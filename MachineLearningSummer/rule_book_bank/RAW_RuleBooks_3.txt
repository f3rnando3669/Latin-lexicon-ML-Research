### Rulebook for Analyzing Effective Speech Based on "Rhetorica ad Herennium"

#### Introduction
1. **Purpose and Audience**:
   - Understand the context and background of the speech.
   - Identify the audience and what the speaker seeks to achieve.

2. **Types of Causes**:

   - Statement of Facts (Narratio)
   - Division (Partitio)
   - Proof (Confirmatio)
   - Refutation (Refutatio)
   - Conclusion (Peroratio)

#### Content Analysis

1. **Introduction (Exordium)**:
   - Assess how the speaker prepares the audience for the speech.
   - Check if the introduction is direct or employs a subtle approach.

2. **Statement of Facts (Narratio)**:
   - Evaluate the clarity, brevity, and plausibility of the narration.
   - Ensure the narrative follows a logical order and effectively sets up the argument.

3. **Division (Partitio)**:
   - Verify if the speaker clearly defines what is agreed upon and what is contested.
   - Look for an enumeration of points to be discussed.

4. **Proof (Confirmatio)**:
   - Check for the use of arguments to support the speaker's case.
   - Examine types of issues addressed:
     - **Conjectural**: Concerns fact.
     - **Legal**: Concerns interpretation of law.
     - **Juridical**: Concerns right or wrong of an act.

5. **Refutation (Refutatio)**:
   - Analyze how the speaker addresses and dismantles opposing arguments.

6. **Conclusion (Peroratio)**:
   - Look for a recap of key points, amplification, and an appeal to emotions or pity.

#### Method of Invention

1. **Invention Skills**:
   - **Theory**: Knowledge of rules.
   - **Imitation**: Learning from effective models.
   - **Practice**: Exercise and experience.

2. **Faculties of the Speaker**:
   - **Invention**: Devise convincing material.
   - **Arrangement**: Organize the material logically.
   - **Style**: Adapt appropriate words and sentences.
   - **Memory**: Retain and recall information.
   - **Delivery**: Regulate voice, expression, and gestures.

#### Argument Structure

   - **Proposition**: What is to be proved.
   - **Reason**: Why it's true.
   - **Proof of the Reason**: Supporting evidence.
   - **Embellishment**: Adorn the argument.
   - **Résumé**: Summarize the argument.

2. **Identification of Defective Arguments**:
   - Test the proposition, reason, and proofs for faults.
   - Consider relevance, logical consistency, and authenticity.

#### Commonplace Techniques

1. **Amplification Techniques**:
   - Use authorities, examples, and comparisons to expand points.
   
2. **Appeal to Emotions**:
   - Invoke emotions such as pity, fear, or indignation to strengthen the argument.

#### Faults to Avoid

1. **Inappropriate Reasoning**:
   - Avoid weak or groundless reasons.
   - Do not use overgeneralizations or irrelevant proofs.

2. **Lack of Consistency**:
   - Ensure arguments are free of contradictions and consistent with earlier claims.

3. **Disjointed Structure**:
   - Maintain the logical flow and coherence of the argument throughout all parts of the discourse.

#### Conclusion Analysis

1. **Summing Up**:
   - Condense all critical points made without repetition.

2. **Effective Appeals**:
   - Aim for emotional and logical appeals to leave a strong impression on the audience.

Using these guidelines, one can rigorously analyze a speech to determine its argumentative effectiveness and overall coherence. This structured approach ensures that each component of the speech works towards persuading the audience while avoiding common pitfalls.
