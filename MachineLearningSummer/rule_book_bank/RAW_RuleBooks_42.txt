Define <FE> to be a defective argument type called False Enumeration listing fewer or more options than actually exist (e.g., ""Vote for Smith or live through four more years of higher taxes."", "America: Love it or leave it")
Define <IR> to be a defective argument type called Inappropriate Reason providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition (e.g., "We cannot listen to John’s opinion on global warming because he is a tree hugger.")

Define <WCB> to be a defective argument type called Weak Causal Basis offering a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition (e.g., "I had a real bad headache, then saw my doctor.
