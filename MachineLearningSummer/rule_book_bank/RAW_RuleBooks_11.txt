For Rhetorica Rulebook
Certainly! Here is a rulebook for types of defective arguments according to *Rhetorica ad Herennium*:

1. **Faulty Proposition**: An assertion based on some one part or a majority but not necessarily applicable to all, thereby generalizing improperly.
   - *Example*: "All the poor would rather do wrong and acquire riches than do right and remain poor." This generalizes a property of some poor individuals to all poor individuals.

2. **Impossible Generalizations**: Declaring a rare occurrence impossible, failing to acknowledge that it can happen, even if only occasionally.
   - *Example*: "No one can fall in love at a single glance." This fails because, though rare, it is possible.

3. **Incomplete Enumeration**: Asserting that you have made a complete list of possibilities but leaving out some pertinent ones.
   - *Example*: "Since the man was killed, he must have been killed by robbers, enemies, or you, since these are the only possibilities." This neglects to consider other potential culprits like slaves or co-heirs.

4. **False Enumeration**: Presenting fewer possibilities than reality.
   - *Example*: "There are two things which ever impel men to crime: luxury and greed." This omits other motives like love, ambition, or fear of death.

5. **Tracing Too Far Back**: Tracing the causes or reasons too far back, adding unnecessary complexity.
   - *Example*: "Stupidity is the mother of all evils because it leads to boundless desires, which breed avarice, driving men to any crime." This overcomplicates the explanation when mentioning avarice immediately would suffice.

6. **Inappropriate Reason**: Offering a weak or groundless reason that does not support the proposition.
   - *Example*: "Wisdom is useful because wise men practice a sense of duty." This ascribes a minor consequence (duty) as the main reason for valuing wisdom.

7. **Circular Reasoning**: Repeating in the Reason what was said in the Proposition using different words.
   - *Example*: "A great evil to mankind is greed because men suffer from boundless passion for money." This merely reiterates the proposition.

8. **Adequacy in Reason**: Giving a reason that is not strong enough to fully support the proposition.
   - *Example*: "It is useful to have true friends because you need someone to jest with." This fails to encompass the comprehensive benefits of true friendships.

9. **Misapplied Reason**: Using a reason that fits another proposition equally well.
   - *Example*: Pacuvius' reasoning for calling both Fortune "blind" and "stupid" with the same rationale.

10. **Rebuttable Dilemma**: A dilemma that can easily be either reversed against the speaker or rebutted in a single term.
    - *Example*: "If you think Cresphontes wicked, why did you marry me to him?" can be rebutted by stating that the knowledge of his character came too late.

11. **Misapplied Sign**: An indication of an event that can multiple interpretations but is presented as definitive proof.
    - *Example*: "Since he is pale, he must have been sick."

12. **Banal Defense**: Using banal excuses that could apply to many other situations and therefore lack specificity.
    - *Example*: "He was led into crime by anger."

13. **Universal Agreement**: Assuming general agreement on a disputed topic.
    - *Example*: Claiming that gods always live in harmony without proving it.

14. **Retrospective Reasoning**: Presenting what could have been done after the event has occurred.
    - *Example*: "If it had entered my mind, I should have taken different actions."

15. **Manifest Transgression**: Presenting a defense for an action that remains unquestionably wrong.
    - *Example*: "I abandoned you when you were popular but am returning now in your difficulty to restore you."

16. **Ambiguous Statements**: Making statements that can be misconstrued or interpreted differently than intended.
    - *Example*: "It is better to submit to kings than to bad laws," potentially misleading in interpretation.

17. **False Definitions**: Using incorrect or overly general definitions.
    - *Example*: "There is no injury except physical battery or insulting language."

18. **Disputed Proof**: Using a disputed assertion as proof without it being settled or universally accepted.
    - *Example*: "He is a thief, so he is deceitful, greedy, and wicked, therefore he is guilty."

19. **Unsettled Controversy**: Allowing the main point of controversy to pass without sufficient proof.
    - *Example*: Assuming guilt based on the inadequately proven interaction of a prophet with arms.

20. **Self-Contradiction**: Contradicting oneself within the same argument.
    - *Example*: "Should I impeach him? If he's noble, there's no need. If he's basically shameless, impeachment is pointless."

21. **Inconsistency with the Audience**: Going against the strongly held beliefs or convictions of your audience.
    - *Example*: Attacking a popular person or an idea dear to the audience.

22. **Unfulfilled Promises**: Not proving everything that was promised in the proposition.
    - *Example*: Declaring several points in the Proposition but failing to address them all in the argument.

23. **Changing the Subject**: Shifting away from the argument by addressing another topic.
    - *Example*: Diverting from the main discussion on bribery to irrelevant military accolades.

24. **Faulty Disparagement**: Disparaging a whole field based on the faults of a few individuals.
    - *Example*: Criticizing all rhetoric because some orators have unethical conduct.

25. **Crime Identification**: Thinking proving a crime occurred is equating to proving who did it.
    - *Example*: Focus on proving poison as the method without connecting it to the accused.

26. **Unbalanced Comparison**: Not giving equal consideration to both sides while making a comparison.
    - *Example*: Fully detailing benefits but downplaying disadvantages in a comparison of policy choices.

27. **Disparaging When Unnecessary**: Believing that for praise of one, it's required to disparage the other.
    - *Example*: Comparing allies' contributions but denigrating another's efforts.

28. **Controversy on Names**: Raising a debate solely on the basis of changing names or titles.
    - *Example*: Proposing different terms for the same group of individuals to justify a change in policy without substantive differences.

29. **Faulty Simile**: Providing an inexact simile that fails to draw a proper comparison.
    - *Example*: Comparing a deliberate action to a natural event without a strong basis for comparison.

30. **False Example**: Using examples that don't align with reality or don't set a proper precedent.
    - *Example*: Citing discredited events as parallels.

31. **Invalid Previous Judgements**: Citing past decisions that are not relevant or are refutable with better examples.
    - *Example*: Using an anomalous legal decision when many contrary precedents exist.

32. **Redundant Proof**: Proving what is already admitted instead of amplifying the implications.
    - *Example*: Arguing extensively the existence of a fact that has been already agreed upon.

33. **Unbacked Amplification**: Amplifying a point that itself hasn't been sufficiently proven.
    - *Example*: Amplifying the crime before confirming the accused’s involvement.

34. **Incomplete Résumé**: Not summarizing all the points exactly or missing elements leading to confusion.
    - *Example*: Summarizing arguments but leaving out critical points or the order presented.

I hope you find this structured template useful as a concise reference for identifying and avoiding defective arguments!
