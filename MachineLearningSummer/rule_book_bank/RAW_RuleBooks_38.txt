Define <Reason> to be information or evidence.
Define <Proposition> to be a statement which can be true or false.
Define <SP> to be a statement which describes a subject using a predicate.

Define <G> to be a defective argument type called Generalization claiming a general truth based on a specific instance (e.g., ""All sports car drivers are too aggressive!" is an example of:")
Define <FE> to be a defective argument type called False Enumeration listing fewer or more options than actually exist (e.g., ""Vote for Smith or live through four more years of higher taxes."")
Define <WCB> to be a defective argument type called Weak Causal Basis offering a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition (e.g., "I had a real bad headache, then saw my doctor. Just by talking with him, my headache started to subside, and I was all better the next day. It was well worth the $200 visit fee.")
Define <FU> to be a defective argument type called False Universals asserting universally agreed points without proof (e.g., "Mormonism is one of the fastest growing sects of Christianity today so that whole story about Joseph Smith getting the golden plates that, unfortunately, disappeared back into heaven, must be true!", "Stating that something should be done (or agreed to) because everyone else thinks this way.", "“[Everyone else is buying it, so you should too!]”", "You appealed to popularity or the fact that many people do something as an attempted form of validation.", "SM 7: No global warming happening", "Everybody know that staying out in the rain can make you sick. Which logical fallacy is represented here?")
Define <DEP> to be a defective argument type called Double-Edged Phrases using statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker (e.g., "I want to have myself a merry little Christmas, but I refuse to do as the song suggests and make the yuletide gay. I don't think sexual preference should have anything to do with enjoying the holiday.")
Define <RR> to be a type of defective argument that is a sentence with two parts: clause 1 is of type <Reason>, and clause 2 is of type <Proposition>, with clause 1 using evidence or information that just restates in different words what is said in clause 2. (e.g., "This legislation is sinful because it is the wrong thing to do.")
Define <IR> to be a type of defective argument that is a sentence with two parts: clause 1 is of type <Reason>, and clause 2 is of type <Proposition>, with clause 1 not supporting or giving credence to clause 2. (e.g., "We cannot listen to John’s opinion on global warming because he is a tree hugger.")

Let <s> be some string. Define <IDA> to be the task of classifying <s> as of type <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU> or <DEP>
Let <t> be some advanced task. Define <D> to be the decomposition of <t> into specific steps.
Define <IDAA> to be the application of <D> to <IDA>. Take it step by step.
