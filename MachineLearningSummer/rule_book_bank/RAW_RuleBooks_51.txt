Three Parts of a Complete Argument:
Define <P> to be a part of a complete argument called a Proposition through which we set forth summarily what we intend to prove.
Define <R> to be a part of a complete argument called Reason which sets forth the causal basis for <P> establishing the truth of what we are urging.
Define <PR> to be a part of a complete argument called a Proof of Reason which corroborates, by means of additional arguments, the briefly presented Reason.

Defective Arguments:
Define <G> to be a defective argument type called Generalization where the <P> is an assertion based on some one part or on a majority of individuals, but not necessarily applicable to all, is referred to all (e.g., "All poor people would rather do wrong to get rich than stay honest and poor.", "All politicians are corrupt because I once read about a scandal involving a senator.", "Every teenager is rebellious, look at my neighbor's kids.")
Define <FE> to be a defective argument type called Incomplete Enumeration where the <P> is defective when we claim to have made a complete enumeration of the possibilities, but actually miss out on some pertinent ones (e.g., "Only luxury and greed drive men to crime,", "The victim was either attacked by robbers, enemies, or you,", ""Trees are either oaks or pines," ignoring the multitude of other tree species.")
Define <IR> to be a defective argument type called Inconclusive Reason where <R> does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the <P> (e.g., "Plautus: "To reprove a friend for a fault that deserves reproof is a thankless task, but in season useful and profitable." That is the Proposition. Let us see what Reason is presented: "For​ today I shall severely reprove my friend for a fault that much deserves reproof." His reckoning of what is useful is based on what he himself is about to do, and not on what it is proper to do. A Reason is groundless when it rests on a false supposition, as follows: "One must not flee from love, for it engenders the truest friendship." Or as follows: "One must spurn philosophy, for it produces inactivity and sloth." If all these Reasons were not false, we should also be obliged to admit the truth of their Propositions.", "One must not avoid love because it leads to true friendship,")
Define <WCB> to be a defective argument type called Insufficient Causal Basis where a <R> is weak if the causal basis which it submits for the <P> is not a compelling one (e.g., "Wisdom is useful because wise men sense duty,", "Don’t wear red because it attracts bad luck.")
Define <RR> to be a defective argument type called Faulty Repetition of Proposition where a <R> is weak when it appears to be presented as the <R>, but says precisely the same as was said in the <P> (e.g., "A great evil to mankind is greed, for the reason that men wrestle with great and many ills on account of the boundless passion for money.", "Greed is evil because it leads to avarice.")
Define <FU> to be a defective argument type called Presumptuous Consensus where a <PR> is assumed as certain, on the ground that "it is universally agreed upon," a thing which is still in dispute (e.g., "making unchecked assumptions.", "Everybody knows that all politicians lie.", )
Define <DEP> to be a defective argument type called Ambiguous Language Use in which a <PR> can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended (e.g., "You have a great personality—to make up for your looks.", "Your proposal is interesting, in a very unorthodox way.")

Let <s> be some string. Define <IDA> to be the task of classifying <s> as of type <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU> or <DEP>. If <s> fits in category <G>, always choose <G>
Let <t> be some advanced task. Define <D> to be the decomposition of <t> into specific steps.
Define <IDAA> to be the application of <D> to <IDA>. Take it step by step.
