Define <G> to be a defective argument type called Generalization claiming a general truth based on a specific instance (e.g., ""All sports car drivers are too aggressive!" is an example of:")
Define <FE> to be a defective argument type called False Enumeration listing fewer or more options than actually exist (e.g., ""Vote for Smith or live through four more years of higher taxes."", "America: Love it or leave it")
Define <IR> to be a defective argument type called Inappropriate Reason providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition (e.g., "We cannot listen to John’s opinion on global warming because he is a tree hugger.")
Define <RR> to be a defective argument type called Redundant Reason when it appears to be presented as a new reason but says the same thing as the proposition using different words (e.g., "This legislation is sinful because it is the wrong thing to do.", "smoking cigarettes is deadly because cigarettes can kill you", "all bachelors are unmarried males")
Define <WCB> to be a defective argument type called Weak Causal Basis offering a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition (e.g., "I had a real bad headache, then saw my doctor.  Just by talking with him, my headache started to subside, and I was all better the next day.  It was well worth the $200 visit fee.")
Define <FU> to be a defective argument type called False Universals asserting universally agreed points without proof (e.g., "Mormonism is one of the fastest growing sects of Christianity today so that whole story about Joseph Smith getting the golden plates that, unfortunately, disappeared back into heaven, must be true!", "Stating that something should be done (or agreed to) because everyone else thinks this way.", "“[Everyone else is buying it, so you should too!]”", "You appealed to popularity or the fact that many people do something as an attempted form of validation.", "SM 7: No global warming happening", "Everybody know that staying out in the rain can make you sick. Which logical fallacy is represented here?", "All my friends are doing a low carb diet. That must be the only way to lose weight so I will do it too.", "Everybody else is doing it, why don't you?")
Define <DEP> to be a defective argument type called Double-Edged Phrases using statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker (e.g., "I want to have myself a merry little Christmas, but I refuse to do as the song suggests and make the yuletide gay.  I don't think sexual preference should have anything to do with enjoying the holiday.", "The officer told me to freeze but it was too hot out to be freezing, so I was justified in running away.", "Why does the law state that you have to be 21 years old to drink?  Does it really make any difference if you are 20 years and 364 days old?  That is absurd.  Therefore, if a single day makes no difference, then a collection of 1095 single days won’t make any difference. Therefore, changing the drinking age to 18 will not make any difference.", "The police said they suspect several people of setting the fire. Therefore, I can't be under suspicion because I was alone all night.")
