### Summary of Defective Arguments in **"Rhetorica ad Herennium"** by Cicero

**Defective Arguments** are those that can be either easily refuted by an opponent or are logically unsound and should not be engaged with. Recognizing and avoiding these types of faulty arguments can significantly strengthen one's rhetoric while also allowing one to undermine the opponent's case effectively.

#### Types of Defective Arguments and Their Characteristics:

- **Generalization**: Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance, e.g., "All poor people would rather do wrong to get rich than stay honest and poor."
 - Example 1: "All politicians are corrupt because I once read about a scandal involving a senator."
 - Example 2: "Every teenager is rebellious, look at my neighbor's kids."

- **Impossibility**: Declaring a rare occurrence as impossible, e.g., "No one can fall in love at the first sight."
 - Example 1: "No one ever wins the lottery; it's rigged."
 - Example 2: "It's impossible for anyone to run a mile in under four minutes."

- **Incomplete Enumeration**: Failing to list all possibilities in a proposition, e.g., "The victim was either attacked by robbers, enemies, or you," without considering other potential suspects.
 - Example 1: "Trees are either oaks or pines," ignoring the multitude of other tree species.
 - Example 2: "Energy sources are just coal or solar," ignoring wind, nuclear, hydro, etc.

- **False Enumeration**: Listing fewer or more options than actually exist, e.g., "Only luxury and greed drive men to crime," while ignoring other motives like ambition or fear.
 - Example 1: "People only commit crimes out of greed, no other reason."
 - Example 2: "You can either be happy in a small town or miserable in a city."

- **Remote Tracing**: Tracing the origin of an argument too far back unnecessarily, e.g., unnecessary elaboration on a well-understood cause.
 - Example 1: "The pollution problem can be traced back entirely to the Industrial Revolution."
 - Example 2: "Our employee turnover goes back to a decision made ten years ago."

- **Inappropriate Reason**: Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition, e.g., "One must not avoid love because it leads to true friendship," without valid supporting evidence.
 - Example 1: "We should not recycle because recycling trucks emit CO2."
 - Example 2: "Don't trust the weather report; it's often rainy when they say it will be sunny."

- **Groundless Reason**: Providing a false reason that doesn’t uphold scrutiny, e.g., "Philosophy should be avoided because it results in sloth," a contested assertion.
 - Example 1: "Studying history is pointless because it fills your head with useless dates."
 - Example 2: "Investing in stocks is useless because the market always crashes."

- **Redundant Reason**: Saying the same thing as the proposition but in other words, e.g., "Greed is evil because it leads to avarice."
 - Example 1: "Freedom is essential because people must be free."
 - Example 2: "Honesty is the best policy because it's good to be truthful."

- **Weak Causal Basis**: Offering a reason that is not compelling enough to support the proposition, e.g., "Wisdom is useful because wise men sense duty," a non-absolute claim.
 - Example 1: "We shouldn't eat carrots because they often have dirt on them."
 - Example 2: "Don’t wear red because it attracts bad luck."

- **Misapplied Reason**: Using the same reason for different propositions without proper justification, e.g., Pacuvius using the same reason for different qualities.
  - Example 1: Using the same argument, "because it leads to happiness," to justify both drinking coffee and exercising.
  - Example 2: "Because it saves money," used to support both cooking at home and using public transit.

- **Dilemma Misuse**: Providing dilemmas that can be easily reversed or rebutted, e.g., "If you think X is evil, why did you...?"
  - Example 1: "If flying is safe, why do people fear flying?"
  - Example 2: "If you believe in science, why not accept all scientific claims without question?"

- **Misapplication of Signs**: Misusing signs that represent a variety of things to indicate one specific thing, e.g., "Being pale always means sickness."
  - Example 1: "If you have a headache, it must be a brain tumor."
  - Example 2: "Yawning means you're always bored."

- **Peripheral Disputes**: Making examples that fit oneself or others as well, e.g., criticizing marriage when you have remarried.
  - Example 1: Criticizing a fitness trainer for being a smoker.
  - Example 2: Calling out a financial advisor for not having a luxury car themselves.

- **Banality**: Offering overused excuses, e.g., "He did it because of anger."
  - Example 1: "He lied because he was under a lot of stress."
  - Example 2: "She didn't complete the project due to time constraints."

- **False Universals**: Asserting universally agreed points without proof, e.g., making unchecked assumptions.
  - Example 1: "Everybody knows that all politicians lie."
  - Example 2: "It's a universal truth that money can't buy happiness."

- **Belated Arguments**: Presenting arguments too late in the timeline of the discourse.
  - Example 1: "We should have saved more money last year to have avoided this debt crisis."
  - Example 2: "If you had started studying earlier, you wouldn't be in a panic now."

- **Misleading Defenses**: Using pretexts to cover evident faults.
  - Example 1: "I wasn't late; the clocks are just fast."
  - Example 2: "I didn't cheat; I just had the notes open by accident."

- **Double-Edged Phrases**: Using statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.
  - Example 1: "You have a great personality—to make up for your looks."
  - Example 2: "Your proposal is interesting, in a very unorthodox way."

- **Misleading Definitions**: Offering false or overly general definitions.
  - Example 1: "Freedom is doing whatever you want whenever you want."
  - Example 2: "Truth is whatever you believe in."

- **Questionable Statements**: Using unproven assertions to support an argument.
  - Example 1: "Everyone who eats chocolate is healthier than those who don’t."
  - Example 2: "Vaccines cause more harm than good."

- **Inconsistent Reasoning**: Contradicting one's own arguments in the discourse.
  - Example 1: Arguing for environmental protection but supporting policies that exploit natural resources.
  - Example 2: Advocating for minimal government while simultaneously demanding government intervention in certain industries.

- **Hostile Addressing**: Speaking against the audience’s beliefs.
  - Example 1: "If you’re smart, you wouldn’t need this explained to you."
  - Example 2: "Only an idiot would disagree with me on this point."

- **Incomplete Proofs**: Failing to substantiate all promised claims.
  - Example 1: Claiming that a certain diet leads to weight loss but not showing evidence for all cases.
  - Example 2: Asserting a product's effectiveness based on a single testimonial without scientific backing.

- **Topic Shifting**: Deviating from the main issue under dispute.
  - Example 1: Diverting a discussion about climate change to talk about political ideologies.
  - Example 2: Switching a debate on healthcare to education systems.

- **Fault by Association**: Disparaging a field due to the faults of its practitioners.
  - Example 1: Dismissing an entire scientific field because of a few fraudulent scientists.
  - Example 2: Generalizing negative traits found in a few individuals of a profession to all members.

- **Evidence Mix-Up**: Proofing misconduct without identifying the perpetrator.
  - Example 1: Using circumstantial evidence to accuse someone without concrete proof.
  - Example 2: Blaming a group for the actions of one individual.

- **Biased Comparisons**: Utilizing unfair or unbalanced comparisons.
  - Example 1: Comparing the life quality of a billionaire’s child to a middle-class child.
  - Example 2: Judging the performance of students from highly different educational backgrounds.

- **Name Disputes**: Creating controversy over naming conventions when usage should decide the matter.
  - Example 1: Arguing over whether a tomato is a fruit or vegetable instead of discussing its nutritional value.
  - Example 2: Debating the correct term for a couch versus a sofa when both are understood colloquially.

- **Inexact Similes**: Using inaccurate comparisons.
  - Example 1: Saying "this book is a rollercoaster" when it's moderately suspenseful at best.
  - Example 2: Comparing a minor issue to a world-ending catastrophe.

- **Unsupported Examples**: Using examples that are false, inappropriate, or overextended.
  - Example 1: Using an isolated incident to generalize about a whole group.
  - Example 2: Claiming universal application from a single case study.

- **Misapplied Judgements**: Referencing irrelevant or inappropriate previous judgments.
  - Example 1: Referencing a legal case that's irrelevant to the current case.
  - Example 2: Using outdated or contextually different rulings to support your stance.

- **Unnecessary Establishments**: Proofing points that adversaries concede.
  - Example 1: Proving the gravity of Earth's existence in a debate about specific falling objects.
  - Example 2: Arguing that fire is hot when everyone agrees already.

- **Amplification Errors**: Amplifying points that should be substantiated, not because of their controversy.
  - Example 1: Focusing excessively on a trivial point to make it appear important.
  - Example 2: Elevating minor faults into major defects.

- **Incomplete Summaries**: Concluding without covering all parts precisely.
  - Example 1: Ending a report without covering the results or conclusions sufficiently.
  - Example 2: Concluding an argument without addressing all key points discussed.
