Define <G> to be a defective argument type claiming a general truth based on a specific instance (e.g., "All poor people would rather do wrong to get rich than stay honest and poor.", "All politicians are corrupt because I once read about a scandal involving a senator.", "Every teenager is rebellious, look at my neighbor's kids.")
Define <FE> to be a defective argument type listing fewer or more options than actually exist (e.g., "Only luxury and greed drive men to crime," while ignoring other motives like ambition or fear, "People only commit crimes out of greed, no other reason.", "You can either be happy in a small town or miserable in a city.")
Define <IR> to be a defective argument type providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition (e.g., "One must not avoid love because it leads to true friendship," without valid supporting evidence, "We should not recycle because recycling trucks emit CO2.", "Don't trust the weather report; it's often rainy when they say it will be sunny.")
Define <RR> to be a defective argument type saying the same thing as the proposition but in other words (e.g., "Greed is evil because it leads to avarice.", "Freedom is essential because people must be free.", "Honesty is the best policy because it's good to be truthful.")
Define <WCB> to be a defective argument type offering a reason that is not compelling enough to support the proposition (e.g., "Wisdom is useful because wise men sense duty," a non-absolute claim, "We shouldn't eat carrots because they often have dirt on them.", "Don’t wear red because it attracts bad luck.", "assumes that short-term deviations will correct themselves", "I've had bad luck for so long that I'm bound to have good luck now.")
Define <FU> to be a defective argument type asserting universally agreed points without proof (e.g., making unchecked assumptions, "Everybody knows that all politicians lie.", "It's a universal truth that money can't buy happiness.", "claiming that an idea or belief is true simply because it is what most people believe", "Lots of people bought this album, so it must be good.")
Define <DEP> to be a defective argument type using statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker (e.g., "You have a great personality—to make up for your looks.", "Your proposal is interesting, in a very unorthodox way.")

Let <s> be some string. Define <IDA> to be the task of identifying the type of defective argument <s> has.
Let <t> be some advanced task. Define <D> to be the decomposition of <t> into specific steps.
Define <IDAA> to be the application of <D> to <IDA>.
