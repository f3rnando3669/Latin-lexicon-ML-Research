In the context of rhetoric and debate, defective arguments are typically those that fail to adhere to logical standards and principles. These can include a variety of logical fallacies, which are errors in reasoning that undermine the validity of an argument. While I'm not sure if "<RH>" refers to a specific source or author, I can certainly provide a general overview and some guidelines that might align with common rhetorical standards.

### Summary of Defective Arguments

Defective arguments are those that do not hold up to scrutiny because they exhibit logical fallacies, misleading reasoning, or insufficient evidence. These fallacies can be categorized broadly into several types, including but not limited to:

1. **Formal Fallacies**: Errors in the structure of the argument.
2. **Informal Fallacies**: Problems in the content or context of the argument.
3. **Emotional Fallacies**: Arguments that appeal primarily to emotions rather than logic.

### Rule-Book for Identifying Defective Arguments

#### 1. Fallacies of Relevance
- **Ad Hominem**: Attacking the person making the argument rather than the argument itself.
- **Red Herring**: Introducing irrelevant information to distract from the actual issue.
- **Straw Man**: Misrepresenting someone's argument to make it easier to attack.

#### 2. Fallacies of Ambiguity
- **Equivocation**: Using ambiguous language to mislead or misrepresent the truth.
- **Amphiboly**: Misleading due to grammatical construction.

#### 3. Fallacies of Presumption
- **Begging the Question**: Assuming the conclusion in the premises.
- **False Dilemma**: Presenting only two options when more exist.
- **Hasty Generalization**: Making a broad statement based on limited evidence.

#### 4. Fallacies of Analogical Reasoning
- **False Analogy**: Making a comparison between two things that aren't truly comparable.
- **Slippery Slope**: Arguing that a small step will inevitably lead to a chain of related (negative) events.

#### 5. Fallacies of Causation
- **Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc**: Assuming that because one thing followed another, it was caused by it.
- **Cum Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc**: Concluding that things which occur together must be causally related.

#### 6. Emotional Fallacies
- **Appeal to Pity**: Evoking pity instead of presenting a logical argument.
- **Appeal to Fear**: Using fear as the primary motivator for accepting a claim.

### General Guidelines

1. **Check the Premises**: Ensure that all premises are true and relevant to the conclusion.
2. **Examine the Structure**: The argument should follow a logical structure, with clear connections between premises and conclusion.
3. **Avoid Ambiguity**: Language should be clear and precise to prevent misunderstandings.
4. **Seek Relevance**: Ensure that all parts of the argument are directly related to the issue at hand.
5. **Evaluate Evidence**: Good arguments should be supported by sufficient and appropriate evidence.

By following these guidelines, you can more effectively identify and counter defective arguments in various rhetorical contexts. This knowledge not only prepares you to debate more effectively but also helps you develop stronger, more persuasive arguments of your own.
