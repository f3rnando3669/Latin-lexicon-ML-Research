Five Parts of a Complete Argument:
Define <P> to be a part of a complete argument called a Proposition through which we set forth summarily what we intend to prove.
Define <R> to be a part of a complete argument called Reason which sets forth the causal basis for <P> establishing the truth of what we are urging.
Define <PR> to be a part of a complete argument called a Proof of Reason which corroborates, by means of additional arguments, the briefly presented Reason.

Defective Arguments:
Define <G> to be a defective argument type called Generalization where the <P> is an assertion based on some one part or on a majority of individuals, but not necessarily applicable to all, is referred to all (e.g., ""All sports car drivers are too aggressive!" is an example of:")
Define <FE> to be a defective argument type called Incomplete Enumeration where the <P> is defective when we claim to have made a complete enumeration of the possibilities, but actually miss out on some pertinent ones (e.g., ""Vote for Smith or live through four more years of higher taxes."")
Define <IR> to be a defective argument type called Inconclusive Reason where <R> does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the <P> (e.g., "We cannot listen to John’s opinion on global warming because he is a tree hugger.")
Define <WCB> to be a defective argument type called Insufficient Causal Basis where a <R> is weak if the causal basis which it submits for the <P> is not a compelling one (e.g., "I had a real bad headache, then saw my doctor.  Just by talking with him, my headache started to subside, and I was all better the next day.  It was well worth the $200 visit fee.")
Define <RR> to be a defective argument type called Faulty Repetition of Proposition where a <R> is weak when it appears to be presented as the <R>, but says precisely the same as was said in the <P> (e.g., "This legislation is sinful because it is the wrong thing to do.")
Define <FU> to be a defective argument type called Presumptuous Consensus where a <PR> is assumed as certain, on the ground that "it is universally agreed upon," a thing which is still in dispute (e.g., "Mormonism is one of the fastest growing sects of Christianity today so that whole story about Joseph Smith getting the golden plates that, unfortunately, disappeared back into heaven, must be true!", "Stating that something should be done (or agreed to) because everyone else thinks this way.", "“[Everyone else is buying it, so you should too!]”", "You appealed to popularity or the fact that many people do something as an attempted form of validation.", "SM 7: No global warming happening", "Everybody know that staying out in the rain can make you sick.
Which logical fallacy is represented here?")
Define <DEP> to be a defective argument type called Ambiguous Language Use in which a <PR> can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended (e.g., "I want to have myself a merry little Christmas, but I refuse to do as the song suggests and make the yuletide gay.  I don't think sexual preference should have anything to do with enjoying the holiday.")

Let <s> be some string. Define <IDA> to be the task of classifying <s> as of type <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU> or <DEP> 
Let <t> be some advanced task. Define <D> to be the decomposition of <t> into specific steps.
Define <IDAA> to be the application of <D> to <IDA>. Take it step by step.
