  - Dependent Clauses:
    - "who have been careful in collecting and collating the floating facts concerning this spectre"
    - "having been buried in the churchyard"
    - "with which he sometimes passes along the Hollow, like a midnight blast"

- **Sentence Type:** Since the sentence comprises two independent clauses and at least three dependent clauses, it is classified as a **complex-compound sentence** (<CXC>).

    - Likely to have varied combinations reflecting an intricate pattern.

- **Meter Classification**: Given the complexity, we might broadly categorize it but note variability and richness in stress patterns.

#### 5. **Rh Analysis**

- **Apply <MAAnalysis>:**
  - This reveals that the sentence likely has varied meter patterns given its complexity and length.

- **Rhythm and Euphony:** Given the intricate mix of clauses and detail:

  - **Complex and varied** (<CV>).
