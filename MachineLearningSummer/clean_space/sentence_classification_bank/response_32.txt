For 
Let's analyze the sentence: "In that case, it must surely wait till they are ready." according to the <Full_Sent> process:

### 1. Clause and Sentence Type Identification (<IDAnalysis>):
**Identify Clauses**: 
- "In that case, it must surely wait till they are ready."
  - "it must surely wait" (independent clause)
  - "till they are ready" (dependent clause)
  
**Classify Sentence**: Since it has one independent clause and one dependent clause, classify it as <CC>.

### 2. Sentence Opener Identification (<OAnalysis>):
**Classify Opener**: 
- "In that case," is a clause opener. Classify it as <C>.

### 3. Rhetorical Type Identification (<RTAnalysis>):
**Classify Rhetorical Type**: 
- The sentence does not present parallel structures, opposing ideas, or balanced phrases. It has the main clause followed by a dependent clause. This structure does not match the defined rhetorical types well, but for clarity, we will leave it as unclassified (<RT> not applicable here).

### 4. Rhetorical Meter and Rhythm Identification (<RhAnalysis>):
**Meter Analysis (<MAAnalysis>)**: 
- Analyzing syllables and stress patterns:
  - "In that case," - (stress pattern: <t>)
  - "it must sure-ly wait" - (stress pattern: mixed, <t> <t>)
  - "till they are rea-dy" - (stress pattern: mixed, <t> <sp>)
  
**Rhythm and Euphony Classification**: 
- Given the varied meter and structure without a consistent rhythmic or balanced pattern, classify it as <CV> (Complex and varied).

### 5. Sentence Function Identification (<SentType>):
**Classify Function**: 
- It conveys information, classify it as <S> (statement).

### Summary for the Example:
- **Clause and Sentence Type**: <CC>
- **Opener Type**: <C>
- **Rhetorical Type**: <Unclassified>
- **Rhythm and Euphony**: <CV>
- **Sentence Function**: <S>

Therefore, the analysis of the sentence "In that case, it must surely wait till they are ready." yields:
- **Clause and Sentence Type**: <CC>
- **Opener Type**: <C>
- **Rhetorical Type**: (Unclassified)
- **Rhythm and Euphony**: <CV>
- **Sentence Function**: <S>

This completes the application of <Full_Sent> to the given string.
