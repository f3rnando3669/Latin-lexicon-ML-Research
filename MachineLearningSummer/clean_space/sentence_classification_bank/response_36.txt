  - "In the restricted space of two-thirds of a page" (incomplete phrase, also a prepositional opener)
  - "Cooper has scored 114 offenses against literary art out of a possible 115." (independent clause)

**Step 1.2: Determine the type of each clause (independent or dependent).**

- Only one clause is independent: "Cooper has scored 114 offenses against literary art out of a possible 115."

**Step 1.3: Identify the sentence type (<S>, <C>, <CC>, <CXC>) based on the composition and relationships between the clauses.**

- Sentence Type: Since there is only one independent clause and no dependent clause modifying it directly, this is a simple sentence (<S>).

**Step 1.4: Document findings.**
