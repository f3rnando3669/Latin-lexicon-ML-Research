### Step 1: <IDAnalysis>
**Identification of Clauses and Sentence Type:**
- **Independent Clause:** "The dominant spirit, however, is the apparition of a figure on horseback without a head."
- **Dependent Clause:** "that haunts this enchanted region and seems to be commander-in-chief of all powers of the air"
- The sentence has one independent clause and at least one dependent clause.

### Step 2: <OAnalysis>
**Identification of the Type of Opening:**
- The opening of the sentence is "The dominant spirit".
- This opening is a direct statement.

    - "that haunts this en-chant-ed re-gion" (This can be partly dissected as: <t> <sp> <i>, and so on)
    - "and seems to be com-mand-er-in-chief" (<t> <sp> <t>)
    - "of all pow-ers of the air," (<t> <sp> <i>)
    - "is the ap-par-i-tion of a fig-ure on horse-back with-out a head." (<t> <sp> <i> <t>)
- Overall, these meters are generally kept regular but with some variations.
