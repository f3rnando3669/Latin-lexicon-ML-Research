For 
Let's perform a <Full_Sent> analysis on the string "But it is undeniable, also, that men may have the sense of exercising this free creative activity in other ways than in producing great works of literature or art; if it were not so, all but a very few men would be shut out from the true happiness of all men."

### Step 1: Clause Identification and Sentence Type Analysis (<IDAnalysis>)

1. **Identify Clauses**:
    - Independent Clauses:
        - "But it is undeniable, also, that men may have the sense of exercising this free creative activity in other ways than in producing great works of literature or art."
        - "If it were not so, all but a very few men would be shut out from the true happiness of all men."
    - Dependent Clauses:
        - "If it were not so"

2. **Classify Sentence**:
    - There are two independent clauses and at least one dependent clause.
    - This is a complex-compound sentence (<CXC>).

### Step 2: Sentence Opener Analysis (<OAnalysis>)

1. **Identify Opener Type**:
    - The sentence begins with "But".
    - This is a transitional word opener (<T>).

### Step 3: Rhetorical Type Analysis (<RTAnalysis>)

1. **Identify Rhetorical Type**:
    - The sentence has a mix of clauses and phrases but does not satisfy the specific definitions of loose (<L>), periodic (<P>), balanced (<B>), or antithetical (<A>) structures directly.
    - However, because it involves intricate arrangements and multiple clauses, it fits the complex and varied (<CV>) rhetorical type.

### Step 4: Rhetorical Meter Analysis (<MAAnalysis>)

1. **Identify Meter**:
    - Breaking down into smaller pieces and identifying the meter:
        - "But it is undeniable" - (Trochaic <t>)
        - "also" (Spondaic <sp>)
        - "that men may have" (Trochaic <t>)
        - "the sense of exercising this" (Anapestic <a>)
        - "free creative activity" (Iambic <i>)
        - etc.
    - The overall sentence combines different metrical patterns, supporting the complex and varied nature.

### Step 5: Rhythm and Euphony Analysis (<RhAnalysis>)

1. **Identify Rhythm and Euphony**:
    - Based on <MAAnalysis>, it uses various rhythmic patterns and incorporates a mix of different clauses.
    - This sentence fits the complex and varied rhythm and euphony (<CV>).

### Step 6: Sentence Function Identification (<SentType>)

1. **Identify Sentence Function**:
    - The sentence presents a statement.
    - Therefore, it is a statement (<S>).

### Full Sentence Analysis (<Full_Sent>)

- **Clause Identification and Sentence Type**: Complex-compound Sentence (<CXC>)
- **Opener Type**: Transitional Opener (<T>)
- **Rhetorical Type**: Complex and Varied (<CV>)
- **Rhetorical Meter**: Mixture of Trochaic (<t>), Spondaic (<sp>), Anapestic (<a>), and Iambic (<i>), leading to a Complex and Varied rhythm (<CV>)
- **Sentence Function**: Statement (<S>)

In summary, the string "But it is undeniable, also, that men may have the sense of exercising this free creative activity in other ways than in producing great works of literature or art; if it were not so, all but a very few men would be shut out from the true happiness of all men" is a complex-compound sentence (<CXC>), with a transitional opener (<T>), complex and varied rhetorical type (<CV>), and it is a statement (<S>). The rhythm and euphony is complex and varied (<CV>).
