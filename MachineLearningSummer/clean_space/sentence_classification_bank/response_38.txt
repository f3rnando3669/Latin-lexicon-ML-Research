For 
To apply the <Full_Sent> task to the string "There are nineteen rules governing literary art in the domain of romantic fiction--some say twenty-two.", we will systematically follow the steps detailed in <IDAnalysis>, <OAnalysis>, <RTAnalysis>, <RhAnalysis>, and <SentType>. 

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

#### 1. **<IDAnalysis> (Identifying Clauses and Sentence Type)**
**Steps:**
1. **Identify Clauses:**
   - Count the number of independent and dependent clauses in the sentence.
   - Classify the sentence as simple, compound, complex, or complex compound based on the clause count.

**Analysis:**
- Independent Clauses: 
  - "There are nineteen rules governing literary art in the domain of romantic fiction"
  - "some say twenty-two"
- Dependent Clauses: None
- Sentence Type: Compound (<C>)

The sentence is compound (<C>) because it has two independent clauses connected by a dash (which can function similarly to a semicolon or conjunction).

#### 2. **<OAnalysis> (Identifying the Type of Opening)**
**Steps:**
1. **Determine Sentence Opener:**
   - Check if the opener is a transitional word/phrase, direct statement, clause, or question.

**Analysis:**
- Opener: "There are nineteen rules"
- Type: Direct statement (<D>)

The sentence begins with a straightforward assertion, so it is a direct statement opener (<D>).

#### 3. **<RTAnalysis> (Identifying Rhetorical Type)**
**Steps:**
1. **Identify Rhetorical Type:**
   - Determine if the sentence follows the structure of a loose, periodic, balanced, or antithetical type.

**Analysis:**
- Observation: The two clauses balance each other by virtue of their similar structure and length.
- Rhetorical Type: Balanced (<B>)

The sentence uses balanced structure (<B>), as the two independent clauses contribute equally to the overall meaning.

#### 4. **<MAAnalysis> (Identifying Type of Rhetorical Meter)**
**Steps:**
1. **Identify Metrical Pattern:**
   - Analyze the sentence for stressed and unstressed syllables to identify the type of meter.

**Analysis:**
1. "There are nine-teen rules gov-ern-ing lit-er-ar-y art in the domain of ro-man-tic fic-tion" 
- (Various meters including iambic <t> and trochaic <i>)
2. "some say twen-ty-two"
- (Simple meter, possibly trochaic <i>)

Since the sentence is primarily prose, it doesn't follow a strict metrical pattern but includes a mix of stressed and unstressed syllables, mainly <i> and <t>.

#### 5. **<RhAnalysis> (Identifying Rhythm and Euphony)**
**Steps:**
1. **Combine Metrical Patterns Identified:**
   - Use the identified metrical patterns to categorize the sentence as smooth and flowing, rhythmic and balanced, complex and varied, or jerky and abrupt.

**Analysis:**
- Given the combination of balanced structure and various meter, the sentence is rhythmic yet balanced.
- Rhythmic and Euphony: Rhythmic and balanced (<RB>)

The sentence has a rhythmic and balanced quality due to its parallel structure and consistent flow.

#### 6. **<SentType> (Identifying Function of Sentence)**
**Steps:**
1. **Identify Function:**
   - Determine if the sentence is a statement, question, command, or exclamation.

**Analysis:**
- Function: Statement (<S>)

The sentence asserts an informational statement about literary art rules, thus it's a statement (<S>).

### Combining All Analyses
