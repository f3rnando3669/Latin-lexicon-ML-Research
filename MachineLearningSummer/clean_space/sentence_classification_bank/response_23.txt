### Full_Sent Analysis of "The critical power is of lower rank than the creative."

Let's break down the analysis following the steps we have defined for each of the components:

#### 1. IDAnalysis
**Clause Identification**:
   - Identify all independent clauses in the sentence: "The critical power is of lower rank than the creative."
     - Independent Clause: "The critical power is of lower rank than the creative."
   - Identify all dependent clauses in the sentence: None.

**Sentence Type Classification**:
   - Since there is only one independent clause and no dependent clauses, classify it as a simple sentence (<S>).

#### 2. OAnalysis
**Check Opening Word/Phrase**:
   - If the sentence begins with a transitional word or phrase (<T>).
   - If the sentence begins with a direct statement (<D>).
   - If the sentence begins with a clause opener (<C>).
   - If the sentence begins with a question (<Q>).
   - The sentence begins directly with "The critical power," which is a direct statement opener (<D>).

#### 3. RTAnalysis
**Determine Sentence Structure**:
   - Check if the main clause is followed by parallel dependent clauses or phrases (<L>).
   - Check if parallel dependent clauses or phrases precede the main clause (<P>).
   - Check if phrases or clauses balance each other in structure, meaning, or length (<B>).
   - Check if opposing ideas or meanings are juxtaposed (<A>).
   - The two main ideas are compared, presenting a contrast in rank (<A>).

#### 4. RhAnalysis
**Apply MAAnalysis**:
   - Determine Syllable Patterns:
     - "The critical" (trochee <t> + <sp>),
     - "power is of lower" (iamb <i> + trochee <t>),
     - "rank than the creative" (spondee <sp> + iamb <i> + trochee <t>).

**Classify Rhythm and Euphony**:
   - The overall rhythm tends to be flowing smoothly and predictably (<SM>).

#### 5. SentType
**Determine Function of the Sentence**:
   - Classify the function of the sentence as a statement (<S>).

### Summary of Full_Sent Analysis
1. **IDAnalysis**: Simple sentence (<S>).
2. **OAnalysis**: Direct statement opener (<D>).
3. **RTAnalysis**: Antithetical structure (<A>).
4. **RhAnalysis**: Smooth and flowing rhythm (<SM>).
5. **SentType**: Statement (<S>).

So, the comprehensive analysis of the string "The critical power is of lower rank than the creative." is:
- ID: <S>
- O: <D>
- RT: <A>
- Rh: <SM>
