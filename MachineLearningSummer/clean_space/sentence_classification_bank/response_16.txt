For 
Let's apply the <Full_Sent> analysis step-by-step to the string "The eye was placed where one ray should fall, that it might testify of that particular ray."

---

### Step 1: IDAnalysis (Identifying Clauses and Sentence Type)

**Step 1:** Identify if the sentence is a simple, compound, complex, or complex-compound sentence.
- The sentence has one independent clause: "The eye was placed."
- The sentence has two dependent clauses: "where one ray should fall" and "that it might testify of that particular ray."

**Step 2:** Count the number of independent and dependent clauses.
- Independent Clauses: 1
- Dependent Clauses: 2

**Step 3:** Determine the specific type of sentence based on the identified clauses.
- This is a complex sentence (<CC>).

### Step 2: OAnalysis (Identifying the Type of Opening)

**Step 1:** Examine the beginning of the sentence.
- The sentence starts with "The eye."

**Step 2:** Determine if the sentence opening is a transitional word or phrase (<T>), a direct statement (<D>), a clause opener (<C>), or a question opener (<Q>).
- The opening is a direct statement (<D>).

### Step 3: RTAnalysis (Identifying the Rhetorical Type)

**Step 1:** Analyze the sentence structure for rhetorical patterns.
- The sentence follows a structure where the main clause is followed by parallel dependent clauses.

**Step 2:** Determine if the sentence follows a loose rhetorical structure (<L>), a periodic rhetorical structure (<P>), a balanced rhetorical structure (<B>), or an antithetical rhetorical structure (<A>).
- The sentence follows a loose rhetorical structure (<L>).

### Step 4: MAAnalysis (Identifying the Rhetorical Meter)

**Step 1:** Break the sentence into syllables.
- The eye was placed where one ray should fall, that it might testify of that particular ray.
  - The eye / was placed / where one / ray should / fall, that / it might / testify / of that / particular / ray.

**Step 2:** Determine the pattern of stresses and unstressed syllables.
- Breaking down phonetically:
  - The eye (unstressed-stressed, <t>)
  - was placed (unstressed-stressed, <t>)
  - where one (stressed-unstressed, <i>)
  - ray should (stressed-unstressed, <i>)
  - fall, that (stressed-unstressed, <i>)
  - it might (unstressed-stressed, <t>)
  - testify (stressed-unstressed-unstressed, <d>)
  - of that (unstressed-stressed, <t>)
  - particular (unstressed-unstressed-stressed, <d>)
  - ray (stressed, <i>)

**Step 3:** Classify the meter.
- The meter components are mainly <t>, <i>, and <d>. The sentence has varied metrical patterns.

### Step 5: RhAnalysis (Identifying Rhythm and Euphony)

**Step 1:** Utilize the results from MAAnalysis.
- The sentence has varied rhythms, composed of <t>, <i>, and <d> patterns.

**Step 2:** Determine the rhythmic and euphonious quality of the sentence.
- The varied use of stress patterns suggests a complex and layered sentence structure.

**Step 3:** Classify the sentence.
- The sentence is complex and varied (<CV>).

### Step 6: SentType (Identifying the Function of the Sentence)

**Step 1:** Analyze the sentence for its function.
- The sentence provides information about the eye and its purpose.

**Step 2:** Classify the sentence.
- The sentence is a statement (<S>).

### Summary of Full_Sent Analysis:

1. **IDAnalysis:** Complex Sentence (<CC>)
    - Independent Clauses: 1
    - Dependent Clauses: 2

2. **OAnalysis:** Direct Statement (<D>)

3. **RTAnalysis:** Loose Rhetorical Structure (<L>)

4. **MAAnalysis:** Varied Metrical Patterns (<t>, <i>, <d>)

5. **RhAnalysis:** Complex and Varied (<CV>)

6. **SentType:** Statement (<S>)

Therefore, the complete classification of the sentence "The eye was placed where one ray should fall, that it might testify of that particular ray." according to <Full_Sent> is:
- **Clause Structure:** <CC>
- **Opening Type:** <D>
- **Rhetorical Type:** <L>
- **Metrical Analysis:** <t>, <i>, <d>
- **Rhythm and Euphony:** <CV>
- **Sentence Function:** <S>
