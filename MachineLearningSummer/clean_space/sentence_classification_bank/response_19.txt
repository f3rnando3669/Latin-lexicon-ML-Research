For 
To apply the comprehensive sentence analysis (<Full_Sent>) to the given sentence, "A man is relieved and gay when he has put his heart into his work and done his best; but what he has said or done otherwise shall give him no peace.", we will follow each specified analytical step:

### Step 1: Clause and Sentence Type Identification (<IDAnalysis>)

1. **Identify Clauses:**
   - Independent Clauses: 
     - "A man is relieved and gay when he has put his heart into his work and done his best;"
     - "but what he has said or done otherwise shall give him no peace."
   - Dependent Clauses:
     - "when he has put his heart into his work and done his best"
     - "what he has said or done otherwise"

2. **Classify Sentence Type:**
   - The sentence has two independent clauses, each containing their own dependent clauses.
   - This makes it a **Complex-Compound (CXC)** sentence.

### Step 2: Sentence Opener Identification (<OAnalysis>)

1. **Identify Opener:**
   - The sentence starts directly with the subject and the predicate: "A man is relieved and gay..."
   - This is a **Direct Statement Opener (D)**.

### Step 3: Rhetorical Type Identification (<RTAnalysis>)

1. **Identify Rhetorical Structure:**
   - The first part of the sentence presents a positive outcome balanced by a contrasting negative outcome in the second part.
   - This juxtaposition of opposing ideas (relief and peace) makes it **Antithetical (A)**.

### Step 4: Rhetorical Meter Analysis (<MAAnalysis>)

1. **Identify Rhetorical Meter:**
   - Breaking the sentence into syllables:

     "A man (ia) | is re-lieved (i) | and gay (ia) | when he (da) | has put (da) | his heart (da) | in-to (ia) | his work (ia) and done (da)| his best (ia); |
     but what (da) | he has said (i) | or done (ia) | oth-er-wise (ia) | shall give (da) | him no peace (ia)."

   - The primary meters occurring are primarily iambic (i) and dactylic (da).

2. **Summarize Meters:**
   - The sentence primarily utilizes **Iambic (i)** patterns, with some **Dactylic (da)** patterns.

### Step 5: Rhythmic and Euphony Identification (<RhAnalysis>)

1. **Identify Rhythmic and Euphony Type:**
   - The mix of iambic and dactylic meters, along with its antithetical structure, creates a rhythmic but varied flow.
   - This suggests it is **Rhythmic and Balanced (RB)**.

### Step 6: Sentence Function Identification (<SentType>)

1. **Classify Sentence Function:**
   - The sentence is making a statement about the man's state of mind.
   - Therefore, it is a **Statement (S)**.

### Full_Sent Analysis Summary

**Full Analysis of the Sentence:**

1. **Clause and Sentence Type:** <CXC>
2. **Opener:** <D>
3. **Rhetorical Type:** <A>
4. **Rhetorical Meter:** <i, da>
5. **Rhythmic and Euphony:** <RB>
6. **Sentence Function:** <S>

By systematically applying each analytical step, we've produced a detailed full sentence analysis for the given string.
