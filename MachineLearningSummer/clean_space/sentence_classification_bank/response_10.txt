For 
Certainly! Let's apply the Full Sent analysis to the given string.

**String (`<s>`):** "His haunts are not confined to the valley, but extend at times to the adjacent roads, and especially to the vicinity of a church at no great distance."

### 1. **Clause and Sentence Type Analysis (`<IDAnalysis>`):**

**Step 1:** Identify the number of independent and dependent clauses:

- Independent Clause 1: "His haunts are not confined to the valley"
- Independent Clause 2: "but extend at times to the adjacent roads"
- Dependent Phrase (modifying): "and especially to the vicinity of a church at no great distance"

**Step 2:** Classify the sentence:

- This sentence consists of two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction ("but").
- Dependent phrases serve to elaborate, but do not form full clauses.

**Sentence Type:** `<C>` (Compound Sentence)

### 2. **Sentence Opening Analysis (`<OAnalysis>`):**

**Step 1:** Examine the opening portion of the sentence:

- Opener: "His haunts are not confined to the valley"

**Step 2:** Determine the type of opener:

- Opener Type: Direct statement

**Opener Type:** `<D>`

### 3. **Rhetorical Type Analysis (`<RTAnalysis>`):**

**Step 1:** Identify the structure:

- The main clause is followed by balancing clauses formed with a coordinating conjunction.

**Step 2:** Classify the rhetorical structure:

- The phrases and clauses balance each other by virtue of their likeness of structure.

**Rhetorical Type:** `<B>` (Balanced)

### 4. **Rhythm and Euphony Analysis (`<RhAnalysis>`):**

#### **Performing `<MAAnalysis>`:**

**Step 1:** Determine the syllabic pattern:

- Syllabic pattern analysis:
  - "His haunts are not confined to" (iambic feel, <t>)
  - "the valley, but extend at" (iambic feel, <t>)
  - "times to the adjacent roads, and" (mixed stress patterns)
  - "especially to the vicinity" (anapestic feel, <a>)
  - "of a church at no great" (mixed stress patterns)
  - "distance" (iambic feel, <t>)

**Step 2:** Identify the meter type(s):

- Mixed meter types present: predominantly iambic (<t>), with some anapestic (<a>) influences.

**Classification of Rhythm and Euphony:**

- The mixture of varied meter types (iambic and anapestic) and the balanced phrasing leads to a rich and layered effect.

**Rhythm and Euphony Type:** `<CV>` (Complex and varied)

### 5. **Sentence Function Analysis (`<SentType>`):**

**Step 1:** Analyze the purpose of the sentence:

- Purpose: To inform or describe (statement).

**Sentence Function:** `<S>` (Statement)

### **Final Annotation for Example String:**

```text
<s> := "His haunts are not confined to the valley, but extend at times to the adjacent roads, and especially to the vicinity of a church at no great distance."
<Full_Sent>: 
    <ID> := <C> 
    <O> := <D>
    <RT> := <B>
    <Rh> := <CV>
    <SentType> := <S>
```

This comprehensive Full Sent analysis provides a detailed understanding of the structure, type, rhetoric, meter, rhythm, and function of the sentence.
