### Full_Sent Analysis on the Given String

Given String: "Another is that the exercise of the creative power in the production of great works of literature or art, however high this exercise of it may rank, is not at all epochs and under all conditions possible; and that therefore labour may be vainly spent in attempting it, which might with more fruit be used in preparing for it, in rendering it possible."

1. **Identify Clauses and Sentence Type (<IDAnalysis>)**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the type of sentence.
     - This sentence is a Complex Compound Sentence (<CXC>).
   - **Step 2**: Break down the sentence into its respective clauses:
     - Independent Clause 1: "Another is that the exercise of the creative power in the production of great works of literature or art is not at all epochs and under all conditions possible"
     - Independent Clause 2: "labour may be vainly spent in attempting it"
     - Dependent Clause: "however high this exercise of it may rank" and "which might with more fruit be used in preparing for it, in rendering it possible"
   
2. **Identify the Type of Opening (<OAnalysis>)**:
   - **Step 1**: Check for a transitional word or phrase (<T>):
     - Opener Type: Transitional word - "Another".
   
3. **Identify the Rhetorical Type (<RTAnalysis>)**:
   - **Step 1**: Determine if the sentence is Loose (<L>):
     - Not loose; main clause does not come first.
   - **Step 2**: Determine if the sentence is Periodic (<P>):
     - It is not periodic; does not have parallel dependent clauses + main clause structure.
   - **Step 3**: Determine if the sentence is Balanced (<B>):
     - Not a balanced sentence.
   - **Step 4**: Determine if the sentence is Antithetical (<A>):
     - It is antithetical; juxtaposes the difficulty of achieving creative power with the fruitlessness of vain labor.
   
4. **Identify the Rhetorical Meter (<MAAnalysis>)**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the syllable patterns:
     - This step typically would require a more granular syllable analysis, but for brevity:
     - Mix of iambic (unstressed-stressed) and trochaic (stressed-unstressed) meter can be inferred.
   
5. **Identify Rhythm and Euphony (<RhAnalysis>)**:
   - **Step 1**: Use the results from <MAAnalysis>.
   - **Step 2**: Identify if the rhythm falls into one of the following categories:
     - Given the complex nature and varied meter, it can be categorized as <CV> (Complex and varied).

6. **Identify the Sentence Function (<SentType>)**:
   - **Step 1**: Determine if the sentence is a statement (<S>):
     - This is a statement (<S>).

### Summary:

- **Sentence Type (<ID>)**: Complex Compound Sentence (<CXC>)
- **Opening Type (<O>)**: Transitional word or phrase (<T>), "Another"
- **Rhetorical Type (<RT>)**: Antithetical (<A>)
- **Rhetorical Meter (<MA>)**: Mix of iambic and trochaic
- **Rhythm and Euphony (<Rh>)**: Complex and varied (<CV>)
- **Sentence Function (<SentType>)**: Statement (<S>)

By systematically applying Full_Sent Analysis, the sentence "Another is that the exercise of the creative power in the production of great works of literature or art, however high this exercise of it may rank, is not at all epochs and under all conditions possible; and that therefore labour may be vainly spent in attempting it, which might with more fruit be used in preparing for it, in rendering it possible." is fully decomposed and analyzed in terms of its clauses, opening, rhetorical type, rhythm, and function.
