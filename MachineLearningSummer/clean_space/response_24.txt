For 
Let's apply the steps from <Full_Sent> to the given string: "True; but in assenting to this proposition, one or two things are to be kept in mind."

### Step 1: Conduct <IDAnalysis>
1. **Identify independent clauses:**
   - Independent Clause 1: "one or two things are to be kept in mind."
   
2. **Identify dependent clauses:**
   - Dependent Clause: "in assenting to this proposition"

3. **Classify the sentence:**
   - The sentence has one independent clause and one dependent clause.
   - Therefore, it is a **Complex Sentence (<CC>)**.

### Step 2: Conduct <OAnalysis>
1. **Evaluate the opening word or phrase:**
   - Opener: "True; but"

2. **Match it to categories:**
   - The opener "True; but" is a transitional phrase.
   - Therefore, the opener is **Transitional Opener (<T>)**.

### Step 3: Conduct <RTAnalysis>
1. **Examine sentence structure for key patterns:**
   - The sentence structure is: Transitional Opener + Parallel Dependent Clause + Main Clause.

2. **Identify if structure fits any rhetorical type:**
   - The sentence does not strictly follow the patterns of the given types <L>, <P>, <B>, or <A>.
   - However, its structure is similar to a **Loose Sentence (<L>)**: Main Clause + Parallel Dependent Clause.

### Step 4: Conduct <RhAnalysis>
1. **Perform <MAAnalysis>:**
   - Analyzing the syllable patterns:
     - "True" (<t>)
     - "but in assenting to this proposition" (<sp> pattern overall due to its varied stress patterns)
     - "one or two things are to be kept in mind" (this clause does not follow a strict meter but can be considered primarily <i> and <t> mixed)

2. **Determine if the sentence fits <SM>, <RB>, <CV>, or <JA>:**
   - The overall structure has a relatively predictable cadence with some variation, suggesting a more **Complex and Varied (<CV>)** type of rhythm and euphony.

### Step 5: Determine <SentType>
1. **Analyze sentence context and punctuation:**
   - The sentence makes a declarative statement.
   
2. **Determine the function of the sentence:**
   - The function is to state something.
   - Therefore, the sentence is a **Statement (<S>)**.

### Summary of <Full_Sent> Analysis:
- **Sentence Type (<ID>)**: Complex Sentence (<CC>)
- **Opener Type (<O>)**: Transitional Opener (<T>)
- **Rhetorical Type (<RT>)**: Loose Sentence (<L>)
- **Rhythm and Euphony (<Rh>)**: Complex and Varied (<CV>)
- **Sentence Function (<SentType>)**: Statement (<S>)

The string "True; but in assenting to this proposition, one or two things are to be kept in mind." can be categorized as a **Complex Sentence (<CC>)** with a **Transitional Opener (<T>)**, following a **Loose Sentence (<L>)** structure, having a **Complex and Varied (<CV>)** rhythm, and serving the function of a **Statement (<S>).**
