Sure, let's analyze the string 'Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.' using the steps outlined in <Full_Sent>.

### Step 1: Clause and Sentence Type Identification (<IDAnalysis>)

#### Step 1.1: Identify the different clauses
1. **Independent clauses:**
   - "there was found in it a poor wise man" (Ind. Clause 1)
   - "he by his wisdom delivered the city" (Ind. Clause 2)
   - "no man remembered that same poor man" (Ind. Clause 3)

2. **Dependent clauses:**
   - None explicitly present.

#### Step 1.2: Determine the sentence type
- The sentence contains three independent clauses joined by conjunctions and a semicolon. Therefore, it is a **Compound sentence (<C>)**.

### Step 2: Opening Type Identification (<OAnalysis>)

#### Step 2.1: Identify if the opener is a transitional word or phrase (<T>)
- "Now" is a transitional word.

### Step 3: Rhetorical Type Identification (<RTAnalysis>)

#### Step 3.3: Identify if the sentence follows a Balanced rhetorical type (<B>)
- The clauses present balance each other by virtue of their structure and meaning. Especially notable is the parallelism in "he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man."

### Step 4: Rhythmic and Euphony Analysis (<RhAnalysis>)

#### Step 4.1: Perform a rhetorical meter analysis (<MAAnalysis>)

##### Step 4.1.1: Identify the type of rhetorical meter in <s>
- The sentence has varied metrical patterns, likely leaning towards prose with no strict metrical form like iambic or trochaic patterns. So a mix is observed, but no single meter dominates consistently.

#### Step 4.2: Determine the rhythm and euphony

##### Step 4.2.1: Identify if the sentence has a Smooth and Flowing rhythm (<SM>)
- The rhythm seems more complex due to the variations between the dependent and independent clauses.

##### Step 4.2.2: Identify if the sentence is Rhythmic and Balanced (<RB>)
- The sentence is **Rhythmic and Balanced (RB)** due to the balanced structure of the clauses and their parallel ideas.

##### Step 4.2.3: Identify if the sentence is Complex and Varied (<CV>)
- The sentence also appears **Complex and Varied (CV)** given the intricate arrangement of clauses and phrases.

##### Step 4.2.4: Identify if the sentence is Jerky or Abrupt (<JA>)
- The rhythm is not particularly jerky or abrupt, as it maintains a coherent flow despite the complexity.

### Summary of the Analysis:

- **Clause and Sentence Type (<ID>):** Compound Sentence (<C>)
- **Opening Type (<O>):** Transitional Word (<T>)
- **Rhetorical Type (<RT>):** Balanced (<B>)
- **Rhythm and Euphony (<RhAnalysis>):** Complex and Varied (<CV>), Rhythmic and Balanced (<RB>)

Therefore, the complete analysis of the string is as follows:

- The sentence is a **Compound sentence (C)**.
- It starts with a **Transitional word (T)**.
- It utilizes a **Balanced rhetorical type (B)**.
- The rhythm and euphony are **Complex and Varied (CV)** and **Rhythmic and Balanced (RB)**.
