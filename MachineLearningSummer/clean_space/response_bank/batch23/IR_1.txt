To apply the process of decomposing the task of classifying defective argument types to the string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you," let's follow the outlined steps:

### Step-by-Step Breakdown Using <IDAA>

#### Step 1: **Understand the Defective Argument Types**

- **<G>**: Generalization
- **<FE>**: False Enumeration
- **<IR>**: Inappropriate Reason
- **<RR>**: Redundant Reason
- **<WCB>**: Weak Causal Basis
- **<FU>**: False Universals
- **<DEP>**: Double-Edged Phrases

#### Step 2: **Read and Parse the Input String**

- **String**: "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you."

#### Step 3: **Identify Key Indicators for Each Argument Type**

- Notice the reliance on someone else's statement as the basis for the decision not to communicate.

#### Step 4: **Compare Against Definitions**

- **<G>**: This is not making a sweeping generalization based on a specific instance.
- **<FE>**: This string doesn't limit the options available; it's a single decision.
- **<IR>**: The reason given ("My best friend says you’re a liar") is not logically supporting the conclusion ("I’m not going to talk to you"). It's a form of ad hominem reasoning, where the character of the person is attacked rather than addressing any specific arguments or actions.
- **<RR>**: The reason is not a redundant restatement of the proposition.
- **<WCB>**: The causal link (best friend's opinion leading to refusal of communication) is weak.
- **<FU>**: This does not involve asserting universally agreed points without proof.
- **<DEP**: Not a statement with dual interpretations.

#### Step 5: **Make a Preliminary Classification**

- The classification that fits best here is **<IR>** (Inappropriate Reason) because the reasoning provided (best friend's opinion) doesn't logically support the proposition (refusal to communicate).

#### Step 6: **Double-Check for Ambiguities**

- Ensure that this reasoning is indeed what the classification intends. This is a personal attack or reliance on a third party's opinion rather than a direct logical connection or reason.

#### Step 7: **Final Classification**

- Confirmed classification: **<IR>**

#### Step 8: **Document the Process**

- The string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you" was classified as **<IR>** because it relies on an irrelevant reason (someone else's opinion) to support a decision (refusal to communicate), which doesn't logically follow.

### Conclusion
The argument in the string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you" is classified as **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)** after systematically applying the decomposition and analysis process.
