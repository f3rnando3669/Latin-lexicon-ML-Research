For 
Given \( <s> \): "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people."
This logical fallacy is called...

### Step-by-Step Decomposition \( <D> \) of \( <IDA> \):

1. **Identify the structure of the argument:**
   - Read the string \( <s> \) carefully.
   - Break down \( <s> \) into its main components: premise(s) and conclusion (if applicable).

2. **Analyze the content of the argument:**
   - Determine the main claim or conclusion being made.
   - Identify the supporting reasons or premises provided.

3. **Map the argument to known types:**
   - Compare the identified structure and content with definitions of each defective argument type.
     - **Generalization (\( <G> \))**: Check if it claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
     - **False Enumeration (\( <FE> \))**: Check if it lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
     - **Inappropriate Reason (\( <IR> \))**: Check if the reasons provided don’t logically support the proposition.
     - **Redundant Reason (\( <RR> \))**: Check if it presents a new reason that says the same thing as the proposition using different words.
     - **Weak Causal Basis (\( <WCB> \))**: Check if it offers a causal basis that is not compelling enough.
     - **False Universals (\( <FU> \))**: Check if it asserts universally agreed points without proof.
     - **Double-Edged Phrases (\( <DEP> \))**: Check if it uses statements open to dual interpretations.

4. **Classify the argument:**
   - Assign the most fitting defective argument type to \( <s> \) based on the comparison.
   - If \( <s> \) doesn't clearly fit into one type, note the ambiguities or overlaps and use the most dominant characteristic for classification.

### Application \( <IDAA> \):

Given \( <s> \): "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people."

1. **Identify the structure:**
   - Main claim: "We need to fix our broken judicial system."
   - Proposed solution: "by electing new people."

2. **Analyze the content:**
   - Claim: The judicial system is broken.
   - Proposed action to solve the issue: Electing new people.

3. **Map to known types:**
   - **Check for Generalization (\( <G> \))**:
     - Is there a broad claim from specific examples? No, not primarily.
   - **Check for False Enumeration (\( <FE> \))**:
     - Are there limited or exaggerated choices? Yes, "electing new people" as the only solution implies a limited set of options without considering other reforms.
   - **Check for Inappropriate Reason (\( <IR> \))**:
     - Are the reasons relevant/logically connected? The solution seems too simplistic and may not directly address the complexities of fixing the judicial system.
   - **Check for Redundant Reason (\( <RR> \))**:
     - Is the reason merely rephrasing the claim? No.
   - **Check for Weak Causal Basis (\( <WCB> \))**:
     - Is the causal connection weak or unconvincing? Perhaps, but more directly, it’s about restricting the options.
   - **Check for False Universals (\( <FU> \))**:
     - Are there unproven universal claims? No.
   - **Check for Double-Edged Phrases (\( <DEP> \))**:
     - Are statements ambivalent or open to multiple interpretations? No.

4. **Classify the argument:**
   - The argument fits the definition of **False Enumeration (\( <FE> \))** by implying only one solution (electing new people) to fix the judicial system.

Thus, \( <s> \) is classified as \( <FE> \).
