To apply the step-by-step process of <IDAA> to the string "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way," we need to classify the argument type based on the specified defective argument classifications.

Here is the detailed decomposition:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) Applied to IDA (IDAA)

#### Step 1: Understand the Argument Types
We thoroughly understand the definitions and examples provided for:
- Generalization (<G>)
- False Enumeration (<FE>)
- Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)
- Redundant Reason (<RR>)
- Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- False Universals (<FU>)
- Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)

#### Step 2: Initial Read
Read the string: "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way."

#### Step 3: Identify Key Elements
- The phrase suggests a motivation or reasoning for joining a group or taking action is based on the fact that others are doing the same.

#### Step 4: Pattern Matching
- This key element matches with the concept of asserting universally agreed points or social proof without substantial evidence, which is a recognized pattern for the <FU> (False Universals) argument type.

#### Step 5: Classify the Argument
- The argument type is False Universals, so we classify it as <FU>.

#### Step 6: Verification
- Verify that the string "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way." fits the definition of <FU>: Asserting universally agreed points (or actions) without proof, appealing to popularity or social proof.

#### Final Classification
Classify the string "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way." as an example of <FU> (False Universals).

This systematic approach ensures that the argument type is accurately identified and classified.
