For 
Let's apply the steps of the decomposition \((<D>)\) to the classification task \((<IDA>)\) for the given statement:

### Decomposition \((<D>)\):

1. **Step 1: Understand the Argument Types**
   - Familiarize with definitions of \(<G>\), \(<FE>\), \(<IR>\), \(<RR>\), \(<WCB>\), \(<FU>\), and \(<DEP>\).

2. **Step 2: Identify Keywords or Phrases**
   - Significant keywords/phrases: "argument for the existence of God," "scientific answer," "origin of life," "goalposts farther back."

3. **Step 3: Analyze the Logical Structure**
   - The statement discusses how arguments for the existence of God evolve as new scientific answers emerge, suggesting that religious arguments shift to unanswered science questions, thus "moving the goalposts."

4. **Step 4: Match with Argument Types**
   - **Generalization (\(<G>\))**: Not present because it's not a claim based on a specific instance.
   - **False Enumeration (\(<FE>\))**: Not an issue listing fewer or more options.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (\(<IR>\))**: No illogical reason provided against a proposition.
   - **Redundant Reason (\(<RR>\))**: Not repeating any proposition.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (\(<WCB>\))**: Not providing a weak causal basis for an argument.
   - **False Universals (\(<FU>\))**: The statement implicitly claims universality ("arguments ... are replaced"), but it's more descriptive than assertive.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (\(<DEP>\))**: No dual interpretation used.

   This closely aligns with the idea of "moving the goalposts," a fallacy where standards are adjusted to make arguments unprovable.

5. **Step 5: Validate the Classification**
   - Reiterate that none of the predefined types perfectly encapsulate the idea of "moving the goalposts." The predefined types do not directly map onto this fallacy, indicating it might require differentiation.

6. **Step 6: Final Decision**
   - The given statement corresponds to a well-described logical fallacy called "Moving the Goalposts," but since this doesn't directly fit within any \(<IDA>\) classification types, we note the closest matching predefined types, which approach but don't fully cover the fallacy described:

   **Closest Match Consideration**:
   - **False Universals (\(<FU>\))**: The implication of arguments evolving based on remaining unanswered science questions fits \(<FU>\) due to implied universality without rigorous proof.

**Final Classification**: The closest classification could be \(<FU>\), as it generalizes the behavior of religious arguments evolving universally to stay relevant with the lack of scientific explanations, implicitly claiming this is always true without direct proof.

### Documentation:
"The statement implies universality in behavior ('moving the goalposts') and fits best under \(\text{false universals}\) (\(<FU>\)). This classification is based on the implication that all religious arguments ultimately shift to unanswered scientific questions without providing proof for such an overarching claim."
