Sure, let's apply the steps defined in the process \( \text{IDAA} \) to the given string: 

### Given String \( s \)
"Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong."

### Step 1: Understand the Argument Types
- **Generalization (<G>):** Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Presents a reason that merely restates the proposition.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Offers a causal explanation that is not compelling.
- **False Universals (<FU>):** Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Uses statements open to dual interpretations.

### Step 2: Analyze the Given String
- **Main Proposition:** "Get Verizon."
- **Supporting Reason:** "1 billion people can't be wrong."

### Step 3: Compare with Definitions and Examples
- **Compare with <G>:** No generalization based on a specific instance.
- **Compare with <FE>:** Not listing limited or expanded options.
- **Compare with <IR>:** Not providing irrelevant reason to the main proposition.
- **Compare with <RR>:** Not merely restating the proposition in different words.
- **Compare with <WCB>:** Not offering a weak causal argument directly in this sense.
- **Compare with <FU>:** Yes, it asserts universally agreed points without proof by stating that because "1 billion people" use Verizon, it must be the right choice.
- **Compare with <DEP>:** Not ambiguous with dual interpretations.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument Type
- Based on the analysis, this argument mainly fits **False Universals ( <FU> )**. It relies on the notion that a large number of people using Verizon is a sufficient reason for everyone to use it without providing additional evidence or reasoning.

### Step 5: Validate Your Classification
- **Re-evaluate the Argument:** Yes, the argument fits the category of falsely suggesting that universally agreed points (1 billion people liking Verizon) validate the proposition without further proof.
- **Consider Counterexamples:**
  - Not other defective types as previously established.

**Conclusion:** The given string "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong." is classified as **False Universals ( <FU> )**.
