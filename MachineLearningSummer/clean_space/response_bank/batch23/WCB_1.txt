For 
To apply the task <IDAA> (decomposition of <IDA>) to the string "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far," we will follow the structured steps outlined previously.

### Steps for Decomposition (<D>) of <IDA>:
1. **Identify the Argument**: Extract the primary statement or argument from the string <s>.
2. **Understand Context**: Comprehend the context and the more extensive narrative surrounding the argument if it exists.
3. **Categorize the Argument Type**:
    - **Check for Generalization**: Determine if the argument makes a broad claim based on a specific instance.
    - **Check for False Enumeration**: Assess if the argument lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
    - **Check for Inappropriate Reason**: Verify if the given reason does not logically support the proposition.
    - **Check for Redundant Reason**: Ascertain if the reason simply restates the proposition in different words.
    - **Check for Weak Causal Basis**: Evaluate if the provided causal basis is insufficient to support the proposition.
    - **Check for False Universals**: Determine if the argument asserts universally agreed points without proof.
    - **Check for Double-Edged Phrases**: Identify if the statement can have dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.
4. **Classify the Argument**: Assign the argument to one of the categories <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.
5. **Review and Validate**: Reassess the classification to ensure it accurately represents the argument type based on the predefined categories.

### Application (<IDAA>):
Here’s how to apply the decomposed steps to classify the given string:

**Step 1: Identify the Argument**
   - Extract the main statement: "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far."

**Step 2: Understand Context**
   - Context: This statement tries to explain the cause of Donald Trump getting elected by attributing it to liberals taking political correctness too far.

**Step 3: Categorize the Argument Type**
   - **Check for Generalization**: The string does not make a generalization.
   - **Check for False Enumeration**: The string does not list options.
   - **Check for Inappropriate Reason**: The reason relates to the outcome (election result), but it does not logically or empirically support the whole proposition convincingly.
   - **Check for Redundant Reason**: The reason given does not restate the proposition.
   - **Check for Weak Causal Basis**: The statement provides a causal relationship that is contentious and not sufficiently compelling without more evidence. The causal link between liberals taking political correctness too far and the election of Donald Trump is not robustly substantiated.
   - **Check for False Universals**: The argument does not assert universally agreed points without proof.
   - **Check for Double-Edged Phrases**: The statement does not have a dual interpretation that works against the speaker.

**Step 4: Classify the Argument**
   - Based on the analysis, the argument fits under **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)** because the proposition that liberal political correctness directly caused Donald Trump’s election is a weakly supported causal claim.

**Step 5: Review and Validate**
   - Reassessing the classification, we can confirm that the statement provides a reason but not a strong enough causal link to support the proposition fully, thus making it a case of <WCB>.

By following these steps, we have systematically classified the string "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far" as <WCB>.
