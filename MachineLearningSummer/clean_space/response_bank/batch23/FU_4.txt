For 
Let's apply the step-by-step process of <IDAA> to the string <s>: "Everyone else is doing it, so should you."

**Step 1: Identify the Nature of the Argument**
- Main claim: "You should do it."
- Supporting statement: "Everyone else is doing it."

**Step 2: Classify Supporting Statements and Claims**
- **Check for Generalization (<G>):** The argument does not claim a general truth based on a specific instance. 
- **Check for False Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument does not list fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **Check for Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** The support given ("Everyone else is doing it") does not logically provide a valid reason for the proposition ("You should do it").
- **Check for Redundant Reason (<RR>):** The reason given is not merely rephrasing the proposition.
- **Check for Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The argument is not suggesting a causal basis.
- **Check for False Universals (<FU>):** The argument does assert a universally agreed point without proof, suggesting that because everyone else is doing it, you should do it too, which is an appeal to popularity or bandwagon fallacy.
- **Check for Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** The statement does not have dual interpretations potentially against the speaker.

**Step 3: Match Against Examples**
- Examples of <FU>: 
  - "Mormonism is one of the fastest growing sects of Christianity today so that whole story about Joseph Smith getting the golden plates that, unfortunately, disappeared back into heaven, must be true!"
  - "Stating that something should be done (or agreed to) because everyone else thinks this way."
  - "“[Everyone else is buying it, so you should too!]”"
- The string matches the essence of these examples, particularly the bandwagon fallacy where a proposition is considered true or more valid because many people believe it or are doing it.

**Step 4: Determine the Argument Type**
- The argument type for <s> "Everyone else is doing it, so should you." is classified as <FU> (False Universals).

By following these steps, we have systematically determined that the string falls under the classification of False Universals.
