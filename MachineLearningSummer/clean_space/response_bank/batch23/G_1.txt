For 
To apply the decomposition process (IDAA) to the given string, "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!", we will follow the structured steps outlined previously.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Understanding the Problem Statement:**
   - The task is to classify the given string based on the defective argument types.

2. **Identify Key Features and Criteria:**
   - Observe the components: 
     - "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up" (specific instance about the Church).
     - "Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!" (general conclusion about a specific individual).

3. **Initial Classification Step:**
   - A superficial look suggests that a general conclusion about an individual based on an instance involving a larger group might be present.

4. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - Evaluating the argument structure:
     - There is an inference made about an individual based on a specific instance involving a much larger group (the Catholic Church).

5. **Comparison with Definitions:**
   - **Assessing for <G> (Generalization):** 
     - This string concludes that the 102-year-old individual is guilty based on the actions of a larger group. 
     - There is an over-generalization from the specific instance of the Catholic Church’s involvement in a scandal to an individual who is merely a member of that larger group.
   - **Assessing for <IR> (Inappropriate Reason):** 
     - It provides a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition. The involvement of the Catholic Church doesn't directly implicate every individual Catholic.
   - **Assessing for other types:**
     - <FE>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP> do not fit well since the argument is not about limited or false options, repetition, weak causality, unproven universals, or phrases with dual interpretations.

6. **Re-evaluation:**
   - The best fit here is <G> because the argument makes an unsupported generalization about an individual based on the actions of a collective group.

7. **Final Classification:**
   - Thus, the final classification is <G> (Generalization).

By following these steps, we systematically decomposed the task and accurately classified the argument as <G> (Generalization).
