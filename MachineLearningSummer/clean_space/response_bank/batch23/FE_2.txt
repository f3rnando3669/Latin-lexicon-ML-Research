For 
Sure, let's apply the steps of <IDAA> to classify the string "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA> into <D>

1. **Text Understanding and Interpretation**
   - Parse the string: The statement presents a binary choice linking the support for a particular political figure to a belief in women's rights.

2. **Identify the Argument Type**
   - Determine the nature: The argument appears to present only two options.

3. **Analyze the Argument Structure**
   - Structure: It suggests that you must support Hillary Clinton for President or otherwise be against women's rights.

4. **Match with Defective Argument Definitions**
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument does not make a claim based on a specific instance but rather offers a false binary.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: It presents a dichotomy by suggesting there are only two mutually exclusive options.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: No illogical reasoning provided here.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: This isn't presenting a redundant repetition.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Not suggesting a causal relationship.
   - **False Universals (<FU>)**: While this might seem universally agreed upon, it primarily suggests a limited choice.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: No dual interpretation present.

5. **Classification**
   - The argument fits best under **False Enumeration (<FE>)** because it restricts the complex issue of supporting a political candidate to just two oversimplified choices.

6. **Verification and Validation**
   - Review: The statement "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" falsely limits the available options. There are many ways to support women's rights other than supporting Hillary Clinton, making it a classic case of **False Enumeration (<FE>)**.

### Final Classification
The string "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" is classified as:

**False Enumeration (<FE>)**

By systematically analyzing the argument structure and comparing it against known definitions, we have verified that the string indeed fits the category of **False Enumeration (<FE>)**, presenting a false dichotomy.
