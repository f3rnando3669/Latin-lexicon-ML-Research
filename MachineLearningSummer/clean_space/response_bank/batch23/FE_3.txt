Certainly! Let's apply the steps of IDAA (the decomposition of the task of identifying the defective argument type) to classify the string "People either like coffee or hate it."

### Given String <s>: "People either like coffee or hate it."

### Application <IDAA>:

#### Step 1: Identify Key Features
- Options presented: "like coffee" and "hate it."

#### Step 2: Match Structural Patterns
- **<FE> False Enumeration**: The statement presents only two extreme options without acknowledging the possibility of neutral or varying opinions.

#### Step 3: Contextual Understanding
- The context involves people's preferences regarding coffee. It suggests a binary choice.

#### Step 4: Check for Logical Fallacies
- Logical Fallacy: This presents a false dichotomy or false dilemma, ignoring that people might have neutral feelings, moderate preferences, or even indifferent attitudes toward coffee.

#### Step 5: Assign Argument Type
- Based on the analysis, the string fits the pattern of <FE> (False Enumeration).

### Conclusion:
The argument type of the given string <s> "People either like coffee or hate it." is classified as **<FE> False Enumeration**.

This method ensures a thorough and systematic classification based on the identified key features, structural patterns, and logical fallacies, leading to an accurate assignment of the defective argument type.
