For 
Let's apply the step-by-step process of <IDAA> to the given argument:

### Example String <s>:
"Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified.
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so.
Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct?
Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran."

### Decomposition of IDA (<D>)

#### 1. Input Analysis
- **Read and parse the input string <s>.**
  - The string involves a dialogue between two speakers discussing the validity of the Quran's claims.

#### 2. Context Identification
- **Identify the main claim or proposition and any supporting elements.**
  - Main Claim: "Jesus was not really crucified."
  - Supporting Argument: The Quran states it, and the Quran is deemed to be true because it is the Word of God.

#### 3. Pattern Matching
- **Compare the main claim and its supporting elements with the characteristics of each defective argument type:**

  - **<G> Generalization**:
    - Does it claim a general truth based on a specific instance? No, it does not.
  
  - **<FE> False Enumeration**:
    - Does it list fewer or more options than actually exist? No, it does not.
  
  - **<IR> Inappropriate Reason**:
    - Does it provide a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition? Yes, it seems the evidence provided (the Quran) is used to validate itself in a circular manner.

  - **<RR> Redundant Reason**:
    - Is there redundancy presented as a new reason? No, it doesn’t merely restate the proposition.
  
  - **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis**:
    - Is the causal basis weak? No causal basis is offered within this dialogue except for the authority of the Quran.
  
  - **<FU> False Universals**:
    - Does it assert universally agreed points without proof? No, it doesn’t appeal to a universal agreement.
  
  - **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases**:
    - Are there dual interpretations in the statement? No, it does not present a dual interpretation.

#### 4. Rule Application
- **Check for closest match:**
  - The argument uses the Quran to prove itself, which fits the criteria of providing a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition due to circular reasoning.

#### 5. Classification
- **Assign the most fitting defective argument type to <s>**:
  - **<IR>: Inappropriate Reason**: The statement uses a circular argument where the Quran is used to prove its validity, which doesn't provide a logical support external to itself.

Therefore, the given argument falls under the **<IR> Inappropriate Reason** category due to its circular reasoning where the Quran's own statements are used to validate the Quran itself, not providing external logical evidence.
