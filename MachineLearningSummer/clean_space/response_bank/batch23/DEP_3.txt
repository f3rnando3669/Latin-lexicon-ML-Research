Alright, let's apply the IDAA process to classify the given statement:

### Step-by-Step Classification of: 
"I see nobody on the road," said Alice.
"I only wish I had such eyes," the king remarked..."To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why it's as much as I can do to see real people, by this light."

1. **Identify the Premise and Conclusion**:
    - Premise: Alice states she sees nobody on the road.
    - Conclusion: The king wishes he had eyes like Alice to be able to see "Nobody."

2. **Check for Specific Instance and General Claim (<G>)**:
    - The statement does not make a general claim based on a specific instance.

3. **Check for Limited or Excessive Options Provided (<FE>)**:
    - The statement does not list fewer or more options than exist.

4. **Check for Logical Irrelevance of the Reason (<IR>)**:
    - The argument does not seem to provide an irrelevant reason for a proposition.

5. **Check for Rephrased Proposition (<RR>)**:
    - The statement doesn't seem to restate the proposition using different words.

6. **Check for Weak Causal Relationship (<WCB>)**:
    - The argument does not offer a weak causal relationship.

7. **Check for Asserted Universality without Proof (<FU>)**:
    - The statement does not assert universally agreed points without proof.

8. **Check for Dual Interpretations (<DEP>)**:
    - The king's remark gives a humorous, dual interpretation where "seeing nobody" is taken literally to mean seeing an entity called "Nobody," making it difficult to gauge intent under certain light conditions.

    **Classification**: <DEP>

This argument is best classified as a **Double-Edged Phrase (DEP)** because the king's response plays on the dual interpretation of "nobody"â€”both the absence of people and the literal entity "Nobody."
