For 
To apply \(<IDAA>\) to the given string "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today," we follow the steps outlined in \(<D>\):

**Step 1: Identify the Argument Type**
- The argument seems to imply that not being in class today invalidates the belief that someone is a good person.
- It appears to draw a conclusion about someone's character based on a specific instance of not attending class.

**Step 2: Compare with Definitions**
- **Generalization (<G>)**: This could be a candidate since it draws a broad conclusion about a person's goodness from a single event.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Does not seem to list limited options.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Providing a reason (not being in class) that might not logically connect to being a good person.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: The argument is not merely restating the same thing.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Not clearly suggesting causality here.
- **False Universals (<FU>)**: No apparent universal claim is made.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Not a dual interpretation scenario.

**Step 3: Eliminate Irrelevant Types**
- Eliminate \(<FE>\), \(<RR>\), \(<WCB>\), \(<FU>\), and \(<DEP>\) as these do not align well given the argument structure.

**Step 4: Validate with Examples**
- Comparing with \(<IR>\) examples, it seems similar to "We cannot listen to John’s opinion on global warming because he is a tree hugger." Here, not being in class is not a logically valid basis for determining someone's moral character.
- With \(<G>\) examples, it also resembles drawing a broad, sweeping conclusion from a specific incidence.

**Step 5: Assign the Correct Type**
- Given the argument most closely aligns with either a generalized belief from a specific instance or an inappropriate reason, the logically defective argument type is best understood as \(<IR>\) since the reason given (not being in class) does not logically support the claim about the person's goodness.

**Step 6: Double-Check the Logic**
- Re-evaluate to ensure no misclassification: The reason provided (absence from class) is indeed inappropriate for determining the moral character of a person.

Result: This is an \(<IR>\) defective argument.
