For 
To classify the string "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being.  Fetuses are innocent human beings.  Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses." using the structured approach \((IDAA)\), we will follow the detailed decomposition \(D\):

### Initial Analysis:
1. **Read and understand the given string \(s\)**:
   - The string consists of three parts:
     1. "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being."
     2. "Fetuses are innocent human beings."
     3. "Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."
   - The argument progresses from a general ethical principle to a specific application concerning fetuses.

### Identify Key Patterns:
2. **Look for patterns in the string that match any of the argument types defined**:
   - The argument provides a moral principle and asserts a specific case (fetuses) under that principle.

### Check Definitions:
3. **Compare these patterns against the specific characteristics of each argument type**:
   - *Generalization (G)*: Not applicable—this argument does not generalize from a specific instance.
   - *False Enumeration (FE)*: Not applicable—this argument does not present a limited set of choices that excludes other possibilities.
   - *Inappropriate Reason (IR)*: Not directly fitting—this argument's reason is relevant to the conclusion.
   - *Redundant Reason (RR)*: Not applicable—each statement in the argument builds on the previous, rather than restating it.
   - *Weak Causal Basis (WCB)*: Not applicable—no cause-effect reasoning is present.
   - *False Universals (FU)*: Not applicable—does not claim universal agreement for validation.
   - *Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)*: Not applicable—the phrases aren't open to dual interpretations.

### Classify Argument Type:
4. **Determine the defective argument type that best fits the string \(s\)** based on the identified patterns**:
   - This argument does not neatly fit any of the defective argument types listed. While it presents a moral argument, the reasoning is generally coherent and relevant to its conclusion.

### Validate Classification:
5. **Recheck the string to confirm the classification accuracy**:
   - Given the string doesn't align with defects like generalization, false enumeration, inappropriate reason, redundant reason, weak causal basis, false universals, or double-edged phrases, there is no applicable defective argument type identified.

### Conclusion:
- The string "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being.  Fetuses are innocent human beings.  Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses." does not exemplify any of the classified defective argument types. 

For future analysis, ensure the provided defective argument types are accurately applicable to the string in question. If the argument appears logically sound and free from the specified types of fallacies, it should be recognized as such.
