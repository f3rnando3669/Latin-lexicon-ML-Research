For 
Let's apply the step-by-step <IDAA> approach to classify the given string:

### Given String
"Speaker 1: We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change.
Speaker 2: Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."

### Step-by-Step Classification

#### 1. Identify the Main Proposition:
   - There are two speakers in this string, and we'll classify the defective argument based on Speaker 2's response.
   - Main Proposition by Speaker 2: "I can’t be a part of this."

#### 2. Analyze the Supporting Statements:
   - Supporting Statement by Speaker 2: "I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."

#### 3. Identify Patterns and Key Phrases:
   - "I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people" appears to use a reasoning that doesn't logically support the rejection of participating in the initiative to spread the word about social injustice.

#### 4. Classify Based on Definitions:
   - The reasoning provided does not address the merits of the initiative (spreading the word about social injustice) but focuses on the phrase "use people," which is taken out of the intended context. This is more of an Inappropriate Reason (\(<IR>\)), where the reason given doesn't logically support the proposition.

#### 5. Validate Classification:
   - The key element here is that Speaker 2 dismisses the involvement based on a phrase without consideration of the context and the actual effort (door to door campaign for social justice). This fits well with \(<IR>\) since the reasoning is not logically relevant to the proposition.

Therefore, the classification of this string \( <s> \) is:

\[ \boxed{<IR>} \]
