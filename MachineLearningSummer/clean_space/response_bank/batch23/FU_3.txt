For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding," we will follow the decomposition steps designed for identifying defective argument types.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA>:

1. **Initial Analysis of the Argument**:
   - **Main Proposition**: "I wasn't speeding."
   - **Supporting Statement**: "I was only driving as fast as everyone around me."

2. **Matching the Argument Against Defined Types**:
   - Compare the identified proposition and its supporting statements against each defect type <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

3. **Evaluation Checklist** for Each Defect Type:

   - **Generalization (<G>)**:
     - Does the argument make sweeping claims based on limited instances?
     - No, it doesn't seem to generalize from limited instances.

   - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**:
     - Does the argument present only a limited number of choices, ignoring other potential options?
     - No, it doesn't limit the choices artificially.

   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**:
     - Are the reasons given logically relevant to the main proposition?
     - While the reason given ("everyone around me") seems like it could be relevant, this doesn’t automatically make it inappropriate.

   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**:
     - Is the supporting reason merely a restatement of the main claim using different words?
     - Not obviously a repetition of the proposition.

   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
     - Does the cause presented genuinely contribute to the effect stated?
     - The cause-effect relationship here is not about causality but rather a justification. This isn’t quite <WCB>.

   - **False Universals (<FU>)**:
     - Does the argument assert truths as universally accepted without providing substantiating evidence?
     - Yes, the argument relies on the assumption that because everyone is doing something, it must be acceptable, which is a form of appeal to popularity.

   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**:
     - Are there statements that can be interpreted in more than one way, particularly one that might discredit the speaker’s point?
     - No, the statement isn't particularly ambiguous or potentially self-discrediting based on its dual interpretation.

4. **Decision Making**:
   - Utilize the checklist to determine which, if any, of the defective arguments the string fits best.
   - The argument fits best under **False Universals (FU)**, as it asserts a justification for not speeding based on what everyone else is doing, without providing direct evidence for the speaker’s compliance with speed limits.

### Conclusion:
For the string "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding," the most appropriate classification is <FU>—False Universals, due to the reliance on an appeal to the actions of others as validation of the proposition.
