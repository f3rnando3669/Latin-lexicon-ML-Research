For 
Let's apply the steps defined in <IDAA> to the string \( \langle s \rangle \): "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess all the other classes will all fail it, too."

### Step-by-Step Application of IDAA:

**Step 1: Understanding the Argument Types**

- **Generalization (G):** Claims a universal truth based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (FE):** Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **Weak Causal Basis (WCB):** Offers a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
- **False Universals (FU):** Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP):** Uses statements open to dual interpretations.
- **Redundant Reasoning (RR):** Uses evidence that restates the proposition in different words.
- **Irrelevant Reasoning (IR):** The given reason does not support or give credence to the proposition.

**Step 2: Identify the Clauses in the String**

The string can be broken down into:
- Clause 1 (Reason): "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz"
- Clause 2 (Proposition): "I guess all the other classes will all fail it, too."

**Step 3: Match Clauses to Argument Types**

- Does the string claim a universal truth from a specific instance? -> \( \langle G \rangle \)
- Does it list options that don't encompass all possibilities? -> \( \langle FE \rangle \)
- Does it make a weak causal connection? -> \( \langle WCB \rangle \)
- Does it assert points without proof? -> \( \langle FU \rangle \)
- Does it have dual interpretations? -> \( \langle DEP \rangle \)
- Does the reason restate the proposition? -> \( \langle RR \rangle \)
- Does the reason not support the proposition? -> \( \langle IR \rangle \)

**Step 4: Apply Heuristic or Keywords**

- This does not involve listing options, so it is not \( \langle FE \rangle \).
- It makes a broad assumption based on a specific instance, potentially leading to \( \langle G \rangle \).
- It does not use a weak causal basis, so not \( \langle WCB \rangle \).
- It does not assert universally agreed points without proof, so not \( \langle FU \rangle \).
- It does not use statements that are open to dual interpretations, so not \( \langle DEP \rangle \).
- It does not use evidence that restates the proposition, so not \( \langle RR \rangle \).
- The reason provided, albeit weak, does support the proposition and is not irrelevant, so not \( \langle IR \rangle \).

**Step 5: Conclude the Classification**

The argument claims a broad generalization (all the other classes failing the quiz) based on a specific instance (three kids in one class failing). This matches the criteria for \( \langle G \rangle \).

That means the classification of \( \langle s \rangle \) is \( \langle G \rangle \).
