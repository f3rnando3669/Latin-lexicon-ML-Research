For 
Let's apply the step-by-step decomposition (IDAA) to the given string "<s>":

**String (s):** "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong."

### Step-by-Step Application of IDAA

#### Step 1: Understand and Parse the Statement
- **Subject:** 1 billion people
- **Predicate:** can't be wrong
- **Action/Proposition:** Get Verizon

#### Step 2: Identify Key Characteristics
- The argument is asserting that one should choose Verizon because a large number of people have done so.
- It implies that the choice of 1 billion people serves as evidence or reason to follow the same action.

#### Step 3: Match Characteristics with Defective Argument Types
- **<G> Generalization:** This does not fit because it’s not making a general statement based on a specific instance.
- **<FE> False Enumeration:** This does not fit because it’s not listing options inaccurately.
- **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis:** This does not fit because it’s not presenting a weak causal relationship.
- **<FU> False Universals:** This fits because it asserts that because 1 billion people chose Verizon, it must be the correct choice. This is an appeal to popularity, implying that a popular choice is valid or true without further proof.
- **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases:** This does not fit because the language is not open to dual interpretations.
- **<RR> Restating Reason:** This does not fit because the reason does not simply restate the proposition.
- **<IR> Irrelevant Reason:** This does not fit because the reason provided (popularity) is not irrelevant, though it is a weak form of reasoning based on appeal to popularity.

#### Step 4: Classify the Argument
- The argument fits the type **<FU> False Universals**.

**Classification:** <FU>

By following the steps, we have classified the given argumentative statement as <FU>.
