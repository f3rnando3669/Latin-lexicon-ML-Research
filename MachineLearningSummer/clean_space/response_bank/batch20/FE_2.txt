For 
Let's apply the step-by-step decomposition of \( IDAA \) to the string \( <s> \): "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

**1. Identify the Structure of \(<s>\):**
- \( <s> \) is a single sentence with a compound statement.

**2. Parse the Clauses:**
- Clause 1: "You either support Hillary Clinton for President"
- Clause 2: "you don't believe in women's rights"

**3. Analyze the Clauses:**
- Clause 1: Proposition: "You support Hillary Clinton for President" (This is one option presented)
- Clause 2: The other part of the compound statement is: "you don't believe in women's rights"

**4. Classify Based on Argument Types:**
- **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement is not generalizing from a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement is presenting two options. We need to check if these are fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This statement does not establish a causal link.
- **False Universals (<FU>)**: The statement does not assert a universally agreed point but rather limits the choices.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: The statement isn't open to dual interpretations.
- **Reason Restatement (<RR>)**: The statement does not restate the proposition in different words.
- **Irrelevant Reason (<IR>)**: The statement does not give a reason that does not support the proposition.

**5. Apply Examples for Verification:**
- The statement "...or you don't believe in women's rights" limits the possible beliefs to only two: either supporting Hillary Clinton for President or not believing in women's rights. There are more nuanced positions than these two, indicating a **False Enumeration**.

**6. Final Classification:**
- The string \( <s> \) is classified as **False Enumeration (FE)**.

By following these steps, we arrive at the conclusion that the argument type of the given statement "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" falls under **False Enumeration (FE)**.
