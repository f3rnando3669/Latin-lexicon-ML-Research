For 
Let's apply the defined steps of <D> to the statement provided: 

"s: Farmer McDonald: Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain. I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature."

### Step-by-Step Application of <IDAA>:

1. **Identification of SP Structure:**
   - **Subject:** "Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river"
   - **Predicate:** "we haven't had a bit of rain"
   - **Subject (2nd part):** "mankind"
   - **Predicate (2nd part):** "has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature"

   The statement describes an event and a consequence, followed by a general assertion about human actions.

2. **Initial Categorization:**
   - The statement involves a cause-and-effect relationship (new power plant put up and no rain).
   - Additionally, there's a general claim about mankind's actions with nature.

3. **Specific Identification:**
   - Does it generalize from a specific instance? Possibly, the general comment about mankind.
   - Does it enumerate options, potentially incompletely? No, there aren't multiple options listed.
   - Does it involve a cause-and-effect relationship? Yes, attributing the lack of rain to the new power plant.
   - Does it assert a universally agreed point without proof? The statement about mankind's actions is more figurative but could imply an assertion without direct proof.
   - Does it contain phrases open to dual interpretations? Not explicitly.
   - Does it restate the conclusion as its reason? No, the conclusion isn't restated.
   - Does the reason presented not support the conclusion? Yes, the causal link between a power plant and the absence of rain is weak and not logically supported.

4. **Verification and Refinement:**
   - The claim about no rain due to the power plant fits the category of <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis) as it provides an unsupported causal link.
   - The general statement about mankind can be seen as a comment on human hubris, but it's not the main defect here.

5. **Final Classification:**
   - Given that the key defective argument features stem from the unwarranted causal link, the appropriate classification is <WCB>.

Therefore, the result of applying <IDAA> to "Farmer McDonald: Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain. I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature." is that <s> is classified as of type:

**<WCB>** (Weak Causal Basis)
