For 
To apply the task \(<IDAA>\) to the string "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding.", we will follow the step-by-step procedure (\(<D>\)):

### Step-by-Step Application (\(<IDAA>\)):

1. **Identify the structure of the argument:**
   - The argument provides a reason (driving as fast as everyone around) to support a proposition (wasn't speeding).

2. **Analyze the content of the argument:**
   - The phrase "driving as fast as everyone around me" suggests a comparison with others.
   - The proposition is that the speaker was not speeding because their speed was comparable to that of others.

3. **Match the structure and content to one of the predefined defective argument types:**
   - The argument implies that the speaker's speed was lawful based on the premise that everyone else was driving at the same speed.
   - This argument assumes that if many people are doing something (driving at a certain speed), it must be acceptable, without providing direct evidence that this speed is within the legal limit.

4. **Make the classification:**
   - This argument falls under **<FU> (False Universals)** because it relies on the behavior of others (everyone driving at the same speed) as validation for the speaker's claim of not speeding. It asserts a universal point (not speeding) without providing specific evidence that the speed was legally acceptable.

Therefore, the argument "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding." is classified as \(<FU>\).
