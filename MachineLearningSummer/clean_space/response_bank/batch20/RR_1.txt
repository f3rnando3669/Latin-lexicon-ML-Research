For 
To classify the given string "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity." as one of the specified defective argument types, we'll follow the decomposition into specific steps as outlined in \( <D> \).

### Step-by-Step Application of \(IDAA\):

1. **Identify Clause Structure:**
   - Break down \(s\) into distinct clauses.
   - Clause 1: "Paranormal activity is real"
   - Clause 2: "because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."

2. **Clause Analysis:**
   - Clause 1 is a statement that can be true or false (\(<Proposition>\)).
   - Clause 2 offers evidence or information (\(<Reason>\)).

3. **Match Generalization Patterns (\<G>):**
   - The clause does not make a broad conclusion about an entire group based on a single or very limited example. Thus, \(s\) does not fit \(<G>\).

4. **Evaluate Enumeration (\<FE>):**
   - The sentence does not improperly list options or choices, so it does not fit \(<FE>\).

5. **Assess Causal Basis (\<WCB>):**
   - The argument does not present a causal relationship between events or actions, so it does not fit \(<WCB>\).

6. **Check for Universals (\<FU>):**
   - The string does not assert universally agreed-upon points without proof. Therefore, it does not fit \(<FU>\).

7. **Examine for Ambiguities (\<DEP>):**
   - The sentence does not seem to use statements that have dual interpretations leading to confusion, so it does not fit \(<DEP>\).

8. **Redundant Reasoning (RR):**
   - Check if the reason provided simply restates the proposition in different words.
   - Proposition: "Paranormal activity is real"
   - Reason: "because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."
   - The reason ("because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity") restates the proposition using different words without providing independent evidence.

9. **Irrelevant Reasoning (IR):**
   - The reason given is not irrelevant to the proposition; it actually purports to provide support (though it does so inadequately).

Based on this analysis, \(s\) fits the definition of \(<RR>\) (Redundant Reasoning).

Thus, "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity." is classified as \(<RR>\).
