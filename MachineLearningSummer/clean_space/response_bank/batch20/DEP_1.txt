For 
Let's apply the step-by-step decomposition \( <IDAA> \) to classify the given string:

### Given String:
"When the judge asked the defendant why he hadn't paid his parking fines, he said that he shouldn't have to pay them because the sign said 'Fine for parking here' and so he naturally presumed that it would be fine to park there."

### Step 1: Understand the Definitions and Contexts
- We know the definitions for defective argument types: \( <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, \) and \( <DEP> \).

### Step 2: Extract Key Components
- **Main Claim (Proposition)**: The defendant shouldn't have to pay the parking fines.
- **Evidence/Reason**: The sign said 'Fine for parking here', which the defendant interpreted as permission to park.

### Step 3: Compare Components Against Each Argument Type

1. **Generalization (\<G>)**:
   - Not applicable. There's no general truth claim based on a specific instance here.
   
2. **False Enumeration (\<FE>)**:
   - Not applicable. The argument does not involve listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
   
3. **Weak Causal Basis (\<WCB>)**:
   - Weak Causal Basis involves a non-compelling causal basis to support the proposition. While here, the issue is not about causality but interpretation of a statement.

4. **False Universals (\<FU>)**:
   - Not applicable. There's no assertion of universally agreed points without proof.

5. **Double-Edged Phrases (\<DEP>)**:
   - This involves statements open to dual interpretations, especially those that can contradict the speaker.
   - The phrase "Fine for parking here" can indeed be interpreted in two ways:
     - Interpretation 1: It is acceptable to park here.
     - Interpretation 2: There is a fine (penalty) for parking here.
   
6. **Restatement in Reason (\<RR>)**:
   - Not applicable. This type involves restating the proposition in the reason, which is not the case here.

7. **Irrelevant Reason (\<IR>)**:
   - Not applicable. The reason given is directly relevant to the proposition, though it is based on a misunderstanding.

### Step 4: Classify the String
- Based on the analysis, the string involves the use of a **Double-Edged Phrase (\<DEP>)** because it hinges on the dual interpretation of the sign "Fine for parking here," which the defendant misunderstood.

### Final Classification:
- "When the judge asked the defendant why he hadn't paid his parking fines, he said that he shouldn't have to pay them because the sign said 'Fine for parking here' and so he naturally presumed that it would be fine to park there." is of type \( <DEP> \).
