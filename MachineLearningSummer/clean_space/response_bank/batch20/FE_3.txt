To apply the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as one of the specified defective argument types, let's follow the steps defined under <IDAA> for the string \( s \): "People either like coffee or hate it."

### Step 1: Identify and Parse the Components of the Sentence
- **Extract Clauses**: In this sentence, there is no clear separation into a Reason-Proposition structure. It is a single statement.
- **Classify Clauses**: Since there aren't distinct clauses serving the roles of reason and proposition, this sentence might fall under a different type of defective argument.

### Step 2: Determine the Argument Type
- **Check for Generalization (<G>)**: This sentence does not claim a general truth based on a specific instance. It makes a categorical statement about people's preferences.
- **Check for False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Check if the sentence lists fewer or more options than actually exist. The sentence presents only two options ("like coffee" or "hate it"), but realistically, there are more than these two options (e.g., neutrality or indifference towards coffee).
- **Check for Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: There is no causal relationship being presented.
- **Check for False Universals (<FU>)**: The statement does not assert universally agreed points without proof or appeal to popularity.
- **Check for Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: There is no statement open to dual interpretations.
- **Check for Restating Reason (<RR>)**: There is no repetition in different words of what is said.
- **Check for Irrelevant Reason (<IR>)**: There are no reasoning and proposition parts; hence irrelevance does not apply.

### Step 3: Classify the Argument
- Since the sentence presents only two options but in reality, there are more, it best aligns with the definition of **False Enumeration (<FE>)**.

So, the string \( s \) "People either like coffee or hate it." is classified as **<FE>**.
