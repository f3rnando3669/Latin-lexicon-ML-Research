For 
Let's apply the step-by-step procedure of <IDAA> to classify the given string:

**String \(s\)**: 
"Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified.  
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?  
Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so.  
Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct?  
Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.  
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?  
Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran."

**Step-by-Step Classification:**

### Step 1: Understand the Definitions
- We review and confirm the understanding of each defective argument type: <G>, <FE>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>, <RR>, <IR>.

### Step 2: Analyze \(s\)
- Break down the conversation to identify the structure and logic used in the argument:
  - Speaker 1 asserts: Jesus was not really crucified.
  - Speaker 2 questions the truth of the statement.
  - Speaker 1 justifies it by referencing the Quran.
  - Speaker 2 questions the validity of the Quran.
  - Speaker 1 claims the Quran is the Word of God and everything it says is true.
  - Speaker 2 questions the truth of this statement.
  - Speaker 1 reiterates that God says so in the Quran.

### Step 3: Compare \(s\) to Argument Types
- **Structure Analysis**: 
  - The argument fundamentally rests on the proposition that the Quran is correct because it is the Word of God and everything it says is true.
  - Speaker 1 is using circular reasoning to support the validity of the Quran (i.e., the Quran is true because God says so in the Quran).

- **Match with Defective Argument Types**:
  - This shows a case where the reason presented (the Quran says so because it is the word of God) is effectively restating the proposition in different wording. This seems to fit the structure of <RR> (Restating Reason).
  - Additionally, the claim that "everything in the Quran is true because God tells us so in the Quran" is also a form of circular reasoning.

### Step 4: Classify \(s\)
- Based on the analysis, \(s\) can primarily be classified as <RR> because the reason provided simply restates the proposition.

### Step 5: Validate the Classification
- Re-assess to confirm:
  - The argument fails because it uses circular logic, where the reason is essentially a restatement of the proposition.
  - The claim itself does not give any independent evidence outside of the Quran to support its truth.

Thus, the string "Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified.  
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?  
Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so.  
Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct?  
Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.  
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?  
Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Quran." is correctly classified as <RR>.
