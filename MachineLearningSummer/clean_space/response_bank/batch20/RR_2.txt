For 
Let's apply the decomposition steps of <IDAA> to the provided statement: "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people. This logical fallacy is called..."

### **Application of Decomposition (IDAA)**

1. **Understand the Statement:**
   - The statement is proposing a solution to the problem of a broken judicial system, which is to elect new people.

2. **Identify Clauses and Structure:**
   - Clause 1: "We need to fix our broken judicial system"
   - Clause 2: "by electing new people."

3. **Determine the Type of Clauses:**
   - Clause 1 is a <Proposition> making a claim that the judicial system is broken and needs fixing.
   - Clause 2 appears to be a <Reason> suggesting that electing new people will fix the judicial system.

4. **Check for Restatements (for RR):**
   - The statement does not simply restate the proposition in different words; it suggests a specific action.

5. **Check for Irrelevance (for IR):**
   - Determine if the reason given (electing new people) is relevant and supportive of the proposition (fixing the broken judicial system).

6. **Identify Generalizations (for G):**
   - The statement is not claiming a general truth based on a specific instance, so this does not apply.

7. **Look for False Enumeration (for FE):**
   - The statement does not list options, so this does not apply.

8. **Check for Weak Causal Basis (for WCB):**
   - Evaluate whether electing new people provides a strong and compelling causal connection to fixing the judicial system.

9. **Detect False Universals (for FU):**
   - The statement does not assert a universally agreed-upon claim without proof.

10. **Identify Double-Edged Phrases (for DEP):**
   - The statement does not appear to contain phrases that can be interpreted in two ways.

11. **Classify the Defective Argument:**
   - The most fitting category for this statement is Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>), as the causal link between electing new people and fixing the judicial system is not strong and compelling enough without further evidence or explanation.

### Conclusion:
The statement "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people. This logical fallacy is called..." is best classified as <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis).
