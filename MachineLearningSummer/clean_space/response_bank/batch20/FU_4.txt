For 
Let's apply the step-by-step decomposition of task `<IDAA>` to classify the string `<s>`: "Everyone else is doing it, so should you."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Understand and Identify Clauses**:
   - Clause 1 (Reason): "Everyone else is doing it"
   - Clause 2 (Proposition): "so should you"

2. **Check for Generalization (`<G>`)**:
   - There is no broad statement making a general truth based on a specific instance.

3. **Check for False Enumeration (`<FE>`)**:
   - There is no listing of options that is fewer or more than actually exist.

4. **Check for Weak Causal Basis (`<WCB>`)**:
   - The reasoning does not present a causal relationship, weak or strong.

5. **Check for False Universals (`<FU>`)**:
   - The statement is asserting that because "everyone else" is doing something, it justifies the action for others without providing concrete proof or reasoning. This appeals to popularity or common belief.

6. **Check for Double-Edged Phrases (`<DEP>`)**:
   - There is no ambiguity that leads to dual interpretations.

7. **Check for Restating Reasons (`<RR>`)**:
   - The two clauses do not restate the same idea in different words.

8. **Check for Irrelevant Reasons (`<IR>`)**:
   - The Reason is based on what others are doing and is attempting to support the conclusion that you should do it too, but not in a way that is logically disconnected.

### Conclusion
Based on our decomposition and step-by-step analysis, the given string `<s>` "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" is classified as `<FU>`, since it is a False Universal appealing to popularity or common belief without concrete proof.
