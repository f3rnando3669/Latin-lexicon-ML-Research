For 
To classify the string "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there." using the detailed decomposition process (\(<D>\)) for the task of identifying defective argument types (\(<IDAA>\)), follow these steps:

### Decomposition (\(<D>\)):

1. **Identify the Argument Type**:
   - The argument presents a proposition with supposed reasoning: "That restaurant is popular" (proposition) "because everyone in town goes there" (reason).

2. **Check for Generalization (\(<G>\))**:
   - This argument does not infer a general truth from a specific instance. Therefore, it is not a \(<G>\).

3. **Check for False Enumeration (\(<FE>\))**:
   - This argument does not present a limited set of options, ignoring other possible choices. Therefore, it is not a \(<FE>\).

4. **Check for Weak Causal Basis (\(<WCB>\))**:
   - There is no causal connection offered that seems insufficiently supported or speculative. Therefore, it is not a \(<WCB>\).

5. **Check for False Universals (\(<FU>\))**:
   - Look for arguments appealing to universal acceptance or agreement without proof. The statement "everyone in town goes there" appeals to universal acceptance without providing proof, suggesting that since everyone goes there, the restaurant must be popular.
   - This fits the pattern of \(<FU>\).

6. **Check for Double-Edged Phrases (\(<DEP>\))**:
   - There are no ambiguous statements that can be interpreted in multiple ways, some potentially against the speaker. Therefore, it is not a \(<DEP>\).

7. **Check for Restated Reason (\(<RR>\))**:
   - The reason "everyone in town goes there" does not merely restate the proposition "the restaurant is popular" in different words. Therefore, it is not a \(<RR>\).

8. **Check for Irrelevant Reason (\(<IR>\))**:
   - The reason "everyone in town goes there" is not irrelevant to the proposition "the restaurant is popular," as it attempts to provide a justification. Therefore, it is not a \(<IR>\).

9. **Classify the Argument**:
   - Based on the identified pattern of appealing to universal acceptance without proof, classify this argument as \(<FU>\).

**Final Classification**: The string "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there." is of type \(\text{<FU>}\).

Thus, using the systematic steps provided by the decomposition, we accurately classify the defective argument \(<s>\) as \(\text{<FU>}\).
