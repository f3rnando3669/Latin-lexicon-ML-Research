To apply IDAA and classify the given string, "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!", we will follow the step-by-step decomposition process.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D)

1. **Identify Structural Patterns**:
    - Read the string and identify any recognizable structural pattern or fallacy.

2. **Analyze Clause Relationships**:
    - If the string has multiple clauses, identify the roles of each clause. Specifically, determine if:
        - Clause 1 is meant to provide a Reason and Clause 2 is a Proposition.
        - Clause 1 just restates Clause 2 in different words.
        - Clause 1 does not logically support Clause 2.

3. **Compare Against Definitions**:
    - Compare the identified patterns and clause structures against the definitions to classify the defective argument type.

### Application to IDA (IDAA)

#### Step 1: Identify Structural Patterns

- The string consists of two sentences:
  1. "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up."
  2. "Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!"

- The structure of the argument suggests that the conclusion about the neighbor's guilt is derived from the information about the Catholic Church's scandal.

#### Step 2: Analyze Clause Relationships

- Clause 1 provides the Reason: "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up."
- Clause 2 provides the Proposition: "Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!"

- We need to determine how Clause 1 (Reason) logically supports Clause 2 (Proposition).

#### Step 3: Compare Against Definitions

- In this context, Clause 1 is presenting information about an organization (the Catholic Church) and using this information to claim something specific about an individual associated with that organization (the 102-year-old Catholic neighbor).

- This is a type of defective reasoning as it assumes guilt by association without any direct evidence linking the neighbor to the scandal.

- This pattern aligns with **Generalization (G)** as it extrapolates a general truth or guilt from a specific instance related to a group and applies it to an individual member of that group.

### Classification:

The given string is of type **<G>** (Generalization), as it concludes that an individual must be guilty based solely on their association with a larger group that has been implicated in a scandal.

This classification correctly identifies the logical flaw in the argument where an inappropriate generalization is made from a group characteristic to an individual member.
