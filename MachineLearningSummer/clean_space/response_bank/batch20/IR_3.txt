For 
To classify the given string using the task IDAA, let's follow the steps of decomposing and analyzing the statement systematically:

### Given String \( s \):

"Perhaps the most classic example of this fallacy is the argument for the existence of God. Due to the understanding of nature through science, many of the arguments that used to be used for God (or gods) were abandoned, only to be replaced with new ones, usually involving questions to which science has not definitively answered yet. The move from creationism to intelligent design is a prime example. Currently the origin of life is a popular argument for God (although a classic argument from ignorance), and an area where we very well may have a scientific answer in the next decade, at which time, the “origin of life” argument will fade away and be replaced by another, thus moving the figurative goalposts farther back as our understanding of the natural world increases. Exception: This fallacy should not be confused with an argument or set of arguments, with multiple propositions inherent in the argument. The reason for the difference between this kind of argument and the moving the goalposts fallacy, is a subtle one, but indicated by a strong initial claim (“has to be”, “must”, “required for”, etc.) that gets answered and/or what appears to be ad hoc objections that follow eventually leading to an impossible request for proof. Fun Fact: The name “moving the goalposts” comes from the analogy of kicking a perfect field goal in American football, only to have the goalposts be moved on you. This would be very unfair. References: This is a logical fallacy frequently used on the Internet. No academic sources could be found. Questions about this fallacy? Ask our community!"

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Application:

1. **Identify Parts of the Statement:**
   - The string is a complex description rather than a single, straightforward argument. It describes a logical fallacy known as "moving the goalposts."

2. **Analyze Clauses for Patterns:**
   - The string consists of multiple observations and explanations about how the fallacy operates, with reference to examples and distinctions.

3. **Check for Generalization:**
   - The string is not claiming a general truth based on a specific instance. Thus, it is not of type <G>.

4. **Examine Enumeration:**
   - The string does not erroneously list options. Thus, it is not of type <FE>.

5. **Causal Basis Analysis:**
   - The string is providing a narrative rather than reasoning from a weak causal basis. Thus, it is not of type <WCB>.

6. **Universal Assertions Check:**
   - There are no universal claims without support relevant to the overall string. Thus, it does not fall under <FU>.

7. **Double-Edged Phrases Analysis:**
   - The string does not employ phrases with dual interpretations against the speaker. Thus, it is not of type <DEP>.

8. **Restated Reason Test:**
   - The string does not exhibit restated reasoning. Thus, it is not of type <RR>.

9. **Irrelevant Reason Analysis:**
   - The string does not provide irrelevant reasons for any specific proposition. Thus, it is not of type <IR>.

### Observation and Classification:

The string primarily explains the concept of a logical fallacy ("moving the goalposts") in elaborate detail with examples and an etymological explanation. It does not appear to match any of the defined defective argument patterns (<G>, <FE>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>, <RR>, or <IR>).

**Conclusion:**
- The given string does not qualify as a defective argument type as defined in <IDA> and thus does not fall under any specific classification (<G>, <FE>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>, <RR>, or <IR>).

The string itself is informational, providing an explication rather than making a fallacious argument. Therefore, it does not fit within the predefined defective argument types.
