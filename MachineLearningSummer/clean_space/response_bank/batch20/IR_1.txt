For 
To classify the string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you." using \( \langle IDAA \rangle \), we will follow the decomposition step by step.

### Step 1: Understand and Parse the String \( \langle s \rangle \)
The statement is: "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you."
- This statement contains two parts: 
  1. "My best friend says you’re a liar" (Reason)
  2. "so I’m not going to talk to you." (Proposition)

### Step 2: Identify the Structural Components
- This is a compound sentence with a reason (clause 1) justifying a proposition (clause 2).

### Step 3: Compare with Definitions of Defective Argument Types
- **Generalization (G):** The statement is not generalizing a whole group based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (FE):** The statement does not enumerate options.
- **Weak Causal Basis (WCB):** No causal relationship described.
- **False Universals (FU):** The statement does not rely on universally agreed points.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP):** No phrases open to dual interpretations.
- **Restating (RR):** The reason given does not restate the proposition.
- **Irrelevant Reason (IR):** The reason given ("My best friend says you’re a liar") does not really support or give credence to the proposition ("so I’m not going to talk to you"). There is no logical connection between a third person's opinion and the decision to not communicate.

### Step 4: Match
- After comparison, the type that fits closest is Irrelevant Reason \( \langle IR \rangle \) because the reason does not logically support the proposition.

### Step 5: Classify
- Therefore, classify \( \langle s \rangle \) as \( \langle IR \rangle \).

### Step 6: Review and Validate
- Rechecking, the classification aligns well with the definition of Irrelevant Reason \( \langle IR \rangle \).

Thus, the application of \( \langle IDAA \rangle \) yields that the string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you." is classified as \( \langle IR \rangle \).
