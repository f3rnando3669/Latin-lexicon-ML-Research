For 
To classify the string "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far" using the decomposition (D) of the task (IDA), we proceed step-by-step:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify the Structure**:
    - This statement consists of two distinct parts:
        - Clause 1 (Reason): "liberals took political correctness too far."
        - Clause 2 (Proposition): "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because [clause 1]."

2. **Contextual Analysis**:
    - The statement suggests a causal relationship.
    - Keywords: "The reason" indicates a causal explanation is being attempted.

3. **Evaluate the Evidence**:
    - The reasoning provided (liberals taking political correctness too far) is presented as the cause of the proposition (Trump's election).

4. **Check for Causality**:
    - The argument implies that the cause of Donald Trump's election is due to liberals' actions regarding political correctness.
    - This requires evaluating if the causal connection is compelling or substantive enough.

5. **Universality**:
    - The statement does not claim universal agreement but suggests a specific reason without providing direct proof or evidence.

6. **Ambiguity**:
    - The phrase "liberals took political correctness too far" could be somewhat subjective and open to interpretation, but it does not primarily fall within ambiguity of dual interpreting.

### Classification

Given the above analysis, we can assess that the string primarily attempts to establish a weak causal relationship:

- **Type Identification**: This example fits the type <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis) because it asserts a causal explanation for Donald Trump's election based on a specified action (liberals' political correctness), but the given reason may not be compelling or substantiated enough to fully support the proposition.

### Conclusion

By systematically breaking down and analyzing the string according to the specified steps:

- **Final Classification**: The statement “The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far” is best classified as <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis).
