For 
Let's apply the <IDAA> process step-by-step to classify the string provided:

\<s\>: "Speaker 1: We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change.
Speaker 2: Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."

### Step-by-Step Classification Using <IDAA>:

1. **Identify Statement Structure**:
   - The string consists of two parts: Speaker 1 presents an argument about using people to promote social change, and Speaker 2 responds with a personal reason for not participating.
   - The structure indicates two separate propositions connected by a cause-effect relationship implied by the response.

2. **Classify by Common Defective Types**:
   - **Check for <G>**:
     - Neither Speaker 1 nor Speaker 2 make broad generalizations based on specific instances. Both are discussing the specific context of their argument.
  
   - **Check for <FE>**:
     - The conversation does not list options or scenarios explicitly.

   - **Check for <WCB>**:
     - Neither speaker offers a weak causal basis. The first speaker describes an action plan, and the second speaker gives a reason for refusal.

   - **Check for <FU>**:
     - There is no assertion of universally agreed points without proof. Both statements are personal or specific to the situation.

   - **Check for <DEP>**:
     - There are no ambiguous phrases with dual meanings.

   - **Check for <RR>**:
     - Speaker 2's reason ("because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people") does not restate the initial proposition but instead introduces a new proposition.

   - **Check for <IR> (Irrelevant Reason)**:
     - **Examine**: 
       - Does Speaker 2's reason support the claim? 
       - The reason provided ("I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people") seems irrelevant to the primary goal stated by Speaker 1 about spreading the word about social injustice. Speaker 2 implies that using people is inherently wrong without addressing the aim of spreading social change.

Therefore, the string \<s\> is classified as:

**<IR> (Irrelevant Reason)**: "Speaker 1: We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change.
Speaker 2: Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."

The reason provided by Speaker 2 does not directly support or dispute the proposition made by Speaker 1; instead, it introduces an unrelated moral belief.
