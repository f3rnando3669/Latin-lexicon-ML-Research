### Step-by-Step Application of <IDAA> to "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way."

1. **Identify Clauses**:
   - Clause 1: "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act"
   - Clause 2: "because other people are acting in the same way"

2. **Determine Structure**:
   - The structure here is a statement of encouragement followed by a reasoning clause.
   - This suggests a possible structure of a <Reason> followed by a <Proposition>.

3. **Classify Clause 1 (Reason)**:
   - Clause 1 provides a form of encouragement: "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act"
   - While it's not a traditional <Reason> providing evidence, for the context of the argument, it serves as the motivational reasoning.

4. **Classify Clause 2 (Proposition)**:
   - Clause 2 provides the basis for the encouragement: "because other people are acting in the same way"
   - This can be interpreted as establishing a belief or a course of action based on what others are doing, which can be seen as a <Proposition>.

5. **Compare Meaning**:
   - Examine the relationship: Clause 1 provides an encouragement based on the action of others stated in Clause 2.
   - Clause 2 (the reason) is used to justify Clause 1 (the proposition).

6. **Match Type**:
   - The argument asserts that an action should be taken because it is popular or widely practiced.
   - This aligns with leveraging the appeal to popularity or the idea that many people doing something validates it.

7. **Assign Classification**:
   - Based on the analysis, this type of argument matches <FU> (False Universals), as it appeals to a widely accepted point (popularity) without actual proof.

### Conclusion
For the argument "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way," the classification is <FU> (False Universals).
