Alright, let's apply the IDAA methodology to classify the logical fallacy in the statement: "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick."

1. **Identify the Task (<IDA>):**
   We need to classify the statement as one of the defective argument types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

2. **Decompose the Task (<D>) into Specific Steps:**
   - Step 1: Analyze the Proposition (<P>).
   - Step 2: Analyze the Reason (<R>).
   - Step 3: Examine the structure to find where it fails (e.g., incomplete, inconclusive, repetitive, general, ambiguous, etc.).

3. **Apply the Decomposition to the Task (<IDAA>):**
   - Step 1: Analyze the Proposition (<P>):
     - The proposition here is "the water must have made me sick."
   
   - Step 2: Analyze the Reason (<R>):
     - The reason given is "I drank bottled water and now I am sick."

   - Step 3: Examine the Structure:
     - Let's see if the reason provided conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the proposition.
     - The reason implies a direct cause-and-effect relationship between drinking the bottled water and becoming sick, without considering other possible causes for the sickness.
     - This suggests a causal connection based solely on temporal succession (post hoc reasoning). 

4. **Classify the Fallacy:**
   - The fallacy lies in assuming that just because one event (drinking the bottled water) occurred before another event (getting sick), the first event caused the second.
   - This is a case of **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**, since the causal basis it submits (i.e., drinking bottled water) for the proposition (i.e., the water made me sick) is not compelling without ruling out other possible causes or providing stronger evidence for causation.

**Conclusion:**
The logical fallacy used in the statement "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick." is **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
