For 
To apply the IDAA (decomposition of the classification task) to the given string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you," we will take it step by step as follows:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The proposition in the string is "I’m not going to talk to you."

2.**Determine if the Reason (<R>) provided relates to the Proposition and is causal:**
   - The reason given is "My best friend says you’re a liar."

3. **Evaluate the correctness of the argument:**
   - Check if the Reason (<R>) conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the Proposition (<P>).
   - The Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition. Instead, it appeals to authority or opinion rather than providing solid evidence.

4. **Identify which defective argument type applies:**
   - Generalization (G) does not fit since it's not asserting a general principle based on insufficient sampling.
   - Incomplete Enumeration (FE) does not apply as it doesn't involve a missing enumeration of all alternatives.
   - Inconclusive Reason (IR) could be relevant if the reason provided does not conclusively support the proposition.
   - Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB) evaluates whether the cause-effect relationship is weak or not compelling, which isn't quite the issue here.
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR) does not apply as there's no repetition of the proposition.
   - Presumptuous Consensus (FU) isn't relevant here since it does not depend on the consensus being presumed as universally agreed.
   - Ambiguous Language Use (DEP) does not fit since the argument's language is not ambiguous.

Considering these points, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** is the appropriate classification because the reason "My best friend says you’re a liar" does not conclusively support the proposition "I’m not going to talk to you."

So, the classification of the string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you" would be:

**<IR> Inconclusive Reason**.
