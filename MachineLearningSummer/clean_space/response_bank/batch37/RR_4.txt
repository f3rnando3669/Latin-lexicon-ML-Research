For 
To apply \<IDAA\> (the decomposition of the classification task \<IDA\> into specific steps), we first need to break down the advanced task of classifying a defect in an argument into manageable, specific steps. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step approach to apply \(<IDAA>\) to the string "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there."

### Step-by-step Approach to <IDAA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Determine the main assertion or claim that is being made.
   - **Proposition Example:** "That restaurant is popular."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Identify the causal basis or reason given to support the Proposition.
   - **Reason Example:** "because everyone in town goes there."

3. **Classify the Defective Argument:**
   - Compare the identified Proposition and Reason against the definitions of defective argument types (\<G\>, \<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<RR\>, \<WCB\>, \<FU\>, \<DEP\>).
  
   - **Generalization (\<G\>):** The Proposition is based on a part or majority but not necessarily applicable to all. Is it a blanket statement about all 'everyone in town'?
     - **Analysis:** No specific evidence provided to suggest this applies universally to all individual cases, but looks more like an appeal to popularity.
  
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>):** Presents a false dichotomy, missing other possibilities.
     - **Analysis:** This example does not present a limited set of options.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>):** Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the Proposition.
     - **Analysis:** The reason provided might be weak but not necessarily inconclusive in this context since it seems more about conclusivity rather than a logical defect.

   - **Faulty Repetition (\<RR\>):** Reason repeats the Proposition.
     - **Analysis:** The Reason does not repeat the Proposition.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>):** Cause provided is weak and unproved.
     - **Analysis:** We might lean towards this, but the argument relies more on the appeal to consensus.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>):** Proposition backed by presumed universal agreement.
     - **Analysis:** The reasoning provided is "because everyone in town goes there," which directly appeals to the popularity or consensus fallacy.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>):** Reason is ambiguous and can be taken in another sense.
     - **Analysis:** The language is straightforward without significant ambiguity.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the step-by-step process, the defective argument in the string "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there" fits the definition of a **Presumptuous Consensus** (\<FU\>). This is because the argument assumes that the popularity of the restaurant is validated simply through the claim that "everyone in town goes there," leveraging the appeal to popularity or consensual validation.

**Classification:** <FU>
