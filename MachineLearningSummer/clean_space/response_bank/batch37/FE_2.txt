For 
To apply IDAA to classify the string "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights," we need to break down the task of identifying the argument type by systematically decomposing the process and then applying it. Here are the steps for IDAA:

### Decomposition of Task <IDA>:
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
    - Determine what the main assertion or claim is.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
    - Determine what the causal basis or rationale provided for the proposition is.
3. **Analyze the Defective Arguments**:
    - Compare the structure of <P> and <R> to the definitions of defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>) and identify the most fitting one.

### Steps for IDAA:
1. **Extract and Identify <P>**:
    - The proposition (main assertion) here is: "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."
  
2. **Extract and Identify <R>**:
    - The reason provided is not explicitly clear as an independent statement, but implied: a binary choice indicating a consequential relationship between supporting Hillary Clinton and believing in women's rights.

3. **Classify the Argument Type**:
   - Analyze and compare to defective argument types:

    - **Generalization (<G>)**: 
      - The proposition is not a generalization about a group but a binary choice claim.
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
      - The proposition presents an incomplete enumeration by offering a falsely limited set of choices; there may be other reasons to support or not support Hillary Clinton without necessarily linking to belief in women's rights.
    - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
      - The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the assertion, but it may fit elsewhere.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: 
      - The proposition does not have a causal reason; it's conditional.
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: 
      - The reasoning is not circular or repetitive.
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: 
      - The claim does not rely on popularity or presumed universal agreement.
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
      - The language in the proposition isn't ambiguous or open to multiple interpretations.

Based on the definitions, the most fitting defective argument type is **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**.

### Conclusion:
The classification of "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights." is **Incomplete Enumeration** (<FE>), because the argument presents a limited set of choices and disregards other possible scenarios or positions one might take.

### Summary of IDAA Application:
1. **<P>:** "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."
2. **<R>:** Implied binary relationship.
3. **Classified as <FE>:** The argument type is determined as Incomplete Enumeration because it forces a choice between two options, ignoring other possibilities.

Thus, according to the given definitions and the step-by-step analysis, the string is of type <FE>.
