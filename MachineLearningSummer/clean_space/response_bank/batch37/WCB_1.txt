For 
To apply the process of classifying the provided argument using <IDAA>, we need to decompose the advanced task of identifying the defective argument (<IDA>) into specific steps. Here's the step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
Determine what the argument aims to prove or assert.
- In this case, the proposition is: "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Identify the causal basis provided for supporting the proposition.
- Here, the reason suggested is: "liberals took political correctness too far."

### Step 3: Examine for Defective Argument Types
Check for each type of defective argument defined (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

#### Step 3.1: Generalization (<G>)
Is the argument based on an assertion about a part or majority without evidence that applies to all?
- This does not seem to fit the argument. There's no assertion applicable to every individual in a group.

#### Step 3.2: Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
Does the argument falsely claim a complete enumeration of possibilities?
- The argument does not present a false dichotomy or limited choices.

#### Step 3.3: Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
Does the reason fail to conclusively establish the truth of the proposition?
- The reason provided (liberals took political correctness too far) does not solidly establish the causal effect leading to Trump’s election, making it a potential candidate here.

#### Step 3.4: Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
Does the reason merely restate the proposition in another form?
- The reason does not simply restate the proposition; it offers a specific causal factor.

#### Step 3.5: Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
Is the causal basis weak or not compelling enough?
- The causal basis provided lacks compelling evidence and reasoning to prove the point conclusively, making it another candidate for this type.

#### Step 3.6: Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
Is the reason assumed as certain due to a claimed universal agreement?
- The argument doesn't explicitly rely on presumptuous consensus.

#### Step 3.7: Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)
Is there ambiguity in the language used?
- There does not appear to be ambiguous language in the argument.

### Step 4: Classify <s>
From the identified possible defective arguments, the argument could be classified under:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason given (liberals taking political correctness too far) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition that Trump's election was due to this factor.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis provided is weak and not compelling enough to establish the truth of the proposition that liberals' actions directly led to Trump’s election.

### Conclusion
Considering the analysis, the argument "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far." is best classified as:
- **<IR>: Inconclusive Reason**.
- **<WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis**.
