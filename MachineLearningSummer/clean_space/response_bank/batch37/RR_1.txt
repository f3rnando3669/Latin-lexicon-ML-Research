Sure, let's apply the process of decomposing the task of classifying the logical fallacy (IDAA) step by step to the given statement "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."

### Decomposition of the Task (D)

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>)

- **Proposition (<P>):** "Paranormal activity is real."
- **Reason (<R>):** "I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."

#### Step 2: Compare <R> with the types of defective arguments to identify potential fallacies

- **Generalization (G):** The statement does not attempt to generalize based on an insufficient sample group.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument does not involve an incomplete listing of possibilities.
  
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This is a logical reason type where <R> does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of <P>. The reason provided ("I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity") is anecdotal and does not conclusively prove that paranormal activity is real for all cases.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal connection in <R> is very weak. The experience described does not establish a necessary relationship to prove <P>.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason essentially repeats the proposition ("Paranormal activity" as described being equal to "paranormal activity"), making it appear as if they are different points when they are, in fact, the same.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The statement does not appeal to the fact that many people believe something.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language in the statement is clear; it doesn't appear to hold ambiguous terms that can be misinterpreted.

#### Step 3: Confirm the identification of defective argument type

The statementâ€™s primary issue lies in:

1. It uses the reason as an insufficient causal basis to establish the proposition.
2. It appears to repeat the proposition within the reasoning.

### Conclusion

Based on these steps, the statement "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity." can be classified into two defective argument types:

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

Hence, the logical fallacies present in the given statement are <RR> and <WCB>.
