For 
To apply IDAA to the statement "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding.", we'll break down the task (IDA - Identifying Defective Arguments) into specific steps (D), and apply each step sequentially:

1. **Extract the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The driver is implying that they were not speeding.
   - Proposition (<P>): "I wasn't speeding."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The driver provides the reason for their proposition.
   - Reason (<R>): "I was only driving as fast as everyone around me."

3. **Evaluate the Reason and Establish Defective Argument Type:**
   - Evaluate if the reason conclusively supports the proposition.
   - Identify if the argument falls into any specific type of defective argument.

Let's go through the categories to identify the specific type of defective argument:

### Categories of Defective Arguments:

- **Generalization (<G>):** This argument type applies if the driver assumes that because they were following the speed of the majority, this speed must be acceptable universally.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This would apply if the driver overlooked all possibilities of speeding.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** If the given reason does not conclusively demonstrate the truth of the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The reason given for the proposition is not compelling.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** When the reason is a restatement of the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** If the driver assumes that their action is correct because everyone else is doing it.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** If the proposition can be misunderstood because of ambiguous language.

### Applying Each Category:

- **Generalization (<G>):** This does not apply since the argument does not generalize about a group based on limited evidence.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This does not apply since the driver does not claim to consider all possible scenarios.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This applies here since the reason does not conclusively prove the proposition. Just because everyone else was driving at a certain speed does not mean the driver was not speeding.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This could also apply since following the crowd is not a strong basis for not being guilty of speeding.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This does not apply as the reason is not a direct repetition of the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This strongly applies because the driver assumes that driving at the speed of others implies compliance with legal speed limits, essentially appealing to a form of popular practice as justification.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** This does not apply as there is no ambiguity in the language used.

### Conclusion:
The statement "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding." most strongly fits the category of **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**. The driver presumes that because others are doing something, it must be acceptable, which is a logical fallacy.

Thus, the application of IDAA classifies the string as of type **<FU>**.
