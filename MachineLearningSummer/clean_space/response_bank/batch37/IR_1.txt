Performing the task of classifying the argument "Don't you want the best for your baby?" as a type of defective argument involves the following steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition (\<P\>):**
    - The statement implicitly asserts that you should take or endorse a certain action because it is in the best interest of your baby.

2. **Identify the Reason (\<R\>):**
    - The reason implied here is that taking or endorsing the action in question is the best for your baby.

3. **Look for potential Proof of Reason (\<PR\>):**
    - No additional proof is presented within the statement. It is more of a leading question designed to prompt agreement rather than provide explicit evidence or proof.

4. **Evaluate for Defective Argument Types (\<G\>, \<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<RR\>, \<WCB\>, \<FU\>, or \<DEP\>):**
    - Determine if any fallacies are present by analyzing the structure and content of the argument.

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Generalization (\<G\>):**
    - Check if it is making a broad, unsupported generalization. The statement does not make such a generalization about a group or category.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>):**
    - Analyze if it presents a false choice or a limited set of options. The statement does not explicitly present a set of options.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>):**
    - Decide if the reason does not conclusively support the proposition. Here, no explicit reason is provided, making it difficult to judge conclusive support.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>):**
    - Determine if the causal relationship presented is weak or unconvincing. No explicit causal relationship is stated.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>):**
    - Check if the statement merely repeats the proposition under the guise of a reason. This is not the case here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>):**
    - Evaluate if the argument relies on presumed universal agreement. The argument does not mention what others are doing or believing.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>):**
    - Identify if the statement uses ambiguous language that could be interpreted differently. The language here is straightforward and not ambiguous.

### Conclusion

Based on the steps and evaluation:
- The argument "Don't you want the best for your baby?" is a **loaded question** designed to lead the respondent to an answer, usually to prompt an emotional response without a rational basis. 

Given our provided definitions and classifications:
- The statement seems to fit best with the idea of an argument that prompts compliance based on presumed universality or emotional appeal—a potential case of **<FU>: Presumptuous Consensus**, though it’s more subtle and less direct than the examples provided. It implies that not wanting the best for your baby is unreasonable, relying on a widely accepted sentiment that all parents want the best for their children to avoid providing proper reasoning.

Therefore, despite the slightly tangential nature, applying <IDAA> to "Don't you want the best for your baby?" suggests it most closely aligns with **<FU>: Presumptuous Consensus**.
