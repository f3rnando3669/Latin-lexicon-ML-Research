For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types provided), we'll take the following steps:

1. **Identification:** Determine if the string contains an argument (proposition, reason, or proof of reason).
2. **Analysis:** Examine the argument for any logical fallacies or defective argument types.
3. **Classification:** Match the argument to one of the defined defective argument types, if applicable.

Let's proceed step by step with the given string:

### Step 1: Identification

The given string is a dialogue between two characters, Alice and the king, from "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" by Lewis Carroll.

```
"I see nobody on the road," said Alice.
"I only wish I had such eyes," the king remarked..."To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why it's as much as I can do to see real people, by this light."
```

This seems more like a play on words and not necessarily an argument with a proposition, reason, or proof of reason. However, let's assume there might be a rhetorical structure hidden within the dialogue.

### Step 2: Analysis

Examining the string:

- Alice makes a statement: "I see nobody on the road." (Proposition: <P>)
- The king's reply involves a misunderstanding or playful re-interpretation of Alice's words:
  - "I only wish I had such eyes," (Acknowledgement of ‘seeing nobody’ as being extraordinary)
  - "To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too!" (Implying the ability to see ‘Nobody’ as if 'Nobody' were a person)
  - "Why it's as much as I can do to see real people, by this light." (The king compares his difficulty seeing real people with Alice's ability to see ‘Nobody’.)

### Step 3: Classification

Now, let's classify the response according to the defective argument types:

- **Generalization (<G>):** This isn't making a broad assertion based on a limited set of examples.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The dialogue doesn't involve listing possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** There's no reason provided that fails to conclusively support a proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** There's no weak reason provided to support a proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** There's no repeating of the proposition as the reason.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** It isn't assuming a proof based on presumed consensus.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** This seems to be a likely candidate. The king is playing on the ambiguity of "seeing nobody" (interpreting it as seeing a person named Nobody rather than seeing no one) which fits the definition of DEP.

### Conclusion

Applying IDAA to the given string, we classify it as DEP (Ambiguous Language Use). The confusion arises from the ambiguous interpretation of "nobody" by the king, who jokes about the ability to see someone named "Nobody" rather than understanding Alice's meaning of not seeing any person.
