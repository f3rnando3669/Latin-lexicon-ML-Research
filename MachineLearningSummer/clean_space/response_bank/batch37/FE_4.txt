For 
To apply the process of decomposing and classifying a given string as a defective argument type, we can follow these steps: 

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>)
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine what the main assertion or claim is.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the causal basis or rationale provided to support the claim.
3. **Examine the Logical Connection**: Analyze the relationship between the <P> and the <R>.
4. **Identify Defective Argument Type (<IDA>)**: Classify the given string based on the identified defective argument types.

### Apply <IDAA> to the Given String
**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**

- The proposition in the string "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today." is an implied assertion that the person being addressed is not a good person.

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**

- The reason provided is "but you weren’t in class today." This implies that the person's absence from class is the basis for the assertion that they are not a good person.

**Step 3: Examine the Logical Connection**

- Evaluate whether being absent from class logically indicates that someone is not a good person. Here, there seems to be a weak or inconclusive connection.

**Step 4: Identify Defective Argument Type (<IDA>)**

- By examining the propositions and reasons and the type of logical connection (or lack thereof), we can identify the defect:

### Classification of Defective Argument Type

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning that someone is not a good person solely because they were not in class is inconclusive. The absence from class does not directly and conclusively demonstrate the moral character (goodness) of the person.

### Conclusion

"I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today." is classified as:
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)

This concludes the step-by-step application of <IDAA> to the given string. The classification correctly identifies the logical fallacy present in the argument.
