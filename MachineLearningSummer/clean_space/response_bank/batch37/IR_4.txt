For 
To classify the given string as one of the defective argument types using the procedure IDAA, we can decompose the task IDA into specific steps following the definition:

1. **Read and understand the argument**:
   - Initially, we need to thoroughly read and understand the argument provided in the string.

2. **Identify the nature of the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Determine what the main assertion or claim is in the argument. 
   - In this case, "<P>" could be "The argument for the existence of God often moves the goalposts as scientific understanding increases."

3. **Recognize the Reason (<R>) and Proof of Reason (<PR>) if present**:
   - Identify the causal basis presented to support the Proposition.
   - Here, the <R> seems to be that "As scientific explanations improve, the arguments for God's existence change."
   - <PR> might be "The transition from creationism to intelligent design and the shifting focus to the origin-of-life argument as scientific understanding evolves."

4. **Compare with definitions of defective argument types**:
   - Based on the provided classification:
     - <G>: Generalization
     - <FE>: Incomplete Enumeration
     - <IR>: Inconclusive Reason
     - <RR>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition
     - <WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis
     - <FU>: Presumptuous Consensus
     - <DEP>: Ambiguous Language Use
 
5. **Match the argument's flawed reasoning with defective types**:
   - Identify which specific defective argument type corresponds with the reasoning flaws found in the argument.
   - Here are the steps to apply:

  a. **Generalization**:
     - Is the argument making a broad claim based on a limited observation?
     - No clear indication of an over-generalized statement.

  b. **Incomplete Enumeration**:
     - Is the argument presenting limited options in an inclusive sense?
     - Not apparent here as the argument is discussing the evolution of reasoning, not an exhaustive set of options.

  c. **Inconclusive Reason**:
     - Does the Reason (R) fail to conclusively prove the Proposition (P)?
     - The Reason provided is not fully proving the Proposition definitively as it depends on future scientific findings.

  d. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition**:
     - Is the Reason just reiterating the Proposition without new substantiation?
     - The Reason does provide a basis, changing arguments with scientific progress, which isn’t mere repetition.

  e. **Insufficient Causal Basis**:
     - Does the argument present a weak causal link between Reason and Proposition?
     - The linkage between scientific progress and shifting arguments could be viewed as insufficiently compelling.

  f. **Presumptuous Consensus**:
     - Is the argument claiming universal agreement without substantiation?
     - The text itself notes the lack of academic sources. It cites the prevalence of this fallacy on the Internet which could be over-asserting the consensus.

  g. **Ambiguous Language Use**:
     - Are terms used in an unclear or misleading manner?
     - The argument doesn’t seem to rely on ambiguous terms.

6. **Classify the argument**:
   - After evaluating the argument and comparing it to the defective argument types, the most fitting type appears to be:
   
   **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**:
   - The argument suggests widespread agreement on this fallacy but provides no academic sources, hinting at an overestimation of consensus.

Thus, applying IDAA, the string can be classified as:

**<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**
