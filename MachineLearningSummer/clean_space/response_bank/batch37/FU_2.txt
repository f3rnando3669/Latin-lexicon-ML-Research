For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposition of the task of classifying the string into specific steps) to "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way," we need to go step by step in decomposing the classification task:

### Decomposition Steps (D):
1. **Understand the String (s)**: Break down the string to grasp its full meaning and implications.
2. **Identify Possible Defective Argument Types**: List types of defective arguments that could potentially apply to the string.
3. **Match Characteristics with Examples**: Compare the characteristics of each defective argument type with the given string.
4. **Determine Closest Match**: Choose the defective argument type that most accurately describes the sentiment and structure of the string.

### Step-by-Step Application (IDAA):

#### Step 1: Understand the String (s)
- **String (s)**: "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way."
- **Meaning**: This string suggests influencing an audience to join a group or engage in an action primarily because others are doing it.

#### Step 2: Identify Possible Defective Argument Types
- **Potential Defective Argument Types**:
  - **<G> (Generalization)**: Based on an assertion applicable to all.
  - **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: Claim of complete enumeration is missing possibilities.
  - **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: The reason is not conclusive for the proposition.
  - **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The reason provided is not compelling enough.
  - **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: Repetition of the proposition rather than a reason.
  - **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: Reason based on assumed universal agreement.
  - **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: Language used ambiguously leading to misinterpretation.

#### Step 3: Match Characteristics with Examples
- **Comparison**:
  - **<G>**: Not relevant, as it does not generalize specific behavior to all.
  - **<FE>**: Not relevant, as it does not claim completeness of enumeration.
  - **<IR>**: Not relevant, as it focuses on the reason for dismissal rather than appeal to action.
  - **<WCB>**: Not relevant, as there is no weak causal basis.
  - **<RR>**: Not relevant, as the reason isn't a repetition of the proposition.
  - **<FU>**: Relevant. The suggestion to join because others are joining reflects an assumed universal agreement or popularity.
  - **<DEP>**: Not relevant, as the language does not seem to hold ambiguous meanings.

#### Step 4: Determine Closest Match
- **Closest Match**: The string "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way" closely reflects the characteristics of <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus). The string implies that the action should be taken due to its popularity or the number of people engaging in it, assuming agreement or validation based on the collective behavior.

### Conclusion:
Applying IDAA to the given string, it is classified as **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**.
