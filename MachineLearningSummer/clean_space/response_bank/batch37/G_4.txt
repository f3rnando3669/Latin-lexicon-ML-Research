For 
Sure, let's apply <IDAA> to classify the given string "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess all the other classes will all fail it, too."

**Step-by-Step Decomposition**:

1. **Identify and understand the proposition <P> in the statement**: 
   - The proposition (the main assertion that is being argued) is that "all the other classes will fail the Jane Eyre quiz."

2. **Identify and understand the reason <R> given for the <P>**:
   - The reason provided for the proposition is that "three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz."
   
3. **Determine if the reason <R> logically supports the proposition <P>**:
   - Assess whether the failure of three kids in one class necessarily indicates that students in all other classes will fail as well.

4. **Check for the types of defective arguments**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: Does the argument make a broad claim based on limited information?
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Does the argument ignore other possible outcomes?
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Does the reason not conclusively support the proposition?
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Is the causal basis weak or unrelated?
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Is the reason essentially a restatement of the proposition?
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Does the argument rely on presumed universal agreement?
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Is there an ambiguous or misleading use of language?
   
**Classifying the Argument**:

- **Generalization (<G>) Analysis**: 
   - The proposition "all the other classes will fail the Jane Eyre quiz" is based on the performance of just "three kids in one class."
   - There is an unwarranted leap from a small sample size (three kids in one class) to a general application to all classes, ignoring variability among different students and classes.

Given that the argument is making a broad claim about the performance of all classes based on the result of a very small and non-representative sample, it fits the pattern of a **Generalization (G)**.

**Conclusion**: 
The defective argument type for the given string "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess all the other classes will all fail it, too." is **Generalization (G)**.
