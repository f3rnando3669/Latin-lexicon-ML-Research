Sure, let's apply the process defined as <IDAA> to classify the given string according to the defective argument types.

### Decomposition of the Task (<D>)
1. **Identify the argument structure**: Break the given dialogue into its arguments <P>, <R>, and <PR>.
2. **Analyze the Reason (<R>)**: Determine if the reason provided is conclusive or if it falls into any of the defective argument categories.
3. **Examine the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Check if the proof of the reason presented has any logical issues or defects based on the defined categories.
4. **Classify**: Based on the analysis, classify the argument into one of the defective argument types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

### Step by Step Application of <IDAA>

1. **Identify the argument structure**:
    - **Proposition (<P>)**: "Jesus was not really crucified."
    - **Reason (<R>)**: "Because the Quran says so."
    - **Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: "Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true."

2. **Analyze the Reason (<R>)**:
    - **Reason (<R>):** "Because the Quran says so."
      - This statement relies on the authority of the Quran, but the acceptance of the Quran itself as a reliable source is in question. Thus, this might be susceptible to certain logical flaws such as circular reasoning.

3. **Examine the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
    - **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** "Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true."
      - This statement relies on the premise that the Quran is the Word of God, which needs independent validation.
      - When asked for further justification, the response is: "Because God tells us so, here in the Quran." This returns to the initial reason, committing circular reasoning.

4. **Classify**:
    - Comparing the arguments to the definitions provided, the argument given by Speaker 1 appears to fit the category of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**. This is because the argument essentially says, "The Quran is true because it is the Word of God, and it says it is the Word of God."

### Conclusion:

The given argument "Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified.
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so.
Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct?
Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran." is classified as **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**. This is because the proof provided is not independent and simply reiterates the initial proposition without providing substantive, external justification.
