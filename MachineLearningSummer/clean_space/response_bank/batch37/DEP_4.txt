For 
Sure, let's apply the process of decomposition (<D>) to the task of classifying the string "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being.  Fetuses are innocent human  beings.  Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses." as one of the defective argument types (<IDA>).

**Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDAA>:**

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The <P> is a summary of what is intended to be proved. 
   - In this case, the proposition is: "It is immoral to kill fetuses."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The <R> provides the causal basis for the <P>.
   - Here, the reason is: "Fetuses are innocent human beings."

3. **Examine the logical structure of the overall argument:**
   - The argument can be rewritten as:
     1. Major Premise: "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being."
     2. Minor Premise: "Fetuses are innocent human beings."
     3. Conclusion (<P>): "Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."

4. **Determine if the Reason (<R>) is relevant and conclusive:**
   - We need to check if the reason strongly supports the proposition.
   - The reason "Fetuses are innocent human beings" appears logical in connection to the proposition "It is immoral to kill fetuses" since it aligns with the moral principle set forth in the major premise.

5. **Assess for any logical fallacies or defective argument types:**
   - Generalization (<G>): This doesn't appear to be a generalized statement based on a partial observation.
   - Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>): There is no presentation of limited choices here.
   - Inconclusive Reason (<IR>): The reason here aligns with widely accepted moral principles.
   - Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>): The causal basis (moral principle + definition of fetuses) appears sufficient.
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>): The reason isn't merely a restatement of the proposition.
   - Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>): There is no appeal to popularity or universal agreement.
   - Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>): The terms used aren’t ambiguous within the context given.

6. **Check for any specific argument forms:**
   - The argument is a syllogism with both premises aiming to lead logically to a conclusion.

Upon thorough examination, the argument doesn’t seem to fit into any of the listed defective argument types. The structure appears to be logical and valid, assuming one agrees with the moral premises. 

Therefore, the given argument does not fall under:

 - <G> (Generalization)
 - <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)
 - <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)
 - <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)
 - <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)
 - <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)
 - <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)

The argument seems to be logically valid under the assumption that all moral premises are accepted as true.
