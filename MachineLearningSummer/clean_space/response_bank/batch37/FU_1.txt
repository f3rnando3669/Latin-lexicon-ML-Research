For 
To classify the given string "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong" as one of the defective argument types, we will apply the task of IDAA, which involves decomposing the task IDA (the classification task) into specific steps (D). Here, we go step-by-step:

### Step-by-step Decomposition (D):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Determine the main assertion the argument is making.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Determine the causal basis or justification given for the assertion.

3. **Identify Proof of Reason (PR) (if present):**
   - Look for any additional arguments that corroborate the reason.

4. **Identify the nature of the Reason (R):**
   - Assess whether the reason provided is generalized, incomplete, inconclusive, insufficient, repetitious, based on presumed consensus, or ambiguous.

5. **Match with Defective Argument Types:**
   - Classify the argument as one of the defined defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) based on the nature of the Reason.

### Applying IDAA:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**
- The proposition in the string "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong" is:
  - "Get Verizon."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)**
- The reason given for the proposition is:
  - "1 billion people can't be wrong."

**Step 3: Identify Proof of Reason (PR) (if present)**
- There is no additional proof of the reason provided in this string.

**Step 4: Identify the nature of the Reason (R)**
- The reason is attempting to establish that because a large number of people (1 billion) use Verizon, it must be the right choice.

**Step 5: Match with Defective Argument Types**
- This reasoning appeals to the popularity or widespread acceptance of Verizon (implicitly stating it must be correct because many people use it).
- This is effectively assuming consensus or a majority opinion as a validation for the proposition.

### Classification
Based on the above steps, the reasoning fits the defective argument type:

- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):** The statement implies that because "1 billion people" use Verizon, it must be the correct choice, which assumes that the large number alone is a valid reason to agree without addressing any specific merits or details of why Verizon is a good choice.

Therefore, the defective argument type for the given string "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong" is **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**.
