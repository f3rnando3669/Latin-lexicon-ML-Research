For 
To apply <IDAA>, the application of task decomposition <D> to the task of identifying the type of defective argument <IDA>, we'll follow step-by-step analysis for "People either like coffee or hate it." Let's break it down:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
The proposition we are examining is "People either like coffee or hate it."

### Step 2: Examine for Generalization <G>
- **Criterion**: A generalization applies a characteristic of some or a majority to all.
- **Analysis**: Here, the statement does not generalize the characteristic of liking or hating coffee based on a limited observation but rather presents a binary division. Therefore, it does not fit the criteria for a generalization.

### Step 3: Examine for Incomplete Enumeration <FE>
- **Criterion**: This involves making an enumeration of possibilities but missing out on pertinent ones.
- **Analysis**: The statement presents only two possibilities (liking or hating coffee) and implies these are exhaustive, thereby excluding any middle ground, indifferent, or other opinions. This fits the definition of an incomplete enumeration because it does not account for other possibilities like being indifferent to coffee.
- **Conclusion**: **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>**

### Step 4: Examine for Inconclusive Reason <IR>
- **Criterion**: This involves an <R> that does not conclusively prove the <P>.
- **Analysis**: There is no reason presented here, just a proposition, so this fallacy isn’t applicable.

### Step 5: Examine for Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>
- **Criterion**: This occurs when the <R> is weak or not compelling for the <P>.
- **Analysis**: No causal basis or reason is provided in the statement, so this fallacy isn’t applicable.

### Step 6: Examine for Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>
- **Criterion**: This happens when the proposition is repeated as the reason.
- **Analysis**: Again, no reason is provided, just the proposition, so this fallacy isn’t applicable.

### Step 7: Examine for Presumptuous Consensus <FU>
- **Criterion**: Assuming something as true because it is "universally agreed upon".
- **Analysis**: The statement does not attempt to assert consensus or appeal to popularity. It simply makes a binary claim. Therefore, this fallacy isn’t applicable.

### Step 8: Examine for Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>
- **Criterion**: Use of ambiguous language that can be interpreted differently than intended.
- **Analysis**: There is no ambiguous language that changes the meaning of the statement unexpectedly. Therefore, this fallacy isn’t applicable.

### Conclusion
Based on the decomposition of the task <t> into specific steps, the defective argument type (one of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>) that "People either like coffee or hate it" most closely aligns with is **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>**. 

The reasoning is that the statement presents a false dichotomy, missing out on other pertinent possibilities such as being indifferent.
