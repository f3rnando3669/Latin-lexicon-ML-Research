For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a defective argument) to the statement "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people.", we will follow these specific steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
Examine the statement to determine what is being asserted or intended to be proven.

**Proposition (<P>):** "We need to fix our broken judicial system."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Determine the causal basis that is provided to establish the <P>.

**Reason (<R>):** "by electing new people."

### Step 3: Analyze the Fit of the Reason with the Proposition
Evaluate whether the Reason provided conclusively supports or establishes the truth of the Proposition.

### Step 4: Classify Potential Defective Argument Type
Compare the relationship between the <P> and <R> against definitions of defective arguments:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: Assertion based on a part or majority but applied to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Missing pertinent possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Weak causal basis for the proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Reason says the same as the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Assumes universal agreement on a disputed proposition.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Ambiguous terms misinterpreted.

### Step 5: Determine the Defective Argument Type
Based on the classification criteria, determine the most fitting defective argument type.

From the provided options:

- **Generalization (<G>)** does not quite fit as this is not an assertion based on a majority incorrectly applied to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** could fit if we argue that it misses other options besides electing new people; however, it is not made clear this is an explicit enumeration failure.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** are strong candidates since the reasoning provided ("by electing new people") doesn't sufficiently support the claim that this action alone will "fix our broken judicial system."

After examination:
**The most fitting classification appears to be Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), as the reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate that electing new people will necessarily fix the judicial system.**

### Conclusion
Apply IDAA:

"We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people."
**This logical fallacy is called: Inconclusive Reason (<IR>).**
