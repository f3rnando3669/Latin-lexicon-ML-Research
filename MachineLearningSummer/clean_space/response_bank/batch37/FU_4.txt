For 
To apply the process of \(<IDAA>\) to the statement "Everyone else is doing it, so should you," we must decompose the task of classifying the string into specific steps. Here is the step-by-step process of decomposition (\(<D>\)) and its application.

### Step-by-step Decomposition (\(<D>\)):
1. **Identify the Proposition (\(<P>\))**: Determine what is being asserted or suggested in the statement.
2. **Identify the Reason (\(<R>\))**: Determine the causal basis or rationale supporting the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\(<PR>\))**: Determine if there is any additional argument provided to corroborate the reason.
4. **Compare with Defective Argument Types**: Evaluate whether the identified components (\(<P>\), \(<R>\), and \(<PR>\)) fit any of the defective argument types \((<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>)\).

### Apply \(<IDAA>\) to "Everyone else is doing it, so should you":

1. **Identify the Proposition (\(<P>\))**:
   - The proposition here is "You should do it."

2. **Identify the Reason (\(<R>\))**:
   - The reason provided is "Everyone else is doing it."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\(<PR>\))**:
   - In this statement, there is no additional argument provided to support the reason, so the proof of reason is absent or implied.

4. **Compare with Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization \((<G>)\)**: Not applicable here, as it's not stating a proposition based on part of the whole, but on the behavior of "everyone."
   - **Incomplete Enumeration \((<FE>)\)**: Not applicable here, as it is not about missing options.
   - **Inconclusive Reason \((<IR>)\)**: Not directly applicable here, though the reason might be seen as weak, it is not entirely inconclusive.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis \((<WCB>)\)**: Could be seen as insufficient, but the primary issue here is the nature of the consensus.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition \((<RR>)\)**: Not applicable here, as there's a clear difference between the proposition and reason.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus \((<FU>)\)**: This fits well as it assumes that because "everyone else is doing it," it must be the right or valid action, without any further validation.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use \((<DEP>)\)**: Not applicable here, as there's no ambiguous language involved.

### Conclusion:
The statement "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" is best classified as a defective argument type \((<FU>)\) â€“ **Presumptuous Consensus**. The reason provided relies on presumed universal agreement or popularity to validate the proposition.
