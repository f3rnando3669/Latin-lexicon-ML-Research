For 
Applying <IDAA> (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a string as falling under one of the defective argument types), we will break down the classification task for the string "Farmer McDonald: Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain. I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature." step by step.

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - "Farmer McDonald: Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain."
   - Proposition: The construction of the new power plant has caused a lack of rain.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason: The construction of the new power plant across the river is implied to be the cause of the lack of rain.
   
3. **Evaluate the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine if the Reason provided adequately supports the Proposition.
   - In this case, the reason "Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain." asserts causality between two events with no substantial proof.

4. **Check for Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** Is it asserting something about all events based on one instance? No, itâ€™s tying one specific event to another without broad generalization.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Is it claiming a complete set of options have been considered (missing some)? No, it does not enumerate possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Does the reason not conclusively support the proposition? Yes, it does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Is the causal basis not compelling or sufficient? Yes, there is no substantial evidence showing that the power plant caused the lack of rain.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Is the reason simply repeating the proposition in different words? No, the reason is not a repetition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Is the proof assumed to be certain due to universal agreement? No, it does not appeal to a consensus.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Is the language ambiguous? No, there is no ambiguity in language.

5. **Classify the String:**
   - The defective argument types that apply are: Inconclusive Reason (<IR>) and Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).
   - This is because the Reason fails to conclusively demonstrate a direct causality and provides a weak, non-compelling basis for the Proposition.

**Conclusion:**
The argument provided by Farmer McDonald is an example of both an Inconclusive Reason (<IR>) and Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).
