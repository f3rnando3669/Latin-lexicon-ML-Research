For 
To apply the task of classification (IDA) to the given string "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!", we will decompose the advanced task (t) into specific steps (D) and then apply those steps to the classification task.

### Decomposition (D)
1. **Identify Proposition (P)**: Determine the assertion or main claim made in the string.
2. **Identify Reason (R)**: Determine the causal basis or rationale provided for the proposition.
3. **Detect Defective Argument Type**: Compare the identified parts against the definitions of defective argument types to classify the string as one of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Application (IDAA)

#### Step 1: Identify Proposition (P)

**Proposition (P)**: "my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!"

#### Step 2: Identify Reason (R)

**Reason (R)**: "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up."

#### Step 3: Detect Defective Argument Type

1. **Generalization (G)**: Does the Proposition make a broad assertion about all members based on one or a few instances?
    - Yes, the Proposition asserts that the 102-year-old neighbor is guilty based on a generalization regarding the Catholic Church.
  
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Is the Proposition making a claim of complete possibilities but missing some options?
    - No, this doesn't apply here.
  
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Does the Reason fail to demonstrate conclusively the correctness of the Proposition?
    - The Reason given is about the broader Catholic Church while the Proposition is about an individual, making the Reason inconclusive for this specific case.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Does the Reason provide a weak causal basis for the Proposition?
    - The causal basis is weak because the involvement of the Church as an institution in a scandal does not imply individual guilt.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Is the Reason simply a restatement of the Proposition?
    - No, the Reason is not a restatement.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Is the Reason assumed as correct based on presumed universal agreement?
    - No, this doesn’t apply here.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Does the Reason or Proposition contain language that can be interpreted in another unintended way?
    - No, this doesn’t apply here.

### Conclusion

The given string, "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!" is best classified under **Generalization (G)** because it takes an assertion about one part (the Catholic Church's involvement in a scandal) and incorrectly applies it to all individuals associated with the Church (the neighbor).
