For 
Sure, let's apply the decomposed steps of <IDAA> to classify the argument presented:

---

1. **Identify the Claim:**

   - Speaker 1: "We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change."
   - Speaker 2: "Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."

2. **Analyze the Structure:**

   - Speaker 1 is making a claim about using people to spread awareness about social injustice.
   - Speaker 2 is refusing to participate based on a moral teaching they claim to follow.

3. **Check for Generalization (<G>):**
   - Speaker 2's argument ("I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people") hints at a general principle but isn't making a general claim about all instances of using people.

4. **Check for False Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - This argument doesn't seem to list options. It focuses on whether the practice of "using people" is acceptable or not.

5. **Check for Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):**
   - This is a likely candidate. The argument against participating leans on a moral lesson ("it’s wrong to use people") which doesn't directly address the practicality or intention behind the action described by Speaker 1 (raising awareness about social injustice). The moral lesson doesn’t seem particularly tuned to the specific nature of the door-to-door activity which aims to promote a social cause, thus, it appears somewhat misaligned.

6. **Check for Redundant Reason (<RR>):**
   - This argument doesn't simply restate the claim in different words. It presents a different rationale (moral teaching) for refusing participation, so it's not redundant.

7. **Check for Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - There isn't a direct causal argument presented here. It's more of a moral objection rather than a cause-effect relationship.

8. **Check for False Universals (<FU>):**
   - Speaker 2 refers to a personal teaching but doesn’t claim a universal truth agreed upon by everyone, despite implying a broad principle.

9. **Check for Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):**
   - It's not ambiguous or open to dual interpretations that would work against Speaker 2's position.

10. **Classify the Argument:**
    - Given the considerations, the most fitting classification is **<IR>**. Speaker 2's refusal based on a generalized moral lesson does not directly address or logically support the specific context and proposition (spreading the word about social injustice).

---

**Conclusion:**
The argument type for the provided string is best classified as **<IR>** (Inappropriate Reason).
