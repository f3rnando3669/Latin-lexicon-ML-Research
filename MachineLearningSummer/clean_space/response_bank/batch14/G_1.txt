For 
Sure, let's apply the decomposition of <IDA> into specific steps (as in <IDAA>) to classify the given argument:

"I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!"

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Premise and Conclusion**:
    - **Premise**: "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up."
    - **Conclusion**: "Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!"

2. **Analyze Specificity vs. Generality**:
    - The argument is making a claim about a specific individual based on an instance involving a broader group.

3. **Examine Enumeration**:
    - The argument is not listing options, so this step isn't applicable here.

4. **Assess the Relevance of the Reason**:
    - The reason (premise about the Catholic Church) does not logically support the conclusion that an individual member (the neighbor) is guilty.

5. **Check for Redundancy in Reasoning**:
    - The conclusion is not merely a rephrased version of the premise, so redundancy isn't the issue here.

6. **Evaluate Causal Basis**:
    - The argument does not provide a causal link; it's more about guilt by association with the group.

7. **Identify Universal Claims without Proof**:
    - The argument does not make a universal claim without proof; rather, it generalizes guilt from a group to an individual.

8. **Detect Dual Interpretations**:
    - There aren't dual interpretations in this statement. The argument's meaning is straightforward.

### Classification:

Given the above analysis, where the argument draws a specific inference about an individual (the neighbor) based on an incident involving the broader group (the Catholic Church), it can be classified as a **Generalization**.

Thus, the argument in the string "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!" is of type **<G>**.
