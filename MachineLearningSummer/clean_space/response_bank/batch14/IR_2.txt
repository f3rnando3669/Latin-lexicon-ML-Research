Applying the structured decomposition approach to classify the argument in the string "In the race for mayor, Lara says a vote for her opponent will lead to you losing your job.", we can proceed as follows:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of the Task (<IDAA>)

1. **Input String**
   - "In the race for mayor, Lara says a vote for her opponent will lead to you losing your job."

2. **Step 1: Parse the Argument**
   - Extract the core statement or proposition: "A vote for Lara’s opponent will lead to you losing your job."

3. **Step 2: Identify the Logical Structure**
   - This argument structure presents an either-or situation, suggesting a significant negative consequence if a specific choice is not made.

4. **Step 3: Match to Defective Argument Types**
   - Compare the logical structure and content against the definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>. This structure appears to fit <FE> (False Enumeration), as it is presenting a limited set of options with exaggerated consequences.

5. **Step 4: Evaluate Specific Characteristics**
   - Analyze if it is listing fewer or more options than actually exist:
      - The argument limits choices to either voting for Lara or losing your job, without considering other factors or options that might exist.

6. **Step 5: Classify the Argument**
   - Based on the evaluation, classify the argument as <FE> (False Enumeration).

7. **Step 6: Justify the Classification**
   - Reasoning: The statement "A vote for Lara’s opponent will lead to you losing your job" falsely limits the options available to the voter in a way that exaggerates the negative consequences of not choosing Lara, akin to presenting a false dichotomy.

### Example Output

```plaintext
Classification: <FE> (False Enumeration)
Justification: The statement "A vote for Lara’s opponent will lead to you losing your job" falsely limits the options available to the voter in a way that exaggerates the negative consequences of not choosing Lara, akin to presenting a false dichotomy.
```

This approach illustrates how the argument fits the category of <FE> (False Enumeration) by unjustifiably simplifying the options to drive a particular conclusion.
