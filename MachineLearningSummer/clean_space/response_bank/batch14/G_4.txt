For 
To apply **<IDAA>** to the string "**Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess, all the other classes will all fail it, too.**", we will follow the decomposed steps:

### 1. Understanding Definitions:
We need to understand the definitions of each defective argument type: **<G>**, **<FE>**, **<IR>**, **<RR>**, **<WCB>**, **<FU>**, and **<DEP>**.

### 2. Parse the String:
We break down the string to understand its components:
- **Precondition**: "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz"
- **Conclusion/Generalization**: "all the other classes will all fail it, too."

### 3. Initial Identification:
Identify any immediate clues or keywords that might hint at a particular argument type:
- The phrase "Three kids in one class" represents a specific instance.
- The phrase "all the other classes will all fail it, too" represents a broad generalization.

### 4. Categorization by Type:
We compare the string against each typeâ€™s criteria incrementally to find the best fit:
- **Generalization (G)**: This seems to be making a broad claim based on a specific instance (three kids in one class failing). This is indicative of a **Generalization**.
- **False Enumeration (FE)**: This string does not list options.
- **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**: The provided reason is about failure in one class and doesn't logically support the broad conclusion, but this is less prominent.
- **Redundant Reason (RR)**: The reason and the conclusion are not restatements of each other.
- **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is no cause-and-effect link suggested here.
- **False Universals (FU)**: It asserts a prediction based on a single example but does not appeal to universally agreed points.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**: The statement does not seem to have dual interpretations.

### 5. Verification:
Reevaluate the notion that a specific instance (three kids failing in one class) being used to generalize all other classes will fail too fits the criteria for **Generalization (G)**.

### 6. Output Classification:
Based on the above steps, the string "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess, all the other classes will all fail it, too." is best classified as **<G>**.

Therefore, the classification of the string is **<G>** (Generalization).
