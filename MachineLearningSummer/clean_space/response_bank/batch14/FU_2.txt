### Applying <IDAA> to "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way."

Steps for <IDAA>:

1. **Identify the Core Proposition**:
   - Core Proposition: "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act."
2. **Determine the Reasoning or Evidence**:
   - Reasoning: "Because other people are acting in the same way."
3. **Match to Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: Does it claim a general truth based on a specific instance? (No)
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Does it list fewer or more options than reality presents? (No)
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Is the given reason unrelated or irrelevant to the proposition? (No)
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Is the reason simply rephrasing the proposition in different words? (No)
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Is there a weak or implausible causal relationship? (No)
   - **False Universals (<FU>)**: Does it assert universal agreement or appeal to popularity without proof? (Yes)
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Is the statement open to dual interpretations that could undermine the speaker? (No)

4. **Classify**: Based on the identified reasoning, the string "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way" matches with <FU> (False Universals), since it appeals to popularity as a form of validation without substantive evidence.

Therefore, the classification for the provided string is **<FU>**.
