For 
To apply the defined process of <IDAA> to the argument "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong," we will follow the decomposition steps thoroughly to classify it under the appropriate defective argument type.

### Step-by-Step Application of <IDAA>

**Step 1:** Identify the Proposition and Reasoning
- **Proposition:** You should get Verizon.
- **Reasoning:** 1 billion people can't be wrong.

**Step 2:** Analyze Against Each Defective Argument Type

1. **Check if the string fits the <G> definition (Generalization)**
   - Does it claim a general truth based on a specific instance?
   - **Analysis:** No, it doesn't make a general claim based on a specific instance. It's making an appeal based on the number of users.

2. **Check if the string fits the <FE> definition (False Enumeration)**
   - Does it list fewer or more options than actually exist?
   - **Analysis:** No, it doesn't seem to be about enumeration of choices.

3. **Check if the string fits the <IR> definition (Inappropriate Reason)**
   - Does it provide a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition?
   - **Analysis:** No, the reason given (large number of users) does provide some support, although it might not be logical.

4. **Check if the string fits the <RR> definition (Redundant Reason)**
   - Does it say the same thing as the proposition but in different words?
   - **Analysis:** No, it is not redundant. It provides new information (the number of users) in support.

5. **Check if the string fits the <WCB> definition (Weak Causal Basis)**
   - Does it offer a causal basis that is not compelling enough?
   - **Analysis:** No, this is more about an appeal to popularity than a weak causal basis.

6. **Check if the string fits the <FU> definition (False Universals)**
   - Does it assert universally agreed points without proof?
   - **Analysis:** Yes, it asserts that because 1 billion people use Verizon, it must be the right choice for everyone. This is an appeal to popularity without direct proof that it’s the best choice for you specifically.

7. **Check if the string fits the <DEP> definition (Double-Edged Phrases)**
   - Does it use statements open to dual interpretations?
   - **Analysis:** No, the statement isn't open to dual interpretations; it makes a straightforward appeal to popularity.

**Step 3:** Classify the String
- Based on the analysis, the most fitting defective argument type is **<FU> (False Universals)**.

**Step 4:** Document and Validate
- **Classification:** <FU>
- **Reasoning:** The argument "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong" is an appeal to popularity, which asserts a universally agreed point without proof. It implies that because many people use Verizon, it must be the right choice, without providing concrete evidence for why it would be the best choice for any individual.

**Validation:**
- This example fits the definition of <FU> wherein it appeals to a large number of users as validation, without proving why Verizon is inherently better for everyone in every context.
- Similar cases would include statements like "Join Facebook—everyone is on it" which also appeals to popularity to validate the proposition without substantive proof.

Therefore, the argument "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong" is classified as **<FU> (False Universals)** according to our defined process.
