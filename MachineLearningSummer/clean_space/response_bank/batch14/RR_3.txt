For 
Applying the decomposition (IDAA) to classify the given conversation as one of the defective argument types, we will follow the structured steps outlined earlier:

**Given string <s>:** 
"Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified.
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so.
Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct?
Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran."

**Applying IDAA:**

1. **Step 1:** Identify specific keywords or phrases:
   - "Jesus was not really crucified."
   - "Because the Quran says so."
   - "Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true."
   - "Because God tells us so, here in the Koran."

2. **Step 2:** Match the identified keywords or phrases to the definitions of the defective argument types:
   - The argument hinges on the assertion that something is true because it says so in the Quran.
   - This is a form of circular reasoning where the truth of the statement is supported by the same statement without additional evidence.

3. **Step 3:** Evaluate the context and structure:
   - The context involves a claim about a historical event (Jesus's crucifixion) and the justification purely within the religious text (the Quran) without external validation.
   - The repeated justification "because the Quran says so" and "because God tells us so in the Quran" does not provide independent support and circles back to the initial assertion.

4. **Step 4:** Classify:
   - This is an example of **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**, where the reason given (the Quran says so) is essentially the same as the proposition in other words without providing external validation. It might also blend with elements of **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)** if we consider the lack of logical support, but mainly it fits the redundancy pattern.

**Classification:** The given conversation is classified as **Redundant Reason (<RR>)** due to its circular and self-referential reasoning.
