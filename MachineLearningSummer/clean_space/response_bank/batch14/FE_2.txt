For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the classification task <IDA>) to the string "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights," we will follow these decomposition steps (<D>):

### Decomposition Steps (<D>):
1. **Identify the Argument Type**:
   - Review the definition of each defective argument type.
   - Match the given string to the type definitions.

2. **Analyze String <s>**:
   - Inspect "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."
   - Compare the structure to definitions:
     - **<G>**: Does it generalize from a specific instance?
     - **<FE>**: Does it present an incorrect enumeration of options?
     - **<IR>**: Does it provide an irrelevant reason?
     - **<RR>**: Does it redundantly restate an argument?
     - **<WCB>**: Does it use a weak causal basis?
     - **<FU>**: Does it assert a universally agreed-upon point without proof?
     - **<DEP>**: Is it open to dual interpretations against the speaker?

3. **Determine Classification**:
   - The statement "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" presents a false dilemma by providing only two options when in fact more options might exist (e.g., one might believe in women's rights but prefer a different candidate).
   - This fits the definition of **<FE>** (False Enumeration), as it lists fewer options than actually exist.

### Analysis:
- **<FE> (False Enumeration)**: "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" creates a false enumeration by only presenting two choices.
  
**Classification**: **<FE>** (False Enumeration)

By following these steps, we applied <D> (Decomposition) to <IDA> (Classification), resulting in our process of **<IDAA>**. Therefore, the classification of the given string is **<FE>**.
