For 
Let's apply the steps delineated in the decomposition of the task (IDAA) to the provided string "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Classification:

1. **Read and Understand the Argument:**
   - The argument states that killing an innocent human being is immoral, and fetuses are classified as innocent human beings. Therefore, it concludes that it is immoral to kill fetuses.

2. **Identify the Core Proposition:**
   - The core proposition is that killing fetuses is immoral.

3. **Check for Generalization (<G>):**
   - This argument does not appear to be claiming a general truth based on a specific instance. It relies on definitions and a principle.

4. **Check for False Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - There is no listing of limited options or exclusion of other possibilities in this argument.

5. **Check for Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):**
   - The reason provided (killing an innocent human being is immoral) seems logically related to the proposition, assuming agreement with the definitions.

6. **Check for Redundant Reason (<RR>):**
   - The argument does not repeat the proposition in different words. It builds upon the initial claim logically.

7. **Check for Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - There is no causal claim being made that lacks compelling evidence; rather, it's an ethical argument structured on definitions and moral principles.

8. **Check for False Universals (<FU>):**
   - The argument does involve a generally accepted moral principle ("it is immoral to kill an innocent human being"), but it does not assert this point universally without proof within the context of an ethical argument.

9. **Check for Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):**
   - The statement is not ambiguous or open to dual interpretation that could potentially work against the speaker. It’s clear in its definitions and steps.

10. **Classify the Argument:**
    - Most pertinent to the argument appears to be the classification of <IR> (Inappropriate Reason). While at first glance, it aligns logically, one might argue that equating fetuses with innocent human beings could be contextually controversial and may not fully support the proposition to everyone’s agreement logically.

11. **Justify the Classification:**
    - Classifying the argument as <IR> stems from the potential controversy in the foundational assertion that "fetuses are innocent human beings." This premise might not be universally accepted and can shift the logical foundation of the moral argument depending on differing definitions and perspectives on what constitutes a human being and innocence in the context of abortion ethics.

### Conclusion:
Based on the systematic decomposition using IDAA, we classify the argument as <IR> (Inappropriate Reason) because the premise that fetuses are innocent human beings may not be uniformly accepted and thus may not constitute a logically sound reason to everyone when supporting the proposition that killing fetuses is immoral.
