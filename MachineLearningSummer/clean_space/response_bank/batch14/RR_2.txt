For 
Applying the process \( IDAA \) to classify the given string \( s \):

### Given \( s \)
"We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (\( D \))

#### Step 1: Identify the Argument Type
- **Read and Comprehend**: Understand the proposition that is being made, which suggests that electing new people will fix the broken judicial system.

#### Step 2: Mapping Against Definitions
- **Identify Indicators**: The key statement here is the suggested solution to fix the judicial system by electing new people.
- **Match with Definition**:
  - Check if it’s a **Generalization (\<G\>)**: No, it’s not a sweeping generalization from a specific instance.
  - Check if it’s a **False Enumeration (\<FE\>)**: No, it does not list fewer or more options than actually exist.
  - Check if it’s an **Inappropriate Reason (\<IR\>)**: This might be a better fit, as the solution of electing new people does not logically connect directly to fixing the judicial system without further explanation.
  - Check if it’s a **Redundant Reason (\<RR\>)**: No, it doesn’t restate the proposition in other words.
  - Check if it’s a **Weak Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**: Yes, it provides a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
  - Check if it’s a **False Universals (\<FU\>)**: No, it doesn’t resort to universally agreed points without proof.
  - Check if it’s a **Double-Edged Phrases (\<DEP\>)**: No, it doesn’t use statements open to dual interpretations.

#### Step 3: Classify
- **Assign a Type**: Based on the analysis, the argument type fits as Weak Causal Basis (\<WCB\>).

### Classification Result

"We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people."
- **This logical fallacy is called**: Weak Causal Basis (\<WCB\>).

Therefore, applying \( IDAA \) to the statement correctly identifies it as a flawed argument due to the weak causal link established between electing new people and fixing the judicial system.
