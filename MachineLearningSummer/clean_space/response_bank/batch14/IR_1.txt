### Applying <IDAA> to "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you":

To classify the given string as one of the defective argument types, we will decompose the task using the defined steps.

#### Decomposition <D> for Task <IDA>:

1. **Step 1**: Identify the main proposition in the string.
2. **Step 2**: Identify any supporting assertions or reasons provided for the proposition.
3. **Step 3**: Check if the support logically follows the proposition.
4. **Step 4**: Match the pattern of the argument to one of the known defective types.
5. **Step 5**: Confirm the identified type by re-evaluating the argument.

### Applying the Decomposition Steps:

**String <s>**: "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you."

1. **Step 1**: Identify the main proposition in <s>.
   - Main proposition: "I’m not going to talk to you."

2. **Step 2**: Identify any supporting assertions or reasons provided for the proposition.
   - Supporting assertion: "My best friend says you’re a liar."

3. **Step 3**: Check if the support logically follows the proposition.
   - Analysis: The argument is essentially stating that because the best friend believes the person is a liar, the speaker has decided not to engage in communication. This does not provide a logical reason for believing the friend’s claim is true or for the action taken (not talking to the person).

4. **Step 4**: Match the pattern of the argument to one of the known defective types.
   - The support here is an appeal to authority – "My best friend says" – but it doesn’t logically follow that the person is indeed a liar or that this justifies cutting off communication without further evidence. The argument relies on an external (and possibly biased) opinion rather than objective reasoning.

5. **Step 5**: Confirm the identified type by re-evaluating the argument.
   - Re-evaluation: The argument does not provide a logical connection between the friend’s assertion and the speaker’s decision. The implication here is that the speaker should not talk to the person because the friend's statement is taken as sufficient justification, which doesn’t logically support the conclusion.

### Conclusion:
The defective argument type represented by the string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you." is best classified under **<IR>** (Inappropriate Reason).

- **Type <IR>**: The reason given ("My best friend says you’re a liar") does not logically support the main proposition ("I’m not going to talk to you"). It relies on an assertion from an authority (the best friend) rather than directly addressing the truth or falsity of the claim or why that justifies the action of not talking to the person.

Thus, by applying the decomposition of steps to the task of identifying defective argument types, we have classified the given argument as **<IR>**.
