For 
To apply **IDAA** (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types) to the string "Everyone else is doing it, so should you", we will follow each of the steps outlined in the IDAA framework.

### Step-by-Step Classification:

1. **Identify and Understand the Argument:**
   - **Given String:** "Everyone else is doing it, so should you."
   - **Main Proposition:** You should also do it.
   - **Reason Provided:** Everyone else is doing it.

2. **Categorize the Type of Defect:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** Is this claiming a general truth from a specific instance? No, it is not making a claim about all instances based on one instance.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Is it listing fewer or more options than actually exist? No, it doesn't present multiple options at all.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Is the reason provided logically supporting the proposition? The reason provided is "everyone else is doing it". Whether that logically supports the proposition depends on whether popularity is a valid reason for action.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Is it just restating the proposition in different words? No, it provides a reason, albeit potentially a weak one.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Is the causal basis compelling? The reasoning is based on what others are doing rather than a strong causal link.
   - **False Universals (<FU>):** Does it assert universally agreed points without proof? Yes, it appeals to popularity or the actions of others as a form of validation.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Is the statement open to dual interpretations that may work against the speaker? No, the statement is quite straightforward.

3. **Match with Definitions:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** Does not fit.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Does not fit.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Partly fits, but is not purely illogical.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Does not fit.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Somewhat fits but more related to popularity.
   - **False Universals (<FU>):** Fits well as it appeals to the popularity and actions of others without substantive proof or reasoning.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Does not fit.

4. **Validate and Finalize:**
   - Since the string appeals to the fact that many people are doing something as validation without providing a substantive reason, it matches **<FU>** (False Universals).

### Conclusion:
The string "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" represents the **False Universals (FU)** defective argument type.
