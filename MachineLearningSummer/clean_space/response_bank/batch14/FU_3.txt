For 
Let's apply the IDAA process to the given statement: "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDA (IDAA):

#### 1. **Extract Argument:**
   - **Core Claim:** "I'm sure I wasn't speeding."
   - **Supporting Premises:** "I was only driving as fast as everyone around me."

#### 2. **Keyword and Phrase Identification:**
   - **Keywords/Phrases:** "only driving as fast as everyone around me."

#### 3. **Match to Fallacy Types:**
   - **Generalization (G):** Does not appear to be making a sweeping generalization.
   - **False Enumeration (FE):** No enumeration of options presented.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (IR):** The reasoning provided isn't completely irrelevant but more needs to be checked.
   - **Redundant Reason (RR):** The proposition isn't restating itself in different words.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (WCB):** Not dealing with causality.
   - **False Universals (FU):** The statement "as everyone around me" suggests an appeal to common practice or universality without any proof or relevance to the legality of the action.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP):** No dual interpretations are present.

#### 4. **Explain Classification:**

The claim "I'm sure I wasn't speeding" is supported by the premise "I was only driving as fast as everyone around me." The argument is attempting to validate compliance with the speed limit based on what others (everyone around) were doing without providing concrete evidence that their actions meet legal standards. This reasoning asserts a universally applicable point that if everyone is doing it, it must be correct or permissible.

This fits the classification of **False Universals (FU)** because it is appealing to common practice or assumed universal behavior without establishing its correctness or legality.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the statement "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding." would be classified under **<FU>** (False Universals) using the IDAA process.
