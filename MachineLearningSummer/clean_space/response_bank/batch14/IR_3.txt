Sure, let's apply the decomposition approach (IDAA) step-by-step to classify the given string:

**String <s>:**
"Perhaps the most classic example of this fallacy is the argument for the existence of God.  Due to the understanding of nature through science, many of the arguments that used to be used for God (or gods) were abandoned, only to be replaced with new ones, usually involving questions to which science has not definitively answered yet.  The move from creationism to intelligent design is a prime example.  Currently the origin of life is a popular argument for God (although a classic argument from ignorance), and an area where we very well may have a scientific answer in the next decade, at which time, the “origin of life” argument will fade away and be replaced by another, thus moving the figurative goalposts farther back as our understanding of the natural world increases. Exception: This fallacy should not be confused with an argument or set of arguments, with multiple propositions inherent in the argument.  The reason for the difference between this kind of argument and the moving the goalposts fallacy, is a subtle one, but indicated by a strong initial claim (“has to be”, “must”, “required for”, etc.) that gets answered and/or what appears to be ad hoc objections that follow eventually leading to an impossible request for proof.
Fun Fact: The name “moving the goalposts” comes from the analogy of kicking a perfect field goal in American football, only to have the goalposts be moved on you. This would be very unfair.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

**Step 1: Understand Definitions**
- Review the definitions provided for each argument type and examples to guide the identification process.

**Step 2: Preprocess the String (<s>)**
- Read over the string to comprehend its meaning. This string is explaining the concept of "moving the goalposts," a type of logical fallacy.
- The string comprises several sentences to form a cohesive explanation of the fallacy.

**Step 3: Identify Keywords and Phrases**
- Keywords and phrases from the string include: "abandoned, only to be replaced with new ones," "moving the figurative goalposts farther back," "argument from ignorance," "to which science has not definitively answered yet," "indicated by a strong initial claim (“has to be”, “must”, “required for”, etc.)."

**Step 4: Matching Against Definitions**
- The primary point here seems to be describing the fallacy of "moving the goalposts" where as soon as one question or requirement is satisfied, a new one is created, pushing back the goal of proving something.
- This might not map perfectly to any one specific argument type as previously defined, since it is identifying a specific logical fallacy. However, we can still analyze it relative to our categories:
  - <FE> False Enumeration: Listing fewer or more options than actually exist. This example doesn't list options explicitly, but the repetitive replacement of arguments might be an indirect form.
  - <FU> False Universals: Universally agreed points without proof. This is closer to an argument method described here, rather than the specific claim being criticized.
  - None of the other categories fit well (Generalization, Inappropriate Reason, Redundant Reason, Weak Causal Basis, Double-Edged Phrases).

**Step 5: Logical Consistency Check**
- Ensure this interpretation logically fits with the argument's content:
  - The argument explains replacing one defense with another when the former is countered, which might be indirectly hinting at inappropriate or weak reasoning.

**Step 6: Final Classification**
- The best fit from the given definitions might be <FE> since it indirectly implies an endless, unfair enumeration of requirements and it's addressing multiple shifting arguments.

### Final Classification:
The best classification for this explanation of "moving the goalposts" fallacy is Falls under <FE> (False Enumeration) as it involves a misleading enumeration of claims moving forward as counters to existing knowledge.
