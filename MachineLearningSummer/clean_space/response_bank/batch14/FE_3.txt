Sure, let's apply the detailed step-by-step classification process (<IDAA>) to the new string: "People either like coffee or hate it."

### Step-by-Step Classification:

1. **Identify the Argument:**
   - **Argument:** "People either like coffee or hate it."

2. **Check Generalization (<G>):**
   - **Examine:** Does this claim convey a general rule or truth based on limited or specific instances?
   - **Analysis:** This statement doesn't seem to bridge from specific instances to a general rule; instead, it makes an absolute claim about people's preferences.

3. **Check False Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - **Examine:** Does this argument present a limited set of options or create a false dichotomy?
   - **Analysis:** Yes, it implies that there are only two options when it comes to people's feelings about coffee — either they like it or they hate it. This neglects the possibility that some people may feel neutral or indifferent towards coffee.
   - **Result:** **<FE> identified.**

4. **Check Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):**
   - **Examine:** Does this argument rely on a reason that doesn't logically support the claim?
   - **Analysis:** There doesn't appear to be an external reason given to support the proposition; it is a straightforward claim.

5. **Check Redundant Reason (<RR>):**
   - **Examine:** Does the argument's reason restate the proposition in different terms without adding substantive support?
   - **Analysis:** No additional reason is given that restates the proposition.

6. **Check Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - **Examine:** Does the argument suggest a weak or unconvincing causal relationship?
   - **Analysis:** There is no causality presented in this argument about people's feelings toward coffee.

7. **Check False Universals (<FU>):**
   - **Examine:** Does the argument assert universal truths or widespread beliefs without supporting evidence?
   - **Analysis:** It does claim a universal truth about people's preferences, but it’s more about limited enumeration than asserting a widely accepted belief without proof.

8. **Check Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):**
   - **Examine:** Can the statement be interpreted in two ways, potentially counter to the speaker's intent?
   - **Analysis:** The statement is not inherently ambiguous or open to dual interpretations in a way that could be misinterpreted.

**Conclusion: The string "People either like coffee or hate it." is classified as <FE> because it presents a false dichotomy of people's preferences towards coffee, suggesting that there are only two possible attitudes while ignoring other possibilities.**

This methodical approach confirms that the string falls under the category of False Enumeration (<FE>).
