For 
To apply the classification task <IDA> to the statement "Be happy with the 1972 Chevy Nova you drive. There are many people in this country who don’t even have a car.", we will proceed step by step according to the decomposition of <t>.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Application:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
- The main proposition here is: "Be happy with the 1972 Chevy Nova you drive."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R> 
- The reason provided is: "There are many people in this country who don’t even have a car."

#### Step 3: Assess the Argument for Defective Types
Now, we will check if the argument fits into any of the defective argument types defined earlier. Let’s compare it with each one:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - This occurs when an assertion based on some parts is referred to all.
   - Here, the statement does not seem to generalize the characteristics of car owners or non-owners universally. Thus, it does not fit <G>.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - This occurs when possibilities not considered make the argument incomplete.
   - The statement does not attempt to enumerate all possible arguments for being happy with the car, it only provides one reason. Thus, it does not fit <FE>.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Here, <R> does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of <P>.
   - The reason given (that there are many people without cars) does not directly address why one should be happy with a 1972 Chevy Nova specifically, making it an inconclusive reason.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - This occurs when the causal basis for <P> is weak.
   - The reason that others do not have cars is not a compelling reason why one should be happy with their specific car, the 1972 Chevy Nova. This reason is weak.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - This is when <R> says the same as was said in the <P>.
   - The reason does not simply repeat the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - This argument type involves assuming something is certain on the ground of universal agreement.
   - While the reason does seem to appeal to a widely understood situation, it does not declare that the assertion is universally agreed upon. Hence, it does not fit <FU>.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - This involves ambiguous sense in the language of the argument.
   - The language used here does not seem particularly ambiguous.

#### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument
- Given the analysis above, the best fit for this argument appears to be **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)** and **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**. However, since the task specifies to always choose <G> if appropriate, and we determined it is not <G>, we will opt for the best sole fit.
- The strength of <IR> outweighs <WCB> due to <IR>'s direct focus on the conclusive nature of reasoning.

### Final Classification
- **Classification: <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**.
