For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "Eat lamb--could thousands of coyotes be wrong?", we will first decompose the advanced task <IDA> into specific steps and then follow these steps to classify the string.

### Decomposition of <IDA> (<D>):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Determine what is being asserted or proposed in the string.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Determine the causal basis or reason given to support the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Check if there is additional support provided for the reason.
4. **Classify the Argument Type:** Using the definitions provided, categorize the argument as <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step-by-Step Application of <D> to <IDA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The proposition in the string is: "Eat lamb."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason provided is: "could thousands of coyotes be wrong?"

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - In this string, there is no explicit additional support provided beyond the reason itself.

4. **Classify the Argument Type:**
   - Now we must check if the reason "could thousands of coyotes be wrong?" fits into any of the defective argument categories defined.

Let's analyze it step by step with respect to the defective argument types:
- **<G> Generalization:** The reason is implying that because coyotes eat lamb, everyone should, which is a broad generalization based on the behavior of a specific group (coyotes). But since we are considering human dietary choices and not just coyote behavior as the basis, this "thousands" part doesn't directly fit the idea of turning a part into a whole for humans.
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:** This does not fit as it doesn’t claim to have made a complete enumeration of possibilities.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** The reason might be considered inconclusive because the eating behavior of coyotes doesn't necessarily apply to human dietary choices. However, it’s not directly presenting an inconclusive reason but rather more presumptuous support.
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** The reason does not repeat the proposition.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** This could fit as the causal link between "coyotes eat lamb" and "humans should eat lamb" is not compelling (weak base).
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** This is a good fit. The argument presumes consensus or correctness based on what is implied to be widely accepted behavior among coyotes: essentially arguing that if many coyotes do it, it must be right for another group, in this case, humans.
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:** There is no ambiguous language employed.

After evaluating the argument types, the most fitting classification here appears to be:
**<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**

The argument assumes that because it is a consensus among coyotes to eat lamb, it should be similarly acceptable or good for humans, which is still a disputable statement.

**Classification: <FU>**
