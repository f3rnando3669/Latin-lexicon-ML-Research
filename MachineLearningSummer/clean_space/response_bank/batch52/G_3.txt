For 
To classify the statement "An environmental group illegally blocked loggers and workers at a nuclear plant. Therefore, environmentalists are radicals who take the law into their own hands." as one of the defective argument types using the task of decomposition, let's proceed step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P> and the Reason <R>
- **Proposition (<P>):** Environmentalists are radicals who take the law into their own hands.
- **Reason (<R>):** An environmental group illegally blocked loggers and workers at a nuclear plant.

### Step 2: Evaluate each defective argument type against the given statement
- **Generalization (<G>):** This argument might fit <G> since it takes the actions of one environmental group and generalizes it to all environmentalists. "Environmentalists are radicals who take the law into their own hands" is an assertion based on the actions of "an environmental group," applying it to all environmentalists.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument does not attempt to enumerate all the possible reasons or factors, so it is unlikely to fit <FE>.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Though the reason might be considered in some interpretations, the argument’s flaw does not primarily hinge on the reason being inconclusive regarding the correctness of <P>.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal link between the actions of one group and the character of all environmentalists is weak, but the flaw in the argument doesn't primarily stem from an insufficient causal basis as per the definition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The statement’s reason isn't simply a repetition of the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The argument does not appeal to a universally agreed upon notion but is making a sweeping statement based on one instance.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The language in the argument isn't ambiguous or open to multiple interpretations leading to a different sense.

### Step 3: Decide on the most fitting category
Based on the definitions provided and the analysis:

- The argument "An environmental group illegally blocked loggers and workers at a nuclear plant. Therefore, environmentalists are radicals who take the law into their own hands." is most fittingly categorized as **Generalization (<G>)**.

### Step 4: Confirm the conclusion
- **Conclusion:** <s> = "An environmental group illegally blocked loggers and workers at a nuclear plant. Therefore, environmentalists are radicals who take the law into their own hands." fits the defective argument type <G>.

Thus, the classification of the statement is complete and the result is **Generalization (<G>)**.
