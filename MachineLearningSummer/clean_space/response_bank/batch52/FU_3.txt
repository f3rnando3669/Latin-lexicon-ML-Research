For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given statement, we need to decompose the task <IDA> into specific steps and then classify the statement accordingly. Here are the steps for decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Determine what is being set forth as the main claim or assertion in the statement.
  
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Look for the causal basis given in the statement to justify the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Check if there is any further argument that corroborates the reason.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument:** Based on what has been identified, classify the type of defective argument the statement falls under.

Let's apply these steps to the given statement:

```
"Trump cites (biased) poll results showing that people think he’s a strong leader to prove a point that he is a strong leader.
ABC News/Washington Post Poll (wrong big on election) said almost all stand by their vote on me & 53% said strong leader."
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition: "Trump is a strong leader."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason: The reason provided is that the ABC News/Washington Post poll shows almost all stand by their vote on him, and 53% said he is a strong leader.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Proof of Reason: The poll results themselves are cited as proof that people think he is a strong leader.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument:**

   - First, we see that Trump uses poll results to substantiate his claim of being a strong leader.
   - However, if the poll is biased or flawed (as suggested by the mention that the poll was "wrong big on election"), the reliability of the Reason becomes questionable.

Given the above analysis:

- There's a possibility of an **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** because the proof rests on the assumption that the poll is accurate and unbiased, which might not be true.
- Another plausible classification could be **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)** because Trump assumes that the poll’s results (even if biased) reflect a universal agreement on his leadership strength, which is still under dispute.

Since our guideline is to classify as <G> if it applies, we must check for a generalization:

- The statement doesn't seem to make a general assertion based on some individuals, so it doesn’t fit <G>.

Hence, the correct classifications appear to be:
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** The Reason (biased poll results) does not conclusively demonstrate the Proposition (Trump is a strong leader).
- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):** Assuming that the biased poll results reflect universal agreement on the Proposition.

**Final Classification:**
```
<IR> and <FU>
```

Note: While both classifications apply, the necessity to stick with one for simplicity would lean towards <IR> as the primary classification for this analysis.
