For 
To apply the process of <IDAA> to the string "Only a mentally ill person would kill someone, so anyone who kills someone is automatically mentally ill," we will decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps. Here's the decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: What is the argument attempting to prove?
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: What is the causal basis presented to support the Proposition?
3. **Determine whether the argument fits into any defective argument categories (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>)**:
    - Check for Generalization (<G>)
    - Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
    - Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
    - Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
    - Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
    - Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
    - Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)

Now we'll follow these steps one by one:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition in the argument is:
**<P>: "Anyone who kills someone is automatically mentally ill."**

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason provided in the argument is:
**<R>: "Only a mentally ill person would kill someone."**

### Step 3: Determine whether the argument fits into any defective argument categories:
Let's analyze the argument to see if it fits into any of the specified defective argument types.

- **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument does not broadly generalize about a group based on limited evidence. It's making a definitive statement about a characteristic of people who commit a specific action.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not involve enumerating possibilities but making a definitive claim about the nature of people who commit murder.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The Reason does not provide conclusive evidence for the Proposition. It asserts a causal linkage without justifying why this linkage must hold true for all cases.
  
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The Reason is not a repetition of the Proposition but instead provides a basis (albeit a weak one).
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The Reason "Only a mentally ill person would kill someone" provides an insufficient causal basis for the Proposition as it assumes without sufficient evidence that mental illness is the sole cause of killing.
  
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument does not appeal to a universal agreement or consensus.
  
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The language does not appear to be particularly ambiguous; it is clear albeit faulty in its logic.

Having examined the argument through the different defective types, the most fitting classification for this argument is **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**. The Reason provided does not compellingly support the Proposition and rests on unexamined assumptions about causality.

### Conclusion
The argument "Only a mentally ill person would kill someone, so anyone who kills someone is automatically mentally ill." fits into the defective argument type of **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
