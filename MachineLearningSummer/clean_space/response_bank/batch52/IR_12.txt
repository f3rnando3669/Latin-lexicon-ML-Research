For 
To apply IDAA to the given string "Grace and Helen were both romantically interested in Brad. One day, with Brad sitting within earshot, Grace asked in an inquisitive tone whether Helen was still having problems with her drug habit.", we need to decompose the task IDA into specific steps and then apply each step systematically.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDA (D)

1. **Identify the Proposition (P) in the string.**
2. **Identify the Reason (R) provided for the Proposition, if any.**
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR), if any.**
4. **Classify the string into one of the defective argument types: G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, or DEP.**

### Applying the Decomposition to the Given String

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   The Proposition (P) is essentially an implied one in this case. It might be interpreted as: "Helen has a continuing problem with her drug habit."

2. **Identify the Reason (R) provided for the Proposition:**
   The Reason (R) is provided implicitly by Grace's question: "Grace asked in an inquisitive tone whether Helen was still having problems with her drug habit." This suggests that there is an ongoing issue with Helen's drug habit according to Grace.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   There isn't a clear Proof of Reason (PR) provided. The statement is more of an insinuation rather than backed by additional argumentation or proof.

4. **Classify the String:**

    - **Generalization (G)**: This does not fit as the string does not generalize from a part to a whole.
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This does not fit as the string does not present a false dilemma.
    - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This might partly fit, but since there's no substantial Reason given, it doesn’t conclusively match.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This does not completely fit as there’s no weak causation explicitly provided.
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This does not fit; there’s no repetition here.
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This does not fit as it does not rest on assumed universal agreement.
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: This fits more closely due to the ambiguous, somewhat leading nature of Grace's question. It can be interpreted as Grace causing insinuation about Helen's drug habit.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the steps above, the most appropriate classification appears to be **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**.

The application of IDAA has led us to the conclusion that the string "Grace and Helen were both romantically interested in Brad. One day, with Brad sitting within earshot, Grace asked in an inquisitive tone whether Helen was still having problems with her drug habit." fits the defective argument type <DEP>.
