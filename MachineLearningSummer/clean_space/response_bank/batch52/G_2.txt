To apply the IDAA (the step-by-step application of decomposition) to the task of classifying the string "The more things change, the more they remain the same," we will decompose the task of classification into specific steps and then execute those steps. 

### Steps for IDAA:
1. **Understand the Proposition (<P>):**
   - First, identify what the Proposition is claiming.
   
2. **Examine the Reason (<R>):**
   - Next, analyze the reasoning given to support the Proposition.
   
3. **Check for Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Determine if there is additional corroborating evidence or argumentation provided to support the Reason.

4. **Match with Defective Argument Types:**
   - Compare the identified components with known defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>.

5. **Choose the Best Fit:**
   - Select the defective argument type that best classifies the string, prioritizing <G> if applicable.

### Step-by-Step Application:

1. **Understand the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The string "The more things change, the more they remain the same." seems to be stating that despite apparent changes, fundamental aspects do not change.

2. **Examine the Reason (<R>):**
   - This statement doesn't provide an explicit Reason to support the Proposition. Instead, it makes an aphoristic assertion rather than presenting a causal basis or explanation.

3. **Check for Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Again, there is no additional corroboration or argumentation directly provided to support the statement.

4. **Match with Defective Argument Types:**
   - **<G> Generalization:** Not applicable since it isn’t claiming a general rule based on an insufficient sample.
   - **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:** Not applicable as it does not attempt to enumerate possibilities.
   - **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** Potentially applicable if we consider it’s making an assertion without proving it.
   - **<RR> Faulty Repetition:** Not applicable, as it's not repeating the same assertion for support.
   - **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** Not applicable since it lacks a stated causal basis altogether.
   - **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** Not applicable since it doesn’t claim something is agreed upon universally.
   - **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:** Potentially applicable if we consider the phrase could be interpreted to mean different things (e.g., superficial vs. meaningful change).

5. **Choose the Best Fit:**
   - Given that no explicit Reason or causal basis is provided and the statement is largely aphoristic and could be interpreted in multiple ways, the best classification might be <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use). 

However, given the nature of the string "The more things change, the more they remain the same," it might not neatly fall into any of the specific defective argument types defined. It's more of a philosophical statement rather than a classical argument with clear P, R, and PR components.

### Conclusion:
The string "The more things change, the more they remain the same." does not perfectly fit any of the defective argument types defined. If forced to classify, <DEP> might be the closest due to the potential for ambiguity in its meaning.
