For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposition to classifying an argument type) to the statement "Giving 10% of your income to the Church will free a child’s soul from Limbo into Heaven, so give your money!", we'll break down the process into specific steps and analyze the argument step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (ᗷ)
First, we identify the main assertion or proposition within the statement. 

- **Proposition (ᗷ):** "Giving 10% of your income to the Church will free a child’s soul from Limbo into Heaven."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
Next, we identify the reason or causal basis for the proposition.

- **Reason (R):** Implicitly, it is "Because giving money to the Church has the power to affect the eternal fate of a child's soul."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
Now, we determine if there is any corroborative evidence or additional justification provided for the reason. 

- **Proof of Reason (PR):** There isn't any direct additional argument provided to explicitly corroborate the reason.

### Step 4: Assess the Completeness and Consistency of the Argument
Evaluate if the argument is logically consistent and complete based on the components identified.

### Step 5: Apply Classifications of Defective Arguments
Now, check the argument against the types of defective arguments (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP) to classify it:

- **Generalization (G):**
  - This does not apply since it is not a broad assertion based on incomplete evidence regarding a group of people.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
  - This does not apply since it isn’t claiming a complete set of possibilities while actually ignoring others.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
  - This argument could fit here because the reason provided ("giving money to the Church has the power to affect the eternal fate of a child's soul") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. It relies on an unproven premise about spiritual transactions.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
  - This also fits since the causal basis (the power of donation to affect a child's soul) is not compelling or evidenced. There is no logical or empirical grounding provided.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
  - This does not apply as the reason is not repeating the proposition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
  - We may suspect this since it assumes acceptance of a spiritual belief without evidence, but it’s less clear-cut without a reference to "universal agreement."

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
  - This does not apply as the argument does not rely on ambiguous terms.

Among IR (Inconclusive Reason) and WCB (Weak Causal Basis), the argument best fits the classification of:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason (donating money to the Church affecting soul's destiny) is not conclusively demonstrating the proposition and rests on unproven assumptions.

Thus:
- **Classification (s):** IR

### Final Step: Conclusion
Based on the application, the argument "Giving 10% of your income to the Church will free a child’s soul from Limbo into Heaven, so give your money!" is classified as type **IR** (Inconclusive Reason).
