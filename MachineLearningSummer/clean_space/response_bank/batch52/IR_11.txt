For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string, we need to first decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps, and then apply these steps to the argument. Here are the steps for <D> broken down:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   Determine the main assertion or statement that the speaker intends to prove in their argument.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   Look for the causal basis or justification provided by the speaker to support the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   Find any additional arguments or evidence presented to support the reason.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type (<IDA>):**
   Determine if the argument fits into any of the predefined defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP>. If it fits into multiple categories, always choose <G>.

Now, we will apply these steps to the string:

"The Supreme Court right now is deciding whether it is right to execute insane people who have committed murder. I think it is all right to execute insane people. If we ban executions of insane people, then everybody on death row will suddenly decide they are insane and purposely fail sanity tests. It would result in chaos."

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition (<P>) is the main assertion the speaker intends to prove:
"I think it is all right to execute insane people."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason (<R>) provided to support the proposition is:
"If we ban executions of insane people, then everybody on death row will suddenly decide they are insane and purposely fail sanity tests."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
The evidence or reasoning given to further support <R> is:
"It would result in chaos."

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type (<IDA>)
We need to determine if this argument fits any of the defined defective argument types:

- **<G> Generalization:** No, the argument is not making a broad assertion about a group based on a part.
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:** No, it doesn't claim a complete list of possibilities and miss some.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** Potentially, but needs more analysis.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** Yes, since the causal basis provided ("everybody on death row will suddenly decide they are insane and it would result in chaos") seems weak and not compelling.
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** No, the reason is not a repetition of the proposition.
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** Potentially, but it does not explicitly assume universal agreement.
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:** No, there is no ambiguous language used.

Among these candidates, the primary issue seems to be the weak causal connection between the reason and the proposition. Therefore, the argument fits best under:

- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**

### Conclusion:
Applying <IDAA> to the given string, we classify it as:

**<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**

The argument's reason does not provide a compelling basis for the proposition that it is right to execute insane people who have committed murder.
