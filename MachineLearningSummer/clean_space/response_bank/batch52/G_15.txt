To classify the statement "If I eat this donut today, I'll probably do it again tomorrow and the next day, and then I'll never be able to eat healthy again." using the IDAA process involves breaking down the task (IDA) into specific steps (D). Here are the steps:

### Decomposition of <t> into specific steps (D):

1. **Identify the proposition (P):**
   - What is being claimed or asserted?

2. **Identify the reason (R):**
   - What is the causal basis for the proposition?

3. **Identify the proof of reason (PR):**
   - Is there an additional argument that corroborates the reason?

4. **Check for defective arguments:**
   - Determine if the argument contains any of the defective types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

### Application of <D> to <IDA> (step by step):

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The proposition (P) is the main claim being made in the statement.
- "I'll never be able to eat healthy again."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason (R) provides the causal basis for the proposition.
- "If I eat this donut today, I'll probably do it again tomorrow and the next day."

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
Check for any corroborative arguments supporting the reason (R).
- There is no additional argument provided; the reason stands on its own.

#### Step 4: Check for Defective Arguments
Examine the argument carefully to see if it fits into any of the defective argument types.

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - The proposition concerns an individual case (eating a donut) and does not make a broad claim about a group.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - The argument does not appear to be listing incomplete possibilities; itâ€™s presenting a sequence of actions leading to a conclusion.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - The reason (R) does not conclusively demonstrate that the person will never be able to eat healthy again, as eating a donut today and potentially more in the future does not logically lead to an absolute inability to eat healthy.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - The causal link provided (eating one donut leading to never eating healthy again) appears weak and insufficient to support the strong proposition.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - The reason is not a repetition of the proposition; it provides a sequence of behavior that is hypothesized to lead to the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - There is no appeal to what is universally agreed upon.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - The statement is clear and not ambiguous in its language.

Given these evaluations, the statement fits best under **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, because the causal basis (eating a donut today leading to never eating healthy again) is not compelling.

Thus, the classification of the statement "If I eat this donut today, I'll probably do it again tomorrow and the next day, and then I'll never be able to eat healthy again." according to IDAA is **<WCB>**.
