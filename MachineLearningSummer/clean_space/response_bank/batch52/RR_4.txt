For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "You must obey the law, because it's illegal to break the law," we will decompose the task <IDA> (classifying the defective argument) step by step.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - The Proposition (P) here is: "You must obey the law."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - The Reason (R) provided is: "because it's illegal to break the law."

3. **Determine if the Reason (R) is conclusive and provides a compelling causal basis for the Proposition (P):**
   - The Reason (R) here effectively restates the Proposition (P) without providing additional justification or a different causal basis.

4. **Classify the type of defective argument:**
   - According to the definitions:
     - Generalization (<G>)
     - Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
     - Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
     - Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
     - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
     - Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
     - Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)

   - The Reason (R) "it's illegal to break the law" is essentially repeating the Proposition (P) "You must obey the law" in different words. This is a case where the Reason does not add any new information or causal basis, but rather, it repeats the same idea presented in the Proposition.

### Final Classification

Based on the analysis above, the statement "You must obey the law, because it's illegal to break the law" falls under the category of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**.

### Conclusion

The logical fallacy used in the statement above is Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>).
