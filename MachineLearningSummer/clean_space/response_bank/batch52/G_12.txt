For 
To classify the given string "It’s getting late, and we still have to decide on the school budget. What do you say we just leave it as is and we can call it a night?" according to <IDA>, let's apply <IDAA> by decomposing the task into specific steps and then proceed with the classification.

### Decomposition of Task <IDA>
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), and Proof of Reason (<PR>) in the string.**
2. **Evaluate each part to identify any defects described by the classifications <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.**

### Step-by-Step Application

#### Step 1: Identify <P>, <R>, and <PR>
- **Proposition (<P>)**: "We should leave the school budget as is."
- **Reason (<R>)**: "It’s getting late, and we still have to decide on the school budget."
- **Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: (Implies that deciding on the budget later will help conclude the meeting early.)

#### Step 2: Evaluate for Defective Argument Types
1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The string does not make a general assertion based on one part or a majority of individuals.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The string does not claim to have made a complete enumeration of possibilities and miss out on pertinent ones.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The Reason given ("It’s getting late, and we still have to decide on the school budget") does not conclusively demonstrate why the Proposition should be accepted (why we should leave the budget as is). The lateness of the hour does not inherently justify not making a decision about the budget.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The Reason is not a repetition of the Proposition.
   
5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis for the Proposition is weak. The lateness of the hour is not a compelling reason to leave the budget as is, suggesting it falls under Insufficient Causal Basis.
   
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The Argument does not rely on an assumed consensus.
   
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The language used in the string does not appear to be ambiguous or capable of being taken in another sense.

Based on the evaluation, the classification most fitting for the argument type is **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, as the Reason provided does not sufficiently justify the Proposition.

### Conclusion
The string "It’s getting late, and we still have to decide on the school budget. What do you say we just leave it as is and we can call it a night?" is best classified as:

**<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**
