For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string, we'll decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The Proposition is what the arguer intends to prove. In the given string, the first part sets up the discussion about Andrea Starkk's argument regarding the media harming women and body image:
    
    **Proposition (<P>): "You shouldn't listen to Andrea Starkk."**

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The Reason is the causal basis given for the Proposition. In this case, the Reason given for not listening to Starkk is her personal attributes:

    **Reason (<R>): "Starkk is an ugly, bitter person."**

### Step 3: Examine for any Proof of Reason (<PR>)
Proof of Reason would typically support the Reason with additional arguments. Here, no additional arguments are provided, so we have:

    **Proof of Reason (<PR>): None**

### Step 4: Classify the string based on defective argument types
Now we classify the string by recognizing the argumentative fallacies that could be present:

- **Generalization (<G>)**:
  - The string does not generalize a characteristic from one part to all.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
  - This does not claim to have enumerated all possibilities.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
  - The reasoning does not conclusively demonstrate why we should not listen to Starkk based on her personal characteristics alone.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
  - "Starkk is an ugly, bitter person" is not relevant to the validity of her arguments about media and body image. 

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
  - The Reason is different from the Proposition and is not merely a repetition.
 
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
  - There is no claim that everyone agrees with the proposition.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
  - The language is not ambiguous in a way that the statement could be misinterpreted.

### Step 5: Conclude on classification
Among the identified types of defective arguments, the most appropriate classification is based on the Reason provided. The Reason provided for not listening to Starkk attacks her character (ad hominem) which is unrelated to her argument's substance and validity:

    **Classification: <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**

Using the decision rule given, even though "Generalization" would be chosen first in another context, it does not apply here, and hence we conclude with <WCB> as the classification.

### Final Output:
<s> = "Andrea Starkk has written several books arguing that the media harms women when it comes to body image. But Starkk is an ugly, bitter person, so you shouldn't listen to her."
<IDA>s = <WCB>

Thus, the complete argument classification process confirms <WCB> as the appropriate defective argument type for the provided string.
