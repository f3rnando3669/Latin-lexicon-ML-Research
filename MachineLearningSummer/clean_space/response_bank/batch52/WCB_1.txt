For 
To apply \(<IDAA>\) to the given statement, we must first decompose the task \((<D>)\) of classifying the string into specific steps. These steps will guide us in identifying the type of defective argument used in the statement:

1. **Identify the Proposition \((<P>)\)**: Determine what is being set forth as the main point or claim.
2. **Identify the Reason \((<R>)\)**: Look for the causal basis or reasoning provided to support the Proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason \((<PR>)\)**: Check for any additional arguments that corroborate the Reason.
4. **Classify the Statement**: Based on the identified proposition, reason, and proof of reason, determine if the argument fits into any of the defective argument categories: \((<G>)\), \((<FE>)\), \((<IR>)\), \((<RR>)\), \((<WCB>)\), \((<FU>)\), or \((<DEP>)\).

Now let's apply these steps to the given statement:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition \((<P>)\)
The main point or claim being made is:
**"Jones is responsible for the rise in crime."**

### Step 2: Identify the Reason \((<R>)\)
The reasoning provided to support the Proposition is:
**"President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up."**

### Step 3: Evaluate the Proof of Reason \((<PR>)\)
There is no additional argument provided to corroborate the Reason. It relies on a chronological sequence of events ("raised taxes" and then "rate of violent crime went up") which implies causation without further proof.

### Step 4: Classify the Statement
Based on the steps above, we need to determine the type of defective argument employed. Let's evaluate if it fits one of the categories:

- **Generalization \((<G>)**: This argument does not generalize about a group of people or things.
- **Incomplete Enumeration \((<FE>)**: This argument does not claim to have enumerated all possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason \((<IR>)**: The reasoning provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition. It assumes a cause-and-effect relationship based solely on the sequence of events, which is not sufficiently substantiated.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition \((<RR>)**: The Reason does not repeat the Proposition but tries to establish causation.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis \((<WCB>)**: The causal basis (raising taxes leading to an increase in violent crime) is weak because it does not provide compelling evidence or a direct link between the two events.
- **Presumptuous Consensus \((<FU>)**: This argument does not rely on a presumed consensus.
- **Ambiguous Language Use \((<DEP>)**: The language in the Reason is not ambiguous.

Since the reasoning provided does not conclusively establish a direct causation and the causal basis is notably weak, we classify the statement under two categories primarily: \(<IR>\) (Inconclusive Reason) and \(<WCB>\) (Insufficient Causal Basis). When evaluating which category fits better, the generic weak causation without compelling evidence aligns closer with \(<WCB>\).

### Final Classification
**The given statement "President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up. Jones is responsible for the rise in crime." fits the category \((<WCB>)\): Insufficient Causal Basis.**
