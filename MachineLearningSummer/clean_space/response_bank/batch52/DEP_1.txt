For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "I didn’t steal your pen—I borrowed it," we need to first break down the task <t> into specific steps <D>. The task <t> here is to classify the string <s> as one of the defective argument types defined above. Below are the steps to decompose the task and apply it:

### Steps for Decomposition (D) of <t> into Specific Steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition <P>:**
   - Analyze the string to determine the primary claim or assertion being made.

2. **Identify the Reason <R>:**
   - Determine the justification or reasoning provided for the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason <PR>:**
   - Look at any additional arguments that corroborate the reason provided.

4. **Analyze and Compare:**
   - Determine whether the Proposition, Reason, or Proof of Reason fits any of the defective arguments: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

### Application of <D> to <IDA> (Step by Step):

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>

In the string "I didn’t steal your pen—I borrowed it," the primary claim or assertion is "I didn’t steal your pen."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>

The justification or reasoning provided is "I borrowed it."

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason <PR>

There doesn’t appear to be an additional argument provided beyond the statement itself.

#### Step 4: Analyze and Compare

Now we will see if the statement fits into any of the defective argument categories:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** 
   - This statement does not make a generalization based on a subset of individuals. It is specific to a particular instance.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - This argument doesn’t claim to have made an exhaustive list of possibilities, so it does not fit <FE>.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The reason "I borrowed it" does not conclusively demonstrate the truth of not stealing since borrowing can sometimes be perceived as stealing without explicit permission. The reason does not fully negate the proposition "I didn’t steal your pen" conclusively.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The reason "I borrowed it" is not a robust causal basis for not stealing since borrowing without permission could still be considered stealing.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - The reason provided is not just a repetition of the proposition; it adds a different context ("borrowed" vs. "stole").

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - The statement does not assume consensus or claim universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - The term "borrowed" could be taken in a different sense than intended, suggesting ambiguity. The term "borrowed" might imply temporary possession with an intent to return, but without permission, it can still be considered stealing, thus making it ambiguous.

Given these analyses, the statement "I didn’t steal your pen—I borrowed it" best fits **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).**

### Conclusion:

Applying <IDAA>, the classification of the string "I didn’t steal your pen—I borrowed it" is **<DEP>** for Ambiguous Language Use.
