For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of decomposing <IDA> into specific steps) to the string "Everyone seems to support the changes in the vacation policy, and if everyone likes them, they must be good," we will break down the process step by step:

### Step 1: Decompose the task <t> (IDA) into specific steps.
- Identify the argument structure in the string.
- Determine if the argument fits into any of the defective argument categories <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.
- Based on the definitions, classify the string into the most fitting category.

### Step 2: Identify the argument structure in the string.
- Proposition (<P>): "The changes in the vacation policy are good."
- Reason (<R>): "Everyone seems to support the changes in the vacation policy, and if everyone likes them, they must be good."
- Proof of Reason (<PR>): Implicitly assumed consensus: "Everyone likes the changes."

### Step 3: Determine if the argument fits into any of the defective argument categories.
- **Generalization (G)**: This does not apply as it is not a generalization based on insufficient instances.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This does not apply as it is not about failing to enumerate all possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This is about a reason that does not conclusively support the proposition, but that doesn't seem to be the issue here.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis here—everyone’s support—seems to directly relate to the proposition, so it's not an insufficient causal basis.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This is not merely repeating the proposition, as it provides a new basis.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This fits the description well. The reason asserts that because "everyone" supports the changes, it must be good, relying on an assumed consensus which might still be in dispute.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language here does not seem ambiguous.

### Step 4: Classify the string into the most fitting category.
- Based on the analysis, the argument's defect seems to stem from assuming a consensus ("everyone likes them"), which presumes that universal agreement makes something inherently good. This fits the category <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).

### Conclusion
We classify the string "Everyone seems to support the changes in the vacation policy, and if everyone likes them, they must be good." as type <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).
