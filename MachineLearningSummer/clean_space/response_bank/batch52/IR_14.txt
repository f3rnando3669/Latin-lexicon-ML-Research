For 
To apply the task of identifying a defective argument (<IDA>) to the string "Did John ever give up his bad habits?" using the decomposition approach (<IDAA>), we need to break down the process into specific steps to classify the string. Here’s the detailed step-by-step decomposition of the task:

### Step 1: Understand the Question
- The string "Did John ever give up his bad habits?" is a question.
- Determine if the string makes an argumentative claim.

### Step 2: Evaluate for Argumentative Structure
- Identify if the string "Did John ever give up his bad habits?" contains a Proposition (<P>), a Reason (<R>), or a Proof of Reason (<PR>).
- Since it is a question, it doesn’t directly form a complete argument (Proposition, Reason, Proof).

### Step 3: Identify Potential Defective Argument Type
Even though it’s a question, we can interpret its implicit context for any fallacies or bias:

#### Generalization (G)
- Check if the question generalizes from limited evidence. 
  - It does not present a generalized claim about a population based on limited evidence.

#### Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
- Check if the question suggests a complete enumeration of possibilities but actually addresses only a subset. 
  - It does not list possibilities.

#### Inconclusive Reason (IR)
- Check if the question’s implication (if any) lacks a conclusive reason.
  - To practically apply (IR), we'd need more assertion rather than a question.

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
- Check if there’s an insufficient causal basis. 
  - No causal argument is being presented due to the nature of the question.

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
- Check if it merely repeats an assertion as its reason. 
  - The question does not assert and repeat a premise.

#### Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
- Check if the question assumes something "universally agreed upon".
  - Usage of the term "ever" can imply John has bad habits, assuming it is universally agreed that John had bad habits.
  - This fits "making unchecked assumptions," thus closer to <FU>.

#### Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)
- Check if the question can be interpreted in more than one way.
  - The question is straightforward in its inquiry about John's habits without ambiguity.

### Step 4: Conclusion
By evaluating the string "Did John ever give up his bad habits?" against defective argument types based on the decomposed steps, its closest fit is <FU> due to the presumptive language "ever" which implicitly assumes John had bad habits without establishing this universally within the context.

Therefore, the classification <IDA> for the string "Did John ever give up his bad habits?" is:

**<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**

### Summary of Steps for <IDAA>:
1. Recognize the nature of the string (question in this case).
2. Determine the lack of complete argument structure due to question form.
3. Evaluate potential implicit bias or assumptions within the question.
4. Classify with <FU> due to the presumptive nature of the implication "ever" in the question.
