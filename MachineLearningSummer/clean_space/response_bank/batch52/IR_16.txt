For 
Applying \( \text{IDAA} \) to the string provided, we will decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps and then apply these steps to the string:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\( P \))
The Proposition is what the argument is intending to prove or assert.

**Analysis:**
The string does not explicitly state a clear proposition, but we can infer an implied one:

"My wife is now shopping for new patio furniture and not asking me about the garage."

**Inferred Proposition (\( P \)):**
"My wife is now distracted from talking about the garage because she is shopping for new patio furniture."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\( R \))
The Reason is the causal basis for the Proposition, explaining why the Proposition should be accepted as true.

**Analysis:**
The Reason provided in the string is:

"I asked her what she wants to do with our patio furniture."

**Identified Reason (\( R \)):**
"I brought up the topic of patio furniture instead of discussing the garage."

### Step 3: Check for Proof of Reason (\( PR \))
The Proof of Reason corroborates the Reason through additional arguments or evidence.

**Analysis:**
There is no additional evidence or argument provided to support the Reason. The string only describes the situation without further proof.

**Proof of Reason (\( PR \)):**
None.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type
Now, we need to classify whether the argument is of type \( G \), \( FE \), \( IR \), \( RR \), \( WCB \), \( FU \), or \( DEP \).

1. **\( G \)** - Generalization: There is no generalization in this argument.

2. **\( FE \)** - Incomplete Enumeration: This does not attempt to enumerate possibilities.

3. **\( IR \)** - Inconclusive Reason: The Reason (bringing up the topic of patio furniture) does not conclusively demonstrate the Proposition (wife is now distracted because of new furniture shopping).

4. **\( RR \)** - Faulty Repetition of Proposition: The Reason is not a mere repetition of the Proposition.

5. **\( WCB \)** - Insufficient Causal Basis: The causal basis (bringing up patio furniture) for the Proposition (wife is distracted from talking about the garage) is weak and not compelling.

6. **\( FU \)** - Presumptuous Consensus: No assumption of universal agreement present.

7. **\( DEP \)** - Ambiguous Language Use: No ambiguity in the language intended by the speaker.

**Classification:**
The classification that best fits this argument is \( WCB \) - Insufficient Causal Basis.

### Conclusion
By applying \( IDAA \), the argument "“My wife wants to talk about cleaning out the garage, so I asked her what she wants to do with our patio furniture. Now she’s shopping for new patio furniture and not asking me about the garage.”" can be classified as:

**\( WCB \)** - Insufficient Causal Basis.
