For 
To classify the string "You can tell that guy's Mexican - he's wearing a sombrero." using the approach defined for <IDA>, we will apply the <D> decomposition into specific steps. Here is the breakdown:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition: "You can tell that guy's Mexican."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason: "he's wearing a sombrero."

3. **Check for Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** 
     - The statement asserts that a person can be identified as Mexican based on a single characteristic (wearing a sombrero), which is an overgeneralization. It treats a specific trait as universally applicable to all Mexican individuals.
     - **Checking**: Does <P> generalize based on a part or majority to apply to all?
       - Yes, it generalizes all Mexicans based on that one trait of wearing a sombrero.

If <s> fits in category <G>, always choose <G>. Given that the argument showcases a classic case of overgeneralization:

### Conclusion:
The string "You can tell that guy's Mexican - he's wearing a sombrero." fits in category <G>.

Thus, the classification of <s> is <G>.
