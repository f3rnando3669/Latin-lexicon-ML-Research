For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of identifying defective arguments) to the provided statement "Jews are lice; They cause typhus (Painful/deadly disease)," we break down the process into specific steps as follows:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition in the statement is:
- "Jews are lice."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason given to support the proposition is:
- "They cause typhus (Painful/deadly disease)."

### Step 3: Examine the Proposition and Reason for Defective Argument Types
Next, we need to classify <s> into one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>. 

### Step 4: Evaluate if it’s a Generalization (<G>)
To check if it’s a Generalization, consider if the proposition is an assertion based on some or the majority of individuals but inappropriately extended to all. Here, the statement targets an entire group (Jews) based on an unfounded and derogatory generalization.

Indeed, this statement fits the definition of a Generalization. It asserts something highly prejudiced and false about all Jews based on no logical or valid evidence, exemplifying a form of hateful stereotyping.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the statement "Jews are lice; They cause typhus (Painful/deadly disease)" is classified as <G> — a Generalization. Thus, the output is:

```plaintext
<G>
```
