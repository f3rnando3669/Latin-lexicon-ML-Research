For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given statement "Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist and perhaps the foremost expert in the field, says that evolution is true. Therefore, it's true.", we will decompose this task into specific steps and classify the argument accordingly.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition in this statement is: "Evolution is true."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason provided is: "Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist and perhaps the foremost expert in the field, says that evolution is true."

### Step 3: Identify the Type of Defective Argument
We will now analyze the reason to determine if it fits any of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Analysis of Defective Argument Types:
- **Generalization (<G>):** The argument does not make a broad assertion applied universally, so it does not fit <G>.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** It does not list possibilities inadequately, so it does not fit <FE>.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition on its own merit. It relies on the authority of Richard Dawkins, rather than a logical, evidence-based proof of evolution itself, providing an inconclusive reason.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason does not repeat the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The argument might be considered weak, but it is more about the reliance on authority rather than a lack of a causal basis.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The argument implicitly assumes that Dawkins' agreement (expert consensus) makes it universally true.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The language is not ambiguous.

### Final Classification:
The most fitting classification for this argument is <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), given that it relies on Dawkins' authority rather than providing direct evidence for the truth of evolution itself.

### Conclusion:
After applying <IDAA> to the given statement, the defective argument type is classified as <IR>.
