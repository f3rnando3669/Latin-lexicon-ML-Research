For 
Let's proceed with the task of applying the decomposition of the advanced task \(<D>\) to the task of classifying the string \(<s>\) as a specific type of defective argument, \(<IDA>\). We'll break the process down step by step.

### Step-by-Step Classification Process (<IDAA>)

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   We need to determine the main assertion that the speaker is trying to prove.

   **Proposition (<P>)**: "We can’t freeze the academic year because then students won’t graduate on time."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   Next, we need to identify the causal basis provided to support the Proposition.

   **Reason (<R>)**: "Next thing you know most people will be unemployed and will resort to crime."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   Finally, we need to see if there are any additional arguments that corroborate the Reason.

   **Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: "The crime rate will skyrocket and society will collapse."

### Assessing the Components for Defects:

1. **Evaluate the Generalization (<G>)**:
   - Does the Proposition assert something about all individuals based on a subset? 
   - No, it does not. While it makes a sweeping prediction about societal outcomes, it's not a classic generalization about all members of a group.

2. **Evaluate the Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - Does the Proposition or Reason claim to enumerate all possibilities but miss out on some?
   - No, it does not explicitly list possibilities.

3. **Evaluate the Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - Does the Reason conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition (<P>)?
   - The Reason provided connects the freezing of the academic year directly to societal collapse in a way that seems speculative and exaggerated. 

4. **Evaluate the Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - Is the causal basis (Reason) compelling enough to support the Proposition?
   - The Reason that students won't graduate on time leading to widespread unemployment and crime seems like a weak causal connection.

5. **Evaluate the Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - Does the Reason simply restate the Proposition in different words?
   - No, the Reason does bring in additional elements beyond just restating the Proposition.

6. **Evaluate the Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - Does the Proof of Reason assume universal agreement for something still in dispute?
   - The Proof of Reason makes a speculative jump to societal collapse. It doesn't exactly assume universal agreement but exaggerates outcomes.

7. **Evaluate the Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
   - Is the Proof of Reason taken in another sense than intended?
   - There is no clear indication of ambiguous language being used.

### Conclusion of the Type of Defective Argument:

Given the evaluation above, the most fitting classification for the argument appears to center around the speculative connection between the events where the Reason provided leads to an exaggerated consequence.

The argument primarily has elements of an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because the Reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition and the causal link is weak.

However, to adhere to the rule specified:
**If \( <s> \) fits in category \( <G> \), always choose \( <G> \)**

Since \( <s> \) does not fit \( <G> \), the final classification focuses on the weakest parts:
**Main Defective Argument Type**: **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**

#"We can’t freeze the academic year because then students won’t graduate on time. Next thing you know most people will be unemployed and will resort to crime. The crime rate will skyrocket and society will collapse."
**Classification: <IR>**
