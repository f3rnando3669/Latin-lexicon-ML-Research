For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "After Sally presents an eloquent and compelling case for a more equitable taxation system, Sam asks the audience whether we should believe anything from a woman who isn't married, was once arrested, and smells a bit weird.", we will decompose the task of classifying the string into specific steps and then apply each step systematically.

### Decomposition (<D>) of <IDA>:
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - What is the primary assertion or claim in the argument?
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - What reason is given to support the proposition?
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - What additional arguments are used to support the reason?
4. **Identify the Defective Argument Type**:
   - Compare the identified parts with each defective argument type definition to classify the argument.

### Application of <D> to <IDA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - The primary assertion in this context is indirectly questioned. Sam implies that Sally's case for a more equitable taxation system shouldn't be trusted.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Sam suggests that Sally should not be believed because she "isn't married, was once arrested, and smells a bit weird."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - There is no further argument or evidence presented to support these reasons; they serve as the primary reason alone.

4. **Identify the Defective Argument Type**:
   - Now, we will examine which category (if any) this argument fits.

Let's evaluate it against our defective argument types:
- **<G> (Generalization)**: This doesn't fit, as the argument doesn't generalize Sally's status to all similar individuals.
- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: This doesn't fit, as it doesn't enumerate possibilities.
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: This does fit somewhat, since the reasons given do not conclusively prove why the taxation argument should be invalid.
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: This reason does weakly touch upon insufficient causal basis, but doesn't entirely capture the nature of the defective argument here.
- **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: This doesn't fit, since the reason isn't just a repetition.
- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: This doesn't fit, as it doesn't assume universal agreement.
- **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: This isn't about ambiguity in language.

Upon evaluating these categories, it is most closely related to **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**. The reasons Sam presents (Sally's marital status, past arrest, and body odor) are inconclusive and irrelevant to the validity of her argument about taxation.

### Conclusion:
The given string "After Sally presents an eloquent and compelling case for a more equitable taxation system, Sam asks the audience whether we should believe anything from a woman who isn't married, was once arrested, and smells a bit weird." can be classified as type **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason).
