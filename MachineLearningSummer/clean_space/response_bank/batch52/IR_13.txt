For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "Is your stupidity inborn?", we need to decompose the task of classifying the string into specific steps and apply these steps to classify the argument type.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA> (Classification Task)

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine what the main assertion or proposition is in the string.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine if the string provides any reason to support the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Determine if the string presents any additional arguments or evidence to corroborate the reason.

4. **Match Against Known Defective Argument Types:**
   - Compare the identified Proposition, Reason, and Proof of Reason with the definitions of each defective argument type (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

5. **Classify the String:** 
   - Based on your analysis, classify the string into one of the defective argument types. If it fits into category <G> based on the definitions, always choose <G>.

### Apply the Steps to "Is your stupidity inborn?"

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The main proposition in the form of a question here is "Is your stupidity inborn?"

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The string does not seem to provide a clear reason supporting the main assertion. It is essentially a rhetorical question implying that the person addressed possesses inherent stupidity.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - The string does not provide any Proof of Reason. 

4. **Match Against Known Defective Argument Types:**
   - **<G> (Generalization):** The statement does not make a broad generalization about a group; it targets an individual.
   - **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):** The proposition does not involve enumerating possibilities.
   - **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** There is no conclusive or inconclusive reason presented in the statement.
   - **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** There is no repetition of the proposition in a different form.
   - **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** There is no reason or causal basis presented.
   - **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):** There is no appeal to universal agreement on a point that is in dispute.
   - **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):** The phrase could be considered to have a somewhat ambiguous implication, but it is more likely intended as an insult rather than an argument.

5. **Classify the String:**
   - Upon evaluation, the statement "Is your stupidity inborn?" most closely aligns with <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use), as it ambiguously insults by implying inborn stupidity without explicitly stating any reason or providing evidence.

### Conclusion
The classification for "Is your stupidity inborn?" is <DEP> based on the ambiguity that it implies about the nature of the addressed person's intelligence.
