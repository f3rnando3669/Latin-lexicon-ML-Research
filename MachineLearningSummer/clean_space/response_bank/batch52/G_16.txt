For 
To apply the IDAA (the application of decomposing the task of classifying a string into specific steps) to the given example "My first day of basketball practice was easy, so it will always be easy." let's follow each step methodically to identify the type of defective argument it represents.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of Task (D):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):** What is the statement or claim being made?
2. **Identify the Reason (R):** What is the causal basis or reasoning provided for the Proposition?
3. **Analyze the completeness and correctness of Reason (PR):** Evaluate if the Reason supports the Proposition appropriately or if it presents any flaws.
4. **Classify the type of defective argument (IDA):** Based on the flaws identified, classify the argument into one of the faulty categories (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Applying IDAA to "My first day of basketball practice was easy, so it will always be easy."

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - "It will always be easy."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - "My first day of basketball practice was easy."

3. **Analyze the completeness and correctness of Reason (PR):**
   - The reason provided is based on a single instance (the first day), and it extrapolates that this will always be the case. This limited data set does not sufficiently capture the variability and potential challenges of future basketball practices.

4. **Classify the type of defective argument (IDA):**
   - The conclusion ("it will always be easy") is generalized from a single experience. This exemplifies a <G> (Generalization) because it makes an assertion based on one experience (one part) and applies it to all future experiences (all parts). 

### Conclusion:
The given statement "My first day of basketball practice was easy, so it will always be easy." fits into the category <G> for **Generalization**.
