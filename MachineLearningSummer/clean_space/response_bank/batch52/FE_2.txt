For 
Sure, let's apply the defined methodology <IDAA> to the sentence "It is either you are for the US war on terror or against it."

### Step 1: Decompose <IDA> into Specific Steps (<D>)
1. **Identify Elements**: Highlight key components of the argument (Proposition <P>, Reason <R>, and Proof of Reason <PR>) if present.
2. **Check Defective Types**: Compare the components of the argument against each defective argument type (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).
3. **Prioritize Generalization**: If the sentence fits <G>, assign it to <G>.
4. **Classify**: Assign the sentence to the most fitting defective argument type based on identified features.

### Step 2: Apply Steps to Given Sentence "It is either you are for the US war on terror or against it."
#### Identifying Elements:
1. **Proposition (<P>)**: "You are either for the US war on terror or against it."
2. **Reason (<R>)**: Not explicitly stated in the sentence.
3. **Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Not provided in the sentence.

#### Checking Defective Types:
1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The sentence does not make a generalization.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The sentence presents only two options out of a potentially broader spectrum of possibilities. It forces a binary choice.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: There's no reasoning presented within the sentence. Hence, it does not fall into this category.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**, **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**, **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**, **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: These do not apply as no reasoning or proof is provided, and there's no ambiguity or consensus assumption.

### Classify:
Given that the argument presents only two possibilities and disregards any potential alternatives, the classification that fits best is **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**.

#### Conclusion:
The sentence "It is either you are for the US war on terror or against it." is classified as **<FE>** (Incomplete Enumeration).
