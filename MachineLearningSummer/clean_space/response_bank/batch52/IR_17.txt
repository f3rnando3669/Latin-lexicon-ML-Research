For 
To apply IDAA to the task of classifying the statement "You moved the goalposts or made up an exception when your claim was shown to be false," we will decompose this advanced classification task into specific steps and then proceed with the classification step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Application of IDA:

#### Step 1: Understand the Statement
- Identify the core assertion being made.
- Identify the logical structure and the reasoning.

#### Step 2: List Characteristics of Defective Arguments
- Determine which characteristics of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) might apply.
  
#### Step 3: Eliminate Non-Matching Types
- Sequentially check each type of defective argument to see which doesn't fit based on the characteristics identified.

#### Step 4: Final Classification
- Classify the statement based on the remaining possibilities.

### Applying These Steps:

#### Step 1: Understand the Statement
- Core Assertion: The statement accuses someone of changing their criteria (moving the goalposts) or creating an exception when their original claim was proven false.
- Logical Structure: The reasoning suggests that the person is being inconsistent or dishonest by altering their stance after being proven wrong.

#### Step 2: List Characteristics of Defective Arguments
- <G>: Generalization — based on insufficient evidence.
- <FE>: Incomplete Enumeration — claiming a complete set but missing possibilities.
- <IR>: Inconclusive Reason — Reason fails to conclusively support Proposition.
- <RR>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition — Reason repeats or restates the Proposition.
- <WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis — weak causal basis for Proposition.
- <FU>: Presumptuous Consensus — assuming something is true because it is universally agreed upon.
- <DEP>: Ambiguous Language Use — statement can be taken in a different sense than intended.

#### Step 3: Eliminate Non-Matching Types
- <G>: The statement does not make a generalization based on limited evidence.
- <FE>: The statement does not enumerate possibilities incompletely.
- <IR>: The statement is not providing a Reason that fails to conclusively support a Proposition.
- <RR>: The statement does not repeat the Proposition.
- <WCB>: The statement does not offer a weak causal basis.
- <FU>: The statement does not assume universal agreement on a thing in dispute.
- <DEP>: The statement could be ambiguous, as "moved the goalposts" and "made up an exception" can be interpreted differently in different contexts.

#### Step 4: Final Classification
- Based on the above elimination, the most fitting classification for "You moved the goalposts or made up an exception when your claim was shown to be false." is <DEP>.

### Conclusion
The statement is classified as <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use) because it can be taken in different senses regarding the shifting of criteria and creating exceptions, leading to ambiguity in interpretation.
