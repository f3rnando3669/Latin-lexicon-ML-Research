For 
To apply the process \( <IDAA> \) to the task of classifying the argument \("Ghosts exist... because I saw a ghost in my closet,"\) we need to decompose the task into specific steps and then classify the given string according to the definitions provided for defective arguments. Here is the step-by-step decomposition and subsequent analysis:

1. **Identify the Proposition (\<P\>):**
   - The proposition in the argument is: "Ghosts exist."

2. **Identify the Reason (\<R\>):**
   - The reason provided is: "because I saw a ghost in my closet."

3. **Evaluate whether the argument is defective and classify it:**
   - Check if the Proposition (\<P\>) fits the definition of any defective argument types.

Step-by-Step Analysis (\<D\>):

1. **Determine if the argument is a Generalization (\<G\>)**:
   - A generalization would assert that a property of a single or majority of individuals applies to all. In this case, the argument asserts the existence of ghosts based on a single personal experience. Since it is applying the existence of ghosts universally based on one instance, it fits the broader definition of a generalization.
   
2. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)**:
   - Incomplete enumeration would require the argument to claim completeness while excluding other possibilities. This is not relevant to the current string.

3. **Check for Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**:
   - An inconclusive reason would not definitively support the proposition. In this case, the reason is deemed to be inconclusive because a single sighting is not definitive evidence of the existence of ghosts. However, this falls more squarely under Generalization.

4. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**:
   - This checks for weak causation. The reason "seeing a ghost in my closet" could be weak, but it is not strictly assessing causation here.

5. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)**:
   - The reason provided must not simply repeat the proposition. This argument does not fall under this category.

6. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)**:
   - This argument does not claim universal agreement explicitly.

7. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)**:
   - The language used here is not ambiguous.

Based on the step-by-step analysis, the defective argument type that \("Ghosts exist... because I saw a ghost in my closet,"\) fits best into is:

**Generalization (\<G\>)**

This is because it draws a broad conclusion that "ghosts exist" from a singular personal experience, which is a hallmark of a generalization fallacy.
