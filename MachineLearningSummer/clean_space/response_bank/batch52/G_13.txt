For 
To apply \(<IDAA>\) to the string "Men score better on math than women do. Jerry is a man. Therefore, Jerry is better at math than Sylvia, who is a woman.", we will decompose the task \(<t>\) of classifying the argument into specific steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Here, the proposition is: "Jerry is better at math than Sylvia."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason given is: "Men score better on math than women do."

3. **Evaluate the connection between <P> and <R>:**
   - Determine if the reason provided sufficiently and correctly supports the proposition.

4. **Determine if there are any additional arguments that corroborate the Reason (<Proof of Reason, PR>):**
   - There doesn't appear to be an additional argument to support the reason given here.

Next, we will evaluate if the provided argument fits into any of the categories of defective arguments:

1. **Check for Generalization (<G>):**
   - The proposition "Men score better on math than women do" is a generalization. It assumes a universal truth based on a likely partial or statistically averaged observation, potentially ignoring variations among individuals.
   - Since the presence of a generalization takes precedence in classification, this string fits as a type <G>.

Therefore, based on \(<IDAA>\) decomposition and the evaluation, the string "Men score better on math than women do. Jerry is a man. Therefore, Jerry is better at math than Sylvia, who is a woman." is classified as:
- <G>: **Generalization**
