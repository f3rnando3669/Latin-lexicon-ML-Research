For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "Some students who attend tutoring over the summer are not very intelligent. Since Beth attended summer tutoring, she is not a very good student.", we'll follow the steps of decomposition and classification:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>) and Classification (<IDA>)

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
    - **<P>**: Beth is not a very good student.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
    - **<R>**: Beth attended summer tutoring.

3. **Analyze the Reason to see if it supports the Proposition adequately**:
    - We need to see if the Reason (<R>) "Beth attended summer tutoring" has a causal basis that justifies the Proposition (<P>) "Beth is not a very good student."

4. **Identify any relevant defective argument type (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>)**:

    - The statement "Some students who attend tutoring over the summer are not very intelligent" involves making a generalization based on a subset of a population (students who attend summer tutoring). The assertion about Beth ("Beth is not a very good student") is derived from this generalization.
    - This fits the definition of a **Generalization (G)**: An assertion based on some part of individuals but not necessarily applicable to all.

Having gone through these steps, we can classify the statement as:

**<G> Generalization.**

### Explanation:

The argument makes a broad generalization about students who attend summer tutoring and applies this generalization specifically to Beth without valid reasoning. The reason provided does not adequately support the conclusion because it relies on a stereotype that some students who attend tutoring are not intelligent, which is not a universally applicable truth.
