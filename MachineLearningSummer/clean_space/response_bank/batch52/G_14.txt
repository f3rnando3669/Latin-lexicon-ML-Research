To apply the IDAA (the application of task decomposition to the task of classifying a defective argument), let's break the task into specific steps and analyze the given string "The United States is the wealthiest nation in the world. So every American is wealthy."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of the Task (D):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Analyze the string and determine what statement the argument is trying to prove.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine the causal basis provided to support the proposition.

3. **Assess the Proposition and Reason:**
   - Evaluate whether the reason conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the proposition.
   - Determine whether the causal basis for the proposition is compelling or sufficient.
   - Identify if there's any faulty repetition or presumptuous consensus.
   
4. **Identify any Defective Argument Types:**
   - Look for characteristics of defective argument types such as Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Presumptuous Consensus, and Ambiguous Language Use.

5. **Classify the Argument:**
   - Assign the argument to the appropriate defective argument category based on the identified characteristics.

### Applying IDAA to the Given String:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- Proposition (<P>): "Every American is wealthy."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- Reason (<R>): "The United States is the wealthiest nation in the world."

#### Step 3: Assess the Proposition and Reason
- The argument claims that because the United States as a country is wealthy, every individual American is wealthy. This does not consider individual variations in wealth distribution, ignoring the evidence of significant economic inequality within any country.

#### Step 4: Identify any Defective Argument Types
- This argument is a **Generalization** (<G>) because it infers that all individuals within a nation share the nation's overall characteristic of wealth. This is an overgeneralization based on the national average without recognizing individual disparities.

#### Step 5: Classify the Argument
- Classification: <G>

In conclusion, the argument given "The United States is the wealthiest nation in the world. So every American is wealthy." fits the category of a Generalization (<G>).
