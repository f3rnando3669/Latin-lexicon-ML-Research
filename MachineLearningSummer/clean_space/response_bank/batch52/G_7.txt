For 
Let's apply the steps for the task <IDAA> (which involves applying the process of decomposition <D> to the task of identifying the argument type <IDA>) to the statement "the following is an example of...".

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <t> (applying <D> to <IDA>):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   The statement doesn't contain a clear proposition aimed at proving something. "The following is an example of..." seems to be introductory and does not assert a proposition.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   Since there's no clear Proposition, there cannot be a Reason provided to support it. The statement itself is leading to an example, not creating an argument.

3. **Classify into Argument Types (General analysis for <IDA>):**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** No generalization is made; the statement lacks a sweeping assertion or claim.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The statement doesn't enumerate possibilities or ignore pertinent ones.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Since no Reason is provided, this does not apply.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Again, with no Reason, there canâ€™t be a test for weak causality.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** There is no repetition, as the statement is not structured as a proposition with repeated reasoning.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** There is no claim of universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The phrase is clear in its intention to introduce an example and does not use ambiguous language.

### Conclusion:
Based on the steps of <IDAA>, the statement "the following is an example of..." does not fit any of the categories <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>. Therefore, it is not classified as a defective argument under the given definitions.

In summary, the phrase "the following is an example of..." is a meta-statement introducing an example and does not constitute an argument. Therefore, it isn't applicable to classify it into any of the defective argument types.
