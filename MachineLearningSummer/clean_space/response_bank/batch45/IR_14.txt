For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "Did John ever give up his bad habits?", we need to follow the steps of decomposing <IDA> to classify the argument type.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>):

1. **Identify the proposition and reason (if any)**: 
   - Proposition (P): Implied bad habits of John.
   - Reason (R): The question of whether John gave them up based on the assumption that he had bad habits in the past.

2. **Analyze the argument for defects**:
   - Examine if there are any known fallacies or defects in the argumentative structure.
   - Check if the proposition is a generalization, incomplete enumeration, inconclusive reason, etc.

3. **Classify the fallacy or defect type**:

Let's analyze the given string step-by-step:

1. **Identify the proposition and reason (if any)**:
   - The proposition is implied: "John had bad habits."
   - The reason: It's a question about whether John stopped his bad habits.
   
2. **Analyze the argument for defects**:
   - The question presumes that John had bad habits without providing evidence or context.
   - This presumption leads the listener to inadvertently confirm John's bad habits' existence.

3. **Classify the fallacy or defect type**:
   - This is an example of a "loaded question" or a "complex question" fallacy, where it assumes a premise that has not been proven.

Given the classifications available in the definitions provided:
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The reason is not conclusive since the question itself creates an implication without evidence.
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: It missed other pertinent possibilities about John's habits.
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: The question presupposes a fact and leverages ambiguity.

### Final Classification:
- While it's tempting to classify this as <DEP>, the best fit is **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason), as the suggestion about the bad habits is not conclusively established.

### Summary:
In this case, the decomposition of the task (<D>) helped classify the given string as having an **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** type of defective argument, since it assumes the presence of bad habits without definitive proof.
