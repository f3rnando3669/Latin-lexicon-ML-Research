For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the statement "You moved the goalposts or made up an exception when your claim was shown to be false," we need to break down the process of identifying the type of defective argument step by step.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA> (`<D>`):
1. **Identify the Central Proposition (`<P>`)**:
   - Determine what central claim or statement is being made.

2. **Identify the Reason (`<R>`)**:
   - Determine the reason or evidence presented to support the central proposition.

3. **Identify the Type of Defective Argument (`<G>`, `<FE>`, `<IR>`, `<RR>`, `<WCB>`, `<FU>`, `<DEP>`)**:
   - Analyze the relationship between the central proposition and the reason to classify which type of defective argument it represents.

### Decomposition of the Statement:
We start with breaking down the statement "You moved the goalposts or made up an exception when your claim was shown to be false."

1. **Identify the Central Proposition (`<P>`)**:
   The central proposition can be inferred as:
   - "Your claim was shown to be false."

2. **Identify the Reason (`<R>`)**:
   The reason provided is:
   - "You moved the goalposts or made up an exception."

3. **Compare Proposition and Reason**:
   - The claim involves changing the criteria for accepting a conclusion after the original claim has been challenged or refuted.

### Classification (`<IDA>`):
- **Moving the goalposts** often involves changing the criterion for success or proof to something more difficult or impossible when the original criterion has been met or disproved.

Given this breakdown, the classification of the statement "You moved the goalposts or made up an exception when your claim was shown to be false" falls under `<IR>`:

- **Inconclusive Reason (`<IR>`)**: Here, the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition because the argument essentially shifts the objective instead of providing valid evidence for the original claim.

### Final Application of <IDAA> on the Given String:
1. Identify the Central Proposition (`<P>`): 
   - "Your claim was shown to be false."
2. Identify the Reason (`<R>`): 
   - "You moved the goalposts or made up an exception."
3. Compare Proposition and Reason to determine the type of defective argument:
   - The reasoning involves changing the criteria rather than providing conclusive evidence, which aligns with `<IR>` (Inconclusive Reason).

Thus, the statement "You moved the goalposts or made up an exception when your claim was shown to be false" is classified as an example of `<IR>`.
