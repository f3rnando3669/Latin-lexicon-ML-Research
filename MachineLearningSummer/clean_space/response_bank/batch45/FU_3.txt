For 
To apply <IDAA> to classify the given string "Trump cites (biased) poll results showing that people think he’s a strong leader to prove a point that he is a strong leader. ABC News/Washington Post Poll (wrong big on election) said almost all stand by their vote on me & 53% said strong leader," we will follow these steps:

### Decomposition (<D>) into specific steps:

1. **Identify the proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine what is being asserted or claimed in the string.

2. **Identify the reason (<R>):**
   - Determine the causal basis or justification provided for the proposition.

3. **Check for proof of reason (<PR>):**
   - Look for any evidence that corroborates the reason, ensuring it supports the assertion presented.

4. **Identify any defective argument types:**
   - Look for specific patterns in reasoning that match known logical fallacies.

### Application of <D> to <IDA>:

1. **Identify the proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition: Trump is a strong leader.
   
2. **Identify the reason (<R>):**
   - Reason: Poll results showing people think he’s a strong leader (ABC News/Washington Post Poll said almost all stand by their vote on Trump & 53% said he’s a strong leader).

3. **Check for proof of reason (<PR>):**
   - Proof of Reason: Trump cites biased poll results.

4. **Identify any defective argument types:**
   - The argument relies on popular opinion (poll results) to assert his leadership quality.

### Classification under defective argument types:

- **Proposition (<P>):** Trump is a strong leader.
- **Reason (<R>):** Poll results showing people think he’s a strong leader.
- **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** ABC News/Washington Post Poll results.
   
Since the reason given relies on the consensus or popularity to validate the claim, this matches a type of defective argument known as **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**.

### Conclusion:

The string "Trump cites (biased) poll results showing that people think he’s a strong leader to prove a point that he is a strong leader. ABC News/Washington Post Poll (wrong big on election) said almost all stand by their vote on me & 53% said strong leader." can be classified as **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**, because it assumes something is true (Trump being a strong leader) based on it being a popular opinion according to the cited poll.
