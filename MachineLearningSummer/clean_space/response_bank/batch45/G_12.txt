Sure, let's apply the steps required to classify the string "It’s getting late, and we still have to decide on the school budget. What do you say we just leave it as is and we can call it a night?" under the given classification system:

### Step 1: Identify Components and Overall Intention
First, identify the main components of the argument and its overall intention:
- **Main components**: The statement emphasizes that it is getting late and suggests leaving the budget as is.
- **Overall intention**: The intention is to avoid making a decision on the school budget by highlighting that it's late and suggesting a call to end the meeting.

### Step 2: Analyze Reasoning and Proposition
Next, analyze the reasoning and proposition within the statement:
- **Proposition (<P>)**: Leave the school budget as is.
- **Reason (<R>)**: It's getting late, suggesting an end to the discussion without making changes.

### Step 3: Evaluate Defective Argument Types
Evaluate the identified components against the defective argument types defined earlier:
- **<G> Generalization**: Doesn't fit as it doesn't make broad, unsupported generalizations.
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: Doesn’t fit as it doesn’t present a limited set of options while ignoring others.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: Fits, since the reasoning “it’s getting late” does not conclusively justify the proposition to leave the budget unchanged.
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: Doesn’t fit as it doesn’t loop the proposition with its reason.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: Fits, since suggesting leaving the budget unchanged based on the late hour is an insufficient cause for such a decision.
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: Doesn’t fit this classification, as there’s no appeal to what others believe or are doing.
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: Doesn’t fit as the language isn't ambiguous in the sense required by this fallacy.

### Step 4: Determine the Best Classification
Given the analysis, the statement primarily fits under **<IR> Inconclusive Reason** because "It’s getting late" does not provide a conclusive reason for leaving the school budget unchanged. It could also be considered as **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**, but as "inconclusive reason" more directly addresses the idea of the reason not compelling enough to support the conclusion, it’s the more fitting category.

### Conclusion
The string "It’s getting late, and we still have to decide on the school budget. What do you say we just leave it as is and we can call it a night?" is best classified as **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**.

This completes the decomposed steps applied to the identification task (IDAA) for the given string.
