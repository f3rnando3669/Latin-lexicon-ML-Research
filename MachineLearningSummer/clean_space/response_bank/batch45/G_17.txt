For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "We can’t freeze the academic year because then students won’t graduate on time. Next thing you know most people will be unemployed and will resort to crime. The crime rate will skyrocket and society will collapse.", we need to take it step by step and decompose the task of classifying the argument:

### Step 1: Identify the Main Components of the Argument
1. **Proposition (<P>)**: The main claim or proposition is that "We can’t freeze the academic year."
2. **Reason (<R>)**: The reason given for this proposition is "because then students won’t graduate on time."
3. **Additional Reasoning (Leading to Claim)**: This is the further reasoning provided for the consequence of students not graduating on time: "Next thing you know most people will be unemployed and will resort to crime. The crime rate will skyrocket and society will collapse."

### Step 2: Analyze the Type of Defective Argument

1. **Assess for Generalization (<G>)**:
   - Does the argument make broad, unsupported generalizations about a group based on insufficient data?
   - No, the argument is not making generalizations about a group.

2. **Assess for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - Does the argument falsely claim to have captured all possible scenarios, but actually misses some out?
   - No, the argument is not presenting an incomplete enumeration.

3. **Assess for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - Does the reason provided fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
   - This could be considered, but the main issue is more focused on a slippery slope.

4. **Assess for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - Is the reason provided simply repeating the proposition in different words?
   - No, the reason is not just a restatement of the proposition.

5. **Assess for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - Does the causal basis for the proposition fail because it is not compelling or logically sound?
   - The causal chain is indeed weak, but the argument's primary issue seems to be escalating consequences illogically.

6. **Assess for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - Does the argument assume something is certain because it's universally agreed upon while it is still in dispute?
   - No, this fallacy does not assume consensus as part of its reasoning.

7. **Assess for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
   - Is language used in a way that can be taken in another sense than what the speaker intended?
   - No, the argument does not use ambiguous language.

### Step 3: Determine the Best Classification

The argument claims that freezing the academic year will lead to students not graduating on time, which will cause societal collapse. This seems to be an example of a **Slippery Slope** fallacy, where a relatively small first step is suggested to lead to a chain of related events culminating in some significant (usually negative) effect, but it doesn't provide evidence that those escalations are inevitable.

### Conclusion

The argument "We can’t freeze the academic year because then students won’t graduate on time. Next thing you know most people will be unemployed and will resort to crime. The crime rate will skyrocket and society will collapse." is best classified as an example of:

**Defective Argument Type: <WCB> - Insufficient Causal Basis**

- Reason (<R>): "because then students won’t graduate on time."
- Claiming that this will lead to unemployment, increased crime, and societal collapse is weak and unsupported (Insufficient Causal Basis).
