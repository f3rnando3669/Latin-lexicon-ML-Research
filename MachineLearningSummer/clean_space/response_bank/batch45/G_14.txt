For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the argument "The United States is the wealthiest nation in the world. So every American is wealthy," we will decompose the classification process into specific steps and then follow those steps sequentially:

### Decomposition of <IDA> (D):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine the main proposition or assertion in the argument.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the reasoning or causal basis provided for the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Determine if there are additional arguments corroborating the reason.
4. **Classify the Argument Type**: Analyze the argument to identify any defective reasoning or fallacies present.
5. **Match with Defective Argument Types**: Compare the argument against known defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

### Application to the Given Argument:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The main assertion in the argument is:
- **<P>**: "Every American is wealthy."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reasoning provided for the proposition is:
- **<R>**: "The United States is the wealthiest nation in the world."

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
In this case, there are no additional arguments provided to support the reason.

#### Step 4: Classify the Argument Type
We need to analyze the reasoning to find out if the reasoning provided (that the U.S. is the wealthiest nation) logically supports the conclusion (that every American is wealthy).

#### Step 5: Match with Defective Argument Types
We compare the reasoning with known defective argument types:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: Making an assertion about all individuals based on a fact about the group.
  - The argument claims that because the U.S. as a whole is wealthy, every individual American is wealthy. This assumes that the wealth of the nation is equally distributed among all its citizens, which is not necessarily true.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: A fallacy where the enumeration of possibilities is incomplete.
  - The argument overlooks the fact that wealth within a nation is not uniformly distributed and that there are significant disparities in wealth among Americans.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: When the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
  - The wealth of a nation does not directly imply that all citizens are wealthy.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: When the reason is just a restatement of the proposition.
  - The argument is not repeating the same thing in different words, so this fallacy does not apply here.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: When the causal basis for the reason is not compelling.
  - The causal link between the wealth of the nation and the wealth of every individual is insufficient.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Assuming a thing is true because it is universally agreed upon.
  - The argument does not claim that 'everyone agrees,' so this fallacy does not apply.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: When terms have multiple meanings.
  - The language in the argument is clear without significant ambiguity.

After careful analysis, the most fitting classification is:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument assumes that the wealth of the United States as a nation directly implies that all its individuals are wealthy, which is an unwarranted generalization.

### Conclusion
Classify the argument "The United States is the wealthiest nation in the world. So every American is wealthy." as of type **Generalization (<G>)**.
