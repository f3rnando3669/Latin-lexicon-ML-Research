For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "I didn’t steal your pen—I borrowed it", let us decompose the task into specific steps and then follow these steps to identify the type of argument.

### Step 1: Extract the Proposition (P)
Identify the main claim or proposition made in the statement.

**Proposition**: The individual did not steal the pen.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
Determine the reason given to support the proposition.

**Reason**: The pen was borrowed, not stolen.

### Step 3: Evaluate the Reason (R)
Check if the reason conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the proposition.

- Borrowing typically implies permission, while stealing does not. The statement hinges on the perception of the action (borrow vs. steal).

### Step 4: Identify the Type of Defective Argument
Using the definitions of the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>, classify the argument.

- **Generalization (G)**: Not applicable, as this is not a generalization but a specific incident.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable, as there is no enumeration involved.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Potentially applicable, as the reasoning hinges on the definition of borrowing versus stealing. If the pen was taken without permission and the terms are used interchangeably, this might be misleading.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Not applicable, as the argument does not merely restate the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Not applicable, as insufficient causal basis does not apply here.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Not applicable, as there is no appeal to popularity or consensus.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Highly applicable, as the argument relies on the ambiguity of the terms "steal" and "borrow".

**Classification**: <DEP>, Ambiguous Language Use.

The statement "I didn’t steal your pen—I borrowed it" employs ambiguous language. The words "steal" and "borrow" have different connotations and legal/moral implications, and the speaker is using the ambiguity of "borrow" to deflect the accusation of "stealing", without addressing whether permission was granted to take the pen.

### Conclusion
The defective argument type for the statement "I didn’t steal your pen—I borrowed it" is <DEP> due to the ambiguous language use.
