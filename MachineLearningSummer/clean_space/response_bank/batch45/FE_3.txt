To apply the process of decomposing and then classifying the argument from the given string "The museum's new gemstones and precious minerals exhibit needs more security guards. If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal a piece of the exhibit", we can take the following steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the proposition (<P>):**
   - "The museum's new gemstones and precious minerals exhibit needs more security guards."

2. **Identify the reason (<R>):**
   - "If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal a piece of the exhibit."

3. **Determine the classification:**
   - Look for standard fallacies or defects in the argument.

### Classification based on identified statements:

- **Step 1: Check for <G> (Generalization):**
  - <P> is a specific statement about security guards for a specific exhibit, not a generalized statement about a group or trend, so it is not <G>.

- **Step 2: Check for <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):**
  - This doesn’t involve falsely presenting a dichotomy as a complete enumeration of possibilities.

- **Step 3: Check for <IR> (Inconclusive Reason):**
  - The reason provided ("If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition that more security guards are needed.

- **Step 4: Check for <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):**
  - The reason provided is not a repetition of the proposition; it is an unrelated accusation.

- **Step 5: Check for <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):**
  - The argument does not establish a basis for causation; it’s implying a false link between disagreement and criminal intent, not an actual cause-effect relationship.

- **Step 6: Check for <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):**
  - The reason assumes that anyone who disagrees is a thief, rather than assuming a universal belief or consensus.

- **Step 7: Check for <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):**
  - The argument does not rely on any ambiguous language or terminology that can be misinterpreted.

### Conclusion:

The defect in the argument fits best with <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration). The argument presents an "either/or" scenario (either you agree with more security or you must be planning to steal something), missing other potential reasons someone might disagree.

**Classification:** <FE>

Thus, the argument "The museum's new gemstones and precious minerals exhibit needs more security guards. If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal a piece of the exhibit." is classified as **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**.
