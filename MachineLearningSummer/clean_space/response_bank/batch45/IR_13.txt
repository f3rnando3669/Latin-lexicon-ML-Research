For 
To apply <IDAA> to "Is your stupidity inborn?", we need to decompose the classification task (<IDA>) of this string step by step. Hereâ€™s how we can break it down:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Read and Understand the Statement**:
   - Analyze the given string: "Is your stupidity inborn?" 

2. **Identify the Components**:
   - Identify any propositions (P), reasons (R), or proofs of reasons (PR) within the statement.

3. **Compare Against Defective Arguments**:
   - Compare the statement against the definitions and examples of defective argument types: 
     - **Generalization (G)**
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
     - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
     - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**
 
4. **Determine the Match**:
   - Match the statement with one of the defective argument types by analyzing its structure and intended meaning.

### Applying the Steps:

1. **Read and Understand the Statement**:
   - The statement: "Is your stupidity inborn?" suggests an inquiry into whether someone's perceived stupidity is a natural, intrinsic quality.

2. **Identify the Components**:
   - There is an implicit proposition that someone is "stupid".
   - The reason (R) is implied in the term "inborn," suggesting causality (i.e., stupidity is a result of birth traits).

3. **Compare Against Defective Arguments**:

   - **Generalization (G)**: The statement does not appear to generalize from one instance.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement does not involve choosing between incomplete options.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: No explicit reason is given or discussed.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: No repetition of proposition is evident.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The term "inborn" suggests causality without proof, making this a potential match.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: No consensus or popularity appeal is presented.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The term "stupidity" is straightforward but the concept of it being "inborn" could be ambiguous without context.

4. **Determine the Match**:
   - **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The most fitting classification seems to be <WCB> because it attributes the cause of "stupidity" to being "inborn" without establishing a causal basis. This implies that the reason (R) provided for the proposition (P) is not compelling or substantiated.

### Final Classification:
- **"Is your stupidity inborn?"** is best classified as **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.

This is because the statement suggests a cause (inborn traits) for a proposition (stupidity) without providing sufficient causal evidence to support that claim.
