For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the argument "I guess I should buy my 12-year-old daughter an iPhone. Everyone at her new school has one and I want her to fit in with the other kids," we follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the relevant argument type categories
The given categories for defective arguments are:
- **<G>** Generalization
- **<FE>** Incomplete Enumeration
- **<IR>** Inconclusive Reason
- **<RR>** Faulty Repetition of Proposition
- **<WCB>** Insufficient Causal Basis
- **<FU>** Presumptuous Consensus
- **<DEP>** Ambiguous Language Use

### Step 2: Analyze the structure of the given argument
Let's break down the argument:
- **Proposition (P)**: "I should buy my 12-year-old daughter an iPhone."
- **Reason (R)**: "Everyone at her new school has one and I want her to fit in with the other kids."

### Step 3: Match the structure and reasoning to the categories
- **Generalization** (<G>): This does not seem to apply since the argument is specific to the situation rather than making a broad generalization.
- **Incomplete Enumeration** (<FE>): This does not apply because the argument does not list out options or miss pertinent ones.
- **Inconclusive Reason** (<IR>): This does not seem to apply since the reason is not addressing a different topic from the proposition directly.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition** (<RR>): There is no circular logic here where the premise repeats the conclusion.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis** (<WCB>): The causal relationship between buying an iPhone and fitting in is weak but not the primary flaw here.
- **Presumptuous Consensus** (<FU>): The argument is appealing to the popularity of having iPhones to justify the purchase.
- **Ambiguous Language Use** (<DEP>): There is no misuse of ambiguous language in the argument.

### Step 4: Determine the most fitting category
The argument relies on the idea that because everyone else has an iPhone, the daughter must also have one to fit in. This is a classic example of:

- **Presumptuous Consensus** (<FU>): The faulty reasoning here is based on the assumption that something should be done because everyone else is doing it.

Thus, the classification of the given argument is **<FU>** (Presumptuous Consensus).

### Conclusion
The argument "I guess I should buy my 12-year-old daughter an iPhone. Everyone at her new school has one and I want her to fit in with the other kids," is classified as **<FU>**, which stands for Presumptuous Consensus.
