For 
To apply <IDAA> to "Men score better on math than women do. Jerry is a man. Therefore, Jerry is better at math than Sylvia, who is a woman.":

1. **Decompose the task <IDA> into specific steps (<D>):**
   - **Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Identify what is being proposed or concluded.
   - **Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>):** Identify the causal basis or the reasoning provided to support the proposition.
   - **Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Determine if the reason is corroborated with additional arguments or evidence, and check if it has any logical issues.
   - **Step 4: Classify the type of argument:** Determine if the argument falls into any of the defective argument categories defined: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

2. **Apply the steps to the given statement:**
   - **Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>):** 
     - Proposition (P): Jerry is better at math than Sylvia.
   - **Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>):**
     - Reason (R): Men score better on math than women do. Jerry is a man and Sylvia is a woman.
   - **Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
     - The proof of reason is indirectly suggested by the general statement that men score better on math than women.
   - **Step 4: Classify the type of argument:**
     - Examination of the argument reveals a generalization about the math scores of men and women.
     - The argument concludes Jerry is better at math than Sylvia based on this generalization.

3. **Classification (<IDA>):**
   - The specific type of defective argument this falls into is **Generalization (<G>)**. The reason being, the argument assumes that because men, on average, score better on math than women, any specific man must be better at math than any specific woman, which is a hasty generalization based on the group characteristic applied to individuals without accounting for individual variabilities.

Therefore, the classification of the statement "Men score better on math than women do. Jerry is a man. Therefore, Jerry is better at math than Sylvia, who is a woman." is <G>.
