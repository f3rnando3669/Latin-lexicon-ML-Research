For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the <IDA> task into specific steps) for classifying the given sentence, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>) in the Sentence:**
   - Proposition (<P>): Helen still having problems with her drug habit.
   - Reason (<R>): The statement made by Grace inquiring about Helen's drug habit implies an assertion.

2. **Check for Defective Argument Types:**
   - Generalization (<G>): Check if the argument is a generalization, which usually applies a specific case to all.
   - Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>): Check if there is a claim presenting limited options and ignoring others.
   - Inconclusive Reason (<IR>): Check if the reason provided fails to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>): Check if the reason is just a repetition of the proposition.
   - Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>): Check if the reason provided for the proposition is weak.
   - Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>): Check if the reason assumes consensus as evidence.
   - Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>): Check if ambiguous language is used to mislead.

3. **Analyze the Sentence for Each Type:**
    - The sentence features a premise where Grace asks about Helen's purported drug problem, but it is designed to imply that Helen indeed has a drug habit without direct evidence. This sentence leverages an implicit, damaging claim under scrutiny.

4. **Classify the Argument:**
    - This particular case closely aligns with **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**, where the language and context imply a meaning that may be different from the straightforward interpretation, thus misleading the audience.

**Classification:** <DEP>

Example:
"Grace and Helen were both romantically interested in Brad. One day, with Brad sitting within earshot, Grace asked in an inquisitive tone whether Helen was still having problems with her drug habit."

Following the steps, we classified the given string as of type <DEP> due to the misleading implication made by Grace's question.
