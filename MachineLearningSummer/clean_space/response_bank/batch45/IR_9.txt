For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the argument type of the string "Studies show that it takes up to seven years for the human body to digest a piece of gum," we will decompose the task into specific steps and classify the string accordingly.

### Steps for Decomposition (<D>)

1. **Identify the Claim**: Understand the proposition or claim presented in the string.
2. **Understand the Reasoning**: Identify the reasoning or evidence used to support the claim.
3. **Check for Argument Types**: Compare the reasoning with known defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>).
4. **Classify the Argument Type**: Determine which defective argument type, if any, fits the reasoning provided in the string.

### Application of Decomposition to Classification (<IDAA>)

#### Step 1: Identify the Claim
The claim in the string is: "Studies show that it takes up to seven years for the human body to digest a piece of gum."

#### Step 2: Understand the Reasoning
The reasoning here is implying a long-term effect of chewing gum based on purported scientific studies without providing further context or specifics.

#### Step 3: Check for Argument Types
Let's analyze the string against each defective argument type:

- **<G> (Generalization)**: The string does not appear to be generalizing based on limited examples.
- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: The string does not present an incomplete enumeration of possibilities; it directly makes a factual claim.
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: This might be relevant as the reasoning (studies show) is vague and potentially inconclusive.
- **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: The string does not appear to simply repeat the proposition as its reason.
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: It might fit here too because the claim about gum digestion duration lacks substantial causal basis or scientific backing.
- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: The string does not rely on a presumed consensus.
- **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: The string's language is not ambiguous; it is very specific in its claim.

#### Step 4: Classify the Argument Type
Given the reasoning is both potentially inconclusive and lacking substantial causal basis, the argument type most fitting would be:

- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: Because it claims "studies show" without providing specific studies or concrete evidence, leading to an inconclusive reason for the claim.
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: Because the statement presents an inadequately supported idea about the duration it takes to digest gum.

Given both options, the most immediate classification would be:

**Classification**: **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**

This classification fits well as the claim is relying on an unsupported premise without substantial evidence.

### Final Classification:
- "Studies show that it takes up to seven years for the human body to digest a piece of gum." is of type **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
