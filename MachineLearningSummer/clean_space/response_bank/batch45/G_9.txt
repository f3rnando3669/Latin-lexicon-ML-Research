To apply the decomposition of the task of classifying the string into one of the defective arguments to the given string, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition <P>**: Determine what the main assertion is.
2. **Examine the Reason <R>**: Look at the reasons given to support the proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason <PR>**: Check if the reasons are supported by logical arguments or data.
4. **Classify the Argument**: Based on the characteristics of Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>), classify the argument.

**Step-by-Step Application**:

1. **Identify the Proposition <P>**:
   - The main assertion in the statement is: "You better take the story of Adam and Eve literally."

2. **Examine the Reason <R>**:
   - The reasons given to support this proposition follow a sequence:
     - If you accept the story of Adam and Eve as figurative,
     - then you will do the same for other Old Testament stories,
     - which will lead to New Testament stories not making sense,
     - which will lead to believing the resurrection of Jesus was spiritual,
     - which will lead to not being a Christian,
     - then you will become an atheist,
     - then you will have no morals,
     - and start having sex with animals.
  
3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason <PR>**:
   - The chain of reasoning here implies several causations that are not supported by logical arguments or evidence. Since one event (accepting a story as figurative) supposedly leads to a series of extreme outcomes without providing substantial proof that these steps necessarily follow each other, the proof of the reasons is highly questionable.

4. **Classify the Argument**:
   - The argument seems to follow a "slippery slope" pattern where one minor step (accepting a story as figurative) is suggested to inevitably lead to extreme and unrelated consequences (bestiality).
   - This type of argument often fits the category of **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** because it assumes a causal relationship where none logically exists. It could also be seen as using **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** by failing to consider other possibilities and presenting only two extreme outcomes.
   
Hence, the given statement involves an argument type primarily classified as **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
