For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to the statement "My first day of basketball practice was easy, so it will always be easy," we need to decompose the task of classifying the string into specific steps and then execute those steps. Here is the detailed step-by-step process:

### Decomposition (\( D \)):

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( P \))**:
   - Determine the main statement or assertion that the string is making.
   
2. **Identify the Reason (\( R \))**:
   - Identify the causal basis or reasoning provided that supports the main assertion.
   
3. **Classify the Argument Type**:
   - Determine which type of argument the statement represents: \( \langle G \rangle \), \( \langle FE \rangle \), \( \langle IR \rangle \), \( \langle RR \rangle \), \( \langle WCB \rangle \), \( \langle FU \rangle \), or \( \langle DEP \rangle \).

4. **Validate the Reasoning**:
   - Check if the reasoning is logically valid and if it actually supports the proposition.

### Application (\( IDAA \)):

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( P \))**:
   - The main assertion here is: "Basketball practice will always be easy."

2. **Identify the Reason (\( R \))**:
   - The reason provided is: "My first day of basketball practice was easy."

3. **Classify the Argument Type**:
   - The statement is making a generalized conclusion based on a single instance or experience. 

4. **Validate the Reasoning**:
   - The reasoning provided here is not logically sound because it assumes that the ease of the first day of practice will definitively predict the ease of all future practices without considering other variables and experiences.

5. **Final Classification**:
   - By evaluating the reasoning, we can see that the argument type is a \( \langle G \rangle \) or Generalization, because it generalizes the experience of one day to all future days without sufficient causal basis or additional evidence.

### Conclusion:
The statement "My first day of basketball practice was easy, so it will always be easy." can be classified as a defective argument type of **Generalization (\( \langle G \rangle \))**.
