For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "The more things change, the more they remain the same.", we'll follow the defined process step-by-step:

### Step 1: Decompose <IDA> into specific steps
First, we need to outline the steps for classifying the string based on the defined defective argument types:

1. **Read and understand the string**.
2. **Identify key claims or propositions within the string**.
3. **Analyze the logical structure and look for any fallacies** using definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.
4. **Match the analysis to the most appropriate defective argument type**.

### Step 2: Apply these steps to the given string

#### Step 2.1: Read and understand the string
"The more things change, the more they remain the same."

#### Step 2.2: Identify key claims or propositions within the string
The string seems to present a paradoxical statement that on the surface does not logically follow. It essentially says that, despite apparent changes, things fundamentally do not change.

#### Step 2.3: Analyze the logical structure and look for any fallacies

1. **Is there a Generalization (<G>)?**
   - This does not fit under Generalization since it does not make a broad claim about a group based on insufficient evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)?**
   - The string does not list out possibilities or scenarios incompletely.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)?**
   - There's no causal basis being claimed; instead, it relates more to a tautological or contradictory structure rather than an incorrect causal argument.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)?**
   - The structure here seems repetitive in a way that almost defines itself through repetition, but it does not precisely fit the definition of simply restating the initial proposition.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)?**
   - It does not attempt to establish a causal relationship that would involve faulty logic on causality.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)?**
   - There is no appeal to what is commonly believed or the majority opinion.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)?**
   - The phrase does contain an element of paradox, suggesting that changes (a word with clear meaning in one context) lead to things remaining the same (where 'remaining the same' seems contradictory to 'change'). This implies a use of ambiguous language where the word 'change' and its expectations are played against their usual meaning.

#### Step 2.4: Match the analysis to the most appropriate defective argument type

Given the analysis, the most fitting defective argument type for this string is **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**. The phrase uses the word "change" and "remain the same" in a paradoxical, ambiguous way that plays on the expected meanings of these terms.

### Conclusion

The string "The more things change, the more they remain the same." is classified as <DEP>: Ambiguous Language Use.
