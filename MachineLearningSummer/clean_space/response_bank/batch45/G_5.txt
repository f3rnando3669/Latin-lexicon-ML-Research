Sure, let's decompose the task <IDAA>, which involves decomposing <IDA> (the task of classifying the given string as one of the defective argument types), into specific steps.

### Decomposition of Task <IDA> into Specific Steps

1. **Understand the Argument:** Read and understand the argument presented in the given string.
  
2. **Identify Key Components:** Identify the key components of the argument, such as the proposition, reason, and any supporting or additional arguments.

3. **Match with Definitions:** Compare the identified components against the definitions of defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

4. **Classify the Argument:** Determine which type of defective argument the given string most closely matches based on the comparison.

### Apply <D> to <IDA>

Let's apply these steps to classify the string "You can tell that guy's Mexican - he's wearing a sombrero."

#### Step 1: Understand the Argument

- **Argument Presented:** The argument is essentially claiming that a person's nationality (Mexican) can be identified based on a stereotypical accessory (sombrero).

#### Step 2: Identify Key Components

- **Proposition (P):** The guy is Mexican.
- **Reason (R):** Because he is wearing a sombrero.
- **Implicit Supporting Argument (if any):** The underlying assumption here is that only Mexicans wear sombreros.

#### Step 3: Match with Definitions

- **Generalization (<G>):** This involves making a broad claim about a group based on a few instances or stereotypes. 
  - Definition: Assertion based on some one part or on a majority but not necessarily applicable to all (e.g., "All sports car drivers are too aggressive!").
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This involves presenting a limited number of options and leaving out others.
  - Definition: Claiming to have made a complete enumeration of the possibilities but missing out on some pertinent ones.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This involves providing reasoning that doesn't conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
  - Definition: Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (e.g., "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you.").

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This involves circular reasoning where the reason merely restates the proposition.
  - Definition: Reason is weak when it appears to be presented as the Reason but says precisely the same as was said in the Proposition (e.g., "This legislation is sinful because it is the wrong thing to do.").

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This involves presenting a weak causal link between the reason and the proposition.
  - Definition: The causal basis submitted for the proposition is not compelling (e.g., "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick.").

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This involves assuming something is true because a large number of people believe it.
  - Definition: Assumed as certain on the ground that "it is universally agreed upon," a thing which is still in dispute (e.g., "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong.").

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** This involves using language that can be interpreted in multiple ways.
  - Definition: A proof can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended (e.g., "I want to have myself a merry little Christmas, but I refuse to do as the song suggests and make the yuletide gay.").

#### Step 4: Classify the Argument

- **Matching with Generalization (G):** This argument uses a stereotype (sombrero) to generalize about someone's nationality (Mexican). It falsely generalizes that wearing a specific item of clothing necessarily identifies someone as Mexican, which is a classic example of faulty generalization.

### Conclusion: The given string "You can tell that guy's Mexican - he's wearing a sombrero." should be classified as a **Generalization (<G>)**.

This completes the application of <IDAA> to the given string.
