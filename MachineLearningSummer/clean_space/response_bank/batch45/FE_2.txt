Sure! Let's apply the process of decomposing and classifying the string step by step:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of the Task (IDAA)

#### Step 1: Understand the string
- **String**: "It is either you are for the US war on terror or against it."

#### Step 2: Identify the key components of the string
- **Key Phrase**: "either you are for the US war on terror or against it."
- This is presenting two mutually exclusive choices without considering possible middle grounds.

#### Step 3: Identify the type of defective argument
- **Type Identification**: Determine which category the argument falls into. Based on the definitions provided:
  - **Generalization** (<G>) involves applying specifics to a whole, which doesn't seem to fit here.
  - **Incomplete Enumeration** (<FE>) means claiming there are only two possibilities when others exist, which seems closer.
  - **Inconclusive Reason** (<IR>) is about the reason not conclusively proving the proposition.
  - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition** (<RR>) is when the reason repeats the proposition.
  - **Insufficient Causal Basis** (<WCB>) is when the causal basis is weak.
  - **Presumptuous Consensus** (<FU>) assumes agreement based on popularity.
  - **Ambiguous Language Use** (<DEP>) is about ambiguous or double meanings.

#### Step 4: Classify the string according to the type of defective argument
- The string presents a binary choice without considering other potential positions. This matches **Incomplete Enumeration** (<FE>).

### Final Classification

The string "It is either you are for the US war on terror or against it." is of type **Incomplete Enumeration** (<FE>).

Therefore, the classification task IDA, decomposed into steps and applied to the given string, results in:

<s> = "It is either you are for the US war on terror or against it."
<IDAA>(<s>) = <FE>

This step-by-step breakdown confirms that the defective argument type is **Incomplete Enumeration** (<FE>).
