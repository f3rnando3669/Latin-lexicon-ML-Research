For 
To apply <IDAA> to classify the argument "Yes, we have safety issues in our factory. But we work really hard to make a good product," let's decompose the task of classification into specific steps and then apply those steps.

### Steps for Decomposition of <IDA> (D):
1. **Identify the Proposition (P):** Determine what the main point or claim of the argument is.
2. **Identify the Reason (R):** Find the causal basis or justification given for the proposition.
3. **Analyze the Proof of Reason (PR):** Examine any evidence or additional arguments provided to support the reason.
4. **Classify the Argument Type:** Based on the structure and content of the argument, classify it into one of the defective argument types (Generalization <G>, Incomplete Enumeration <FE>, Inconclusive Reason <IR>, Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>, Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>, Presumptuous Consensus <FU> or Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>).

### Applying <IDAA> (D applied to IDA) to the given argument:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):** 
   - *Proposition (P):* There are safety issues in our factory.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - *Reason (R):* We work really hard to make a good product.

3. **Analyze the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - No additional evidence or arguments are provided. Instead, the argument attempts to deflect from the safety issue by emphasizing the effort put into making a good product.

4. **Classify the Argument Type:**
   - The argument shifts focus from the critical issue of safety to the quality of the product, which does not justify or resolve the safety issues. This diversion can be identified as a **red herring** or **irrelevant argument**.

In the context of our predefined defective argument types, this argument falls under:

* **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason provided (working hard to make a good product) does not conclusively address or rectify the proposition about having safety issues in the factory.

Thus, the argument "Yes, we have safety issues in our factory. But we work really hard to make a good product" is classified as an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
