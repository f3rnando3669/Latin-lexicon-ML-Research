For 
To apply the procedure of **<IDAA>** to the string "Four out of five dentists recommend Happy Glossy Smiley toothpaste brand. Therefore, it must be great.", we'll break down the process of classifying the argument step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Argument
First, we need to clearly understand the argument presented in the string:

- **Proposition (P)**: "Happy Glossy Smiley toothpaste brand is great."
- **Reason (R)**: "Four out of five dentists recommend it."

### Step 2: Identify the Components of the Argument
- **Proposition (P)**: This is the conclusion that the argument wants you to accept—that Happy Glossy Smiley toothpaste brand is great.
- **Reason (R)**: This is the justification given for the proposition—that four out of five dentists recommend it.

### Step 3: Determine the Type of Defective Argument
Next, we classify the type of defective argument based on the relationship between the proposition and the reason.

Here are the possible classifications explained:

1. **<G> Generalization**: Involves applying a specific case to all cases without proper justification.
2. **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: Claims to cover all possibilities but misses out on some.
3. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The reason doesn’t adequately support the conclusion.
4. **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: Repeats the proposition as the reason.
5. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: Causal basis for the proposition is not compelling.
6. **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: Assumes something is true because many people believe it.
7. **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: Uses a term in an ambiguous way that misleads.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
Given the provided options, let's analyze the argument string:

- **"Four out of five dentists recommend Happy Glossy Smiley toothpaste brand. Therefore, it must be great."**
  
This argument essentially claims that because a majority of a specific group (dentists) recommend the toothpaste, it must be great. The argument is relying on the popularity or endorsement by a specific group to validate its claim.

### Step 5: Matching to a Defective Category
Upon review, this argument falls under:

- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**:
  This category involves the assumption that something must be true because it is popular or accepted by a particular consensus. In this case, the consensus of "four out of five dentists" is used to validate the proposition that the toothpaste is great.

### Step 6: Conclusion
The classification of the argument "Four out of five dentists recommend Happy Glossy Smiley toothpaste brand. Therefore, it must be great." is **<FU>** (Presumptuous Consensus). 

To summarize, the steps taken were:
- Understand the argument.
- Identify proposition and reason.
- Evaluate the reason for its relevance and type.
- Match to the defective argument type.
- Confirm the classification as **<FU>**.
