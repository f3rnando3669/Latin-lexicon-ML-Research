**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>) in the argument:**

- The proposition is the statement's initial idea or claim you intend to prove. In this case, the proposition is: "Since Beth attended summer tutoring, she is not a very good student."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>) supporting the Proposition:**

- The reason is the causal basis or supporting evidence provided to establish the truth of the proposition. Here, the reason is: "Some students who attend tutoring over the summer are not very intelligent."

**Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   
- The proof of reason corroborates the reason with an additional argument. This argument does not explicitly provide further evidence to support the reason.

**Step 4: Evaluate the argument to determine if it is a defective type:**

- **Generalization (<G>):** A generalization is made based on some members of a group but applied to the whole. Here, Beth is judged based on the fact that "some students who attend tutoring over the summer are not very intelligent."

**Step 5: Classify the argument as per identified defects:**

- The argument makes a generalization about students who attend summer tutoring and applies it incorrectly to Beth. This is a case of hasty generalization:
    - **Type:** `<G>` (Generalization)

**Step 6: Provide a justification for the classification:**

- The argument commits a logical fallacy because it unfairly generalizes a characteristic of some students who attend summer tutoring (not being very intelligent) and applies it to Beth to conclude she is not a very good student. This is a hasty generalization as it incorrectly assumes that all or most students attending summer tutoring share that characteristic.

### Final Classification:

- **Type:** `<G>` (Generalization)
- **Justification:** The argument unfairly generalizes that attending summer tutoring implies a lack of intelligence and applies this to Beth, thereby concluding she is not a good student, which is not necessarily true for all students attending tutoring sessions.

### Conclusion:
The argument "Some students who attend tutoring over the summer are not very intelligent. Since Beth attended summer tutoring, she is not a very good student." is an example of the defective argument type `<G>` (Generalization).
