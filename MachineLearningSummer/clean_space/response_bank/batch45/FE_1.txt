Sure, let's decompose and apply the steps to classify the argument provided:

1. **Identify the proposition (\<P\>)**:
   - The statement sets forth a proposition or a dilemma regarding taxation and debt.

2. **Determine the reason (\<R\>)**:
   - This step examines what the statement presents as the causal basis for the proposition. The statement suggests that not cutting taxes will lead to a significant debt for future generations.

3. **Check for Proof of Reason (\<PR\>)**:
   - Here, we look for additional arguments that corroborate the provided reason. In this case, there is no elaboration; it just poses a binary choice without further substantiation.

4. **Classify the argument type**:
   - Identify if the argument commits any logical fallacies or defects as defined.

   The statement "We either have to cut taxes or leave a huge debt for our children." can be decomposed and analyzed as follows:

   - **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: This statement falls under incomplete enumeration. It falsely presents only two options while ignoring other potential solutions or strategies that might address the issue.

Therefore, applying <IDAA> to "We either have to cut taxes or leave a huge debt for our children." leads us to classify it as an Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>).
