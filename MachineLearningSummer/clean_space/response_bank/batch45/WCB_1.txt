For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string into specific steps) to the string "President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up. Jones is responsible for the rise in crime." I'll follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Structure of the Argument**:
   - Proposition (<P>): "Jones is responsible for the rise in crime."
   - Reason (<R>): "President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up."

2. **Identify the Type of Defective Argument**:
   - Here, we see a causal relationship being claimed between two events (raising taxes and the increase in violent crime) without strong evidence presented to support this causality.

3. **Classify the Argument Based on the Defined Types**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: Not applicable here since it's not making a broad general assertion.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not applicable since it’s not narrowing down choices.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Plausible but not the primary issue, as the reasoning here seems more about a weak causal link than irrelevant or weak evidence.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Not applicable since there's no repeating of the same idea as evidence.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Highly applies. This statement suggests causality between raising taxes and an increase in violent crime without concrete evidence linking the two.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Not the best fit since it’s not claiming something based on group consensus.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Not applicable since there’s no double meaning or ambiguity in the terms used.

4. **Application and Conclusion**:
   - Based on the definitions and the analysis, the defective argument type here is **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.

Thus, the string "President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up. Jones is responsible for the rise in crime." is classified as <WCB>.
