Absolutely, let's apply the decomposition of the task of classifying the argument type step by step.

### Step 1: Understanding the Argument
Identify the main argument or claim being made in the statement:

**Statement**: "That politician wants you to think he loves America. His last rally had 20 American flags flying behind him."

### Step 2: Identify Key Elements
Highlight key parts of the argument:

- Claim: The politician wants you to think he loves America.
- Evidence: His last rally had 20 American flags flying behind him.

### Step 3: Analyze the Type of Evidence
Determine the nature of the evidence provided and how it supports the claim:

- The evidence given is the display of 20 American flags at the rally.
- This evidence is used to imply the politician's patriotism.

### Step 4: Compare with Known Defective Argument Types
Check the provided evidence against the types of defective arguments:
- **<G> Generalization**: Involves making broad conclusions based on limited evidence.
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: Suggests only two options when more possibilities exist.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: Offers a reason that doesn't conclusively prove the claim.
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: Repeats the claim without providing substantial evidence.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: Proposes a weak cause-and-effect relationship.
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: Assumes something is true because many people believe it.
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: Uses language that can be interpreted in different ways.

### Step 5: Determine the Closest Match
Identify which argument type best matches the statement:

- The statement provides a piece of evidence (20 American flags) to imply a conclusion (the politician loves America). 
- This implies the use of symbols (flags) as evidence of a sentiment (patriotism), without necessarily proving the sentiment's authenticity.

### Step 6: Select the Correct Defective Argument Type
The argument type "Everyone else is doing it, you should too!" (a common example of <FU> Presumptuous Consensus) is about using popular behavior to validate a claim.

### Step 7: Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the closest match for this argument is:

**Type**: **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**

**Reason**: The use of American flags as evidence heavily relies on the assumption that displaying symbols commonly associated with patriotism necessarily indicates genuine patriotism, an assumption broadly accepted but not necessarily true.

### Final Classification
The statement **"That politician wants you to think he loves America. His last rally had 20 American flags flying behind him" IS an example of this fallacy** is best classified under:

**<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**
