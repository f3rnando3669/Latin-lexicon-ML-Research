For 
To apply <IDAA> to the classification task "The Bible is the Word of God because God tells us it is... in the Bible", we need to decompose the advanced task <t> into specific steps to perform <IDA>. Here's the step-by-step decomposition:

### Stepwise Decomposition of Task (<D>):

1. **Identify the proposition (P)**: Determine the main assertion or claim being made.
2. **Identify the reason (R)**: Determine what causal basis or justification is being provided to support the proposition.
3. **Classify the argument**: Based on the proposition and its reason, classify the argument according to its type among <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Applying <IDAA> to "The Bible is the Word of God because God tells us it is... in the Bible":

#### Step 1: Identify the proposition (P)
- The proposition in the statement is: "The Bible is the Word of God."

#### Step 2: Identify the reason (R)
- The reason given to support this proposition is: "God tells us it is... in the Bible."

#### Step 3: Classify the argument
- Analyze the relationship between the proposition and the reason provided. Here, the justification for the proposition relies on the assertion that the Bible is the Word of God because the Bible itself says so. This exhibits a circular reasoning pattern where the argument tries to prove itself by referring back to the initial assertion.
  
- Therefore, the classification falls under <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition): The reason presented (R) says precisely the same thing as the proposition (P), without providing an external or independent justification.

### Result:
The argument "The Bible is the Word of God because God tells us it is... in the Bible" is classified as type <RR>.

### Additional Analysis:

The argument provided at the end:
```
X is true because of Y.
Y is true because of X.
```
This pattern reinforces the classification of <RR> since it represents circular reasoning involving mutual validation without external corroboration.

### Final Classification:
**<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**.

Thus, applying <IDAA> with the decomposition <D> correctly classifies the string "The Bible is the Word of God because God tells us it is... in the Bible" as a type <RR> argument.
