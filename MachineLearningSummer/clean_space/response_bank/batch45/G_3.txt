For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the IDA task of classifying a string as one of the defined defect types) to the given string, let's decompose the task into specific steps:

### Step 1: Understand the given string:
- **String:** "An environmental group illegally blocked loggers and workers at a nuclear plant. Therefore, environmentalists are radicals who take the law into their own hands."

### Step 2: Identify the structure and content of the argument:
- **Proposition (P):** "An environmental group illegally blocked loggers and workers at a nuclear plant."
- **Conclusion:** "Therefore, environmentalists are radicals who take the law into their own hands."

### Step 3: Analyze the reasoning and identify the possible defects:
- Check for **Generalization (G):** Does the argument take characteristics from one or a few instances and apply them to a whole group?
- Check for **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Does the argument claim completeness but miss pertinent possibilities?
- Check for **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
- Check for **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Does the reason repeat the proposition without adding new information?
- Check for **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the causal basis proposed weak or unsubstantiated?
- Check for **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Does the argument inappropriately assume consensus?
- Check for **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Is the argument using ambiguous terms that can mislead?

### Step 4: Classify the defect type:
- The argument starts with an instance of action by an environmental group and then generalizes this action to all environmentalists.
- **Generalization (G):** The argument asserts that because one group of environmentalists took illegal action, all environmentalists are radicals who take the law into their own hands. This is a clear over-generalization from a single instance (or a small set of instances) to a whole group.

### Step 5: Conclude with the classification:
- **Classification:** The given string should be classified as <G> (Generalization).

**Conclusion:**
The argument "An environmental group illegally blocked loggers and workers at a nuclear plant. Therefore, environmentalists are radicals who take the law into their own hands." falls under the defect type <G> for Generalization.
