For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given statement, we'll break down the task into specific steps for classifying the argument type. Let's proceed step-by-step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), and Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- **Proposition (<P>):** The conclusion or claim being made: "You must find him guilty."
- **Reason (<R>):** The causal basis for the proposition: "The defendant has been able to provide no strong evidence to prove his innocence."
- **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** This step is not explicitly required in the current task, as we'll be figuring out if it fits any known defective argument types instead.

### Step 2: Determine if the argument contains any known defective types such as:
1. **Generalization (<G>):** Broad assertion based on insufficient evidence.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Claim that misses other possible options.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason does not conclusively prove the proposition.
4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Circular reasoning.
5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Weak causal link.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Assuming something is true because "everyone agrees."
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Ambiguous or misleading use of words.

### Step 3: Assess the Argument Type
- In this case, the argument asserts that because the defendant has not provided strong evidence to prove his innocence, this failure automatically means guilt.

- **Reasoning involved:**
  - It shifts the burden of proof from the prosecution to the defense.
  - It suggests that lack of disproof (innocence) is itself proof of guilt.

- This reasoning is flawed because the burden of proof lies with the prosecution to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, not on the defendant to prove innocence.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type
- The presented argument fits the definition of **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** because the reason given does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition:
    - Lack of strong evidence to prove innocence is an inadequate reason to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

### Conclusion
The classification of the argument type under the specified defective argument definitions is:

**<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The reason provided ("no strong evidence to prove his innocence") does not conclusively establish the guilt of the defendant ("you must find him guilty").
