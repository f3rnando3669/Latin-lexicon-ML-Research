For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "Religion may have been wrong about a few things, but science has been wrong about many more things!", let's decompose the task of classifying this string as of type <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP> into specific steps.

### Step-by-step Decomposition (D):
1. **Identify the Core Proposition (P)**:
   - Determine the main assertion or belief that is being presented.

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - Look for the justification or explanation provided to support the core proposition.

3. **Identify Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   - Check for any additional arguments or evidence provided to corroborate the reason.

4. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types**:
   - Compare the identified parts to the definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

### Step 1: Identify the Core Proposition (P)
The core proposition in the string is:
"Religion may have been wrong about a few things, but science has been wrong about many more things!"

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason provided is implied through comparison:
"Science has been wrong about many more things."

### Step 3: Identify Proof of Reason (PR)
There is no explicit additional argument or evidence provided in the string to corroborate the reason.

### Step 4: Analyze for Defective Argument Types
1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - This type asserts broad claims based on limited or singular cases.
   - Analysis: The string does not generalize based on a singular or limited set of cases.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - This type falsely claims completeness while ignoring other possibilities.
   - Analysis: The string does not present a binary choice or falsely claims completeness.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
   - Analysis: The statement objects to the authority of science by claiming it's often wrong, but it fails to conclusively support its point about either science or religion.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - The reason repeats the proposition without providing new information.
   - Analysis: The reason is presented as an external comparison between religion and science, not merely repetition.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - The causal basis is weak or not compelling.
   - Analysis: The statement does not argue causality but comparison.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - Assumes consensus as proof without it being actually correct.
   - Analysis: The string doesn't invoke universal agreement or consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
   - Uses ambiguous terms that could be misinterpreted.
   - Analysis: The string does not seem to employ misleading or ambiguous language intentionally.

### Conclusion
The classification that fits best is **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** because the reason provided ("science has been wrong about many more things") does not conclusively support the proposition related to comparing religion and science. It criticizes science without directly supporting the initial proposition about religion's accuracy. 

Therefore, the task <IDA> for the string "Religion may have been wrong about a few things, but science has been wrong about many more things!" results in the classification:

```plaintext
<IR>
```

This concludes the step-by-step application of <IDAA> to the given string.
