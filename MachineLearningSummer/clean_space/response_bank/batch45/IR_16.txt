For 
To apply the process of <IDAA> to the task of classifying the string “My wife wants to talk about cleaning out the garage, so I asked her what she wants to do with our patio furniture. Now she’s shopping for new patio furniture and not asking me about the garage.” as one of the defective argument types:

**Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D> applied to <IDA>):**

1. **Identify the Argument Structure:**
   - Break down the given argument to understand its structure and claims.

2. **Determine the Propositional content (P):**
   - Assess what is being asserted or proposed in the argument.

3. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Understand the causal basis or reasoning given to support the proposition.

4. **Analyze Potential Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - Evaluate any additional arguments or evidence provided to support the Reason.

5. **Classify the Type of Defective Argument:**
   - Using the definitions and examples provided for <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>, determine which category the argument best fits.

6. **Cross-reference with Examples:**
   - Compare the structure and content of the defective argument with provided examples to ensure the classification is accurate.

**Application:**

1. **Identify the Argument Structure:**
   - "My wife wants to talk about cleaning out the garage" (initial point)
   - "so I asked her what she wants to do with our patio furniture" (response/diversion)
   - "Now she’s shopping for new patio furniture and not asking me about the garage" (result)

2. **Determine the Propositional content (P):**
   - The initial issue proposed is discussing cleaning out the garage.

3. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - The reason involves asking about the patio furniture to divert the conversation from the garage.

4. **Analyze Potential Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - There's no direct proof of reasoning; the diversion tactic led to a shift in the wife's focus.

5. **Classify the Type of Defective Argument:**
   - The argument introduces a distraction from the original topic (cleaning the garage) by changing the subject to patio furniture.
   - This matches with a form of Red Herring fallacy, which diverts attention from the main issue to a different topic.

6. **Cross-reference with Examples:**
   - Compare with examples of <IR>: 
     - This doesn’t fit here as the argument is not providing an inconclusive reason for cleaning the garage but rather diverting the topic.
   - Compare with examples of <RR>: 
     - There's no repetition of the proposition or reason here.
   - Compare with examples of <G>, <FE>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>:
     - The argument fit does not align with these categories. 
   
Therefore, the best fit for this argument is related to changing the subject, which aligns most closely with the **red herring** category under **<IR>**.

**Conclusion:**
The argument “My wife wants to talk about cleaning out the garage, so I asked her what she wants to do with our patio furniture. Now she’s shopping for new patio furniture and not asking me about the garage.” best fits the classification of **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason), as it introduces an unrelated topic to divert the discussion from the original issue.
