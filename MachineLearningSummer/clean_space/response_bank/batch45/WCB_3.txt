For 
Sure, let's apply <IDAA> to classify the string according to the specified types of defective arguments. 

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
The proposition in the given string is: 
- "The rise in violent offending and the explosion in the sales of iPods and other portable media devices is more than coincidental."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
The reason provided is:
- "Nationally, violent crime fell every year from 1993 to 2004, before rising in 2005 and 2006, just as America's streets filled with millions of people visibly wearing, and being distracted by, expensive electronic gear."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Causal Basis of the Reason and Proposition
The string proposes a causal relationship between the rise in violent crime and the increase in sales of iPods and other portable media devices. We need to determine if the causal basis is compelling and valid.

### Step 4: Categorize the Argument
From the evaluation, we notice the argument attempts to link two phenomena without solid evidence of causation. Instead, it relies on the correlation of the two events happening around the same time frame.

### Step 5: Classification
The argument suggests that the rise in violent crime is caused by the increase in sales of iPods and media devices without providing a compelling causal link. This indicates a **defective causal basis**.

### Step 6: Assign the Appropriate Type
Given the reasoning and classification, the type of defective argument here falls under:
- **<WCB>** (Insufficient Causal Basis): The causal basis that links the rise in violent crime to the sales of portable media devices is weak and does not establish a strong, credible causal connection between the two phenomena.

Therefore, the classification of the string is:
- **<WCB>** (Insufficient Causal Basis)
