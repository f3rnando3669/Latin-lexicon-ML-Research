For 
To apply <IDAA> to "Eat lamb--could thousands of coyotes be wrong?" we will decompose the task (<t>) of classifying the string into specific steps, and then apply these steps.

### Decomposition (<D>) of <IDA>:
1. **Identify the main argument or proposition (<P>) in the string.**
2. **Determine the Reason (<R>) supporting the proposition.**
3. **Analyze the Proof of Reason (<PR>) for its validity and logical soundness.**
4. **Identify if the argument falls under any known defective argument types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>)**
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**

Now, we'll apply these steps to the string "Eat lamb--could thousands of coyotes be wrong?"  

### Step-by-Step Application (<IDAA>):

1. **Identify the main argument or proposition (<P>):**
   - The main proposition is "Eat lamb."

2. **Determine the Reason (<R>) supporting the proposition:**
   - The reason given is "could thousands of coyotes be wrong?"

3. **Analyze the Proof of Reason (<PR>) for its validity and logical soundness:**
   - The proof of reason here is implicit. It relies on the idea that since thousands of coyotes presumably eat lamb, it must be a good (or correct) thing to do for humans as well.

4. **Identify if the argument falls under any known defective argument types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: It does not make an overgeneralization about all people or all situations.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: It does not falsely claim that there are only two options.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasoning doesn't conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition; however, this isn't the primary flaw here.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The argument isn't merely repeating the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reason doesn't directly cause or justify the proposition, but the primary issue lies elsewhere.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This argument assumes that because a large group (thousands of coyotes) behaves a certain way, it must be correct or beneficial. This aligns closely with the logical fallacy of appealing to popularity.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The language isn't particularly ambiguous or misleading in this context.

Given the analysis, the argument in "Eat lamb--could thousands of coyotes be wrong?" is best classified under:

**Defective Argument Type: Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>).**

It assumes that because thousands of coyotes eat lamb, this decision must be right, ignoring other logical and ethical considerations.
