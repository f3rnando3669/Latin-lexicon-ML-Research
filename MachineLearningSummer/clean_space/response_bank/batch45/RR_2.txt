For 
Certainly, let's apply the decomposition process to the task of classifying the given statement:

### Step 1: Understand the Statement
First, let's break down the statement to fully understand its components:
"Only a mentally ill person would kill someone, so anyone who kills someone is automatically mentally ill."

### Step 2: Identify Key Parts of the Argument
- **Proposition (P):** Anyone who kills someone is automatically mentally ill.
- **Reason (R):** Only a mentally ill person would kill someone.

### Step 3: Determine the Nature of the Argument
Analyze the reasoning to see if it fits any known defective argument types.

### Step 4: Check for Defective Argument Types
Let's check the statement against each defective argument type:
  
1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - Is the proposition a broad assertion based on insufficient examples? 
   - The statement doesn't seem to generalize based on a small sample.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Is the reasoning presenting limited choices when more options exist?
   - This statement does not seem to limit choices but defines a categorization.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Does the reason not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
   - This fits, as assuming all killers are mentally ill solely because only a mentally ill person would kill someone is not conclusive.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - Is the reason essentially stating the proposition in different terms?
   - It doesn’t seem to simply restate the proposition.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Is the causal basis for the reason weak?
   - This seems plausible, as not all cases of killing may be due to mental illness, suggesting an insufficient causal basis.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - Is the reason based on a supposed consensus?
   - No indication of consensus is present in the statement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - Is there ambiguity in the terms used?
   - The statement doesn’t appear to rely on ambiguous terms.

### Step 5: Final Classification
Based on the analysis, the argument primarily fits two types:
1. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**

### Conclusion
The statement "Only a mentally ill person would kill someone, so anyone who kills someone is automatically mentally ill." is best classified under <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) because the causal link between being mentally ill and committing murder is not sufficiently demonstrated. While it also fits under <IR>, <WCB> provides a clearer explanation.
