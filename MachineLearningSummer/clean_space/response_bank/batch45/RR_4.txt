For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given task, we need to decompose the problem into specific steps and classify the statement according to the given types of defective arguments. Here's a step-by-step decomposition of the task:

1. **Understand the Statement**: Read and interpret the statement carefully.
   - Statement: "You must obey the law, because it's illegal to break the law."

2. **Identify Key Components**: Break down the statement to understand its structure and reasoning.
   - Proposition (P): "You must obey the law."
   - Reason (R): "Because it's illegal to break the law."

3. **Compare with Definitions**: Match the structure and content of the statement with the definitions of the defective argument types:
   - **<G> Generalization**: Not applicable as this statement is not forming a general rule from specific instances.
   - **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: Not applicable as this statement does not claim to have made a complete enumeration of possibilities.
   - **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: Not applicable as the reason provided is not conclusive, but it does not fit the description.
   - **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: Relevant because the Reason (R) is essentially repeating the Proposition (P) without providing new information.
   - **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: Not applicable as this statement does not establish a causal relationship.
   - **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: Not applicable as this statement does not rely on presumed universal agreement.
   - **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: Not applicable as the language is not ambiguous, just repetitive.

4. **Select the Correct Classification**: Evaluate which type of logical fallacy fits best:
   - The statement "You must obey the law, because it's illegal to break the law" uses circular reasoning, where the premise and conclusion essentially restate the same idea.

5. **Conclude the Classification**:
   - The logical fallacy used in the statement is **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**.

By following these steps, we have classified the statement as an example of **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**.
