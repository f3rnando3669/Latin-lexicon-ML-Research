For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the given string, we'll decompose the task into specific steps and classify the argument step-by-step.

### Steps to Classify the Argument
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** What is being claimed or proposed?
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** What reason is given to support the proposition?
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Is there a proof or evidence provided to support the reason?
4. **Determine Defective Argument Type:** Using the definitions of defective argument types, classify the argument.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition in the given string is:
"Everyone seems to support the changes in the vacation policy, and if everyone likes them, they must be good."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason given to support the proposition is:
"Everyone likes them."

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
The proof of reason or evidence provided is implied in the statement "Everyone seems to support the changes."

#### Step 4: Determine the Defective Argument Type
In this step, we'll compare the given string to the definitions of defective argument types. We'll focus particularly on identifying if it falls under <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

- **<G> Generalization:** This does not fit since there is no overgeneralization from a few instances to a broad conclusion.
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:** This does not fit since the argument doesn't involve claiming a complete enumeration while missing out on some possibilities.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** This does not fit since the argument does not hinge on a reason that fails to conclusively demonstrate the proposition.
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** This does not fit since the argument does not involve circular reasoning where the argument simply restates the proposition.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** This does not fit since the argument's issue is not a weak causal basis.
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:** This does not fit since there is no ambiguous language or terms used in multiple ways.

Considering these points, the argument fits the definition of:
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** The argument is based on the assumption that something must be good because "everyone" supports it, which is a classic example of appealing to popularity to validate the claim.

### Conclusion
The given argument "Everyone seems to support the changes in the vacation policy, and if everyone likes them, they must be good." is an example of <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).
