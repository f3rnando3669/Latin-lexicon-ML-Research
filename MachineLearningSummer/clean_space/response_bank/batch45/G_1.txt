To apply the process of decomposing the task of classifying the given statement as a type of defective argument step-by-step, let's proceed systematically:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of IDA
1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
    - Determine what the statement is claiming or intending to prove.
    - **"So don’t take your business there, as you’ll definitely get ripped off."**

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
    - Identify the reason provided for the proposition.
    - **"My friend swears the mechanic at that shop overcharged her last week and after looking at her invoice it seems she’s right."**

3. **Evaluate the Reason and Proposition (R and P)**:
    - Check if the reason logically supports the proposition.
    - Consider if the reason covers all relevant cases or is generalizing from insufficient evidence.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**:
    - Match the logical pattern or fallacy to the given Reason and Proposition.
    - Determine which known fallacy type (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, or DEP) the argument falls under by comparing it against definitions and examples of each.

### Application (IDAA) to the Given Statement

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
    - **Proposition (P)**: "Don’t take your business there, as you’ll definitely get ripped off."
    
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
    - **Reason (R)**: "My friend swears the mechanic at that shop overcharged her last week and after looking at her invoice it seems she’s right."
    
3. **Evaluate the Reason and Proposition (R and P)**:
    - The proposition suggests that all customers will be overcharged based on the experience of one customer.
    - The reason provided is an isolated incident, used to generalize about the overall services of the shop.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**:
    - The argument type appears to generalize a single incident to all potential clients of the shop.
    - This fits well with the definition of **Generalization (G)**:
        - Generalization occurs when a conclusion about all or most cases is drawn from a limited sample of data.
        - Example: "All sports car drivers are too aggressive!" based on witnessing a few aggressive drivers.
    
Hence, the type of defective argument in the statement **"My friend swears the mechanic at that shop overcharged her last week and after looking at her invoice it seems she’s right. So don’t take your business there, as you’ll definitely get ripped off."** is **Generalization (G)**.
