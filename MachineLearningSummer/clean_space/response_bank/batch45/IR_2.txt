For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task \( \text{<IDA>} \), we'll decompose the classification task into specific steps and then perform each step to determine the type of defective argument for the given string.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of \( \text{<IDA>} \) ( \( \text{<D>} \)):

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( \text{<P>} \)) and Reason (\( \text{<R>} \)):**
   - Identify the main proposition that is intended to be proven.
   - Identify the reason provided to support the proposition.

2. **Analyze the Reasoning:**
   - Determine if the reason provided is valid and logically supports the proposition.
   - Check for any logical fallacies or defects in the reasoning.

3. **Classify the Fallacious Reasoning:**
   - If the reasoning is found to be defective, classify it into one of the defined defective argument types:
     - **\( \text{<G>} \)**: Generalization
     - **\( \text{<FE>} \)**: Incomplete Enumeration
     - **\( \text{<IR>} \)**: Inconclusive Reason
     - **\( \text{<RR>} \)**: Faulty Repetition of Proposition
     - **\( \text{<WCB>} \)**: Insufficient Causal Basis
     - **\( \text{<FU>} \)**: Presumptuous Consensus
     - **\( \text{<DEP>} \)**: Ambiguous Language Use

4. **Determine the Specific Fallacy:**
   - Based on the identified fallacious reasoning, pinpoint the specific type of logical fallacy.

### Applying \( \text{<IDAA>} \) to the Given String:

**String:**
"After Sally presents an eloquent and compelling case for a more equitable taxation system, Sam asks the audience whether we should believe anything from a woman who isn't married, was once arrested, and smells a bit weird."

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\( \text{<P>} \)) and Reason (\( \text{<R>} \))**

- **Proposition (\( \text{<P>} \)):** 
  The proposition suggested by Sam is that the audience should not believe Sally’s case for a more equitable taxation system.
  
- **Reason (\( \text{<R>} \)):**
  The reasons provided by Sam are that Sally isn’t married, was once arrested, and smells a bit weird.

**Step 2: Analyze the Reasoning**

- Examine the logical connection between Sally’s marital status, past arrest, and how she smells, and the validity of her argument for a more equitable taxation system.
- Marital status, past arrest, and odor do not logically relate to the validity of an argument concerning taxation. The reasoning is irrelevant to the proposition.

**Step 3: Classify the Fallacious Reasoning**

- The reasoning provided by Sam distracts from the actual argument Sally made and attacks her character instead of addressing the merits of her argument. This type of fallacious reasoning is commonly known as an ad hominem attack.

**Step 4: Determine the Specific Fallacy**

- The fallacy in question is best classified under **\( \text{<IR>} \)** (Inconclusive Reason):
  - An ad hominem attack is a type of inconclusive reasoning where the argument attacks the person making the case rather than addressing the case itself.
  
**Conclusion:**
The given string "After Sally presents an eloquent and compelling case for a more equitable taxation system, Sam asks the audience whether we should believe anything from a woman who isn't married, was once arrested, and smells a bit weird." is classified as an instance of **\( \text{<IR>} \) (Inconclusive Reason)**, specifically an ad hominem attack.

Thus, \( \text{<IDAA>} \) applied to the given string results in identifying it as a defective argument of type **\( \text{<IR>} \)**.
