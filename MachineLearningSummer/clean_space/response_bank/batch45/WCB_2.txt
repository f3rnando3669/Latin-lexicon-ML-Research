For 
To apply the IDAA process to the string "Giving 10% of your income to the Church will free a child’s soul from Limbo into Heaven, so give your money!", we will decompose the task of classifying the type of argument into specific steps and then systematically work through these steps.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the main proposition (P) and the reasoning (R):**
   - Proposition (P): "You should give 10% of your income to the Church."
   - Reasoning (R): "Giving 10% of your income to the Church will free a child’s soul from Limbo into Heaven."

2. **Analyze the reasoning (R) to determine if it properly supports the proposition (P):**
   
3. **Check for characteristics of each defective argument type:**
   - **Generalization (G)**: Does the argument make a broad assertion about all cases based on a few instances?
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Does the argument falsely claim to cover all possibilities but misses some?
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Does the reasoning fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Does the reasoning merely repeat the proposition without providing new support?
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the causal link between the reasoning and the proposition weak or unjustified?
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Does the argument assume a proposition is true because it's universally agreed upon?
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Does the argument use ambiguous words or phrases that might mislead?

4. **Evaluate the given string with respect to each type:**

### Detailed Evaluation:
- **Generalization (G)**: The argument doesn't seem to make a broad assertion about all instances based on specific cases.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not seem to miss out on possible alternatives or choices. 
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning provided does not conclusively demonstrate the validity of the proposition. Just saying that giving money to the Church will achieve a spiritual outcome lacks any substantial evidence or proof.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The argument does not repeat the proposition but attempts to provide a reason that supports it.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is a weak causal link. The claim that monetary contributions will result in a child's soul being freed from Limbo is not supported by any compelling causal evidence or logic.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument does not seem to rely on the idea that it is universally accepted.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language is relatively clear in its intent, even if the logic is flawed.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the defective argument type that best fits is **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The reasoning provided is weakly connected to the proposition, lacking substantial evidence or a compelling causal basis.

So, the classification of the string "Giving 10% of your income to the Church will free a child’s soul from Limbo into Heaven, so give your money!" is:

**Type <WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis**
