Sure, let's apply IDAA (the systematic decomposition approach) to classify the given string "Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist and perhaps the foremost expert in the field, says that evolution is true. Therefore, it's true."

### Step 1: Identify the components of the argument
- **Proposition (P):** Evolution is true.
- **Reason (R):** Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist and expert, says that evolution is true.
- **Proof of Reason (PR):** The statement by Richard Dawkins is considered accurate due to his expertise.

### Step 2: Examine the structure of the reasoning
- **P and R Analysis:** 
    - The **Proposition** is the claim that evolution is true.
    - The **Reason** is the appeal to authority, in this case, Richard Dawkins, who is identified as a foremost expert.

### Step 3: Check for types of defective arguments
- **Generalization (G):** It doesn't generalize based on a small sample or single instance.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** It doesn't present a false dichotomy or binary choice.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** It doesn’t seem to pivot on an irrelevant consideration but needs further analysis.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** It's not a circular argument.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** It doesn't incorrectly establish causation.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** It does not appeal to what everyone believes.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Language is clear without ambiguity.

### Step 4: Focus on <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)
The reason provided ("Richard Dawkins says that evolution is true") doesn't directly substantiate the proposition ("Evolution is true") in a way that demonstrates correctness conclusively. Instead, it relies solely on the authority of Dawkins, without delivering intrinsic evidence for evolution’s truth.

### Conclusion
This argument is best classified as an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the correctness of the proposition is asserted based on Dawkins' authority rather than through direct evidence or logical reasoning.
  
Thus, the string "Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist and perhaps the foremost expert in the field, says that evolution is true. Therefore, it's true." is of type **<IR>**.
