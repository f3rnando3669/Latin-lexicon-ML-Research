For 
Sure, let's proceed with the task step by step.

### Step 1: Decompose the Task <IDA> 
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: "Ghosts exist."
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: "because I saw a ghost in my closet."

### Step 2: Classify the Argument <P> as one of the Defective Types
To classify this argument, we must examine the reason and how it supports the proposition. Here are definitions of defective argument types for reference:

#### Defective Classification Types:
- **<G> Generalization:** Assertion applied universally based on limited instances.
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:** Claims completeness but misses some possibilities.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** Reason says the same thing as the proposition.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** Reason does not adequately support the causal basis for the proposition.
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** Assumes consensus without real evidence.
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:** Uses words in ambiguous ways.

### Step 3: Evaluate the Specific Argument
**Argument:** "Ghosts exist... because I saw a ghost in my closet."

Looks like:
- The **Proposition (<P>)**: "Ghosts exist."
- The **Reason (<R>)**: "because I saw a ghost in my closet."

### Step 4: Determine if <R> Conclusively Demonstrates <P>
- **Nature of <R>**: The reason is based on a personal experience, which doesn't conclusively provide proof that ghosts exist universally.

### Step 5: Match with Defective Argument Types
Letâ€™s evaluate which category it matches best:
1. **<G> Generalization**: Not quite, it isn't generalizing from the instance.
2. **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: No, the argument isn't claiming a complete list of possibilities.
3. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: This looks plausible because the reason provided (personal experience) doesn't conclusively prove the universal existence of ghosts.
4. **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: No, the reason isn't just a restatement of the proposition.
5. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: The seeing a ghost causally leads to an existence proof; however, the basal support seems insufficient.
6. **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: No consensus is being assumed here.
7. **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: No ambiguous wording is identified.

### Step 6: Final Classification
- The classification that fits best is **<IR> Inconclusive Reason** because the personal anecdote does not provide conclusive proof for the universal proposition that ghosts exist.

### Result
**"Ghosts exist... because I saw a ghost in my closet," is an example of <IR> Inconclusive Reason.**
