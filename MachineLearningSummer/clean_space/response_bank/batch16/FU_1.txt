Okay, let's apply the step-by-step decomposition process (IDAA) to classify the string "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong."

### Step-by-Step Classification (IDAA)

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition Structure**
1. **Scan** the string <s>: "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong."
2. **Extract** key phrases and words: Key phrases include "Get Verizon" and "1 billion people can't be wrong."

**Step 2: Map to Argument Types**
1. **Check for markers of generalization (<G>**): 
    - There is no direct statement making a sweeping generalization about a group based on a specific instance.

2. **Assess for options listed to see if they fit the criteria for <FE>**:
    - The string does not present a limited or exaggerated set of options.

3. **Evaluate the reasoning provided to see if it is inappropriate or not logically connected to the proposition, indicating <IR>**:
    - The reasoning provided ("1 billion people can't be wrong") is connected to the proposition ("Get Verizon"), but not a highly inappropriate or irrelevant reason.

4. **Identify if a reason is merely a restatement of the proposition, suggesting <RR>**:
    - The reasoning provided is not a restatement of the proposition using different words.

5. **Determine if the causal basis provided is weak or unconvincing for <WCB>**:
    - The reasoning relies on the popularity of the choice ("1 billion people") rather than an unconvincing causal basis.

6. **Verify if the argument asserts a universal truth without evidence, fitting <FU>**:
    - The string suggests that because "1 billion people" have chosen Verizon, this implies the correctness of choosing it as well, appealing to popularity as validation without proof of why it is the right choice. This is a hallmark of **False Universals (FU)**.

7. **Look for statements that can be interpreted in multiple ways, indicating <DEP>**:
    - The string does not seem to allow for multiple interpretations that could potentially undermine the speaker.

### Conclusion
For the given example string, "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong," after following the steps of our decomposition process (IDAA), we determine that it fits the definition of:
**<FU> (False Universals)**.

The reasoning appeals to the popularity or the sheer number of people using Verizon as an attempted form of validation.
