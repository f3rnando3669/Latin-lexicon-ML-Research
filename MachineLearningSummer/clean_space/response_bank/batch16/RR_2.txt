### Step 1: Understand the Provided Argument
- Main proposition: We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people.
- Supporting reason: Implied, but not explicitly stated.

### Step 2: Identify Argument Components
- Main proposition: Fix the broken judicial system.
- Implied reason: The system is broken because current people are not effective, hence we should elect new people.

### Step 3: Check for Generalization (<G>)
- The proposition does not make a broad, sweeping statement based on a specific instance. Not applicable.

### Step 4: Check for False Enumeration (<FE>)
- The argument doesn't present a limited set of options or a false dichotomy. Not applicable.

### Step 5: Check for Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)
- The reason "by electing new people" is proposed as a solution to fix the system but doesn't necessarily address the specific issues of the judicial system. This may indicate an inappropriate reason if the reason is not logically connected to the proposition.

### Step 6: Check for Redundant Reason (<RR>)
- The reason does not merely rephrase the proposition itself but provides a specific action (electing new people).

### Step 7: Check for Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- The argument provides a causal basis (electing new people) for fixing the judicial system. However, it does not provide compelling evidence that electing new people will solve the identified issues within the judicial system, making it potentially a weak causal basis.

### Step 8: Check for False Universals (<FU>)
- The argument does not appeal to common knowledge or universally agreed points without proof. Not applicable.

### Step 9: Check for Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)
- The phrase "broken judicial system" could have multiple meanings, but the solution "by electing new people" is straightforward and doesn't seem to be open to dual interpretations. Not applicable.

### Step 10: Classify the Argument
- The most applicable classification seems to be <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis) because the argument implies that electing new people will inherently fix the judicial system without providing compelling evidence to support this causal link.

### Step 11: Document Your Reasoning
- The argument suggests that electing new people will solve the problems of the judicial system. However, it fails to provide evidence or a strong causal connection to show how electing new people will address the specific issues within the judicial system. Therefore, this argument falls under the category of Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>).

So, the classification of the argument "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people. This logical fallacy is called" is: **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**.
