For 
To apply the decomposition (D) to the classification task (IDA) for the string "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there," let's proceed step-by-step.

1. **Preliminary Analysis**:
   - Read the string: "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there."

2. **Identify Key Elements**:
   - Claim: "That restaurant is popular"
   - Supporting Argument: "because everyone in town goes there."

3. **Categorization Attempt**:
   - **Check for <G> (Generalization)**: 
     - This argument doesn't take a specific instance and generalize it. So, it doesn't fit <G>.
   - **Check for <FE> (False Enumeration)**: 
     - There are no limited or exaggerated set of options presented. So, it doesn't fit <FE>.
   - **Check for <IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**: 
     - This argument provides a reason (everyone in town goes there) that seems logically supporting the claim of popularity. So, it doesn't fit <IR>.
   - **Check for <RR> (Redundant Reason)**: 
     - The reason given is not just a restatement of the proposition in other words. So, it doesn't fit <RR>.
   - **Check for <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**: 
     - The causation provided is not inherently weak or insufficient by itself; it seems potentially valid for the claim of popularity. So, it doesn't fit <WCB>.
   - **Check for <FU> (False Universals)**: 
     - The argument claims that the restaurant is popular because "everyone in town goes there," which might imply that because many people agree on its popularity, it must be true. Therefore, this fits <FU>.
   - **Check for <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)**: 
     - There is no dual interpretation that could work against the speaker. So, it doesn't fit <DEP>.

4. **Cross-Verification**:
   - Reconsider <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>.
     - After review, the best fitting type remains <FU>.

5. **Final Classification**:
   - The string "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there."
     - Classification: <FU>

By methodically following these steps, we accurately identify that the statement falls under the defective argument type <FU> (False Universals).
