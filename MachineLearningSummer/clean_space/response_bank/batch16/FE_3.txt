### Applying IDAA to "People either like coffee or hate it."

#### Step 1: Initial Analysis
- **Objective**: Understand the structure and content of the statement.
- **Action**: Read the statement carefully.

  - Statement: "People either like coffee or hate it."

#### Step 2: Identify Key Elements
- **Objective**: Identify key phrases or words that might indicate a specific type of defective argument.
- **Action**: Highlight any generalizations, enumerations, causal claims, reasons, or universal assertions in the statement.

  - Key elements: Limitation of choices (like coffee or hate it).

#### Step 3: Compare with Definitions
- **Objective**: Compare the elements identified in Step 2 with the definitions of the argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.
- **Action**: Check each element against the characteristics of each argument type.

  - <G>: General truth from a specific instance. This doesn’t apply here as the statement does not generalize from a specific instance.
  - <FE>: False Enumeration, listing fewer or more options than exist. This seems to fit as the statement presents a binary choice.
  - <IR>: Inappropriate reason. This doesn’t apply as there is no reasoning provided to support a proposition.
  - <RR>: Redundant reason. This doesn’t apply as there is no redundancy in reasoning.
  - <WCB>: Weak causal basis. This doesn’t apply as there is no causal relationship presented.
  - <FU>: False universals. This doesn’t apply as the statement does not claim something as universally agreed without proof.
  - <DEP>: Double-edged phrases. This doesn’t apply as the statement isn’t open to dual interpretations against the speaker.

#### Step 4: Pattern Recognition
- **Objective**: Look for patterns or markers that match a specific argument type.
- **Action**: Determine if the statement fits one of the defined patterns.

  - The identified pattern is the presentation of limited set of choices (False Enumeration).

#### Step 5: Rule Out Other Types
- **Objective**: Ensure the selected argument type is the most accurate classification.
- **Action**: Systematically rule out other argument types by demonstrating that they do not apply to the statement.

  - Other argument types do not fit the pattern of presenting a limited set of options.

#### Step 6: Confirmation
- **Objective**: Confirm the classification by cross-referencing with examples and detailed descriptions.
- **Action**: Reevaluate the matching argument type to ensure consistency with the definition and examples.

  - Reevaluate <FE>: The statement indeed lists an enumeration of options (like or hate) that are not exhaustive. People might have neutral feelings about coffee, or they might not care about it at all.

#### Step 7: Final Classification
- **Objective**: Decide on the final classification of the statement <s>.
- **Action**: Conclude which defective argument type the statement represents and provide rationale.

  - **Final Classification**: The argument type for this statement is <FE> (False Enumeration).

By following these steps, we have systematically classified the statement "People either like coffee or hate it." as an example of False Enumeration (<FE>).
