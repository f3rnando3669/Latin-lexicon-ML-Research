Sure, let's apply the <IDAA> process to the string "Everyone else is doing it, so should you".

### Step 1: Understand the Definitions
We need to clearly understand the various defective argument types defined:
- **<G>: Generalization**
- **<FE>: False Enumeration**
- **<IR>: Inappropriate Reason**
- **<RR>: Redundant Reason**
- **<WCB>: Weak Causal Basis**
- **<FU>: False Universals**
- **<DEP>: Double-Edged Phrases**

### Step 2: Identify Keywords and Phrases
The string "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" contains the keyword "Everyone else," suggesting a universal claim.

### Step 3: Analyze the Logical Structure
The logical structure of this argument asserts that since everyone else is participating in an action, you should too. It depends on what others are doing as the reason for why you should do the same.

### Step 4: Compare Against Known Definitions
- **<G>: Generalization** - Not applicable, as it's not generalizing a truth from a specific instance.
- **<FE>: False Enumeration** - Not applicable, as it doesn’t list limited choices.
- **<IR>: Inappropriate Reason** - Not directly providing an irrelevant reason.
- **<RR>: Redundant Reason** - Not merely restating the proposition in different words.
- **<WCB>: Weak Causal Basis** - Doesn’t propose a weak causal relationship.
- **<FU>: False Universals** - This argument type involves asserting universally agreed points without proof, often based on popular opinion.
- **<DEP>: Double-Edged Phrases** - Not offering statements open to dual interpretations.

Given the phrase "everyone else is doing it," it asserts a universally agreed point (i.e., conformity with others) as validation without proof.

### Step 5: Classify the Fallacy
Based on the analysis, the string can be classified as <FU> (False Universals).

### Step 6: Review and Verify
Reviewing the classification, it is clear that "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" aligns with the characteristics of <FU> as it appeals to popularity or the fact that many people do something as a form of validation.

### Final Classification
The string "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" is classified as <FU>.
