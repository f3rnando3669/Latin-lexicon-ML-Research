For 
Certainly! Let's apply the IDAA process to classify the given argument from the provided statements.

### Step-by-Step Application of IDAA to the Given String

#### Step 1: Identify and Parse Input String (`<s>`)
- The string to classify is: 
  ```
  Speaker 1: We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change.
  Speaker 2: Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people.
  ```

#### Step 2: Extract Key Components and Keywords
- **Speaker 1:** "We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change."
- **Speaker 2:** "I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."

#### Step 3: Compare Against Definitions
- **Generalization (`<G>`)**:
  - Not a broad general claim based on a specific instance here.
  
- **False Enumeration (`<FE>`)**:
  - No false choice is presented in Speaker 2's argument.

- **Inappropriate Reason (`<IR>`)**:
  - Potentially fitting; the reason given ("it’s wrong to use people") does not logically follow the action of recruiting volunteers. This may invoke a moral argument but doesn't directly or logically counter the action described by Speaker 1.

- **Redundant Reason (`<RR>`)**:
  - The reason does not restate the proposition using different words.

- **Weak Causal Basis (`<WCB>`)**:
  - The causal link given by Speaker 2 is potentially weak, but it’s more about moral perception rather than a weak cause-effect relationship.

- **False Universals (`<FU>`)**:
  - No broad or universally agreed point asserted without proof.

- **Double-Edged Phrases (`<DEP>`)**:
  - Speaker 2’s phrase could potentially be problematic and interpreted in multiple ways, but does not fully fit the definition of a double-edged phrase.

#### Step 4: Match to Closest Defective Argument Type
- **Inappropriate Reason (`<IR>`)** appears to be the most fitting. Speaker 2 provides a reason rooted in morality that does not logically support his inability to participate in the door-to-door campaign. The reason pertains more to an ethical view rather than directly responding to the practicalities or outcomes of the campaign described by Speaker 1.

#### Step 5: Finalize and Output
- The classified defective argument type is `<IR>`, as Speaker 2’s reason does not logically support the proposition about not participating in the campaign.

### Conclusion:
Given the interaction between Speaker 1 and Speaker 2, the argument provided by Speaker 2, "I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people," is identified as an Inappropriate Reason (`<IR>`).
