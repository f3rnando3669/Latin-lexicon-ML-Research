Sure! Let's apply the step-by-step process of <IDAA> to classify the statement: "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDAA>

#### Step 1: Understanding the Defective Argument Types
We'll refer to the types defined earlier:
- Generalization (<G>)
- False Enumeration (<FE>)
- Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)
- Redundant Reason (<RR>)
- Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- False Universals (<FU>)
- Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)

#### Step 2: Initial Classification (Read and Understand)
Read the statement: "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding."
- The speaker is arguing that their speed was justifiable because it matched the speed of other drivers.

#### Step 3: Identify the Key Elements in the Statement
- The main argument: The driver was keeping pace with other drivers.
- Supporting point: Therefore, the driver believes they weren't speeding.

#### Step 4: Match Against Definitions
Letâ€™s compare the statement against each defective argument type:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**
   - Does not claim a general truth based on a specific instance.
   
2. **False Enumeration (<FE>)**
   - Does not omit or exaggerate the number of options.

3. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**
   - The reasoning here is that if others are doing it, it should be acceptable. However, it does not directly fit into reasoning that doesn't support the proposition.

4. **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**
   - Not merely restating the proposition using different words.

5. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
   - The causality is not about being the root cause of another effect; rather, it justifies the action by comparison.

6. **False Universals (<FU>)**
   - It implies that the action (driving at that speed) is justified because it is what "everyone" was doing, which falls under appealing to the popularity of the action as validation. 

7. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**
   - No dual interpretation or potential for the statement to turn against the speaker.

#### Step 5: Check for Multiple Types
- The statement clearly fits <FU> (False Universals), as it asserts that because many people were doing it, the action is justified.

#### Step 6: Assign the Classification
- Based on the analysis, the statement is classified as <FU> (False Universals).

#### Step 7: Recheck and Validate
- Re-read the statement: "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding."
- Confirming that it asserts a universally accepted point (or at least a widely accepted behavior) without justification.

### Final Classification
The statement: "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding." is classified as <FU> (False Universals).
