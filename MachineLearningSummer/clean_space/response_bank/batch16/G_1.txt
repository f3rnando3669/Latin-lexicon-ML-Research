For 
To apply IDAA to the argument "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!", let's follow the steps meticulously:

### Step 1: Understand the Defective Argument Types
- **Generalization (<G>):** Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Presenting a reason that essentially reiterates the proposition.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Offering an unconvincing causal basis to support the proposition.
- **False Universals (<FU>):** Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Using statements that could be interpreted in dual ways, potentially against the speaker.

### Step 2: Identify Key Characteristics of the Provided Argument

Given the argument: "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!"

Key Characteristics:
- The argument mentions a specific instance of the Catholic Church being involved in a sex scandal cover-up.
- It extends the blame from this specific instance to a 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, implying a general guilt based on an unrelated individual's actions.

### Step 3: Compare with Definitions
- **Generalization (<G>):** The argument seems to be extending a general truth (guilt) based on a specific instance involving the Catholic Church to an individual Catholic neighbor.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Not listing options, hence not applicable here.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** The reasoning of connecting church-wide issues directly to an individual's guilt might be termed inappropriate, but let’s see if it fits better elsewhere.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Argument doesn’t present any redundancy.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** It links involvement of the church with the guilt of the neighbor; this is a shaky causal link but not the primary focus here.
- **False Universals (<FU>):** Does not assert universally agreed points without proof, so doesn’t fit here.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Not an issue of dual interpretation.

### Step 4: Match the Best Fit

Given the key characteristics and comparison with definitions, the argument "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!" most closely matches **Generalization**:

- **Classification: <G> (Generalization)**

This classification fits because the argument wrongly generalizes that a specific instance involving the Catholic Church implicates an individual attending the Church, thus imputing guilt on the neighbor without direct evidence.
