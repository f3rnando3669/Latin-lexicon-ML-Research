For 
Certainly! Let's apply the <IDAA> (decomposition process) to classify the string "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>) of the Classification Task (<IDA>):

1. **Understand the argument in the string (<s>):**
   - Read and comprehend the content of the string to understand what argument is being presented.

2. **Identify the main proposition:**
   - Determine the main claim or proposition within the argument.

3. **Check for specific characteristics linked to each defective argument type:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** Look for a conclusion drawn about all instances from a specific case.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Look for instances where options are falsely limited or expanded.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Identify if the reason given does not logically support the proposition.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Check if the reason is simply a restatement of the proposition.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Assess if the causal relationship provided is insufficient or weak.
   - **False Universals (<FU>):** Look for assertions of universally agreed points without proof.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Identify statements that can be interpreted in dual, potentially contradictory ways.

4. **Match the argument characteristics with the predefined defective argument types:**
   - Compare the identified characteristics with the definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

5. **Classify <s> into the appropriate defective argument type:**
   - Assign the string <s> to the matching defective argument type.

Let's implement the decomposition (<D>) step by step (the <IDAA> process) for the given string example.

### Example String:
"You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."

#### Step 1: Understand the argument in the string
- The string suggests a binary choice: either supporting Hillary Clinton for President or not believing in women's rights.

#### Step 2: Identify the main proposition
- Main Proposition: Supporting Hillary Clinton for President is equated with believing in women's rights.

#### Step 3: Check for specific characteristics:
- Does it draw a general conclusion from a specific instance? No.
- **Does it list fewer options than actually exist?** Yes, it limits the options to only two choices that may not cover all possibilities.
- Does it provide a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition? No.
- Is it a restatement of the proposition? No.
- Does it offer a weak causal basis? No.
- Does it assert universally agreed points without proof? No.
- Is it a statement open to dual interpretations? No.

#### Step 4: Match the argument characteristics with the predefined defective argument types
- The phrase "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" suggests a binary choice and limits the options to these two, fitting the characteristics of <False Enumeration> (FE).

#### Step 5: Classify <s> into the appropriate defective argument type:
- The string "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights." is classified as <FE>.

### Final Classification:
- **String:** "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."
- **Type:** <FE> (False Enumeration)

By following these steps, we've successfully decomposed and classified the argument type for the given string as <FE>.
