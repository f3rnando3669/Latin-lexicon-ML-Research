For 
To apply IDAA to classify the string "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way," we will break down this process step-by-step:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDA (IDAA):

1. **Identify the Claim Type**:
   - The claim encourages an audience to take action based on the fact that others are doing the same.

2. **Analyze Specific Instances**:
   - Check if the string makes a generalization from a specific instance: No, the statement is not about generalizing a specific instance to a general truth.
   - Verify if it contains statements that identify fewer or more options than actually exist: No, it does not present limited or exaggerated options.
   - Determine if it provides a reason not logically supporting the proposition: No, the reasoning is based on the fact that others are doing it.
   - See if it offers a reason that repeats the proposition in different words (redundant reasoning): No, it does not repeat the proposition in different words.
   - Look for weak causal basis: No, it does not present a weak causal relationship.
   - Identify false universals: Yes, it asserts that an action should be taken because others are doing it, appealing to popularity without proof.
   - Determine if it uses double-edged phrases: No, it does not use statements open to dual interpretations.

3. **Classify and Validate**:
   - Based on our analysis, this argument type encourages action because others are performing the same action, relying on popularity or widespread acceptance as a form of validation.
   - Therefore, the string can be classified as **<FU> (False Universals)**.

### Conclusion:

The string "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way" is classified as <FU> because it appeals to the popularity or fact that others are doing something as a form of validation.

**Classification**: **<FU> (False Universals)**
