For 
To apply the task of identifying the defective argument type (<IDA>) to the string "<s>" "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess, all the other classes will all fail it, too." utilizing the decomposed steps (<IDAA>), let’s proceed step-by-step:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>) of the task <IDA> to form <IDAA>:

1. **Understand the Argument Types:** 
   - **<G>:** Generalization - Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - **<FE>:** False Enumeration - Lists fewer or more options than exist.
   - **<IR>:** Inappropriate Reason - Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
   - **<RR>:** Redundant Reason - Reiterates the proposition using different words.
   - **<WCB>:** Weak Causal Basis - Provides a weak causal relation to support the proposition.
   - **<FU>:** False Universals - Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
   - **<DEP>:** Double-Edged Phrases - Uses statements open to dual interpretations.

2. **Develop a Classification Protocol:**
   - **Step 1:** Identify the Proposition and Reasoning. 
   - **Step 2:** Match the Pattern.
   - **Step 3:** Use Elimination.
   - **Step 4:** Confirm the Argument Type.

3. **Detailed Classification Steps:**
   - **Step 1:** Extract the Elements.
   - **Step 2:** Check for Generalization (<G>).
   - **Step 3:** Check for False Enumeration (<FE>).
   - **Step 4:** Check for Inappropriate Reason (<IR>).
   - **Step 5:** Check for Redundant Reason (<RR>).
   - **Step 6:** Check for Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>).
   - **Step 7:** Check for False Universals (<FU>).
   - **Step 8:** Check for Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>).

### Applying the Steps to the String "<s>":

"s = "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess, all the other classes will all fail it, too."

#### Step 1: Extract Elements

- **Proposition:** "All the other classes will fail the Jane Eyre quiz."
- **Reasoning:** "Three kids in one class failed."

#### Step 2: Check for Generalization (<G>)

- **Pattern Matching:** 
  - This argument claims that because three kids in one class failed, all other classes will fail. 
  - This fits the pattern of generalizing from a specific instance to a broader conclusion. 

#### Step 3: Check for False Enumeration (<FE>)

- **Pattern Matching:**
  - Enumeration does not apply here, as the argument is not presenting a limited set of choices or outcomes.

#### Step 4: Check for Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)

- **Pattern Matching:**
  - The reason given (three kids failing) doesn't support the broad conclusion logically, but this falls under the scope of generalizing a specific instance rather than providing an irrelevant reason.

#### Step 5: Check for Redundant Reason (<RR>)

- **Pattern Matching:**
  - There is no redundant reasoning found here — no repetition in different words.

#### Step 6: Check for Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)

- **Pattern Matching:**
  - This is more about correlation rather than a weak causal relationship due to generalizing from one instance.

#### Step 7: Check for False Universals (<FU>)

- **Pattern Matching:**
  - The argument doesn't assert a universally accepted point without proof but rather generalizes a specific instance to a broad generalization.

#### Step 8: Check for Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)

- **Pattern Matching:**
  - This argument doesn’t include statements open to dual interpretations.

### Conclusion

- By following these steps, we can rule out <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.
- The argument type that best fits the provided string "<s>" is **Generalization (<G>)** because it claims a general truth ("all other classes will fail") based on a specific instance ("three kids in one class failed").

Thus, the string "\("Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess, all the other classes will all fail it, too."\)" is classified as **<G> (Generalization)**.
