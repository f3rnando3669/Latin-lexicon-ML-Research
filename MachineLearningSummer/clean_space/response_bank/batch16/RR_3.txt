For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given dialogue, we need to follow our step-by-step decomposed process for classifying the argument. The steps are:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <t> into IDAA

#### Step 1: Understand the Argument Types
- **Generalization (<G>)**: Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Repeats the same idea as the proposition using different words.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Provides an insufficient causal relationship.
- **False Universals (<FU>)**: Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Uses statements open to dual interpretations that could be problematic.

#### Step 2: Parse and Analyze \( \langle s \rangle \)
Let's carefully read and understand the statements in the dialogue:
- **Speaker 1**: Jesus was not really crucified.
- **Speaker 2**: How do I know that’s true?
- **Speaker 1**: Because the Quran says so.
- **Speaker 2**: How do I know the Quran is correct?
- **Speaker 1**: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.
- **Speaker 2**: How do I know that’s true?
- **Speaker 1**: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran.

#### Step 3: Match \( \langle s \rangle \) to Argument Types
The dialogue seems to involve reasoning that circulates within itself, without providing external validation:

- **Speaker 1**'s statements rely on each other in a circular reasoning pattern. The Quran is true because it is the Word of God, and it is the Word of God because it says so in the Quran. This is a repeating pattern of reasoning that doesn't step outside the original claim.
- This corresponds to redundancy in reasoning where essentially the same claim is repeated in different words.

#### Step 4: Classification
Based on the observed patterns:
- This instance appears to fall under **Redundant Reason (<RR>)** because each claim is supporting itself without providing new, independent evidence.

### Conclusion
The classification of the argument presented by Speaker 1 in the dialogue is <RR> (Redundant Reason).
