For 
Let's apply the steps of <IDAA> to classify the string "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far."

### Step 1: Understanding the Task
Classify this statement into one of the given defective argument types.

### Step 2: Define Each Defective Argument Type
We already have the definitions:
- **<G> Generalization:** Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **<FE> False Enumeration:** Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **<IR> Inappropriate Reason:** Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- **<RR> Redundant Reason:** Appearing to present a new reason but restates the proposition.
- **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis:** Offering a causal basis that isn't compelling enough.
- **<FU> False Universals:** Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
- **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases:** Using statements open to dual interpretations.

### Step 3: Analyze the String
- Structure: "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far."
- Key components: "Donald Trump got elected" and "liberals took political correctness too far."

### Step 4: Match the String to the Definitions
- **<G>:** This is not a generalization based on a specific instance.
- **<FE>:** This is not about listing fewer or more options.
- **<IR>:** The offered reason ("liberals took political correctness too far") may not logically support the proposition ("The reason Donald Trump got elected").
- **<RR>:** This doesn't appear to be rephrasing the proposition.
- **<WCB>:** The causal basis ("liberals took political correctness too far") may not be compelling enough to directly link it to the proposition ("Donald Trump got elected").
- **<FU>:** This is not about universally agreed points without proof.
- **<DEP>:** This is not a double-edged phrase.

### Step 5: Classify the String
This statement fits the description of **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis** because it offers a causal basis that may not be compelling enough to logically support the proposition.

### Step 6: Justify the Classification
"The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far" suggests a cause (political correctness) that may not be strong or sufficient enough to explain the complex phenomenon of why Donald Trump got elected, thus it is classified as **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis**.
