For 
Certainly! Let's apply the steps from <IDAA> to classify the given string:

### Given string <s>: 
"Perhaps the most classic example of this fallacy is the argument for the existence of God. Due to the understanding of nature through science, many of the arguments that used to be used for God (or gods) were abandoned, only to be replaced with new ones, usually involving questions to which science has not definitively answered yet. The move from creationism to intelligent design is a prime example. Currently, the origin of life is a popular argument for God (although a classic argument from ignorance), and an area where we very well may have a scientific answer in the next decade, at which time, the “origin of life” argument will fade away and be replaced by another, thus moving the figurative goalposts farther back as our understanding of the natural world increases. Exception: This fallacy should not be confused with an argument or set of arguments, with multiple propositions inherent in the argument. The reason for the difference between this kind of argument and the moving the goalposts fallacy, is a subtle one, but indicated by a strong initial claim (“has to be”, “must”, “required for”, etc.) that gets answered and/or what appears to be ad hoc objections that follow eventually leading to an impossible request for proof. Fun Fact: The name “moving the goalposts” comes from the analogy of kicking a perfect field goal in American football, only to have the goalposts be moved on you. This would be very unfair. References: This is a logical fallacy frequently used on the Internet. No academic sources could be found. Questions about this fallacy? Ask our community!"

### Step-by-Step Analysis using <IDAA>:

1. **Identify Keywords and Phrases in <s>**
   - Some key phrases: 
     - "argument for the existence of God"
     - "understanding of nature through science"
     - "arguments ... were abandoned, only to be replaced with new ones"
     - "move from creationism to intelligent design"
     - "origin of life"
     - "argument from ignorance"
     - "moving the figurative goalposts farther back"
     - "strong initial claim ('has to be', 'must', 'required for')"
     - "ad hoc objections"
     - "request for proof"

2. **Contextual Analysis**
   - The passage discusses the evolution of arguments used to support the existence of God, arguing that as science advances, old arguments are replaced by new ones. Specifically, it addresses the tendency to shift the basis of such arguments as scientific knowledge grows, likening it to the fallacy of "moving the goalposts."

3. **Compare with Definitions**
   - Comparing with the provided defective argument types:
     - **<G> (Generalization)**: Not a broad claim based on a single instance.
     - **<FE> (False Enumeration)**: Does not list limited or excessive options.
     - **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**: Does not provide illogical reasons directly.
     - **<RR> (Redundant Reason)**: Does not repeat the same point using different words.
     - **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**: Not focused on weak cause-and-effect reasoning.
     - **<FU> (False Universals)**: Potential overlap with false universals, as it assumes a pattern in theological arguments responding to scientific advances without proving each shift.
     - **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)**: Does not present dual interpretations that might be contra the speaker.

4. **Determine Defective Argument Type**
   - Upon closer scrutiny:
     - **False Enumeration (<FE>)** could be considered because it implies only two possibilities (creationism, intelligent design) without acknowledging others.
     - **False Universals (<FU>)** fits well because it asserts a pattern (replacing old arguments with new ones in light of scientific advances) as a general and universal phenomenon, without specific proof for each instance.
     - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)** and **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)** may indirectly apply due to the perceived lack of substantive support for the broader argument's rational basis; still, they are less fitting in the context compared to the broader universal claim.

   - The most fitting defective argument type for this string <s> is **<FU> (False Universals)** because it generalizes that all past and future arguments for God's existence follow the same pattern of shifting goalposts as scientific knowledge increases, without providing specific evidence for all instances. 

By systematically breaking down and analyzing the content of <s>, we've identified **<FU> (False Universals)** as the faulty argument type.
