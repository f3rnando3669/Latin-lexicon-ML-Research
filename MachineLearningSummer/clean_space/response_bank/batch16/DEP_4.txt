For 
Sure, let's apply the decomposed task \( <IDAA> \) to classify the given statement \( <s> \):

**Statement \( <s> \): "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being.  Fetuses are innocent human beings.  Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."**

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Identify the Argument Pattern:**
   - The statement is structured as a logical argument with a premise and conclusion. It attempts to build a moral case regarding the immorality of killing based on the innocence of human beings.

2. **Check for Generalization (<G>):**
   - No, the statement is not making a general claim based on a specific instance. It is instead arguing from moral premises.

3. **Check for False Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - No, the statement does not present a limited set of options or create an artificial dichotomy.

4. **Check for Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):**
   - No, the reasoning provided is directly tied to the moral proposition being advanced (immorality of killing based on innocence).

5. **Check for Redundant Reason (<RR>):**
   - No, the statement does not restate the proposition using different words. It employs a structured syllogism.

6. **Check for Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - No, the statement is not offering a causal relationship; it is providing a moral argument.

7. **Check for False Universals (<FU>):**
   - No, the statement is based on specific moral premises rather than asserting universally agreed points without proof. It does not appeal to popularity or an unsubstantiated unanimous belief.

8. **Check for Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):**
   - No, the statement is straightforward in its moral claim and does not use ambiguous or equivocal language that can be interpreted in dual ways.

### Conclusion:
The provided statement "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being.  Fetuses are innocent human beings.  Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses." does not seem to fit any of the defective argument types provided (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>). It appears to be a structured moral argument with clear premises aimed at supporting its conclusion.

Thus, \( <s> \) does **not** classify under any of the provided defective argument types.
