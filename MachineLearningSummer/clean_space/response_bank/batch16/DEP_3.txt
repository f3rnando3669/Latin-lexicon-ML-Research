For 
To classify the statement "I see nobody on the road," said Alice. "I only wish I had such eyes," the king remarked..."To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why it's as much as I can do to see real people, by this light." using <IDAA>, we will follow the decomposed steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Definitions
Revisit the definitions of each defective argument type:
- **Generalization (<G>)**: Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Restates the proposition using different words.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Offers a causal basis that isn't compelling.
- **False Universals (<FU>)**: Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Uses statements open to dual interpretations.

### Step 2: Analyze the Statement’s Structure
Examine the statement's structure to identify key components:
- Context: Alice sees "nobody" on the road.
- King's remark: The king interprets this literally, wishing he could "see Nobody" at a distance, implying an imaginative or confusing use of language.

### Step 3: Match to Definitions
Match the components of the statement to the given definitions:
- The king takes "seeing nobody" literally, which creates dual interpretations (seeing no one vs. seeing someone named Nobody).

### Step 4: Validate the Classification
Cross-check the classification by ensuring the key components match the specific defective argument type:
- The statement uses "nobody" in dual senses: figuratively (no people) and literally (as if Nobody was a person).
- This usage introduces ambiguity and dual interpretation.

### Step 5: Document the Process
Document the steps taken to classify the statement:
1. **Understand Definitions**:
   - <DEP>: Uses statements open to dual interpretations.
2. **Analyze Structure**:
   - Alice’s statement "I see nobody" contrasts with the king’s interpretation of "nobody".
3. **Match to Definitions**:
   - The dual interpretation fits <DEP>.
4. **Validate Classification**:
   - Multiple layers of meaning confirm the presence of **<DEP>** logic.
5. **Classification**:
   - **<DEP>** (Double-Edged Phrases).

### Conclusion
The statement “I see nobody on the road,” said Alice. "I only wish I had such eyes," the king remarked..."To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why it's as much as I can do to see real people, by this light." is classified as **<DEP>** because it uses the word "nobody" in such a way that it can be interpreted in two different ways, introducing ambiguity and dual interpretation.
