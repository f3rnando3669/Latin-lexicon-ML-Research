For 
Let's apply the IDAA process to classify the string "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today."

### Step-by-Step Classification of Defective Arguments (IDAA)

#### Input String:
"I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today."

#### Step 1: Understand and Parse the Input
- **Objective:** Comprehend the given string to classify.
- **Action:** Read and analyze: "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today."
- **Observation:** The sentence makes a connection between being a good person and attending class.

#### Step 2: Identify Argument Patterns
- **Objective:** Identify which type of logical pattern the string follows.
- **Action:** Analyze for key phrases or structures that match <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

#### Step 3: Match Against Definitions
- **Objective:** Match the identified pattern to the predefined argument types.
- **Action:** Assess each type:
  - <G>: Generalization based on a specific instance.
    - Not applicable as it doesn’t broadly generalize an attribute based on a single case.
  - <FE>: False Enumeration listing fewer/more options than exist.
    - Not applicable as there are no options being listed.
  - <IR>: Inappropriate Reason.
    - The argument connects the concept of being a good person to class attendance, which seems irrelevant.
  - <RR>: Redundant Reason.
    - Not applicable as it doesn’t simply restate the proposition.
  - <WCB>: Weak Causal Basis.
    - The connection between being good and attending class may appear weak, but it’s more about relevance than causality.
  - <FU>: False Universals.
    - Not applicable as it doesn’t assert a universally agreed point.
  - <DEP>: Double-Edged Phrases.
    - Not applicable as there seems to be no double interpretation.

#### Step 4: Eliminate Non-Matching Types
- **Objective:** Narrow down possible types.
- **Action:** Eliminate <G>, <FE>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP> as they do not fit the argument structure or intent.

#### Step 5: Final Classification
- **Objective:** Arrive at a final classification.
- **Action:** The argument fits <IR> (Inappropriate Reason) as it provides a reason that logically doesn’t support the proposition (being a good person is irrelevantly linked to class attendance).

#### Step 6: Validate the Classification
- **Objective:** Ensure the classification is correct.
- **Action:** Re-check the input:
  - "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today." confirms an inappropriate reason as class attendance does not logically determine someone's goodness.

Thus, the classification for the string "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today." is <IR>.
