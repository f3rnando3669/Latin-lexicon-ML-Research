### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Classification (<IDAA>) for the String:

**String <s>:** "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you."

#### Step 1: Understand the Argument Types
We first ensure a clear understanding of each defective argument type:
- **Generalization (<G>):** Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Providing a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Presenting a reason that restates the proposition in different words.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Offering an insufficient causal relationship to support the claim.
- **False Universals (<FU>):** Assert universally agreed points without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Using statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.

#### Step 2: Identify the Proposition in <s>
The main proposition in the string is: "I’m not going to talk to you."

#### Step 3: Analyze the Supporting Evidence or Reason
The supporting evidence provided is: "My best friend says you’re a liar."

#### Step 4: Match Characteristics to Definitions
Now we compare the characteristics of the supporting evidence to the definitions of the defective argument types:
- **Generalization (<G>):** There is no general claim based on a specific instance; the argument is specific and personal.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>):** No options are presented, so this doesn’t apply.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** The reason given for not talking to the person is that the speaker's friend believes the other is a liar, which could be seen as not logically supporting the proposition because the friend's belief isn't necessarily a valid justification.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** The reason does not restate the proposition using different words.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal basis here (friend's opinion) is not directly about a causation; it's more about a personal judgment.
- **False Universals (<FU>):** There are no universally agreed points claimed without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** The statement isn’t open to dual interpretations.

#### Step 5: Assign Classification
The classification here is primarily based on the nature of the justification provided. The reason does not logically support the proposition adequately, as it relies solely on the friend’s opinion without further evidence. Thus, the argument can be classified under:

**Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**

So, applying <IDAA> to the string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you." results in the classification:
- **Defective Argument Type:** <IR>
