### Applying IDAA to the Example Statement

Statement: 
"Speaker 1: We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change.
Speaker 2: Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."

1. **Identify Statement Type (Clause Identification):**
    - The combined dialogue consists of two separate propositions.

2. **Isolate Clauses:**
    - For Speaker 2's statement:
      - Clause 1 (Reason): "because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."
      - Clause 2 (Proposition): "Well then, I can’t be a part of this" – conclusion based on the reasoning provided.

3. **Evaluate Clauses Independently:**
    - Clause 1: "because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people" – a personal belief or teaching that morally condemns using people.
    - Clause 2: "Well then, I can’t be a part of this" – the decision to not participate based on the given reasoning.

4. **Analyze Logical Relationship:**
    - Speaker 2's reason for not participating is based on a teaching regarding the moral wrongness of using people. The term "using" isn't further defined or analyzed in the context provided by Speaker 1.

5. **Classify the Flaw:**
    - The argument could be seen as committing an Irrelevant Reason (IR) because the word "using" people is being interpreted negatively without considering the context of spreading awareness about social injustice. The moral teaching about not "using" people does not directly address the nature of their involvement in the specific activity described by Speaker 1.

### Therefore, the classification of the statement by Speaker 2 is:
   - <IR>: "Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."

By following the decomposed steps (IDAA), we can accurately classify the fallacy present in the argument made by Speaker 2.
