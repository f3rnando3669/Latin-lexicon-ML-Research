Sure, let's apply the step-by-step approach to classify the given string "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding."

### Step-by-step Decomposition (D)

1. **Identify the structure of the sentence:**
   - This sentence consists of two clauses.
   - The first clause ("Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me") provides a reason.
   - The second clause ("I'm sure I wasn't speeding") is a proposition.
   - The sentence seems to imply a justification based on the behavior of others.

2. **Match sentence structure to defective argument type:**
   - Check if it makes a causal claim based on insufficient evidence.
   - Evaluate whether it lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - See if it claims a universally accepted truth without proof.
   - Ensure if the statement has dual interpretations.
   - Verify if the conclusion precedes the reason.
   - Determine if the reason does not support the proposition.

### Application (IDAA)

1. **Identify the structure of the sentence:**
   - The sentence presents a reason for the action ("I was only driving as fast as everyone around me").
   - It follows with a proposition based on that reason ("I'm sure I wasn't speeding").
   - The proposition draws a conclusion based on the behavior of others.

2. **Match sentence structure to defective argument type:**
   - This argument seems to rely on the behavior of others to justify its correctness, asserting that since everyone else was driving at that speed, it must have been acceptable.
   - This is closely related to the assertion of a universally accepted truth based on the behavior of others without sufficient evidence for the specific case in question.
   
**Classification:** This is an example of <FU> (False Universals).

The reason "driving as fast as everyone around me" implies a universal acceptance that such behavior is not speeding, without proving that it actually was within speed limits.
