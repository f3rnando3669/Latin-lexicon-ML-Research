Sure, let's apply the process of <IDAA> (the application of decomposition <D> to the task <IDA>) to the given string "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way."

### Step 1: Identify the components

- The string contains the phrase: "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way."

### Step 2: Define Logical Structure

- The structure here involves an encouragement or argument to act in a certain way.
- The argument is based on the reason that other people are acting in the same way.

### Step 3: Compare with Definitions

- **<G> (Generalization)**: Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
  - This doesn’t seem to fit, as no specific instance is provided. 
  
- **<FE> (False Enumeration)**: Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
  - This doesn’t seem to fit, as no enumeration of options is involved.
  
- **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**: Offering a weak or non-compelling causal basis.
  - This doesn’t seem to fit, as it is not presenting a causal relationship.
  
- **<FU> (False Universals)**: Asserting universally agreed points without proof, often appealing to popularity.
  - This type of argument encourages an action based on what others are doing, aiming at logical validation through appeal to majority opinion.
  
- **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)**: Statements open to dual interpretations.
  - This doesn’t seem to fit, as no dual interpretation is pinpointed.
  
- **<RR> (Reason-Conclusion Reversed)**: Clause 1 is a reason and clause 2 is a conclusion, with the sentence beginning with the conclusion.
  - This doesn’t seem to fit, as the sentence structure is not set up that way.
  
- **<IR> (Irrelevant Reason)**: The reason does not support the proposition.
  - This doesn’t fit, as the argument (while potentially flawed) does center on relevance.

### Step 4: Classify the String

The string "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way." seems to match the definition of **<FU> (False Universals)**, as it appeals to the popularity or fact that many people are doing something as an attempt to validate the action.

Thus, the string should be classified as **<FU>**.

By following these steps, we systematically classify the given string into its respective defective argument type.
