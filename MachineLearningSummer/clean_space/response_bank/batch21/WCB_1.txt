For 
Certainly! Let's apply the step-by-step decomposition (<D>) to the given string <s> to classify it according to the defective argument types.

### Example String <s>:
"The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far."

#### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>)

**Step 1: Identify Clauses in the Statement**
- Clause 1: "The reason Donald Trump got elected"
- Clause 2: "was because liberals took political correctness too far."

**Step 2: Analyze Clause Types**
- Clause 1 is a proposition presenting an outcome (Donald Trump got elected).
- Clause 2 provides a reason (liberals took political correctness too far).

**Step 3: Evaluate the Logical Structure**
- The sentence starts with the conclusion "The reason Donald Trump got elected."
- It then presents the reason "liberals took political correctness too far."

**Step 4: General Patterns and Keywords**
- This sentence may suggest a cause-and-effect relationship that is not compelling or fully explained. We need to consider if the reason given is strong enough to support the proposition.

**Step 5: Classify <s>**
- The sentence claims that the cause of Donald Trump getting elected is the liberals' actions regarding political correctness. This presents a causal basis, but it is not necessarily a compelling or comprehensive reason to explain the election outcome.
  
This fits the pattern of a **Weak Causal Basis** (Type <WCB>), since it attributes a complex event (the election of Donald Trump) to a single oversimplified cause without sufficient evidence.

Therefore, applying the decomposition steps to the given string <s> results in the classification as type <WCB>.
