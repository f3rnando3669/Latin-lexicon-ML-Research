For 
To apply **<IDAA>** (the application of **<D>** to **<IDA>**) to the example string **<s>** "Everyone else is doing it, so should you", we will follow the systematic approach detailed in the decomposition (**<D>**).

### Step 1: Identify the Structure of the Argument

- The argument uses the phrase "Everyone else is doing it," which asserts that something is good or should be done because others are doing it.
- It does not list options, so it’s not **<FE>**.
- It does not present a causal relationship, so it’s not **<WCB>**.
- It does not seem to have a phrase open to dual interpretation, so it’s not **<DEP>**.
- It asserts a universally accepted or popular opinion without proof, implying that the action is valid because it is popular.

### Step 2: Analyze the Reason-Proposition Relationship

- The sentence structure implies a universally agreed point: because "Everyone else is doing it," one should also do it.
- The reason given is based on the popular acceptance of the action, not on any specific evidence or detailed reasoning.

### Step 3: Classify the Argument

- Based on the structure and reason-proposition relationship, the argument fits the description of **<FU>** (False Universals).

**Final Classification: <FU>**

Thus, the example string **<s>** "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" has been classified as of type **<FU>**.
