For 
To apply the task \( IDAA \) to the string "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess all the other classes will all fail it, too.", follow the decomposition steps detailed above:

### Step 1: Identify Argument Structure

- **Clause Identification:** 
  - Clause 1: "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz"
  - Clause 2: "I guess all the other classes will all fail it, too."

The string suggests a general outcome based on a specific instance of a few students failing a quiz.

### Step 2: Type Matching

- **Compare with Definitions:**
  - **G (Generalization):** Yes, the point makes a general claim about the likelihood of all classes failing the quiz based on the specific instance of three kids failing it in one class.
  - **FE (False Enumeration):** No, the point does not enumerate options.
  - **WCB (Weak Causal Basis):** No, it is not attempting to establish a weak causal relationship.
  - **RR (Reason-Conclusion with reversed order):** No, the structure does not begin with the conclusion.
  - **IR (Irrelevant Reason):** No, there is no irrelevant reason provided.
  - **FU (False Universals):** Although it might seem similar, this point does not assert a universally agreed point without proof.
  - **DEP (Double-Edged Phrases):** No, it doesnâ€™t use statements with dual interpretations.

Based on these comparisons, the string matches **Generalization (G)**.

### Step 3: Classify

- **Classification Result:**
  - The string "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess all the other classes will all fail it, too." is categorized as **<G>**. 

This categorization fits because the argument makes a general claim from a specific instance, hence representing a generalization.
