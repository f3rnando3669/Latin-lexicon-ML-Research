For 
Certainly! Let's apply the step-by-step decomposition of IDAA to the given string, "People either like coffee or hate it."

### Step-by-Step Analysis for IDAA

#### Given string `<s>`: “People either like coffee or hate it.”

1. **Identifying Components:**
   - The string makes an assertion about people's preferences regarding coffee.
   - It enumerates two options: liking coffee or hating it.

2. **Checking for Generalization (<G>):**
   - This argument does not seem to generalize based on a specific instance but rather provides options.

3. **Checking for False Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Yes, this statement lists only two options regarding people's preferences for coffee: liking it or hating it.
   - It fails to acknowledge that some people might have a neutral stance on coffee, neither liking nor hating it.

4. **Checking for Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - There is no causal basis indicated in this statement.

5. **Checking for False Universals (<FU>):**
   - There is no assertion claiming universal agreement without proof.

6. **Checking for Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):**
   - The statement is not open to dual interpretations that could backfire on the speaker.

7. **Checking for Defective Argument Types with Clauses (<RR> or <IR>):**
   - The statement does not seem to begin with a conclusion followed by a reason, nor does it present an unsupported reason for a proposition.

### Conclusion:
Since the string "People either like coffee or hate it." presents options but limits the choice to only two, it is best classified under:

- The argument type is **<FE>** (False Enumeration).

This classification identifies that the argument is defective due to providing an incomplete enumeration of options regarding people's feelings about coffee.
