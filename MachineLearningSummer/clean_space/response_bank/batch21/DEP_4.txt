Alright, let's apply the step-by-step decomposition \(<IDAA>\) to the string \(<s>\): "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of the Task (\(<D>\) as applied to \(<IDA>\))

1. **Identify the Structure**:
   - The given string can be broken down into three parts:
     - "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being."
     - "Fetuses are innocent human beings."
     - "Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."

2. **Evaluate Reason and Proposition**:
   - Proposition: "Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."
   - Reason 1: "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being."
   - Reason 2: "Fetuses are innocent human beings."
   - The conclusion is drawn from the two reasons provided.

3. **Check for Generalization (\(<G>\))**:
   - The reasons and proposition are not making a general truth based on a specific instance. So, this is not \(<G>\).

4. **Check for False Enumeration (\(<FE>\))**:
   - The argument does not involve limiting choices to fewer or more options than what actually exists. It’s not \(<FE>\).

5. **Check for Weak Causal Basis (\(<WCB>\))**:
   - The argument provides clear reasons and a strong causal link that builds the proposition. It’s not \(<WCB>\).

6. **Check for False Universals (\(<FU>\))**:
   - While the first reason might be viewed as a universally accepted moral statement, it does not fall into the category of \(<FU>\) because it does not assert a popular opinion without proof, but rather, it presents moral reasoning.

7. **Check for Double-Edged Phrases (\(<DEP>\))**:
   - The statements made are not open to dual interpretations in a way that might go against the speaker. It’s not \(<DEP>\).

8. **Check for RR and IR**:
   - The conclusion "Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses." is derived from the two premises given. Let’s break them down:
     - The structure of the argument does not start with the conclusion, so it’s not \(<RR>\).
     - The reasons presented actually support the proposition, which means it’s not \(<IR>\).

### Conclusion:

The string "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses." does not fit clearly into any of the defective argument types \(<G>\), \(<FE>\), \(<IR>\), \(<RR>\), \(<WCB>\), \(<FU>\), or \(<DEP>\) as defined in this context.
This indicates that this string does not represent a defective argument type as per the given definitions. It forms a structured argument where the conclusion is logically drawn from the premises.

Would you like to provide another string \(<s>\) for classification or further explanation of any specific step?
