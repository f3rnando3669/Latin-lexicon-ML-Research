For 
To apply \( <IDAA> \) to classify the given string \( s \) as one of the defective argument types \( <G> \), \( <FE> \), \( <IR> \), \( <RR> \), \( <WCB> \), \( <FU> \), or \( <DEP> \), we will follow the decomposed steps:

### Given String \( s \):
"Perhaps the most classic example of this fallacy is the argument for the existence of God. Due to the understanding of nature through science, many of the arguments that used to be used for God (or gods) were abandoned, only to be replaced with new ones, usually involving questions to which science has not definitively answered yet. The move from creationism to intelligent design is a prime example. Currently the origin of life is a popular argument for God (although a classic argument from ignorance), and an area where we very well may have a scientific answer in the next decade, at which time, the “origin of life” argument will fade away and be replaced by another, thus moving the figurative goalposts farther back as our understanding of the natural world increases. Exception: This fallacy should not be confused with an argument or set of arguments, with multiple propositions inherent in the argument. The reason for the difference between this kind of argument and the moving the goalposts fallacy is a subtle one, but indicated by a strong initial claim (“has to be”, “must”, “required for”, etc.) that gets answered and/or what appears to be ad hoc objections that follow eventually leading to an impossible request for proof. Fun Fact: The name “moving the goalposts” comes from the analogy of kicking a perfect field goal in American football, only to have the goalposts be moved on you. This would be very unfair.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Structure of the Argument**:
   - This string is more explanatory and illustrative rather than a straightforward argument with a clear \( <Reason> \) and \( <Proposition> \).

2. **Evaluate Content of the Argument**:
   - Analyze to match with specific defective argument types:
     - **Generalization \( <G> \)**: Not applicable, as it doesn't claim a general truth based on a specific instance.
     - **False Enumeration \( <FE> \)**: Not applicable, as it doesn’t list fewer or more options than actually exist.
     - **Weak Causal Basis \( <WCB> \)**: Not applicable, as there is no weak causal claim.
     - **False Universals \( <FU> \)**: Not applicable, as it does not assert universally agreed points without proof.
     - **Double-Edged Phrases \( <DEP> \)**: Not applicable, as it doesn’t use phrases with dual interpretations.
     - **\( <RR> \)**: Not applicable, as it does not begin with a conclusion followed by supporting reason.
     - **\( <IR> \)**: Not applicable, as it doesn't show a supporting statement that doesn’t credibly sustain the conclusion.

3. **Parse the Sentence**:
   - The sentence explains and gives examples of the "moving the goalposts" fallacy. It does not follow a typical argument pattern but rather describes a logical fallacy conceptually.

4. **Contextual Analysis**:
   - The context is educational, explaining a known logical fallacy rather than making an argument itself.

5. **Decision Tree Analysis**:
   - The given string \( s \) doesn’t fit into any predefined defective argument types \( <G> \), \( <FE> \), \( <IR> \), \( <RR> \), \( <WCB> \), \( <FU> \), or \( <DEP> \) as it is an explanatory text discussing the logical fallacy known as “moving the goalposts.”

### Conclusion:

The given string \( s \) is classified as **None of the Above** because it is an explanatory passage about a logical fallacy, not an instance of a defective argument itself. There is no identifiable \( <Reason> \) inappropriately paired with a \( <Proposition> \) in the explanatory context provided.
