Sure, let's apply the decomposition of the advanced task of classifying the string "<s> = 'You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights'" step by step, using the process outlined in <IDAA>.

### Step 1: Understanding the Types of Defective Arguments
We have already defined the types of defective arguments:
1. **Generalization (G)**
2. **False Enumeration (FE)**
3. **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**
4. **False Universals (FU)**
5. **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**
6. **Reason-Reversed (RR)**
7. **Invalid Reasoning (IR)**

### Step 2: Analyze the Given String
The string is: "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."

### Step 3: Step-by-Step Classification Process

#### Step 3.1: Identify Generalization (G)
- Does it make a broad claim based on a specific instance? 
  - No, it doesnâ€™t generalize based on a specific instance.

#### Step 3.2: Identify False Enumeration (FE)
- Does it list only two options when there may be more?
  - Yes, it presents only two options: supporting Hillary Clinton or not believing in women's rights, ignoring other possibilities.

Thus, we have identified that the string fits the category of **False Enumeration (FE)**.

#### Step 3.3: Identify Weak Causal Basis (WCB)
- Is the causal connection weak or non-compelling?
  - Not applicable; this argument does not present a weak causal basis.

#### Step 3.4: Identify False Universals (FU)
- Does it assert a universally agreed point without proof?
  - No, it does not make a universal assertion.

#### Step 3.5: Identify Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)
- Is the statement open to dual interpretations?
  - No, it is not open to dual interpretations that backfire.

#### Step 3.6: Identify Reason-Reversed (RR)
- Does the sentence begin with the conclusion? 
  - No, it does not start with a conclusion followed by a reason.

#### Step 3.7: Identify Invalid Reasoning (IR)
- Does clause 1 not support clause 2?
  - No, it does not present invalid reasoning in the sense defined.

### Conclusion
Having analyzed the string methodically and identified that it fits the pattern of **False Enumeration (FE)**, we can conclude:

The string "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights." is classified as of type <FE>.
