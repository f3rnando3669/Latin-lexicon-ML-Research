For 
To classify the statement "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people." using the \( IDAA \) approach, let's break it down step by step:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of \( IDA \)

**Step 1: Identify the structure of the statement \( s \)**
- The statement is a single sentence with a proposition ("We need to fix our broken judicial system") and a suggested solution ("by electing new people").

**Step 2: Analyze the components of the statement:**
- The statement \( s \) contains a Proposition: "We need to fix our broken judicial system."
- It suggests a reason or method: "by electing new people."

**Step 3: Categorize based on the statement pattern:**
1. **Generalization \( <G> \):**
    - This statement is not a general truth based on a specific instance, so it does not fit \( <G> \).

2. **False Enumeration \( <FE> \):**
    - This statement does not explicitly provide a false dichotomy or list limited options, so it does not fit \( <FE> \).

3. **Weak Causal Basis \( <WCB> \):**
    - The statement suggests causality (electing new people will fix the judicial system) but does not strongly support how electing new people will directly fix the system. This might fit \( <WCB> \).

4. **False Universals \( <FU> \):**
    - The statement does not assert universally agreed points without proof, so it does not fit \( <FU> \).

5. **Double-Edged Phrases \( <DEP> \):**
    - The statement does not have an ambiguous or dual meaning, so it does not fit \( <DEP> \).

6. **Reason-Result \( <RR> \):**
    - The statement does not begin with a conclusion followed by a reason in the pattern of "This is true because of that," so it does not fit \( <RR> \).

7. **Irrelevant Reason \( <IR> \):**
    - The statement does not seem to provide a reason unrelated to the proposition, so it does not fit \( <IR> \).

**Step 4: Apply the categorized pattern to \( s \):**
- Given the analysis, the statement "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people" seems to lack a compelling causal basis for why electing new people will specifically solve the problem of a broken judicial system. Therefore, it is best classified as \( <WCB> \) (Weak Causal Basis).

So, applying \( IDAA \) to the statement "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people." classifies it as:

**This logical fallacy is called \( <WCB> \) (Weak Causal Basis).**
