For 
Let's apply the <IDAA> to the string: "In the race for mayor, Lara says a vote for her opponent will lead to you losing your job. What fallacy has she committed?"

### Step-by-Step Application:

#### Step 1: Identify the Structure of the Statement
- The statement implies a consequence (losing your job) based on an action (voting for her opponent). It suggests a reason (voting for the opponent) and a conclusion/proposition (losing your job).

#### Step 2: Check for Generalization (<G>)
- The statement does not appear to be making a broad generalization from a specific instance. It focuses on a specific outcome related to voting.

#### Step 3: Check for False Enumeration (<FE>)
- The statement does not list multiple options or provide an artificial dichotomy; it asserts a specific negative outcome.

#### Step 4: Check for Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- The statement suggests a causal relationship (voting for the opponent leads to losing your job) but does not provide compelling evidence for this claim. It relies on the fear of personal loss without substantial backing, indicating a weak causal basis.

#### Step 5: Check for False Universals (<FU>)
- The statement does not assert universally agreed points or appeal to popularity.

#### Step 6: Check for Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)
- The statement is not ambiguous or open to dual interpretations; it directly states a supposed consequence.

#### Step 7: Check for Reason-Reversed Argument (<RR>)
- The conclusion (losing your job) is wrongly presented as a direct result of the reason (voting for the opponent) without strong evidence. However, it does not start with the conclusion, so this isn't a classic case of <RR>.

#### Step 8: Check for Irrelevant Reason (<IR>)
- The reason (voting for the opponent) is directly related to the conclusion (losing your job) but lacks logical support. It's more about establishing an unproven cause.

#### Step 9: Classify <s>
- Based on the checks, the string "In the race for mayor, Lara says a vote for her opponent will lead to you losing your job" best fits the criteria for Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>).

### Conclusion:
The given string "In the race for mayor, Lara says a vote for her opponent will lead to you losing your job" is classified as <WCB>, demonstrating a defective argument type based on a weak causal basis.
