For 
Certainly! Let's apply the step-by-step decomposition and classification task <IDAA> to the given string:

**String \(s\)**: "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!"

### Step-by-Step Application of <IDAA>

**Step 1: Understand the Argument Types**
- **<G>**: Generalization based on a specific instance.
- **<FE>**: False Enumeration with limited options.
- **<WCB>**: Weak Causal Basis.
- **<FU>**: False Universals.
- **<DEP>**: Double-Edged Phrases.
- **<RR>**: Reason followed by Proposition, where Reason supports Proposition.
- **<IR>**: Reason followed by Proposition, where Reason does not support Proposition.

**Step 2: Analyze the Structure of the String \(s\)**
- Break down \(s\) into its clauses:
  1. "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up." (Proposition, specific instance, Reason)
  2. "Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!" (Conclusion, general statement)

**Step 3: Match Characteristics**
- **<G>**: Look for a broad claim from a specific instance.
- **<FE>**: Look for a limited set of options.
- **<WCB>**: Identify a weak or anecdotal cause-and-effect relationship.
- **<FU>**: Notice universal claims without evidence.
- **<DEP>**: Check for dual interpretations.
- **<RR>**: Check if it starts with the conclusion followed by a supporting clause.
- **<IR>**: Look for unrelated reason and conclusion.

An analysis of the string:
- The first clause mentions a specific instance involving the Catholic Church.
- The second clause makes a broad claim implicating an individual based solely on their association with the Catholic Church.

**Step 4: Select the Best Match**
- The argument is making a broad generalization ("my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor... is guilty as well") based on a specific instance ("the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up").

**Step 5: Justify the Selection**
- The string fits the pattern of a general truth claim drawn from a specific instance. It makes a generalization that implicates all individuals within the Catholic Church based on an incident involving the organization itself. This is a direct match for the argument type <G>.

So, the defective argument type for the string \(s\) "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!" is **<G>**.
