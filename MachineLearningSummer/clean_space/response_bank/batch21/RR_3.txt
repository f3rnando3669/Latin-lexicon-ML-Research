For 
Let's apply the steps of \( IDAA \) to classify the string provided in the conversation between Speaker 1 and Speaker 2.

### Step-by-Step Classification

#### Input String \( s \)

"Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified.
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so.
Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct?
Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran."

#### Step 1: Identify Clause Structure and Logic

- This is a dialogue rather than a single sentence, so we need to analyze each part to see if it follows a logical structure with <Reason> and <Proposition>.

#### Speaker 1: "Jesus was not really crucified."
- Proposition: "Jesus was not really crucified."

#### Speaker 1: "Because the Quran says so."
- Reason: "the Quran says so."
- Proposition: Implied continuation that "Jesus was not really crucified."

#### Speaker 1: "Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true."
- Reason: "the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true."
- Proposition: "the Quran says so". This is implying the correctness of the Quran.

#### Speaker 1: "Because God tells us so, here in the Koran."
- Reason: "God tells us so, here in the Koran."
- Proposition: The Quran is presented as the ultimate truth.

#### Step 2: Categorize Based on Patterns

- The arguments given by Speaker 1 revolve around the veracity of the Quran without providing independent evidence. This suggests a circular reasoning pattern.
- The primary form of defect here is using one proposition as the reason for another and vice versa without escaping the circular logic.

#### Step 3: Compare Against Definitions

- Circular reasoning can be seen as a type of defective argument where the conclusion is included in the premise.
- This doesn’t explicitly fit the predefined types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>. However, considering the properties of the given categories:

  - <FU> (False Universals) might partially fit as it asserts a universally agreed point (the truth of the Quran) without external proof.

### Result

Given the definitions we have, the closest fit for this argument pattern is:

**Type for \( s \)**: <FU> (False Universals)

The argument falls under <FU> because it claims the universally agreed point (the Quran is the Word of God and hence everything it says is true) without external evidence, which follows the logic of circular reasoning.
