For 
To apply IDAA to the string "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today," we'll follow the defined steps:

### Step 1: Understand and Define Argument Types
Refamiliarize with the definitions of the faulty argument types:
- **G (Generalization)**: General rule from a specific instance.
- **FE (False Enumeration)**: Listing fewer or more options than exist.
- **IR (Invalid Reasoning)**: Reason does not logically support the proposition.
- **RR (Reversed Reasoning)**: Conclusion before the reason.
- **WCB (Weak Causal Basis)**: Weak causal connection.
- **FU (False Universals)**: Universal assertions without proof.
- **DEP (Double-Edged Phrases)**: Statements with dual interpretations.

### Step 2: Analyze String \( <s> \)
Read the given string: *"I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today."*
- Clauses: 
  1. "I thought you were a good person"
  2. "but you weren’t in class today"

### Step 3: Compare Against Argument Types
Evaluate the string against each type:

1. **G (Generalization)**:
   - The string does not suggest a general rule from a specific instance.
2. **FE (False Enumeration)**:
   - It does not present fewer or more options than exist.
3. **IR (Invalid Reasoning)**:
   - Check if clause 1 supports clause 2. Here, the reason (not being in class) does not logically disprove the proposition (being a good person).
4. **RR (Reversed Reasoning)**:
   - Conclusion "you were a good person" is before the reason "you weren’t in class". However, it doesn’t strictly fit this pattern as it's more about expectation vs reality.
5. **WCB (Weak Causal Basis)**:
   - No causal connection is weakly supported here.
6. **FU (False Universals)**:
   - The string does not make a universal assertion without proof.
7. **DEP (Double-Edged Phrases)**:
   - No dual interpretation that is harmful.

### Step 4: Perform Classification
Based on the evaluation, the string fits into **IR (Invalid Reasoning)** because the reason given (not attending class) does not logically disprove the other clause (being a good person).

### Step 5: Validation
Recheck and validate the classification:

- **IR (Invalid Reasoning)**: The statement implies a faulty logic connection between not attending class and being a good person; one does not logically negate the other.

Confirming:
- Having a reason ("you weren’t in class today") doesn’t support or relate correctly to the proposition ("I thought you were a good person").
- It follows the pattern where clause 1's content is unrelated as reasoning to clause 2.

Therefore, the string "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today" is classified as **IR (Invalid Reasoning)**.
