Sure, let's apply the steps outlined in the method \( IDAA \) to classify the string \( s \): "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you."

### Step 1: Identify Key Characteristics of Each Defective Argument Type
First, we need to firmly understand the characteristics of each argument type:
- **<G> - Generalization**: Makes a broad statement based on limited evidence.
- **<FE> - False Enumeration**: Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **<WCB> - Weak Causal Basis**: Provides insufficient causal information to support the conclusion.
- **<FU> - False Universals**: Claims universally agreed points without proof.
- **<DEP> - Double-Edged Phrases**: Uses phrases that can be interpreted in two ways.
- **<RR> - Reversed Reasoning**: The conclusion is presented first, and then a reason follows.
- **<IR> - Irrelevant Reasoning**: The reason provided does not support the conclusion.

### Step 2: Analyze the Structure of the Given String
Break down the given string \( s \):
- There are two main parts: "My best friend says you’re a liar" and "so I’m not going to talk to you."
- The first part provides a reason: "My best friend says you're a liar."
- The second part states the conclusion: "I’m not going to talk to you."

### Step 3: Compare String Characteristics with Argument Types
- **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement does not make a broad claim from a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement does not list options.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal relationship is not applicable here.
- **False Universals (<FU>)**: The statement does not assume universal agreement without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: The statement does not contain phrases interpreted in two conflicting ways.
- **Reversed Reasoning (<RR>)**: The conclusion comes at the end, not at the beginning.
- **Irrelevant Reasoning (<IR>)**: The reason provided ("My best friend says you're a liar") does not logically support the conclusion ("I’m not going to talk to you"). The friend's opinion is not directly relevant evidence to justify the speaker’s decision not to talk.

### Step 4: Classify the String
The string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you." matches the characteristics of **Irrelevant Reasoning (<IR>)**:
- The reason given does not logically justify the conclusion.

Therefore, the string \( s \) is classified as **<IR>**.
