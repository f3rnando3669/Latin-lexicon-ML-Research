For 
Let's apply the decomposed steps of <IDAA> to the given statement:

#### Example Statement:
"When the judge asked the defendant why he hadn't paid his parking fines, he said that he shouldn't have to pay them because the sign said 'Fine for parking here' and so he naturally presumed that it would be fine to park there."

### Step-by-Step Application:

1. **Extract Clauses**:
   - Clause 1: "When the judge asked the defendant why he hadn't paid his parking fines"
   - Clause 2: "he said that he shouldn't have to pay them"
   - Clause 3: "because the sign said 'Fine for parking here' and so he naturally presumed that it would be fine to park there."

2. **Determine Clause Types**:
   - Clause 1: Provides context (not directly part of the argument to be classified).
   - Clause 2: Proposition (a statement that he shouldn't have to pay the fines).
   - Clause 3: Reason (provides justification for not paying the fines).

3. **Analyze Relationship**:
   - Clause 2 is a Proposition claiming that the defendant shouldn't have to pay the fines.
   - Clause 3 is a Reason explaining the defendant’s interpretation of the sign “Fine for parking here,” which he took to mean it was acceptable to park there.

4. **Match with Definitions**:
   - The reasoning provided hinges on a double interpretation of the word "fine" (i.e., monetary penalty vs. acceptable).
   - This matches the definition of <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases), which involves using statements open to dual interpretations possibly against the speaker.

5. **Label Statement**:
   - The statement is classified as type <DEP>.

### Conclusion:

The statement "When the judge asked the defendant why he hadn't paid his parking fines, he said that he shouldn't have to pay them because the sign said 'Fine for parking here' and so he naturally presumed that it would be fine to park there." is classified as type <DEP>, using Double-Edged Phrases with a dual interpretation of the word "fine."
