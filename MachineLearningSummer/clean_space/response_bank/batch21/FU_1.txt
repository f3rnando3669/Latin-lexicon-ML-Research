For 
To apply the process of IDAA (the decomposition of an advanced task into specific steps and the classification of a string as a particular type of defective argument), let's outline the specific steps and then analyze and classify the given string \( s \):

### Given String: 
"Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong."

### Step-by-Step IDAA:

1. **Contextual Analysis**:
    - The string is an advertisement, promoting Verizon.
    - The argument implies that because a large number of people use Verizon, it is the correct choice.

2. **Identify Structure**:
    - The argument's structure can be decomposed as:
        - Clause 1 (Reason): "1 billion people can't be wrong."
        - Clause 2 (Proposition): "Get Verizon."
    - The proposition suggests a course of action (getting Verizon) based on the reason (the belief that the high number of users proves its superiority).

3. **Detect Fallacy Type**:
    - The argument appeals to the large number of people using Verizon to validate the decision to use Verizon.
    - This is a classic example of appealing to popularity, asserting that the action should be taken because many people do it without providing substantial evidence beyond the number of users.

4. **Classification**:
    - This argument exhibits characteristics of **False Universals (FU)** because it relies on a supposed broad agreement (i.e., "1 billion people can't be wrong") to push the proposition without providing substantive proof.

Thus, the classification of the string \( s \) is:

- **Primary Classification**: \( FU \) (False Universals).

### Recapitulation:
- **String \( s \)**: "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong."
- **Primary Classification**: \( FU \) (False Universals).

This completes the IDAA process for the given string.
