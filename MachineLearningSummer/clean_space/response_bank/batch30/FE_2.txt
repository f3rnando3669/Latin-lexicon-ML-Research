3. **Match to Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Step 3.1:** Analyze characteristics:
     - The argument presents two options as being exhaustive and mutually exclusive.

4. **Apply Definitions:**
   - **Step 4.1:** Compare with <FE> (False Enumeration): This argument restricts the options to just two, which excludes the possibility of any middle ground or additional alternatives.
   - **Step 4.2:** Marker: "Either with God or against him" implies that there are no other possible stances or nuances.

5. **Classify the Argument:**
