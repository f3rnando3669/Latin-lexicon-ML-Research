For 
Certainly, let's apply the defined process \( <IDAA> \) to the given argument:

### Step-by-Step Application (\( <IDAA> \)):

#### Given Argument:
"Speaker 1: You should trust the Bible because it’s the Word of God.
Speaker 2: How do you know it’s the Word of God?
Speaker 1: Because God tells us it is.
Speaker 2: Where does God tell us this?
Speaker 1: Right here, in the Bible."

1. **Identify the Structure of the Argument**:
   - Proposition: "You should trust the Bible."
   - Justification: "because it’s the Word of God."
   - Supporting Justification Sequence:
     - Speaker 1: "Because God tells us it is."
     - Speaker 2: "Where does God tell us this?"
     - Speaker 1: "Right here, in the Bible."

2. **Determine the Nature of the Claim**:
   - The argument seeks to justify trusting the Bible based on it being the Word of God.
   - The primary justification is that God tells us it is the Word of God.
   - The circular reasoning concludes with the Bible itself being evidence.

3. **Match to Specific Argument Type**:
   - The reasoning provided by Speaker 1 essentially restates the initial proposition using different words.
   - "You should trust the Bible because it’s the Word of God" is circularly justified by "God tells us it is" and "Right here, in the Bible."

#### Analysis:

- **Redundant Reason (\( <RR> \))**: This fallacy occurs when the reasoning presented is essentially a restatement of the initial assertion, providing no new information, which is the case here.

### Final Classification:
The given argument is of type \( <RR> \) because it presents a redundant reason that restates the proposition in different words without providing additional support.
