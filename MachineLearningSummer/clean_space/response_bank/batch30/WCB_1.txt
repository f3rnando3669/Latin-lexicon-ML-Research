Sure, let's apply the step-by-step decomposition process (<D>) to classify the string "Every girl I've dated has been a nurse. I must only be compatible with nurses!" as one of the defective argument types.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>) of <IDA>:

1. **Step 1: Read and Understand the Proposition**
   - Carefully read the given proposition to understand its structure and content.

2. **Step 2: Identify the Core Argument**
   - Extract the main statement: "Every girl I've dated has been a nurse. I must only be compatible with nurses!"

3. **Step 3: Categorize the Nature of the Argument**
   - Determine the type of claim or reasoning being used here. This looks like a conclusion drawn from specific experiences.

4. **Step 4: Compare with Defined Argument Types**
   - Compare the characteristics of the identified argument with one of the predefined defective argument types:
     - <G>: Generalization - making a claim based on limited instances.
     - <FE>: False Enumeration - not listing options here.
     - <IR>: Inappropriate Reason - not providing irrelevant reasons.
     - <RR>: Redundant Reason - not using redundant reasoning.
     - <WCB>: Weak Causal Basis - no weak causality argument here.
     - <FU>: False Universals - not making a universal claim without proof.
     - <DEP>: Double-Edged Phrases - not using a phrase with dual interpretations.

5. **Step 5: Check for Logical Consistency**
   - Evaluate if the reasoning given logically supports the conclusion: Concluding that one is only compatible with nurses based on his past dating experience lacks a logical foundation. It generalizes personal experience to a universal truth without sufficient evidence.

6. **Step 6: Final Classification**
   - Based on our analysis, the argument type is best classified as <G> (Generalization).

### Summary:

So, for the provided string "Every girl I've dated has been a nurse. I must only be compatible with nurses!", the steps lead us to classify the argument as <G> (Generalization). This conclusion is drawn from specific instances and assumes a general truth which is the hallmark of the defective argument type called Generalization.
