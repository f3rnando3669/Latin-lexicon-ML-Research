For 
Let's apply the step-by-step decomposition \(\<D\>\) to classify the statement, "If everyone believes it, you should too!" 

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (\<D\>) for Classification Task (\<IDA\>)

1. **Identify the Proposition**:
   - Main claim: "You should believe it."

2. **Analyze for Generalization (\<G\>)**:
   - The statement doesn't make a broad claim based on a specific instance or a small sample. It's appealing to the belief of the majority rather than generalizing from a few instances.
   - \(\<G\>\) is not applicable here.

3. **Analyze for False Enumeration (\<FE\>)**:
   - The statement doesnâ€™t present an incomplete list of options or falsely limit the choices available. It simply makes an assertion based on collective belief.
   - \(\<FE\>\) is not applicable here.

4. **Analyze for Inappropriate Reason (\<IR\>)**:
   - The reason provided ("If everyone believes it") is supposed to support the proposition ("you should too"). While this might be considered an appeal to popularity rather than an inappropriate reason per se, it's not entirely irrelevant to the proposition.
   - \(\<IR\>\) is not directly applicable here.

5. **Analyze for Redundant Reason (\<RR\>)**:
   - The reason ("If everyone believes it") and the assertion ("you should too") are not restatements of each other; the reason does not merely restate the proposition in different words.
   - \(\<RR\>\) is not applicable here.

6. **Analyze for Weak Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**:
   - There is no causal assertion made here, so it's not checking for a weak causal connection.
   - \(\<WCB\>\) is not applicable here.

7. **Analyze for False Universals (\<FU\>)**:
   - The statement makes an appeal to popularity, suggesting that because "everyone" believes it, the proposition must be true or should be adopted. This fits the pattern of \(\<FU\>\) as it asserts a universally agreed point without proof and relies on popularity for validation.
   - \(\<FU\>\) is applicable here.

8. **Analyze for Double-Edged Phrases (\<DEP\>)**:
   - The statement isn't open to dual interpretations that could be potentially against the speaker.
   - \(\<DEP\>\) is not applicable here.

9. **Classify**:
   - Based on the analysis, the statement, "If everyone believes it, you should too!" fits best under \(\<FU\>\) (False Universals).

Thus, the statement is classified as \(\<FU\>\).

This completes the steps for \(\<IDAA\>\) for the given string.
