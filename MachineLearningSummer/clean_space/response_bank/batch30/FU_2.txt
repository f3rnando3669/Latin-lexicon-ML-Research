Sure, let's apply the step-by-step decomposition of the task <IDA> to the string "Everybody else is doing it, why don't you?" to classify it as one of the defective argument types.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA>

1. **Identify the Claim Made by the String (<s>):**
   - The claim in the string "Everybody else is doing it, why don't you?" is suggesting that you should do something because everybody else is doing it.

2. **Determine the Type of Defect:**
   - Analyze the structure of the argument by asking specific diagnostic questions:

   **For <G> (Generalization):**
   - Is the argument claiming a general truth based on a specific instance or a limited number of cases?
     - No, this argument is not making a generalization based on specific instances.

   **For <FE> (False Enumeration):**
   - Is the argument presenting an incomplete list of options, or falsely limiting the choices to fewer options than actually exist?
     - No, this argument is not listing options; it's making an appeal.

   **For <IR> (Inappropriate Reason):**
   - Is the reason given for the proposition logically irrelevant?
     - No, the reason given is not irrelevant; it is attempting to influence behavior based on others' actions.

   **For <RR> (Redundant Reason):**
   - Does the argument repeat the same reason in different words, presenting it as if it were a new point?
     - No, this argument does not present the same reason in different words.

   **For <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis):**
   - Does the argument provide a weak causal link that is not compelling enough to support the conclusion?
     - No, this argument is not presenting a weak causal link.

   **For <FU> (False Universals):**
   - Is the argument relying on universally agreed points without proof, or appealing to popularity as validation?
     - Yes, this argument is appealing to popularity, asserting that you should do something simply because everyone else is doing it.

   **For <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases):**
   - Does the statement contain phrases that are open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker's intention?
     - No, this statement does not contain phrases with dual interpretations.

3. **Assign the Appropriate Label:**
   - Based on the analysis, the argument fits the definition of a False Universal (<FU>).

### Classification

The string "Everybody else is doing it, why don't you?" is classified as <FU> (False Universals) because it is appealing to popularity without providing valid reasoned evidence.
