For 
To apply \( <IDAA> \) to the string "What can our new math teacher know? Have you seen how fat she is?", we need to follow the decomposition steps (\(<D>\)) systematically:

1. **Identify the Argument:**
   - Core Argument: "What can our new math teacher know? Have you seen how fat she is?"

2. **Understand the Context:**
   - The argument questions the knowledge or capability of the new math teacher and then makes a statement about her physical appearance.

3. **Compare Against Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (\(<G>\))**: This does not make a sweeping generalization based on an instance.
   - **False Enumeration (\(<FE>\))**: No options are presented.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (\(<IR>\))**: This could be an argument where the supposed reasoning (teacher's physical appearance) does not logically support the proposition (teacher's knowledge).
   - **Redundant Reason (\(<RR>\))**: It does not restate a proposition in different words.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (\(<WCB>\))**: The statement doesn’t imply a causal relationship for something.
   - **False Universals (\(<FU>\))**: The statement does not assert universally agreed points without proof.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (\(<DEP>\))**: The statement does not have a dual interpretation that can potentially go against the speaker.

4. **Analyze Keywords and Structure:**
   - Keywords: "What can our new math teacher know?", "Have you seen how fat she is?"
   - Structure: The first part questions the teacher’s knowledge. The second part refers to her physical appearance as a basis for the question.

5. **Determine the Defective Argument Type:**
   - This argument provides an inappropriate reason for questioning the teacher's knowledge, focusing on her physical appearance instead of relevant qualifications or knowledge.
   - The argument type is closest to an **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**.

Therefore, the string "What can our new math teacher know? Have you seen how fat she is?" should be classified as **<IR: Inappropriate Reason>**.

By following these steps, we can systematically classify this given string \( <s> \) into the appropriate defective argument type.
