For 
Sure, let's apply the \(<IDAA>\) process to the string \(<s>\): "See the movie that everybody's talking about."

### Decomposition of the Task (\(D\))

#### Step 1: Identify the main proposition or claim:
- The primary assertion here is: "See the movie that everybody's talking about."

#### Step 2: Analyze the support or reasons provided:
- The reason given to support the proposition is that "everybody's talking about" the movie. The implicit argument is that because many people are discussing the movie, it must be worth seeing.

#### Step 3: Compare the argument structure to known definitions:
- The argument relies on the assumption that popularity or widespread discussion is a sufficient reason to do something.

#### Step 4: Classify the argument:
- According to the definitions, this aligns with a \(<FU>\) (False Universals): asserting universally agreed points without proof. In this case, the universal point is that widespread discussion or popularity constitutes a good reason to see the movie.

#### Step 5: Validate the classification:
- The statement "See the movie that everybody's talking about" fits the \(<FU>\) definition because it uses the perceived universal agreement (everybody talking about it) as a reason to see the movie without further justification.

### Conclusion:
The given string \(<s>\) "See the movie that everybody's talking about" is classified as \(<FU>\).

This completes the process of \(<IDAA>\): applying the decomposition (\(<D>\)) to the task of classifying an argument type (\(<IDA>\)).
