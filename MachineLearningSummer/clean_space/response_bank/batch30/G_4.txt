Sure, let's decompose the task of classifying the statement "All of those who hate the Duterte administration are CPP-NPA supporters" using the steps outlined.

### Step 1: Initial Analysis
- **Read the statement**: "All of those who hate the Duterte administration are CPP-NPA supporters."
- **Keywords**: "All of those", "hate the Duterte administration", "CPP-NPA supporters".

### Step 2: Categories and Definitions Review
- **<G>:** This involves making a broad generalization based on a specific instance.
- **<FE>:** This would involve listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **<IR>:** Providing reasons unrelated to the proposition.
- **<RR>:** Phrases the same reason in different terms.
- **<WCB>:** Offers a weak causal basis for the proposition.
- **<FU>:** Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
- **<DEP>:** Uses dual-interpretation phrases.

### Step 3: Pattern Matching
- Compare the statement to known examples:
    - Looks similar to making a broad generalization about a group based on a specific instance, potentially matching <G>.

### Step 4: Conditional Checks
- **Check for <G>**:
    - Does it make a broad generalization based on a specific instance? Yes, it generalizes that anyone who dislikes the Duterte administration must be a CPP-NPA supporter.
- **Check for other types**:
    - <FE>: Doesn't list limited options.
    - <IR>: The reason provided isn't unrelated solely on the surface.
    - <RR>: The statement isn't redundant.
    - <WCB>: No weak causal basis presented.
    - <FU>: Does not assert universally agreed points without proof.
    - <DEP>: No dual interpretations are present.

### Step 5: Final Classification
- **Decision**: The statement fits the Generalization (<G>) category.
- **Reasoning**: By saying "All of those who hate the Duterte administration are CPP-NPA supporters," it makes a sweeping generalization about a broad group of people based on the assumption that disliking the Duterte administration equates to being a CPP-NPA supporter, which is precisely what constitutes <G>.

So, the statement is classified as <G>.
