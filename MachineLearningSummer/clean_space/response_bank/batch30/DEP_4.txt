For 
To classify the given string "Science shows us that improved quality of life comes through research and invention." using the decomposed steps of \( <IDAA> \), let's follow the step-by-step approach outlined:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of \( <IDAA> \)

#### Step 1: Input Analysis
- **Step 1.1**: Identify the argument in the string \( <s> \).
    - Argument: "Science shows us that improved quality of life comes through research and invention."
  
- **Step 1.2**: Understand the proposition and the supporting statement within \( <s> \).
    - Proposition: "Improved quality of life comes through research and invention."
    - Supporting statement: "Science shows us."

#### Step 2: Identify Argument Type
- **Step 2.1**: Check if the argument claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
    - This doesn't seem to be claiming a general truth based on a specific instance, but rather makes a general claim supported by an appeal to science.
  
- **Step 2.2**: Check if the argument involves listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
    - It doesn’t list specific options, so \( <FE> \) doesn’t apply.

- **Step 2.3**: Check if the reason provided does not logically support the proposition.
    - The statement "science shows us" could be interpreted as a broad appeal to authority without specific evidence, but it loosely attempts to support the proposition. Not a clear \( <IR> \).

- **Step 2.4**: Check if the reason appears to restate the proposition redundantly.
    - The supporting statement does not simply restate the proposition in different words. \( <RR> \) does not apply.

- **Step 2.5**: Check if the argument offers a weak causal basis to support the proposition.
    - The argument seems weak in proving the causal link between "science shows us" and the broad claim of improved quality of life via research and invention. This falls under \( <WCB> \).

- **Step 2.6**: Check if the argument asserts universally agreed points without proof.
    - The statement does make a broad, universally agreed claim without specific evidence. This fits the definition of \( <FU> \).

- **Step 2.7**: Check if the statement uses double-edged phrases that can be interpreted two ways.
    - There are no double-edged phrases in the statement. \( <DEP> \) does not apply.

#### Step 3: Validation Check
- **Step 3.1**: Ensure the classification aligns with the definitions provided.
    - The argument could align with both \( <WCB> \) and \( <FU> \).

- **Step 3.2**: Verify if any other fallacy might also apply. Choose the most fitting one based on definitions.
    - The statement shows more characteristics of \( <FU> \) because it broadly asserts that science conclusively demonstrates something without providing specific proof or evidence.

#### Step 4: Output
- **Step 4.1**: Return the defective argument type classification.
    - The argument falls under \( <FU> \) (False Universals).

### Conclusion
By applying \( <IDAA> \) to the string "Science shows us that improved quality of life comes through research and invention.", we classify it as \( <FU> \) (False Universals).
