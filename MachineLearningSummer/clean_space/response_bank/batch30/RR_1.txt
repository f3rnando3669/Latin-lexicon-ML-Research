### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDA (Task <IDAA>):

1. **Input the string <s>**:
   - String <s>: "Smoking cigarettes is deadly because cigarettes can kill you."

2. **Identify the core claim in <s>**:
   - Core Claim: "Smoking cigarettes is deadly."

3. **Analyze specific keywords and context**:
   - Keywords/Context: "because cigarettes can kill you." This appears to provide a reason for the claim.

4. **Match keywords and context from <s> to defect categories**:
   - Evaluate the reason given: "because cigarettes can kill you." This does not add new information or a different perspective beyond restating the claim that "smoking cigarettes is deadly."

5. **Classify the string <s>**:
   - This resembles **<RR> Redundant Reason**: The reason provided is essentially a restatement of the claim in different words.

6. **Provide justification for classification**:
   - The statement "Smoking cigarettes is deadly because cigarettes can kill you." tries to substantiate the claim with a reason that is effectively the same as the stated claim. This falls under the defective argument type **<RR> Redundant Reason**, as it does not provide additional support beyond what is already asserted in the proposition.

### Classification:
- The string "Smoking cigarettes is deadly because cigarettes can kill you." is classified as **<RR> Redundant Reason**.

### Justification:
- The reason provided that "cigarettes can kill you" simply rephrases the claim "smoking cigarettes is deadly" without adding any new or different justification, fitting the definition of **<RR> Redundant Reason**.
