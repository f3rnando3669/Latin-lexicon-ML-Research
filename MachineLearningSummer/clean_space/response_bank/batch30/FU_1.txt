### Application of <IDAA> to the Given String

Let's classify the given string \( <s> \):

\( <s> \) = "All my friends are doing a low carb diet. That must be the only way to lose weight so I will do it too."

#### Step 1: Understand and Identify the Argument

1. **Step 1.1:** Read the string carefully.
   - **String:** "All my friends are doing a low carb diet. That must be the only way to lose weight so I will do it too."
   
2. **Step 1.2:** Identify the main claim being made in \( <s> \).
   - **Main Claim:** "The only way to lose weight is by doing a low carb diet."

3. **Step 1.3:** Determine the reasoning or evidence provided to support the main claim.
   - **Reasoning Provided:** "All my friends are doing a low carb diet."

#### Step 2: Analyze the Argument Type

1. **Step 2.1:** Compare the identified claim and reasoning to the definitions of the defective argument types:

   - **<G>:** Is it making a broad generalization based on a specific instance?
     - No, it is not broadly generalizing from a specific instance.
   
   - **<FE>:** Is it falsely enumerating options by listing fewer or more than actually exist?
     - No, it is not about listing options inaccurately.
   
   - **<IR>:** Does the argument provide a reason that does not logically support the proposition?
     - No, the reason somewhat relates to the proposition but it has other issues.
   
   - **<RR>:** Is it presenting a redundant reason, restating the proposition using different words?
     - No, it does not simply restate the claim.
   
   - **<WCB>:** Does it offer a weak causal basis that isn't compelling enough?
     - No, it does not present a causal link.
   
   - **<FU>:** Is it asserting a universally agreed-upon point without proof?
     - Yes, it tends to suggest that because all friends are doing it, it must be the only way to lose weight (appealing to popularity).
     
   - **<DEP>:** Is it using statements open to dual interpretations?
     - No, it does not suggest dual interpretations.

#### Step 3: Categorize the Argument

1. **Step 3.1:** Based on the analysis in Step 2, determine which defective argument type best matches the argument presented in \( <s> \).
   - **Type:** <FU>
     
2. **Step 3.2:** Assign the corresponding argument type label \( <FU> \) to \( <s> \).

#### Step 4: Validate and Conclude

1. **Step 4.1:** Double-check the identified defective argument type against the details in \( <s> \) to ensure accuracy.
   - **Double-check:** The reasoning indeed falls under asserting a universally agreed-upon point without substantial proof. It is an appeal to popularity.

2. **Step 4.2:** Conclude the classification process by confirming the defective argument type.
   - **Conclusion:** \( <s> \) is classified as \( <FU> \).

By following these steps, we have successfully classified "All my friends are doing a low carb diet. That must be the only way to lose weight so I will do it too." as \( <FU> \).
