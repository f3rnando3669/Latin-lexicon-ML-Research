For 
The statement "Only a mentally ill person would kill someone, so anyone who kills someone is automatically mentally ill." falls into the category of <IR>, which stands for Irrelevant Reasoning.

Here's how it breaks down:
- **Irrelevant Reasoning** (IR): This involves making a claim or drawing a conclusion based on information that is not relevant to the argument being made. In this case, the statement assumes that killing someone is sufficient evidence of mental illness without considering other possible factors or evidence. It conflates the action of killing with the state of mental illness without providing a relevant connection between the two.
