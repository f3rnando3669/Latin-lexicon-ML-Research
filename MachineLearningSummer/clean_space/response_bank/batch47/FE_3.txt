The argument "The museum's new gemstones and precious minerals exhibit needs more security guards. If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal a piece of the exhibit" fits the category <FE> - False Dilemma or False Dichotomy.

This type of logical fallacy occurs when someone presents only two options or outcomes in a situation when, in fact, multiple possibilities exist. In this case, the statement falsely assumes that the only reason someone might disagree with the need for more security guards is that they are planning to steal something, ignoring other legitimate reasons someone might have for their disagreement.
