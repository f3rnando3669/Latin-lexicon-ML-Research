For 
The statement "You can tell that guy's Mexican - he's wearing a sombrero." can be classified as <S>. 

Explanation:
- **Generalization** (<G>): This statement makes a broad assumption about a person based on a single attribute (wearing a sombrero), which is a form of generalization about a culture.
- **Racial Representation** (<RR>): It involves attributing a cultural stereotype to an individual, which is a form of racial representation, albeit in a simplistic or stereotypical way.
- **WCB** (Weakness in Critical Thinking and Bias): The statement exhibits bias and a lack of critical thinking by relying on a stereotype.

Given these points, the classification of <G> is most fitting due to the generalization based on a cultural stereotype.
