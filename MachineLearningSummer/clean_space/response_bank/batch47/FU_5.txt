For 
The given statement "Everyone seems to support the changes in the vacation policy, and if everyone likes them, they must be good." can be classified as **<RR>** which stands for "Relying on the opinions of a majority to claim a universal truth." This type of reasoning is often referred to as an appeal to popularity or bandwagon fallacy.

Here is the breakdown:
- **<G>: Generalization** - Making a broad assumption based on limited evidence.
- **<FE>: Faulty Evidence** - Providing evidence that is not sound or accurate.
- **<IR>: Irrelevant Reason** - The reason given has no real connection to the conclusion.
- **<RR>: Relying on the majority** - Suggesting something is true or good just because many people believe it.
- **<WCB>: Weak Cause and Effect** - Assuming one thing causes another without enough evidence.
- **<FU>: False Uniformity** - Assuming that what is true for a part is true for the whole.
- **<DEP>: Dependent on a particular perspective** - The statement's validity relies solely on a specific viewpoint.

Since the statement assumes that because "everyone" supports the changes, they must be good, it is relying on the majority opinion as proof of the changes' quality. Hence, **<RR>** (Relying on the majority) is the best classification.
