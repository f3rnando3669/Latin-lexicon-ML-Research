For 
The statement "Giving 10% of your income to the Church will free a child’s soul from Limbo into Heaven, so give your money!" can be classified as <FU> (Fulfilling an ulterior motive).

Here's the breakdown:
- The statement presents a religious or spiritual claim (freeing a child’s soul from Limbo into Heaven).
- It uses this claim to motivate a specific action (giving 10% of your income to the Church).
- The underlying purpose is to encourage people to donate money to the Church, which can be seen as serving an ulterior motive beyond just the spiritual benefit described.

Therefore, <FU> (Fulfilling an ulterior motive) is the most fitting classification.
