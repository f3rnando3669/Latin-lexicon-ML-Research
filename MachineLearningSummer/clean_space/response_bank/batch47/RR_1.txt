This statement can be classified as <RR>, which stands for **"Circular Reasoning"**. In circular reasoning, the conclusion is included in the premise of the argument or relies on its own assertion without providing independent support. Here, the claim that "The Bible is the Word of God" is validated by referring to the Bible itself, which then produces a circular argument:

- "The Bible is the Word of God because God tells us it is... in the Bible."
- "X is true because of Y. Y is true because of X."

This type of reasoning generally does not provide a persuasive argument to someone who does not already accept the initial premise.
