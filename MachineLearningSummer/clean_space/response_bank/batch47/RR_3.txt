For 
The statement "Ghosts exist.... because I saw a ghost in my closet," is an example of the logical fallacy known as "hasty generalization." However, since we are classifying it according to specified types, it falls under:

<FE> - Faulty Evidence

This is because the conclusion that "ghosts exist" is drawn from the anecdotal and subjective experience of seeing a ghost in the closet, which does not constitute reliable or verifiable evidence supporting the existence of ghosts. Thus, the statement uses faulty or insufficient evidence to make a broader generalization.
