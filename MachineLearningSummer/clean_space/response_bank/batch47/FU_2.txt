The statement "That politician wants you to think he loves America. His last rally had 20 American flags flying behind him" can be classified as an example of the fallacy type <IR>, which stands for Irrelevance. This fallacy occurs when something irrelevant to the argument is used as evidence or in place of relevant evidence. In this case, the presence of American flags at a rally is irrelevant to whether the politician actually loves America.
