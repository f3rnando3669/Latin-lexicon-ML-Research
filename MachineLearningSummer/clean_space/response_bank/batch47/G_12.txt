The statement "It’s getting late, and we still have to decide on the school budget. What do you say we just leave it as is and we can call it a night?" can be classified as type <WCB>, which stands for "We Can’t Be Bothered."

Here's the reasoning:
- The speaker emphasizes that "it's getting late" and the timing aspect.
- They propose to "just leave it as is" instead of making a decision or further discussing the topic.
- The phrase "we can call it a night" suggests ending the activity due to the late hour.

This indicates an inclination to avoid further effort or discussion, which aligns with the "We Can’t Be Bothered" classification.
