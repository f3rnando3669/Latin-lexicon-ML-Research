For 
The argument "Some students who attend tutoring over the summer are not very intelligent. Since Beth attended summer tutoring, she is not a very good student." can be classified as <WCB>, which stands for "Weakening the Character of the Belonging." 

Here's the reasoning:

- The argument makes a generalization about some students who attend summer tutoring (specifically stating that they are not very intelligent).
- It then takes an instance (Beth attending summer tutoring) and concludes something negative about her intelligence or capabilities as a student.

This type of reasoning involves taking a negative characteristic attributed to a part of a group and applying it unfairly to an individual from that group without sufficient evidence. It unfairly weakens Beth's character by association.
