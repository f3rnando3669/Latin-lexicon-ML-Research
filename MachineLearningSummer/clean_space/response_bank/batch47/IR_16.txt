For 
The given statement can be classified under type <RR> (Role Reversal). Here's an explanation:

The individual is describing a situation in which they successfully redirected their wife's focus from cleaning out the garage to shopping for new patio furniture. This shift in focus effectively reversed the original role or task at hand, thereby changing the subject from one area they presumably wanted to avoid (garage cleaning) to another that sidetracked the initial conversation (patio furniture).

So, the classification is: **<RR>**
