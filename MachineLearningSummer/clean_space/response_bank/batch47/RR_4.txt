For 
The statement "You must obey the law, because it's illegal to break the law." utilizes the logical fallacy known as **begging the question** (also known as **circular reasoning**). The conclusion that one must obey the law is supported by a premise that essentially restates the conclusion (since breaking the law is inherently defined as illegal). This does not provide any external justification for why one should obey the law beyond the definition of legality.

Thus, the appropriate classification for this logical fallacy, based on the provided categories, would be <C> for circular reasoning, if <C> were an option. Since it's not listed, a suitable equivalent could be:

- **<DEP>**: This may stand for dependent premises, where the conclusion is dependent on premises which essentially restate the conclusion, making the argument circular.

So, the answer is: <DEP>
