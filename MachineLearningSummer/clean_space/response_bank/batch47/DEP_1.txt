For 
The statement "I didn’t steal your pen—I borrowed it" can be classified as <FE>, which stands for **Fabrication/Evasion**. This type involves a rephrasing or recharacterizing of an action to make it seem more acceptable or less culpable. In this case, the speaker is rephrasing an act of taking someone else’s pen (which could be seen as stealing) as borrowing, presumably to avoid the negative connotations or potential guilt associated with stealing.
