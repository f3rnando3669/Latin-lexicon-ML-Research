For 
The statement "Men score better on math than women do. Jerry is a man. Therefore, Jerry is better at math than Sylvia, who is a woman." falls under the type <IR>.

<IR> stands for "Invalid Reasoning." This classification is appropriate because the conclusion that Jerry is better at math than Sylvia is drawn based on a generalization about gender and math scores, which may not apply to individual cases. Even if men on average score better than women on math, it does not necessarily mean that every man is better at math than every woman. Individual performance can vary significantly regardless of gender.
