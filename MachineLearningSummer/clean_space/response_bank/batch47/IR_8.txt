The statement "Yes, we have safety issues in our factory. But we work really hard to make a good product." can be classified as <RR> (Redirection/Refocusing).

This is because the statement acknowledges a negative aspect (safety issues in the factory) but quickly shifts focus to a positive aspect (working hard to make a good product), redirecting attention from the problem to a more favorable trait or effort.
