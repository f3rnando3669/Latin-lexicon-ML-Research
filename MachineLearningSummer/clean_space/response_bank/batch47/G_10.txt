For 
The statement "Four out of five dentists recommend Happy Glossy Smiley toothpaste brand. Therefore, it must be great." should be classified as type <IR>, which stands for "Inductive Reasoning."

Inductive reasoning makes a generalization based on specific examples or evidence. In this case, the recommendation from most (four out of five) dentists is used to generalize that the toothpaste brand must be great. This is a form of inductive reasoning because it relies on particular instances (the dentists' endorsements) to arrive at a broader conclusion (that the toothpaste is great).
