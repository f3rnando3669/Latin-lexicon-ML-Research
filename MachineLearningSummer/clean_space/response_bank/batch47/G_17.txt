The statement "We can’t freeze the academic year because then students won’t graduate on time. Next thing you know most people will be unemployed and will resort to crime. The crime rate will skyrocket and society will collapse." can be classified as <SL> (Slippery Slope). 

This type of argument suggests that a relatively small first step (freezing the academic year) will lead to a chain of related events (students not graduating on time, unemployment, increased crime rates, and societal collapse) culminating in some significant (usually negative) effect. It assumes a drastic progression without necessarily providing evidence for each step along the way.
