The statement "It is either you are for the US war on terror or against it." is best classified as a **False Dilemma (FE)**.

A False Dilemma (sometimes known as a False Dichotomy) is a type of logical fallacy that occurs when an argument presents two options as the only possible choices, when in fact other alternatives may exist. In this case, the statement suggests that one must be either completely for the US war on terror or completely against it, ignoring any nuanced positions or other possible perspectives.
