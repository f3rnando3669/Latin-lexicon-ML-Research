For 
The statement "President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up. Jones is responsible for the rise in crime." should be classified as <FE> (False Equivalence). 

This classification applies because the statement draws a direct causal link between two events (raising taxes and the rise in violent crime) without sufficient evidence to establish that the two events are directly related. The argument implies a cause-and-effect relationship that doesn't necessarily exist or has not been proven, making it a logical fallacy of false equivalence.
