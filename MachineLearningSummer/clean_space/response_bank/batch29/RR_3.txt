Sure, let's apply the step-by-step process \(<IDAA>\) to the given string:

### Task <t>: Classifying a string \(<s>\) as one of the defective argument types \(<G>\), \(<FE>\), \(<IR>\), \(<RR>\), \(<WCB>\), \(<FU>\), or \(<DEP>\)

### Decomposition <D>:
1. **Read the argument (string \(<s>\)) carefully**.
2. **Identify the core claim or proposition** in the argument.
3. **Determine the type of reasoning used** (generalization, causation, enumeration, etc.).
4. **Compare the reasoning to definitions of defective argument types**.
5. **Conclude on the type of defective argument** the string falls under.
6. **Confirm the identified type against other potential types**.

### Application \(<IDAA>\) to \(<IDA>\):

Suppose the string \(<s>\) is:
> "Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified.
> Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
> Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so.
> Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct?
> Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.
> Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
> Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran."

1. **Read the argument (string \(<s>\)) carefully**:
   - Argument:
     - Speaker 1 claims Jesus was not crucified.
     - When questioned, the proof provided is the Quran.
     - Further questioning about the Quran's correctness leads to the claim that it is the Word of God.
     - When asked how that is known, the response refers back to the Quran.

2. **Identify the core claim or proposition** in the argument:
   - Core Claim: "Jesus was not really crucified."
   - Supporting claims: The Quran is true because it is the Word of God, and because God says so in the Quran.

3. **Determine the type of reasoning used** (generalization, causation, enumeration, etc.):
   - Type of reasoning: Circular reasoning, where the premise and conclusion support each other without any independent evidence.

4. **Compare the reasoning to definitions of defective argument types**:
   - \(<G>\): Generalization is not applicable, as this is not a general statement based on specific instances.
   - \(<FE>\): False Enumeration is not applicable, as there are no options listed.
   - \(<IR>\): Inappropriate Reason is not directly applicable, but it involves reasoning that does not logically support the proposition due to circular logic.
   - \(<RR>\): Redundant Reason could be applicable here because the reasoning is circular, repeating the initial claim in different words without providing new evidence.
   - \(<WCB>\): Weak Causal Basis is not applicable, as there is no causal claim.
   - \(<FU>\): False Universals is not directly applicable, as this does not appeal to population or popular belief.
   - \(<DEP>\): Double-Edged Phrases is not applicable, as there is no dual interpretation.

5. **Conclude on the type of defective argument** the string falls under:
   - This argument seems to fall under <RR> (Redundant Reason) because it uses circular reasoning, where the Quran's truth is asserted based on itself without introducing new evidence.

6. **Confirm the identified type against other potential types**:
   - Considering the steps and definitions, <RR> fits well as the argument repeatedly refers to the Quran as the sole proof without offering independent evidence, constituting circular reasoning.

### Conclusion
The string is classified as type <RR> (Redundant Reason) due to the circular reasoning employed in the argument.

By following the steps, we methodically classify the string \((s)\) as one of the defective argument types.
