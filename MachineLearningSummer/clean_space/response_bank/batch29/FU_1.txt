To apply the IDAA process to the string "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong," we'll follow the outlined steps.

### Step 1: Identify the Core Claim
- The main claim in the string is "Get Verizon."

### Step 2: Determine the Nature of Evidence or Reasoning
- The reasoning provided to support this claim is "1 billion people can't be wrong."

### Step 3: Match Argument Types to Definitions
- **Generalization (<G>):** Not applicable; the argument does not generalize a truth based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Not applicable; the argument does not list fewer or more options than exist.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Not applicable; the reason provided is related to the proposition.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Not applicable; the argument does not simply repeat the proposition in different words.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Not applicable; the argument does not offer a weak causal basis.
- **False Universals (<FU>):** This appears to be the most fitting. The argument asserts that something must be done (getting Verizon) based on the assumption that if many people are doing it, it must be correct. This is appealing to the popularity (bandwagon fallacy).
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Not applicable; no ambiguous statement noted.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
- The most fitting classification for this argument is a **False Universals (<FU>)**, as it appeals to popularity by citing the large number of people using Verizon as evidence of its correctness.

So, the classification of the string "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong." is:
**<FU> (False Universals)**

This completes the IDAA process for the given string.
