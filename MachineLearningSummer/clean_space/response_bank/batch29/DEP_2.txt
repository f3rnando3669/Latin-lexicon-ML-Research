For 
Let's apply the step-by-step decomposition of \(<IDA>\), referred to as \(<IDAA>\), to the given string.

**String \(<s>\):** 
```
Speaker 1: We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change.
Speaker 2: Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people.
```

### Step-by-Step (IDAA):

### Step 1: Understand the Definitions
- **<G> (Generalization):** Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **<FE> (False Enumeration):** Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason):** Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- **<RR> (Redundant Reason):** Presenting a redundant reason that restates the proposition.
- **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis):** Offering an insufficient causal basis to support the proposition.
- **<FU> (False Universals):** Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
- **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases):** Using statements open to dual interpretations.

### Step 2: Analyze the String \(<s>\)
- **Speaker 1's Statement:**
  - Key components: using thousands of people, spreading the word about social injustice and the need for change.
- **Speaker 2's Statement:**
  - Key components: refusal to participate, being taught that it’s wrong to use people.

### Step 3: Compare Against Definitions:

1. **<G>: Generalization**
   - Not applicable, as no general truth is being claimed based on a specific instance.

2. **<FE>: False Enumeration**
   - Not applicable, as no listing of options is present.

3. **<IR>: Inappropriate Reason**
   - Speaker 2's reason ("I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people") doesn't logically engage with the broader context provided by Speaker 1. Speaker 2's response seems to misunderstand the idea of "using people" in the context of activism, making it an inappropriate reason related to the proposition of social change efforts.

4. **<RR>: Redundant Reason**
   - Not applicable, as there's no repetition of the proposition in different words.

5. **<WCB>: Weak Causal Basis**
   - Not applicable, as there's no causal claim being evaluated.

6. **<FU>: False Universals**
   - Not applicable, as there are no universal assertions without proof.

7. **<DEP>: Double-Edged Phrases**
   - The phrase "using people" could have a dual interpretation. Speaker 1 means mobilizing people for activism, while Speaker 2 interprets it as exploitation. Therefore, this aspect makes it a candidate for DEP.

### Step 4: Identify Defective Argument Type
- **Primary:** \(<IR>\) (Inappropriate Reason) fits because Speaker 2's reason doesn't logically support their refusal to participate; it misinterprets the intended meaning of "using people."
- **Secondary:** \(<DEP>\) (Double-Edged Phrases) is also relevant due to the ambiguous interpretation of "using people."

### Conclusion:
The string \(<s>\):
```
Speaker 1: We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change.
Speaker 2: Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people.
```
is classified as an instance of **<IR>** (Inappropriate Reason) due to the logically irrelevant response, with elements of **<DEP>** (Double-Edged Phrases) due to the ambiguous phrase "using people."
