For 
Let's apply the step-by-step decomposition technique <D> to the classification task <IDA> to the argument "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess, all the other classes will all fail it, too."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition to Perform <IDAA>

1. **Identify and Understand the Argument:**
   - Read and comprehend the string <s>: "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess, all the other classes will all fail it, too."
   - The argument claims that because three kids in one class failed a quiz, all other classes will fail it too.

2. **Determine the Argument Type:**
   - Assess whether the argument type is one of the listed defective argument types by comparing it with the definitions provided for <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

3. **Compare and Match:**
   1. **Check for Generalization (<G>):**
      - Does the argument claim a general truth based on a specific instance? 
      - Yes, the argument generalizes the failure of three kids in one class to all other classes.

   2. **Check for False Enumeration (<FE>):**
      - Does the argument list fewer or more options than actually exist? 
      - No, this is not applicable as the argument does not involve listing options.

   3. **Check for Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):**
      - Does the argument provide a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition? 
      - No, this is not the case here.

   4. **Check for Redundant Reason (<RR>):**
      - Does the argument present a new reason that repeats the same proposition in different words? 
      - No, it does not repeat itself.

   5. **Check for Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
      - Does the argument offer a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition? 
      - No, the argument is not based on a weak causal relationship.

   6. **Check for False Universals (<FU>):**
      - Does the argument assert universally agreed points without proof?
      - No, it doesn't assert universally agreed points.

   7. **Check for Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):**
      - Does the argument use statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker? 
      - No, the statement is not open to dual interpretations.

4. **Classify the Argument:**
   - The statement fits the category of Generalization (<G>) as it takes a specific instance (three kids in one class failing the Jane Eyre quiz) and applies it broadly to all other classes.

Thus, "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess, all the other classes will all fail it, too." is classified as a <G> type defective argument.

We have now successfully applied the decomposition process <D> to the classification task <IDA>, achieving <IDAA>.
