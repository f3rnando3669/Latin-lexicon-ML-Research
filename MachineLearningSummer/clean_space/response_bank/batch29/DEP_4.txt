For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses," follow the step-by-step breakdown:

### Applying <IDAA>:

#### Step 1: Understand the Defective Argument Types
1. **Generalization (<G>)**
2. **False Enumeration (<FE>)**
3. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**
4. **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**
5. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
6. **False Universals (<FU>)**
7. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**

#### Step 2: Identify Key Characteristics of Each Type
1. **Generalization (<G>)**: All-or-nothing claims.
2. **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Simplified disjunctive options.
3. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Reason not logically connected.
4. **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Tautological statements.
5. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Weak causal link.
6. **False Universals (<FU>)**: Universally accepted points without evidence.
7. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Ambiguous statements with multiple interpretations.

#### Step 3: Apply Pattern Recognition
- Analyze the string in segments:
  - "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being."
  - "Fetuses are innocent human beings."
  - "Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."

#### Step 4: Categorize the Argument
- **Analyze the Argument**:
  - First premise: "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being."
    - This statement is a moral assertion.
  - Second premise: "Fetuses are innocent human beings."
    - This is an assertion that categorizes fetuses as "innocent human beings."
  - Conclusion: "Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."
    - Conclusion logically follows from combining the two premises.

The argument appears to be a logical syllogism rather than fitting any of the provided defective argument types directly. It doesn't show characteristics of generalization, false enumeration, inappropriate reason, redundant reason, weak causal basis, false universals, or double-edged phrases.

Here’s why:
- Each premise logically supports the conclusion.
- There’s no overgeneralization or simplification.
- The premises provide relevant reasons in support of the conclusion.
- There’s no redundancy in terms of repeating the same proposition.
- Causal basis is not weak; it makes a direct moral claim.
- It doesn’t rely on universally accepted but unproven points.
- It lacks dual interpretations suggesting ambiguity against the speaker.

#### Final Categorization:
- The argument: "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses," does not fit any of the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP> based on the given definitions and characteristics.

Therefore, the string does not belong to any identified defective argument type as per the provided classifications.
