### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDAA> for the Given String

**Given String <s>:**
"That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there."

**Step 1: Understand the Definitions**
- Review and understand the definitions of each defective argument type: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

**Step 2: Preparation of the Input**
- Ensure <s> is clearly defined and provided as input: "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there."

**Step 3: Preliminary Identification**
- Perform an initial analysis of the string <s>:
  - It’s making a statement about the popularity of a restaurant.
  - The reason given is "because everyone in town goes there."

**Step 4: Detailed Analysis Per Category**
- Evaluate each category based on the provided definition:

  - **For <G> (Generalization):**
    - This doesn’t seem to be a broad generalization based on a specific instance.

  - **For <FE> (False Enumeration):**
    - It’s not an argument listing fewer or more options than exist.

  - **For <IR> (Inappropriate Reason):**
    - The reason provided ("everyone in town goes there") logically seems related to the restaurant's popularity, so it’s not inappropriate.

  - **For <RR> (Redundant Reason):**
    - The reason ("everyone in town goes there") seems to be restating why it's popular, but it is not restating the proposition in different words.

  - **For <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis):**
    - The statement doesn't provide a causal relationship that is argued through a weak basis.

  - **For <FU> (False Universals):**
    - This appears to assert a universally agreed point ("everyone in town goes there") to support the restaurant’s popularity without further proof. This structure implies the argument might fall under false universals as it implies that because many people do something, it should be considered true or popular.

  - **For <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases):**
    - The statement is straightforward and does not have an ambiguous or dual interpretation.

**Step 5: Comparison and Validation**
- The phrase "because everyone in town goes there" is asserting the restaurant's popularity based on the general assumption that everyone's behavior is a valid justification. This fits the definition of <FU> (False Universals).

**Step 6: Final Classification**
- Based on the detailed analysis, classify <s> as <FU>.

**Step 7: Reporting the Outcome**
- The string "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there." is classified as <FU> (False Universals).

Therefore, the outcome of the classification is that the given string "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there." falls under the category of <FU> (False Universals).
