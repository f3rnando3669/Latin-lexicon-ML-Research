For 
Let's apply the **Step-by-Step Decomposition of Task \( t \) into Specific Steps (\( D \))** to classify the string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

**Step 1**: Understand the Argument Types

As a reminder, the defective argument types are:
- **Generalization (G)**
- **False Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**
- **Redundant Reason (RR)**
- **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **False Universals (FU)**
- **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**

**Step 2**: Identify the Components of the String

- The claim: "I’m not going to talk to you."
- The reasoning: "My best friend says you’re a liar."

**Step 3**: Match Components to Definitions

Let's analyze each argument type one by one:

- **\( G \)**: Not applicable, as it does not draw a generalization from a specific instance.
  
- **\( FE \)**: Not applicable, as it does not list options.

- **\( IR \)**: This seems possible, as the reasoning ("My best friend says you’re a liar") does not logically support the proposition ("I’m not going to talk to you"). The reasoning relies on the authority of the best friend rather than direct evidence or logical reasoning.

- **\( RR \)**: Not applicable, as it does not restate the same thing as the proposition using different words.
  
- **\( WCB \)**: Not applicable, as it does not offer a weak causal basis.
  
- **\( FU \)**: Not applicable, as it does not rely on universally agreed points without proof.
  
- **\( DEP \)**: Not applicable, as it cannot be construed as having dual meanings.

**Step 4**: Eliminate Incongruent Defective Argument Types

We can eliminate \( G \), \( FE \), \( RR \), \( WCB \), \( FU \), and \( DEP \) based on the analysis above.

**Step 5**: Classify the String

Given that the reasoning provided ("My best friend says you’re a liar") does not logically support the decision ("I’m not going to talk to you"), the string is classified as \( IR \) (Inappropriate Reason).

### Conclusion
The string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you." is classified as **\( IR \)**.
