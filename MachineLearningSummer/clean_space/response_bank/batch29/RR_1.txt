To classify the string "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity" into one of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>) using the decomposed approach (<IDAA>), we will follow the structured steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>)

1. **Identify the Structure of the Argument**:
   - Pinpoint the proposition and the reason(s) provided.
   - Determine if the argument is making a broad claim from a specific instance, providing logic-based reasons, or presenting a causal relationship.

2. **Isolate Key Elements of the Argument**:
   - Extract statements that suggest generalization.
   - Identify enumeration of choices.
   - Look for statements providing reasons or justifications.
   - Check if the argument repeats the same reasoning in different words.
   - Examine causal claims.
   - Note any universally accepted points without proof.
   - Identify statements with dual interpretations.

3. **Match Key Elements to Defective Argument Types**:
   - Compare each extracted statement to the definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.
   - Verify the alignment between the argument's structure and content with any specific defective argument type.

4. **Classify the Argument**:
   - Assign the most fitting defective argument type to the statement based on the identified structural and content matches.

### Application to the Task (<IDAA>)

#### Input: <s> = "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."

**Step 1: Identify the Structure of the Argument**
   - Proposition: "Paranormal activity is real"
   - Reason: "because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity"

**Step 2: Isolate Key Elements of the Argument**
   - Proposition: "Paranormal activity is real"
   - Reason: "because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity"

**Step 3: Match Key Elements to Defective Argument Types**
   - The reason provided ("because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity") does not add additional information to support the proposition "Paranormal activity is real" and instead repeats the proposition using different words.

**Step 4: Classify the Argument**
   - This aligns with the definition of <RR> (Redundant Reason) because the reason appears to be presented as a new reason but says the same thing as the proposition using different words.

Therefore, the classification is <RR> (Redundant Reason).
