For 
To apply <D> (decomposition) to <IDA> (the task of classifying the given string as one of the defective argument types), we will follow the step-by-step decomposition for <IDAA>.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for Classifying the Argument:

1. **Read and Understand the Argument (<s>):**
    - **Argument Provided:** 
        "Perhaps the most classic example of this fallacy is the argument for the existence of God. Due to the understanding of nature through science, many of the arguments that used to be used for God (or gods) were abandoned, only to be replaced with new ones, usually involving questions to which science has not definitively answered yet. The move from creationism to intelligent design is a prime example. Currently the origin of life is a popular argument for God (although a classic argument from ignorance), and an area where we very well may have a scientific answer in the next decade, at which time, the “origin of life” argument will fade away and be replaced by another, thus moving the figurative goalposts farther back as our understanding of the natural world increases. Exception: This fallacy should not be confused with an argument or set of arguments, with multiple propositions inherent in the argument. The reason for the difference between this kind of argument and the moving the goalposts fallacy, is a subtle one, but indicated by a strong initial claim (“has to be”, “must”, “required for”, etc.) that gets answered and/or what appears to be ad hoc objections that follow eventually leading to an impossible request for proof. Fun Fact: The name “moving the goalposts” comes from the analogy of kicking a perfect field goal in American football, only to have the goalposts be moved on you. This would be very unfair.

2. **Identify the Type of Defective Argument:**
    - **Generalization (G):** Does it claim a general truth based on a specific instance?
    - **False Enumeration (FE):** Does it list fewer or more options than actually exist?
    - **Inappropriate Reason (IR):** Does it provide a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition?
    - **Redundant Reason (RR):** Does it present a reason that restates the proposition?
    - **Weak Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the causal connection insufficient to support the proposition?
    - **False Universals (FU):** Does it assert universally agreed points without proof?
    - **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP):** Does it use statements open to dual interpretations?

3. **Classify Argument Based on Definitions:**
    - The main argument suggests that arguments for the existence of God evolve as science answers more questions. Previous reasons given for the existence of God (creationism to intelligent design) are replaced by new reasons as science advances. This is described as "moving the goalposts".
    - The argument critiques a hypothetical process but doesn't explicitly fit the set defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP). Instead, it describes "moving the goalposts", a specific fallacy where criteria for proof are shifted to avoid refutation.

4. **Assign the Defective Argument Type:**
    - This argument best fits a narrative explaining a fallacy itself rather than an instance of one of the predefined defective arguments (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP). Hence, it does not clearly classify under the provided defective argument types.

5. **Verify the Classification:**
    - Cross-referencing the definitions, the argument mainly discusses "moving the goalposts" as a logical fallacy related to shifting requirements for evidence. It doesn't fit into the predefined categories as it explains an evolving defensive argument structure.

6. **Document the Classification:**
    - The argument provided does not strictly fit any of the identified defective argument types. It instead describes the "moving the goalposts" fallacy, where criteria for proof are continuously changed to avoid refutation. The provided argument is more illustrative of this specific kind of logical fallacy rather than fitting neatly into one of the given categories.

### Conclusion
Since the provided argument focuses on explaining the "moving the goalposts" fallacy rather than providing a defective argument type as defined by <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>, it does not classify under the predefined types.
