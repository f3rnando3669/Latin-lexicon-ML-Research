For 
To apply <IDAA> (the systematic decomposition of the classification task <IDA>) to the statement "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights," we follow the steps outlined in the step-by-step decomposition.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDAA> for the Given Statement

1. **Understand the Fallacy Types**: 
    - **Generalization (<G>)**: Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
    - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
    - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
    - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Presenting a reason that says the same thing as the proposition using different words.
    - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Offering a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
    - **False Universals (<FU>)**: Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
    - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Using statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.

2. **Extract the Core Argument from <s>**: 
    - The core argument in "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" is that not supporting Hillary Clinton equates to not believing in women's rights.

3. **Identify Potential Keywords or Phrases**:
    - The phrase "You either...or" suggests a binary choice, which is indicative of a false dilemma or false enumeration (<FE>).

4. **Compare Against Definitions**:
    - **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement does not involve making a broad generalization based on a specific instance.
    - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument presents a binary choice as if these are the only two possible options (either supporting Hillary Clinton or not believing in women's rights). This limits the options and oversimplifies the issue, ignoring other possibilities.
    - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: The argument does not provide a reason that is irrelevant to the proposition.
    - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: The argument does not redundantly say the same thing in different words.
    - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument does not necessarily offer a weak causal basis.
    - **False Universals (<FU>)**: The statement does not rely on universally agreed points without proof, although it makes an absolute comparison.
    - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: The statement does not appear to be open to dual interpretations potentially against the speaker.

5. **Classify the Argument**:
    - The appropriate classification for the statement "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" is **False Enumeration (<FE>)** because it falsely limits the choices to just two, ignoring other possibilities such as supporting women's rights but preferring another candidate or having different criteria for supporting a presidential candidate.

6. **Validate the Classification**:
    - Review the classification to confirm that <FE> is the most fitting fallacy. The statement sets up a false binary opposition that simplifies a complex issue into two mutually exclusive choices.

7. **Document the Decision**:
    - "The statement 'You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights' was classified as a <FE> because it suggests a false dichotomy by presenting only two possible options and ignoring other realistic choices."

This systematic analysis demonstrates that the statement is indeed a case of **False Enumeration (<FE>)** by presenting a false binary choice.
