For 
Let's break down the process of classifying the string "Everyone else is doing it, so should you." into one of the defective argument types (\<G>, \<FE>, \<IR>, \<RR>, \<WCB>, \<FU>, \<DEP>) using the steps defined in \( <IDAA> \):

### Step 1: Understand the Definitions

- **Generalization (\<G>):** Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (\<FE>):** Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **Inappropriate Reason (\<IR>):** Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- **Redundant Reason (\<RR>):** Presenting a reason that says the same thing as the proposition using different words.
- **Weak Causal Basis (\<WCB>):** Offering a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
- **False Universals (\<FU>):** Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (\<DEP>):** Using statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.

### Step 2: Read the String Carefully

- **String (\<s>):** "Everyone else is doing it, so should you."

### Step 3: Identify the Argument Structure

- **Argument Structure:** 
  - Proposition: You should do something.
  - Reason: Because everyone else is doing it.

### Step 4: Match the Argument to Definitions

- **Generalization (\<G>):** No, it’s not claiming a truth based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (\<FE>):** No, it’s not listing options.
- **Inappropriate Reason (\<IR>):** No, the reason is somewhat relevant (peer influence), although it's weak.
- **Redundant Reason (\<RR>):** No, it is not restating the same proposition.
- **Weak Causal Basis (\<WCB>):** No, it’s not a causal argument.
- **False Universals (\<FU>):** Yes, it is asserting a universally agreed point (peer pressure) without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (\<DEP>):** No, it does not have a dual interpretation.

### Step 5: Determine the Best Fit

- The statement seems to fit False Universals (\<FU>) the best because it appeals to popularity or the fact that many people do something as a form of validation without providing actual proof or solid reasoning.

### Step 6: Confirm Decision

- Re-read the statement: "Everyone else is doing it, so should you."
- Confirm that it asserts a universally agreed point (peer influence) without proof.

The classification for the string "Everyone else is doing it, so should you." is \( <FU> \).

### Final Classification

- **String (\<s>):** "Everyone else is doing it, so should you."
- **Defective Argument Type:** (\<FU>) False Universals
