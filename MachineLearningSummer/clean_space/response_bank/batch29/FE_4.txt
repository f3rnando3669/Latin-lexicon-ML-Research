Certainly! Let's apply the step-by-step IDAA (application of decomposition to IDA) process to classify the string "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for IDAA:

1. **Step 1: Understand the Argument Types**
    - Ensure a clear understanding of each defective argument type:
      - **<G> (Generalization)**: Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
      - **<FE> (False Enumeration)**: Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
      - **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**: Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
      - **<RR> (Redundant Reason)**: Presenting a reason as new but it's essentially saying the same thing as the proposition.
      - **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**: Offering a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
      - **<FU> (False Universals)**: Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
      - **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)**: Using statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.

2. **Step 2: Extract Relevant Components from the String**
    - Read the input string: "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today."
    - Identify the proposition and reasoning:
      - Proposition: The speaker had a belief (you were a good person).
      - Reasoning: The support for changing this belief is based on the person's absence from class.

3. **Step 3: Compare Extracted Components against Definitions**
    - Determine if the argument in the string attempts to generalize from a specific instance:
      - The string might be seen as generalizing that being a good person is contingent solely on class attendance.
    - Check if it presents a false dichotomy or overstates the options:
      - The focus is solely on the absence from class, no clear false enumeration.
    - Assess if the reason provided is irrelevant to the proposition:
      - The argument asserts that absence from class negates being a good person, which appears logically irrelevant.
    - Verify if the reason given simply restates the proposition in different words:
      - Not applicable; the reasoning is different from the proposition.
    - Evaluate if the causal relationship provided is weak or insufficient:
      - The reasoning might be seen as weak, as class attendance might not be a strong indicator of being a good person.
    - Look for any assertions of universal agreement without proof:
      - No assertion of universal agreement present.
    - Determine if the argument uses statements that can have multiple interpretations:
      - Not particularly open to dual interpretations.

4. **Step 4: Classify Based on Match**
    - The strongest match here is that the reasoning provided seems inappropriate to support the proposition (i.e., not attending class does not logically infer that someone is not a good person).

### Classification: <IR> (Inappropriate Reason)

Thus, the string "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today." is classified as <IR> because the reason given (not being in class) does not logically support the proposition that the person is not a good person.
