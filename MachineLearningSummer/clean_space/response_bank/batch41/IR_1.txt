Certainly! Applying the procedure for identifying the specific type of defective argument to the statement "Don't you want the best for your baby?" involves the following steps:

1. **Identify the string \( s \)**:
   - The string in question is "Don't you want the best for your baby?".

2. **Decompose the Problem \( IDA \) into Specific Steps \( D \)**:
   - Step 1: Determine if the argument contains a Proposition ( \( P \) ), a Reason ( \( R \) ), or a Proof of Reason ( \( PR \) ).
   - Step 2: Identify if the argument is defective and classify which type of defective argument it is.
     - Check if the argument is a Defect in \( P \) ( \( DP \) ):
       - Generalization ( \( G \) )
       - Incomplete Enumeration ( \( FE \) )
     - Check if the argument is a Defect in \( R \) ( \( DR \) ):
       - Inconclusive Reason ( \( IR \) )
       - Insufficient Causal Basis ( \( WCB \) )
       - Faulty Repetition of Proposition ( \( RR \) )
     - Check if the argument is a Defect in \( PR \) ( \( DPR \) ):
       - Presumptuous Consensus ( \( FU \) )
       - Ambiguous Language Use ( \( DEP \) )

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis of the Given String**:

   - **Step 1**: Determine if the argument contains a Proposition ( \( P \) ), a Reason ( \( R \) ), or a Proof of Reason ( \( PR \) ).

     The statement "Don't you want the best for your baby?" appears to function implicitly as an argument, where the Proposition ( \( P \) ) can be inferred to mean something like "You should take action \( X \) because it is the best for your baby."
     
     However, this statement itself is in question form and lacks explicit reasoning or evidence. 

     - **Proposition ( \( P \) )**: Implicitly suggesting the reader should take some action that is "best for the baby".
     - **Reason ( \( R \) )**: Not explicitly provided.
     - **Proof of Reason ( \( PR \) )**: Not explicitly provided.
     
     Given that it is a rhetorical question, it lacks a clear and explicit reasoning or proof.

   - **Step 2**: Identify if the argument is defective and classify which type of defective argument it is.
     - **Check Defects in \( P \) ( \( DP \) )**:
       - **Generalization ( \( G \) )**: Not applicable, it does not involve a generalization about a category of people or things.
       - **Incomplete Enumeration ( \( FE \) )**: Not applicable, it does not imply limited options explicitly.
     
     - **Check Defects in \( R \) ( \( DR \) )**:
       - **Inconclusive Reason ( \( IR \) )**: Not applicable as no explicit reason is given.
       - **Insufficient Causal Basis ( \( WCB \) )**: Not applicable as no explicit reasoning presented.
       - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition ( \( RR \) )**: Not applicable as there is no repetition involved.
     
     - **Check Defects in \( PR \) ( \( DPR \) )**:
       - **Presumptuous Consensus ( \( FU \) )**: This could be applicable tentatively here, as the question implicitly assumes that the "best for your baby" is universally agreed upon and undisputed.
       - **Ambiguous Language Use ( \( DEP \) )**: Not applicable as the statement does not involve ambiguity in language use.

Based on the analysis, the statement **"Don't you want the best for your baby?"** seems to lean towards being a **Presumptuous Consensus ( \( FU \) )**. The statement presumes everyone agrees on what the "best" action is without offering an explicit argument or reason, essentially relying on an assumed universal consensus to urge the listener towards a specific viewpoint or action.

Therefore, applying \( IDAA \) to "Don't you want the best for your baby?" classifies it as a type **\( FU \) (Presumptuous Consensus)** defective argument.
