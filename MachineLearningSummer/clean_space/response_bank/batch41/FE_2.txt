For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights," we'll take it step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Nature of the String <s>
The string "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" is presented as an argument, likely aiming to influence the reader's decision or belief.

### Step 2: Identify the Components and Classify the Defect if Present
Next, we identify if there's a defect in the argument by determining if it fits into any of the predefined defective argument types.

- **Generalization (<G>):** This occurs when an assertion based on some part or majority of individuals is inappropriately applied to all.
  - This string does not attempt to claim something about all individuals based on a small sample.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This is when a complete enumeration of possibilities is claimed but is missing some pertinent ones.
  - The string presents a binary choice ("either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights"), ignoring possible alternatives. This binary framing fits the definition of <FE>.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This occurs if the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
  - The string does not provide a reason that supports the truth of either proposition conclusively.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This happens when the causal basis for the proposition is weak.
  - The string does not provide a causal explanation insufficiently or otherwise supporting the proposition.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This is when the reason is a repeat of the proposition.
  - The string does not seem to repeat the proposition in the form of the reason.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This happens when the proposition's proof assumes consensus on a disputed matter.
  - The string does not assume consensus as proof.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** This is when the proof can be understood differently than intended.
  - The string does not appear to have language that could be taken in another sense by reasonable interpretation.

### Step 3: Determine the Defective Argument Type
Based on the analysis:

- The argument presents a false dichotomy, stating only two possible positions while omitting others. This fits the description of **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**.

### Step 4: Classify the String as a Specific Defective Argument Type
Classify the string "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" as **<FE>**.

### Conclusion
The defective argument type for the string "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" is **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**.
