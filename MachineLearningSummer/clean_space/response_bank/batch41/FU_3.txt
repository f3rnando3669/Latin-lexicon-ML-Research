For 
Sure, to apply <IDAA> to the string "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding.", we need to break down the process into specific steps as described by the definitions provided:

1. **Identify the Type of Defective Argument**:
   - First, we need to classify the argument based on the types provided: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

2. **Examine the Argument Construction**:
   - Look at the proposition (<P>) and the reason (<R>) provided in the string to identify any defect.

Step-by-Step Breakdown:

### Step 1: Understand the Argument
- **Proposition (<P>)**: "I wasn't speeding."
- **Reason (<R>)**: "I was only driving as fast as everyone around me."

### Step 2: Classify the Argument
- Check if the argument contains a known defect:

#### Analysis of <P> and <R>:
- **Proposition (P)**: The speaker is asserting that they were not speeding.
- **Reason (R)**: The speaker justifies this assertion by stating that they were driving as fast as everyone else around them.

### Step 3: Match with Defective Argument Types:
- **Generalization (<G>)**: Not applicable here since the proposition is not a general assertion about a population.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not applicable as the reason does not rely on a claim of covering all possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Not applicable as the reason provided is attempting to draw a direct relevance without a bias label.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Not applicable because the reason is not simply a restatement of the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Not applicable because no causal basis for an effect is being claimed.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Potentially applicable. The argument assumes correctness because "everyone else" was doing the same, which may reflect an appeal to popularity or consensus.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Not applicable as the language used is not ambiguous.

### Step 4: Identify the Defective Argument Type
- Based on the above analysis, the most fitting classification is:
  - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The reason relies on the behavior of others to justify not speeding, which assumes that following the crowd validates the argument of not speeding.

### Conclusion:
The string "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding." is best classified under the defective argument type <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).

By breaking down the task of classifying the string through the given steps, we encapsulated the complex process into manageable sub-tasks, successfully identifying <s> as <FU>.
