For 
To apply the task of classifying the defective argument within the string <s> ("One of our clients doubled their conversions after changing all their landing page text to bright red. Therefore, changing all text to red is a proven way to double conversions.") as one of the defective argument types <G> (Generalization), <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration), <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis), <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus), or <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use), we follow a step-by-step procedure known as the decomposition of the task:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Determine what the statement is attempting to prove.
   - In this case: "Changing all text to red is a proven way to double conversions."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Find the causal basis provided to support the proposition.
   - In this case: "One of our clients doubled their conversions after changing all their landing page text to bright red."

3. **Assess the Quality of Reasoning**:
   - Evaluate if the reason given establishes a strong causal link or is subject to any defects.

4. **Identify Potential Defects in the Argument**:
   - **Generalization (<G>):** Is the conclusion based on a limited example but applied universally?
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Are all possible factors or scenarios considered or omitted?
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Does the given reason conclusively support the proposition?
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Is the causal basis strong enough to support the proposition?
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Is the reason just a repetition of the proposition?
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Is the proposition claimed to be true because it is widely believed?
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Is there ambiguous language that can lead to multiple interpretations?

5. **Determine the Type of Defective Argument**:
   - **Generalization (G):** The argument concludes that changing all text to red will double conversions based on the experience of one client. This is imputing the outcome of one instance to all possible instances, which is a form of overgeneralization.

Conclusively, the argument fits the type **Generalization (G)** because it assumes that what happened in one specific case will happen in all cases, without sufficient evidence to support such a broad claim.

### Final Classification:
**Generalization (G)**: The statement takes one example (one client) and generalizes it as a proven method for all cases, which is a hasty and unsupported generalization.
