For 
To apply the task of classifying "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong." as one of the defective argument types (IDA), we need to break down the task into specific steps. Here, we will execute the decomposition (D) of the advanced task (t), which is the classification. Let's start step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
Examine the given string to identify the proposition (P), which is what the statement intends to prove or assert.
- **Proposition (P):** "Get Verizon."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Examine the given string to identify the reason (R), which provides the causal basis for the proposition.
- **Reason (R):** "1 billion people can't be wrong."

### Step 3: Assess the Defective Argument Type
Determine if the reason (R) provides a strong, valid causal basis for the proposition (P). We need to see if the argument fits any of the defective argument definitions, as summarized below:
- **G (Generalization):** The proposition is overly generalized based on a part or majority.
- **FE (Incomplete Enumeration):** Claims completeness but misses out on other possibilities.
- **IR (Inconclusive Reason):** Reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
- **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** Reason repeats the proposition without adding meaningful support.
- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The causal basis is weak or not compelling.
- **FU (Presumptuous Consensus):** Assumes consensus as proof.
- **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use):** Language is ambiguous or misleading.

### Step 4: Match the Argument with the Defective Argument Type
Based on the definitions provided, classify the argument by matching it with the type of defective argument. Let's analyze the given reason in the context of each defective argument type.

**Analysis:**
- **G (Generalization):** Not applicable, as the argument does not generalize characteristics from a subset to a whole population.
- **FE (Incomplete Enumeration):** Not applicable, as the argument does not enumerate possibilities.
- **IR (Inconclusive Reason):** Not applicable, the argument does not fail due to inconclusiveness alone.
- **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** Not applicable, the reason is not simply a rephrasing of the proposition.
- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis):** Not quite fitting, since it hinges more on the popular opinion, not the weakness of a causal relationship.
- **FU (Presumptuous Consensus):** Applicable, the argument rests on the belief that if one billion people use Verizon, it must be the right choiceâ€”assuming consensus as proof.
- **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use):** Not applicable, the language is not ambiguous in a misleading way.

### Step 5: Conclude the Classification
From the analysis, the appropriate classification can be determined.

**Conclusion:**
- **Classification:** <FU> Presumptuous Consensus.

### Summary
By applying IDAA to "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong," we decomposed the task into identifying the proposition and reason, assessing possible defective argument types, and matching the argument with the correct type. The result is that the argument is of type **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**.
