For 
To apply **<IDAA>** to the statement "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people." and determine the logical fallacy type, we will follow the steps of **<D>** â€“ decomposition of the task into specific steps for classifying the argument as <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>:

### Step-by-Step Analysis (**<IDAA>** to classify the logical fallacy):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), and Proof (<PR>)**:
   - **Proposition (<P>)**: "We need to fix our broken judicial system."
   - **Reason (<R>)**: "by electing new people."
   - **Proof (<PR>)**: None provided explicitly in the given string.

2. **Determine if the Proposition (<P>) is defective (<DP>)**:
   - Examine whether the assertion in <P> is subject to Generalization (<G>) or Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>).

   <P> ("We need to fix our broken judicial system.") could be a Generalization (<G>) bit more analysis is required to confirm.

3. **Determine if the Reason (<R>) is defective (<DR>)**:
   - Examine if the Reason is Inconclusive (<IR>), has an Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), or if it is a Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>).

   <R> ("by electing new people.") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of <P>. There is a weak causal link provided here.

4. **Determine if the Proof of Reason (<PR>) is defective (<DPR>)**:
   - Examine whether the proof provided is using Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>) or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

   As there is no explicit proof provided in the statement, this step is not applicable.

### Diagnostic Evaluation:

- The Reason (<R>) "by electing new people" does not provide a conclusive causal basis to demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition (<P>) "We need to fix our broken judicial system." Since the reason does not substantiate the proposition effectively, it classifies as **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**.

Therefore, applying **<IDAA>** to the statement "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people," we identify the logical fallacy as **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason).

**Conclusion:** 
The logical fallacy in the statement "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people." is **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**.
