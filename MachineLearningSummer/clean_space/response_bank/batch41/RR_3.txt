For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string provided, we'll need to break down the argument into specific parts and then analyze each part to classify the argument based on the given types of defective arguments. Let's proceed step by step.

Step 1: Decompose the conversation into its argument components:
    
1. **Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified.**
   - This is a proposition (<P>) set forth by Speaker 1.

2. **Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?**
   - This is a questioning response from Speaker 2, asking for the reason or proof.

3. **Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so.**
   - This is the first reason (<R>) provided by Speaker 1 to support <P>.

4. **Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct?**
   - This is another questioning response from Speaker 2, asking for the proof of <R>.

5. **Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.**
   - This is an additional reason (<R>) for corroborating the previous reason.

6. **Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?**
   - This is another questioning response from Speaker 2, seeking further validation.

7. **Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Quran.**
   - This is a further reason (<R>) relying on the same source as the previous reasons (the Quran).

Step 2: Identify the defective arguments in the conversation:
    
- **Primary Proposition (<P>):** Jesus was not really crucified.

- **Reasons (<R>):** Because the Quran says so, because the Quran is the Word of God, and because God tells us so in the Quran.

Step 3: Classify the defective arguments:

1. **"Because the Quran says so" as a reason for "Jesus was not really crucified":** 
   - This can be seen as a form of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** since it essentially assumes the Quran's authority without further justification, and it's also setting up a circular reasoning.

2. **"Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true" as a reason for trusting the Quran:**
   - This is **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** because it relies on the assertion that the Quran is true simply by stating its divine origin, without external evidence.

3. **"Because God tells us so, here in the Quran" as validation of the Quran’s truth:**
   - This is another example of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** as it continues to rely on the Quran to validate the Quran itself, forming a circular argument.

Final Step: Summarize the classification.
    
Based on the classification, all the reasons provided fall into the category of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**.

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the given string results in identifying the faulty argument as <RR>.
