For 
OK, let's apply the procedure outlined by <IDAA> to classify the given string according to our predefined defect categories (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>).

**Original Input:**
"I see nobody on the road," said Alice.
"I only wish I had such eyes," the king remarked..."To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why it's as much as I can do to see real people, by this light."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify Proposition (<P>):**
   - The initial statement by Alice, "I see nobody on the road," serves as the Proposition (P). It sets forth what she intends to informâ€”namely, that there is nobody on the road.

2. **Identify Reason (<R>):**
   - The King's remark is a response to Alice's statement. "I only wish I had such eyes," the king remarked..."To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why it's as much as I can do to see real people, by this light." This provides his reasoning, though humorously interpreting "nobody" as an entity.

3. **Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - The King's statement follows through with some humor and an attempt to clarify or proof that seeing "nobody" is equivalent to having extraordinary vision.

### Identification of Defective Argument:

1. **Possible Ambiguity (DEP):**
   - There is an ambiguous use of language. The King's interpretation of "nobody" as though it were a literal person creates a humorous misunderstanding. This falls under <DEP>, which concerns the ambiguity where the term "nobody" was taken in another sense (literal unseen entity) than Alice intended (an absence of people).

### Conclusion:
- The string contains an instance of <DEP>: Ambiguous Language Use. 

**Classified as: <DEP>**
