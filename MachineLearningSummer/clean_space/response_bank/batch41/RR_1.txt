For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity," we need to break down the tasks step by step. 

### Step 1: **Understanding the Components**
- **Proposition (<P>)**: The argument's proposition is "Paranormal activity is real."
- **Reason (<R>)**: The reason given for the proposition is "I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."

### Step 2: **Identifying Which Family of Defective Arguments the String Belongs To**
We need to classify the argument into one of the following defective argument families:
- <DP>: Defects in <P>
- <DR>: Defects in <R>
- <DPR>: Defects in <PR>

Since the statement completes <P> and provides an <R>, we should examine defects in <R> (<DR>).

### Step 3: **Classifying the Type of Defective Argument**
The type of defective arguments in <DR> includes:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: When <R> doesn't conclusively demonstrate the correctness of <P>.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: When the causal basis for <P> is not compelling.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: When <R> repeats exactly what <P> states, without adding any substantive evidence.

### Step 4: **Determining the Exact Defective Type**
Now, let's analyze the given argument:
- **Proposition (<P>)**: "Paranormal activity is real."
- **Reason (<R>)**: "I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."

Here, the reason given is essentially a repetition of the proposition. The reason doesn't provide any new information or evidence; it just rephrases the proposition with slightly different wording.

This fits the definition of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**, where the reason given (what can only be described as paranormal activity) is essentially repeating the proposition (paranormal activity is real).

### Conclusion: Final Classification
Based on the analysis, the argument "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity" is a defective argument type **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**.

### Summary of Steps:
1. Identify components: <P> and <R>.
2. Determine family: <DR>.
3. Analyze specific types within <DR>: <IR>, <WCB>, and <RR>.
4. Classify as <RR> based on analysis.
