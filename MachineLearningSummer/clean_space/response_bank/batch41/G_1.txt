For 
To apply <IDAA> to the provided statement, we need to decompose the task of classifying the defective argument into specific steps and then apply these steps to classify the argument. Below is a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The main statement or claim that is to be proven.
   - In the given string: "My 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!"

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The causal basis or justification for the Proposition.
   - In the given string: "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up."

3. **Analyze the Defective Argument Types:**
   - **<G> (Generalization):** Is <P> an assertion based on a small sample applied broadly?
   - **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):** Does <P> claim complete enumeration but miss possibilities?
   - **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** Does <R> not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of <P>?
   - **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** Is <R> weak because the causal basis for <P> is not compelling?
   - **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** Does <R> repeat the same idea as <P> without adding justification?
   - **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):** Is <PR> assumed correct because it is universally agreed upon or popular?
   - **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):** Is <PR> ambiguous and taken differently than intended?

4. **Classify the Defective Argument:**
   - Compare the defective argument types to the statement to determine the most fitting classification.
   
   Applying these steps to the given string:

   - **Proposition (<P>):** "My 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well."
   - **Reason (<R>):** "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up."

   Analyzing the defective argument types:

   - <G> (Generalization): The statement is a generalization because it unfairly applies guilt to an individual based on the actions of a larger group. The guilt of one member of the Catholic Church (or a specific incident involving certain members) is extended to all individuals associated with the Church.
     - This fits the classification as a Generalization (<G>).

The final step is the classification of the string:

"I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!" is best classified as:
   
   **<G> (Generalization)**
