To apply **IDAA** (the decomposition of classification into specific steps) to the statement "People either like coffee or hate it," we would break down the task into a systematic process to identify its classification type. Here's the step-by-step approach:

**Step 1: Decompose <t> into specific steps.**

1.1 **Understand the statement:** Examine the content and structure of the argument.
1.2 **Identify the relevant part of the argument:** Determine if the statement is a Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), or Proof of Reason (<PR>).
1.3 **Evaluate for defects:** Match the statement against known defect types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

**Step 2: Understand the statement.**

- The statement "People either like coffee or hate it." is a categorical assertion about people's preferences regarding coffee. It simplifies the range of possible opinions into two distinct and opposing categories.

**Step 3: Identify the relevant part of the argument.**

- The statement is presented as a fact or Proposition (<P>) setting forth what is being asserted. Here, it's asserting a binary choice regarding coffee preference.

**Step 4: Evaluate for defects.**

- Consider if the assertion is a correct and complete representation of reality.

**Step 5: Match against known defect types (<DP>, <DR>, <DPR>).**

- Since the statement is a Proposition (<P>), it should be evaluated against corresponding defects in <DP>.

**Step 6: Determine if it fits any classification.**

- The statement "People either like coffee or hate it." attempts to impose a binary classification on people's preferences. This often leaves out the middle ground where people may have neutral feelings, like coffee sometimes, or be indifferent.

**The statement's categorization could lead to incomplete enumeration.**

**Step 7: Determine if it matches <G>, <FE>, or any other defect in <DP>.**

- This assertion misses out on the neutral or other varying degrees of preference, making it an <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration).

Conclusively, the application of **IDAA** to the statement "People either like coffee or hate it." classifies it as a defective argument type:

**<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)** - Because it simplifies people's opinions into only two categories, disregarding neutral or other possible positions. 

This completes the decomposition and classification process.
