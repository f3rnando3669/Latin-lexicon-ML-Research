To apply the process of **<IDAA>** (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a string **<s>**), we'll break down the steps of classification as follows:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)** implicitly or explicitly present in the text.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>) given for the Proposition.**
3. **Identify the Proof of the Reason (<PR>), if present.**
4. **Determine which, if any, defective argument type (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>) fits the string **<s>** by analyzing the provided <P>, <R>, and <PR>.**

For the given string:
> "Perhaps the most classic example of this fallacy is the argument for the existence of God. Due to the understanding of nature through science, many of the arguments that used to be used for God (or gods) were abandoned, only to be replaced with new ones, usually involving questions to which science has not definitively answered yet. The move from creationism to intelligent design is a prime example. Currently the origin of life is a popular argument for God (although a classic argument from ignorance), and an area where we very well may have a scientific answer in the next decade, at which time, the “origin of life” argument will fade away and be replaced by another, thus moving the figurative goalposts farther back as our understanding of the natural world increases. Exception: This fallacy should not be confused with an argument or set of arguments, with multiple propositions inherent in the argument. The reason for the difference between this kind of argument and the moving the goalposts fallacy, is a subtle one, but indicated by a strong initial claim (“has to be”, “must”, “required for”, etc.) that gets answered and/or what appears to be ad hoc objections that follow eventually leading to an impossible request for proof."

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The primary proposition here is: 
- "Arguments for the existence of God often move the goalposts as understanding of the natural world increases."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason presented is:
- "As science advances, arguments for God are replaced with new ones involving unresolved questions."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of the Reason (<PR>)
Proofs mentioned as support for the Reason include:
- Historical shifts from creationism to intelligent design.
- Current popularity of the origin of life argument.
- Expectation that these arguments will change again as science progresses.

### Step 4: Determine the Defective Argument Type
Analyzing the given <P>, <R>, and <PR>, we see elements of fallacious reasoning that fits with **Defects in <R> (DR)**:
- **<IR>: Inconclusive Reason**: Arguments shifting as science advances do not necessarily invalidate the original point regarding the existence of God. The example tries to invalidate each new argument without directly addressing it.

- **<FU>: Presumptuous Consensus**: Implied widely-held agreements in scientific communities that may not be universally agreed upon.

By considering the content, the most suitable classification for this argument largely falls under **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** because the examples provided only show a historical pattern without conclusively disproving the main point about God's existence. There is also a slight element of **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)** due to implied scientific consensus.

### Conclusion
The identified defective argument type for the string **<s>** is primarily <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) due to the presentation of reasons that do not definitively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition, with some elements of <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).
