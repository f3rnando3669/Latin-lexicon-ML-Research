To apply the task of identifying the type of defective argument (IDA) to the given string by decomposing it into specific steps (IDAA), we will go through a step-by-step process.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine what is being asserted or claimed in the statement.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the causal basis or reasoning provided to support the proposition.

3. **Classify the Defective Argument**: Match the identified elements with the known types of defective arguments (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) and find the best fit.

### Applying IDAA to the Given String

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - "**All the other classes will all fail it, too.**"
   - This is the main claim being made in the statement.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - "**Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess,...**"
   - This is the reasoning given to support the proposition.

3. **Classify the Defective Argument**:
   - Evaluate the logical connection between the <P> (proposition) and the <R> (reason).

#### Possible Defective Arguments

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - This involves making a broad assertion based on a limited sample or an individual case.
   - Applying it here: The statement **"Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz"** leads to the broad assertion **"all the other classes will all fail it, too."**

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - This involves claiming a complete enumeration of possibilities, but missing out on some.
   - Not directly applicable here as the argument doesn't enumerate the possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - When the reason given does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
   - In this case, the failure of three kids does not logically imply everyone else will fail.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - When the reason merely restates the proposition without providing additional support.
   - Not applicable here as the reason and proposition are distinct statements.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - When the causal basis for the <P> is weak or not compelling.
   - The performance of the three kids is not a compelling reason for the conclusion about all classes.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - Assuming something is true because it's universally agreed upon.
   - Not applicable here as there's no reference to universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
   - When ambiguous language is used in the argument.
   - Not evident in this argument.

Based on the evaluation, the defective argument type that best fits the provided string is **Generalization (<G>)**.

### Conclusion

By applying IDAA to the statement "**Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess, all the other classes will all fail it, too.**", we identify the defective argument type as **<G> - Generalization**.
