For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today," we need to classify the statement as one of the types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>. We will break down this advanced task into specific steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
A proposition is what we intend to prove. In this statement, the implied proposition seems to be: "You are not a good person."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
A reason sets forth the causal basis for the proposition. In this case, the reason given is: "You weren’t in class today."

### Step 3: Analyze the Logical Structure
Evaluate whether the reason provided conclusively establishes the truth of the proposition.

### Step 4: Identify the Type of Defect
Using the definitions provided, classify the logical fallacy present in the statement:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement does not seem to generalize from a single case to a broader population.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement does not claim to have considered all possibilities and missed some.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Consider whether the reason provided (absence from class) conclusively demonstrates the proposition (not a good person). Being absent from class one day does not conclusively establish one's moral character.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The proposition and reason do not repeat; they are different statements.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal link between not attending class and being a good person is weak. Missing a class is not a sufficient basis to judge a person's overall character.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The statement does not assume consensus but rather draws a personal conclusion.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The language does not appear to carry ambiguity in a way that misinterprets the speaker's intent.

### Step 5: Classify <s> as a Defective Argument Type
Based on the analysis, "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today" most closely fits two defective argument types:
1. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason does not conclusively prove the proposition.
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reason is not compelling enough to substantiate the proposition.

### Final Classification
The primary defect here seems to be an **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, as the absence from class does not necessarily have a direct and strong correlation to one's overall character.

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the statement "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today," we classify it as primarily <IR>.
