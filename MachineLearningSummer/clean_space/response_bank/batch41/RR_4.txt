For 
To apply <IDAA> to "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there," we will decompose the task of classifying the string into specific steps and execute those steps one by one.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
Identify the part of the argument indicating what is being claimed or intended to be proved.

**Proposition (P):** "That restaurant is popular."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
Identify the part of the argument that provides the causal basis for the Proposition.

**Reason (R):** "because everyone in town goes there."

### Step 3: Identify the Type of Defective Argument
Determine if the identified Reason <R> and Proposition <P> fall into any defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

1. **Generalization (G):** The string does not make a general assertion about all individuals based on a limited sample.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The string does not claim to present a complete list of possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason "because everyone in town goes there" does not provide a substantive or logical basis for why the restaurant is popular; it simply states a fact that everyone goes there without linking it causally to why the restaurant is good or appealing.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The Reason (R) is not merely repeating the Proposition (P) in different words; instead, it offers a different but insufficient explanation.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The Reason "because everyone in town goes there" does provide a causal basis but might not be compelling; popularity could be due to other subjective factors not detailed here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument assumes that something (the restaurant's popularity) is valid because "everyone" agrees with it, falling into the logical fallacy of appealing to common belief without substantive evidence.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language in the argument is not ambiguous; it is clear and straightforward in its terms.

### Step 4: Classify the String
Based on the analysis:

The string "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there" is best classified as <FU> because it makes an appeal to the consensus or popularity as validation of its proposition.

### Conclusion
The string "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there" is of the defective argument type:

**<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**.
