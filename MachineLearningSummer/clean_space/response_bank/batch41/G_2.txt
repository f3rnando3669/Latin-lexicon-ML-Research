To apply the process of decomposing the task of classifying the given string ("The teenagers where rude and disrespectful therefore all teenagers are rude and disrespectful.") into specific steps (IDAA), we need to break down the string into its constituent parts and identify which type of defective argument it represents.

Here are the steps for performing IDAA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The proposition states what is being asserted.
   - In this case, the proposition is: "All teenagers are rude and disrespectful."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason attempts to establish the truth of the proposition.
   - The reason provided is: "The teenagers were rude and disrespectful."

3. **Analyze the Defective Argument:**
   - Determine if the argument falls under the family of defective arguments called Defects in <P> (<DP>).
   - Check the criteria for each type of defective argument.

We'll now apply each category known as <DP> and their types to determine which one fits our given string:

### <DP> - Defects in <P>
1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - A generalization occurs when an assertion based on some part is referred to all.
   - The given string asserts that "all teenagers" are rude and disrespectful based on observation of "the teenagers" (specific ones).
   - The argument is indeed claiming a characteristic of a few (perhaps a small group of teenagers) applies to the whole group (all teenagers).

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - This doesn't seem to apply, as the argument does not concern making a false claim about the completion of enumeration possibilities.

Since the string does not appear to involve any Defects in Reason (<DR>) or Defects in Proof of Reason (<DPR>), we confirm that the given string is best classified within the family <DP>.

In conclusion, the given string "The teenagers where rude and disrespectful therefore all teenagers are rude and disrespectful." is best classified as a defective argument of type **Generalization (<G>)**.

**Final Classification (<IDA>):** <G>
