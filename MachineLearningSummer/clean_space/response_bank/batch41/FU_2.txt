For 
To apply <IDAA> to "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way", we first need to decompose the task of classifying this string as one of the defective argument types by following specific steps. Here is the decomposition (D) process applied to the classification task (IDA):

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D):

1. **Identify the Core Proposition (P)**: 
   - Understand what the main assertion or proposition (P) is in the given string.

2. **Analyze the Reason (R)**: 
   - Determine what the reason (R) is that supports or establishes the truth of the proposition (P).

3. **Categorize Defective Argument Type (DP, DR, or DPR)**:
   - Determine whether the defect lies in the proposition itself (DP), in the reason provided (DR), or in the proof of the reason (DPR).

4. **Match to Specific Defective Argument Types**:
   - Compare the characteristics of the argument to the specific defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

5. **Classify the Argument**:
   - Conclusively determine which defective argument type the string belongs to.

### Application of Decomposition (IDAA):

1. **Identify the Core Proposition (P)**:
   - The proposition (P) in the string "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way" can be summarized as:
     - "You should become part of a group or act because others are doing it."

2. **Analyze the Reason (R)**:
   - The reason (R) provided here is: "Other people are acting in the same way."

3. **Categorize Defective Argument Type (DP, DR, or DPR)**:
   - This argument falls into the category of defective argument types related to the proof of reason (DPR) because it suggests a presumptive validation based on majority opinion.

4. **Match to Specific Defective Argument Types**:
   - By understanding the context, it matches the description of presumptuous consensus where an assertion is validated based on the assumption it is universally agreed upon.

   - Specifically, this description fits <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus), which states that an assertion is assumed valid because it is believed to be universally agreed upon.

5. **Classify the Argument**:
   - The argument "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way" is classified as type <FU>.

### Conclusion:
The string "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way" is classified as a defective argument of type <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).
