For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposing into specific steps) to the task of classifying the argument provided ("It is immoral to kill an innocent human being.  Fetuses are innocent human beings.  Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses.") into one of the defective argument types:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
Identify the part of the argument that sets forth summarily what the speaker intends to prove.
- "It is immoral to kill fetuses."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
Identify the causal basis for <P> establishing the truth of what is being urged.
- "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being.  Fetuses are innocent human beings."

#### Step 3: Evaluate the Reason <R>
Determine if the reason provided (R) conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the proposition (P).

Investigate if reason contains any of the following defects:
  - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason does not conclusively prove the proposition.
  - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis submitted is not compelling.
  - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason simply repeats the proposition. 

Analysis:
- In this case, the <R> breaks down into two claims: "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being." and "Fetuses are innocent human beings."
- The argument's conclusion rests on the application of a general moral principle to a specific case.

Evaluate each part:
- "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being" is a moral statement.
- "Fetuses are innocent human beings" classifies fetuses into the category defined by the moral statement.

#### Step 4: Determine the Argument's Classification

Consider if any defective argument types fit:
- **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**: While the argument appears logically structured, one might consider this could be IR if the moral principle presented is disputable or not universally accepted, thus not conclusively demonstrating the proposition.

- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: If someone argues that the premise "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being" doesn't universally or effectively cover the inclusion of fetuses without additional supportive arguments or context, this could be seen as WCB.

- **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: This doesn't apply as the reason and proposition are not simply repetitions of each other.

The more common classification for this argument would be:
- **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**: Depending on critical analysis of whether the given moral principle ("It is immoral to kill an innocent human being") conclusively covers the specific case of fetuses without further supportive context.

#### Step 5: Final Classification

Final classification of the argument:

- The most likely classification is **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**, since the chain of reasoning depends on a moral principle that may not conclusively prove the proposition without further context or consensus.

Therefore, after applying IDAA to the task, the argument "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being.  Fetuses are innocent human beings.  Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses." can be classified as having the defective argument type **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**.
