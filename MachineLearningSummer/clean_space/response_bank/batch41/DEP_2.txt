For 
To apply \<IDAA\> to the provided string, we need to first break down the task of classifying the string into specific steps (\<D\>) and then systematically apply these steps to come to a conclusion. Here are the steps for decomposing the task of classifying the argument into the given types:

1. **Identify the Proposition (\<P\>)**: Determine the central claim that is being advanced.
2. **Identify the Reason (\<R\>)**: Determine the causal basis supporting the \<P\> (or attempting to support it).
3. **Assess the Argument Structure**:
   - Consider whether the argument is well-formed or contains defects.
4. **Classify the Defects**:
   - If any defects in the argument are present, determine to which family they belong (\<DP\>, \<DR\>, or \<DPR\>).
   - Specify the type of defect within the identified family (\<G\>, \<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<RR\>, \<WCB\>, \<FU\>, or \<DEP\>).

Now, let's apply these steps to the provided string:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\<P\>)
**Speaker 1**'s Proposition:
\[ \text{\<P\>: "We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change."} \]

**Speaker 2**'s Proposition:
\[ \text{\<P\>: "I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."} \]

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\<R\>) 
**Speaker 2**'s Reasoning:
\[ \text{\<R\>: "It’s wrong to use people."} \]

### Step 3: Assess the Argument Structure
- **Speaker 2**'s argument is reacting to **Speaker 1**'s statement claiming it is inappropriate to "use people." 
- The ethical issue raised by Speaker 2 seems to be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the term "using people" as highlighted by Speaker 1.

### Step 4: Classify the Defects

To determine if the argument contains a defect and, if so, classify it accordingly:

#### **Misunderstanding the Term "Use"**:
The primary issue with Speaker 2's argument appears to be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the term "use." Speaker 1 implies "utilizing individuals' efforts for a cause" while Speaker 2 interprets it as "exploiting people."

- This is a **Defect in Proof (\<DPR\>)** since it misinterprets the language used in the proof.

The specific defect is:
#### **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)**:
- **Example** Provided: "I want to have myself a merry little Christmas, but I refuse to do as the song suggests and make the yuletide gay. I don’t think sexual preference should have anything to do with enjoying the holiday." 

The similar ambiguity in the use of "use":

- **String**: "Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."

So, the classification under the given types is:

\[
<s> : \text{\<DEP\>}
\]

Thus, the task \<IDAA\> on the provided string indicates that the defect type in this argument is "Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)."
