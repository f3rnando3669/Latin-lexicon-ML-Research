For 
To apply **<IDAA>** to the given string "Everyone else is doing it, so should you.", we need to decompose the task of identifying the type of defective argument into specific steps and then execute these steps one by one.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Application:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - In the given string, the proposition is: "so should you."

2. **Analyze the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason in the given string is: "Everyone else is doing it."

3. **Determine if the Reason (<R>) supports the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The reason given is: "Everyone else is doing it."
   - It attempts to support the proposition that "you should do it."

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:**
   - Determine if the argument belongs to Generalization (<G>) by checking if <P> is an assertion based on a part or majority but not necessarily applicable to all:
     - This argument doesn't base the <P> on a subset or majority. Instead, it bases it on what "everyone else" is doing.

   - Determine if the argument belongs to Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>) by checking if the <P> claims complete enumeration but misses relevant possibilities:
     - This argument doesn't enumerate possibilities; it uses the behavior of others to influence action.

   - Determine if the argument belongs to Inconclusive Reason (<IR>) by checking if the <R> fails to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the <P>:
     - The argument here relies on popularity, not conclusive proof.

   - Determine if the argument belongs to Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>) by checking if <R> offers a weak causal basis:
     - The reason provided does not give a direct causal relationship to why you should also engage in the action.

   - Determine if the argument belongs to Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>) by checking if <R> is just restating <P>:
     - The reason provided doesn't just restate the proposition.

   - Determine if the argument belongs to Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>) by checking if <PR> is based on supposed unanimous agreement:
     - This argument type suggests "universal agreement" as justification: Everyone else is doing it, so you should too. This supports the idea of bandwagon or appeal to popularity.

   - Determine if the argument belongs to Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>) by checking if <PR> could be interpreted differently from the speaker's intent due to ambiguity:
     - There is no ambiguous language that alters the meaning of the message here.

    Therefore, the correct classification for the given string "Everyone else is doing it, so should you." is **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**.

### Conclusion:
After applying each step systematically, we classify the string "Everyone else is doing it, so should you." as **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**, because it leverages the idea of universal agreement or a bandwagon effect as the reason for the proposition.
