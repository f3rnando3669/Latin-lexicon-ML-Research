For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of decomposing the task of classifying a defective argument into specific steps) to the statement "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick." and determine the logical fallacy used, we'll break down the process as follows:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The proposition in the argument is "the water must have made me sick."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason given to support the proposition is "I drank bottled water and now I am sick."

3. **Analyze the Reason (<R>) for Defects:**
   - Evaluate if the reason adequately supports the proposition.
   - Assess whether the reason provides a conclusive basis for the proposition.
   - Check for common logical fallacies in the reason.

4. **Determine the Type of Defective Argument:**

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - "The water must have made me sick."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - "I drank bottled water and now I am sick."

3. **Analyze the Reason (R) for Defects:**

   - **Causal Connection Analysis:**
     - The reason establishes a temporal sequence (drinking water, then getting sick) but does not conclusively establish a causal connection.
     - There could be many other factors causing the sickness (other food or drinks consumed, environmental factors, an infection, etc.).

4. **Determine the Type of Defective Argument:**

   - Given the causal connection analysis, the argument appears to be assuming a causal relationship purely based on the sequence of events without sufficient evidence.

### Conclusion

- The defective argument type here is **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**. This is because the causal basis (drinking bottled water, then getting sick) is weak and not compelling enough to conclusively establish that the bottled water caused the sickness.

Thus, the logical fallacy used in the statement "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick." is **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
