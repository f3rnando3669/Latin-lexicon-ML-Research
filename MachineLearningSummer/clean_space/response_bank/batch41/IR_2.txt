For 
To apply IDAA (the application of deconstructing the task of classifying a string into its respective defective argument type), we need to break down the string and identify each step systematically to classify it according to the types of defective arguments: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

### Step-by-Step Process (IDAA):

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
Identify what is being claimed or asserted in the statement.

- The proposition (P) here is: "I’m not going to talk to you."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
Identify the reason given to support the assertion.

- The reason (R) provided is: "My best friend says you’re a liar."

#### Step 3: Check for Defective Arguments in Proposition (DP)
Analyze if the proposition itself contains any defects. Common defects include Generalization (G) and Incomplete Enumeration (FE).

- There is no indication of a Generalization (G) or Incomplete Enumeration (FE) in the proposition itself.

#### Step 4: Check for Defective Arguments in Reason (DR)
Analyze if the reason contains any defects. This includes Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), and Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR).

- The reason given "My best friend says you’re a liar" is not conclusively demonstrating the correctness of the proposition "I’m not going to talk to you." This suggests potential Inconclusive Reason (IR).
- Evaluate if the causal basis (saying because a friend claims you are a liar) is strong or weak. It appears to be weak since it relies on hearsay rather than any evidence. This suggests Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).

#### Step 5: Check for Defective Arguments in Proof of Reason (DPR)
Analyze if the proof of reason contains any defects such as Presumptuous Consensus (FU) or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

- There is no additional proof provided or any ambiguous language used in this statement.

### Conclusion
After breaking down the argument, we've identified the following possible defective argument types:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason does not conclusively support the assertion.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis relies on an assertion by a friend rather than robust evidence.

Thus, the classification of the string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you." can be determined as follows:
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**

Both these types are applicable, but if we need to choose one predominant type, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** would be more directly relevant as it emphasizes the lack of direct connection or evidence to support the assertion.
