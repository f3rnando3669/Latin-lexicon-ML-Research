For 
To apply the structured approach <IDAA> to the string <s>: "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding.", we'll follow the defined steps:

### Task <IDA>: Identifying the Type of Defective Argument in a String <s>

### Decomposition of <t> into Steps <D>:

#### Step 1: Understand the Argument in <s>
- The argument presented by the speaker is: "I was only driving as fast as everyone around me."
- The conclusion is: "I'm sure I wasn't speeding."

#### Step 2: Categorize the Argument Type
- Review definitions of defective argument types:
  - <G>: Generalization.
  - <FE>: False Enumeration.
  - <IR>: Inappropriate Reason.
  - <RR>: Redundant Reason.
  - <WCB>: Weak Causal Basis.
  - <FU>: False Universals.
  - <DEP>: Double-Edged Phrases.

#### Step 3: Match the Argument with a Defective Type
- Evaluate the structure and reasoning of the argument in <s> against the definitions.
- The argument is trying to justify the speaker's behavior by referencing the behavior of others.
- This reasoning shares the characteristics of **<FU> (False Universals)**, as it asserts the speaker's behavior is acceptable because it was common among others.

#### Step 4: Justify the Identification
- The phrase, "I was only driving as fast as everyone around me," appeals to the popularity or commonality of the action to validate the proposition. 
- The argument incorrectly assumes that the prevalence of speeding among others justifies the speaker not breaking the speeding law.
- This reasoning aligns with the concept of False Universals, where an action is deemed right because it is widespread or universally accepted without addressing the legality or moral correctness of the action itself.

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the given example identifies the defective argument type as **<FU> (False Universals)**.
