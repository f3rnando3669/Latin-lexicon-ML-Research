For 
Let's apply the steps of <IDAA> to the provided argument:

**Argument**: 
"Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified.
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so.
Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct?
Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran."

### Steps for <IDAA>

1. **Step 1: Read and Understand the Argument**
   - The argument involves a discussion between two speakers about the crucifixion of Jesus and the credibility of the Quran as evidence.

2. **Step 2: Identify Key Components**
   - Proposition/Claim: Jesus was not really crucified.
   - Reasoning/Evidence: 
     - The Quran says Jesus was not crucified.
     - The Quran is correct because it is the Word of God.
     - The Quran is the Word of God because God tells us so in the Quran.

3. **Step 3: Match Components to Definitions**
   - The reasoning provided is that something is true because a particular source says so, and that source is validated by referring to itself.

4. **Step 4: Determine Defective Argument Type**
   - The argument involves circular reasoning, where the proof relies on the initial assumption without providing independent validation. This matches with the definition of a defective argument type called <RR> (Redundant Reason), where the reason provided asserts the same thing as the proposition in different words.
   - Specifically:
     - "Because the Quran says so" is restated as "the Quran is the Word of God," leading back to the initial claim.
     - This is a form of circular reasoning.
   
5. **Step 5: Validate**
   - Validate the identification: The argument indeed involves circular reasoning as it uses the Quran's own assertion to prove its correctness, restating the claim in different forms without providing external validation.

Thus, the identified defective argument type for the given discussion is <RR> (Redundant Reason). The reasoning is fundamentally circular, with the conclusion and the argumentation revolving around the same point without external, independent validation.
