For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity," let's break down the task of identifying the defective argument step-by-step.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition and Reason

- **Proposition**: "Paranormal activity is real."
- **Reason**: "I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."

### Step 2: Analyze the Logical Structure

We need to determine if the structure of this argument falls into any predefined defective argument patterns.

### Step 3: Check for Specific Patterns

We'll compare the argument to the defining characteristics of each defective type.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - No, the argument does not generalize from a specific instance to a larger population.

2. **False Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - No, the argument does not list fewer or more options than actually exist.

3. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**:
   - Yes, the argument provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition. The reasoning is circular: The reason ("I experienced what I describe as paranormal activity") is essentially the same as the proposition ("Paranormal activity is real").

4. **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**:
   - Yes, the argument says the same thing as the proposition but in other words. The reason restates the proposition in a slightly different form.

5. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - No, the argument does not offer a weak causal connection, though it does have other issues.

6. **False Universals (<FU>)**:
   - No, the argument does not assert universally agreed points without proof.

7. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**:
   - No, the argument does not use statements open to dual interpretations that could potentially go against the speaker.

### Step 4: Match the Argument

Based on the analysis, the argument matches both <IR> (Inappropriate Reason) and <RR> (Redundant Reason).

### Step 5: Conclusion and Documentation

In this case, the defective argument primarily falls under <IR> and <RR>:

- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: The support provided, "I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity," does not logically justify the proposition, as it is a circular and self-referential argument.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: The reason given restates the proposition in different terms, making it a redundancy.

Thus, after applying <IDAA>, we identify that the argument type for the given example is primarily <IR> for providing an inappropriate reason and also strongly features elements of <RR> for being redundant.
