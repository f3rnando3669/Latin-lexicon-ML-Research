To apply the task of Identifying Defective Argument (<IDA>) through its decomposed steps (<IDAA>) to the statement "People either like coffee or hate it," let's proceed step-by-step:

### Steps of IDAA

1. **Step 1: Initial Classification**
   - Read the statement: "People either like coffee or hate it."

2. **Step 2: Statement Analysis**
   - Determine the logical structure: This statement is presenting a binary choice or dichotomy regarding people's preferences for coffee.
   - Identify the argument: The statement claims that people have only two possible opinions about coffeeâ€”they either like it or hate it.

3. **Step 3: Match with Definitions**
   - Compare the identified characteristics with the defect definitions:
     - **Generalization (<G>):** Does not generalize from a specific instance.
     - **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Listing fewer options than actually exist.
     - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Does not provide a mismatched reason.
     - **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Does not restate the same proposition.
     - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Does not attempt to establish a weak cause.
     - **False Universals (<FU>):** Does not assert a universally agreed point without proof.
     - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Does not use statements open to dual interpretations.

4. **Step 4: Verification**
   - Verify the match: The statement presents a false dichotomy by suggesting only two options (like or hate) when there can be neutral or mixed feelings about coffee.

5. **Step 5: Identify Type**
   - Output the matched type of defective argument: **False Enumeration (<FE>)**.

Thus, applying the decomposed steps (IDAA) to the given statement "People either like coffee or hate it" leads to the identification of this as a **False Enumeration (<FE>)** logical fallacy.
