For 
Sure, let's apply the decomposition approach (D) to identify the type of defective argument in the given string (IDAA):

### String (s):
"I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!"

### Steps to Decompose and Identify the Argument Defect (IDAA):

1. **Recognize the Argument Pattern:**
   - **Proposition:** "My 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty."
   - **Reason:** "The Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up."

2. **Determine if the Reason Logically Supports the Proposition:**
   - **Evaluation:** The reason provided is a specific instance involving the Catholic Church as an institution. However, this reason does not logically extend to implicate a specific individual member of the Church (like the neighbor mentioned) without further evidence. 

3. **Identify the Type of Faulty Reasoning:**
   - The argument is attempting to make a generalization about an individual based on a specific instance involving a larger group.
   - This matches the definition of **Generalization (G)**, which claims a general truth (or guilt in this case) based on a specific instance without sufficient evidence.

### Conclusion:
The argument presented in the string "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!" is an example of **Generalization (G)**.

By breaking down the task, we effectively identified that the argument defect in the given string is a Generalization.
