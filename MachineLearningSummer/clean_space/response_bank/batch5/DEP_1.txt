Sure, let's use the <IDAA> method to classify the argument:

### Applying <IDAA> to the Argument:

**Argument:** "I want to have myself a merry little Christmas, but I refuse to do as the song suggests and make the yuletide gay. I don't think sexual preference should have anything to do with enjoying the holiday."

#### Step 1: Parse the Argument
- **Main Proposition:** The speaker refuses to "make the yuletide gay" as suggested by the song because they believe sexual preference should not affect holiday enjoyment.
- **Structure:** The argument hinges on the phrase "make the yuletide gay" and interprets "gay" as related to sexual preference.

#### Step 2: Identify the Nature of the Claim
- This shows a misunderstanding or a dual interpretation of the word "gay." The traditional meaning in the song is "happy," but the speaker interprets it as related to sexual preference.

#### Step 3: Match the Argument to Definitions
- Based on the nature of the claim and the dual interpretation of the phrase, this argument fits the definition of **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**.

#### Step 4: Verify with Examples
- Example from <DEP>: "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."
- The provided example shows a dual interpretation based on the moral status of fetuses presented as innocent human beings.
- Similarly, the argument given uses the phrase "make the yuletide gay," which can be interpreted in two ways, potentially misaligned with the speaker's intent.

### Conclusion:
The argument "I want to have myself a merry little Christmas, but I refuse to do as the song suggests and make the yuletide gay. I don't think sexual preference should have anything to do with enjoying the holiday" falls under the classification of **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)** because it hinges on the dual interpretation of "gay."
