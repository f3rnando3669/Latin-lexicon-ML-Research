For 
To apply the task **Identify Defective Argument** (\( \langle IDA \rangle \)) and specifically decompose it into steps (\( \langle IDAA \rangle \)) using the example string "All sports car drivers are too aggressive!", let's follow the structured approach outlined above:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Step 1: Read and Comprehend the String \( \langle s \rangle \).**
   - Input string \( s \): "All sports car drivers are too aggressive!"

2. **Step 2: Identify Key Components of the Argument.**
   - Specific instance: The string generalizes the behavior of sports car drivers.
   - Keywords: "All" and "too aggressive" suggest a broad generalization.

3. **Step 3: Match the Argument's Structure to Known Defective Types.**
   - The structure involves taking a specific observation or prejudice and applying it universally to all members of a category. 
   - The use of the word "All" indicates an overgeneralization from potentially limited observations.

4. **Step 4: Verify the Match Against Definitions.**
   - Check the definition of Generalization (\( \langle G \rangle \)):
     - **Definition:** Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
     - This matches the structure found in the string "All sports car drivers are too aggressive!" because it claims that every sports car driver is aggressive based on limited evidence or observations.

5. **Step 5: Output the Identified Defective Argument Type.**
   - Given the analysis, the string corresponds to the defective argument type **Generalization** (\( \langle G \rangle \)).

### Conclusion
Upon applying \( \langle IDAA \rangle \) to the string, we identify "All sports car drivers are too aggressive!" as an example of the defective argument type \( \langle G \rangle \):

**"All sports car drivers are too aggressive!" is an example of: \( \langle G \rangle \) Generalization.**
