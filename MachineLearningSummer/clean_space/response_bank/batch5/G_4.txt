For 
To apply the method defined as <IDAA> to the statement "One of our clients doubled their conversions after changing all their landing page text to bright red. Therefore, changing all text to red is a proven way to double conversions," we will follow the detailed decomposition steps outlined in <D>.

### Steps for <D> (Decomposition of Task):

1. **Reading the Argument:**
   - "One of our clients doubled their conversions after changing all their landing page text to bright red. Therefore, changing all text to red is a proven way to double conversions."

2. **Identifying Key Clauses:**
   - Clause 1: "One of our clients doubled their conversions after changing all their landing page text to bright red."
   - Clause 2: "Therefore, changing all text to red is a proven way to double conversions."

3. **Classifying the Argument Type:**
   - Compare the identified components with definitions:
     - **Generalization (<G>)**
     - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**
     - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**
     - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**
     - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
     - **False Universals (<FU>)**
     - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**

4. **Matching Characteristics:**
   - The argument makes a broad claim based on a single specific instance (one clientâ€™s result).
   - This fits the definition of **Generalization (<G>)**, as it claims a general truth (changing all text to red will double conversions) based on a single specific instance.

5. **Verifying Consistency:**
   - The argument clearly fits the <G> criteria by making a generalized claim from a specific case without sufficient evidence to support a universal truth.

### Conclusion
By adhering to the <IDAA> approach, we systematically verify the type of defective argument in the provided statement.

**Example Argument:** "One of our clients doubled their conversions after changing all their landing page text to bright red. Therefore, changing all text to red is a proven way to double conversions."
**Identified Defective Argument Type:** <G> (Generalization)
