For 
To apply **IDAA** (the decomposition of the task of identifying defective arguments into specific steps) to the string "This legislation is sinful because it is the wrong thing to do.", we can follow the step-by-step structure provided:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for Identifying Defective Arguments

**Step 1: Understand and Define the Argument in <s>**
- **Argument in <s>**: "This legislation is sinful because it is the wrong thing to do."
- **Proposition/Claim**: This legislation is sinful.
- **Supporting Reason**: It is the wrong thing to do.

**Step 2: Examine for Features of Each Defective Argument Type**
- **Generalization (G)**: This type claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
  - Not applicable here as the argument does not generalize from a specific instance to a broader claim.

- **False Enumeration (FE)**: Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
  - Not applicable here as no options or choices are enumerated.

- **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**: Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
  - Not applicable here as the argument does not give an unrelated reason.

- **Redundant Reason (RR)**: Restates the proposition in different words without adding new information.
  - Potentially applicable here since the reason "it is the wrong thing to do" does not add any new information to the claim that the legislation is sinful.

- **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**: Offers a reason that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
  - Potentially applicable but not primarily since the issue is more about redundancy than weak causality.

- **False Universals (FU)**: Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
  - Not applicable since no universal agreement is asserted.

- **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**: Uses statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.
  - Not applicable as the statement is straightforward without dual interpretations.

**Step 3: Match the Argument to a Defective Type**
- The argument "This legislation is sinful because it is the wrong thing to do" fits the description of **Redundant Reason (RR)** because the reason provided, "it is the wrong thing to do," essentially restates the claim "sinful" without adding any new substantial content or justification.

**Step 4: Verify Consistency and Eliminate Other Types**
- **Generalization**: Not fitting, as no broad claim based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration**: Eliminate as no enumeration of options is present.
- **Inappropriate Reason**: Eliminate as the reason is not unrelated but redundant.
- **Weak Causal Basis**: Eliminate since it's more about redundancy.
- **False Universals**: Eliminate, as there's no assertion of universal agreement.
- **Double-Edged Phrases**: Eliminate since no dual interpretation exists.

**Step 5: Conclusion**
- The argument in <s> is best classified as a **Redundant Reason (RR)** because it repeats the initial claim using different words without offering a new or logical justification.

Thus, the defective argument type for "This legislation is sinful because it is the wrong thing to do." is **Redundant Reason (RR)**.
