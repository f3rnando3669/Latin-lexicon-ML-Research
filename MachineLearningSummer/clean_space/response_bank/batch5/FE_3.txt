### Application of IDAA to the Argument

**Argument**: "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."

Let's apply the decomposition steps to identify the defective argument type in the given statement.

#### Step 1: Comprehension

1.1. **Read the argument carefully**:
   - Argument: "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."

1.2. **Understand the argument's proposition and the supporting statement(s)**:
   - Proposition: The speaker posits that supporting Hillary Clinton for President is equated with believing in women's rights.
   - Supporting statement: There are only two options providedâ€”supporting Hillary Clinton for President or not believing in women's rights.

#### Step 2: Classification

2.1. **Check for Generalization (G)**:
   - Does it make a general claim based on a specific instance? No, it is not making a broad claim based on a specific observation.

2.2. **Check for False Enumeration (FE)**:
   - Does it list fewer or more options than actually exist? Yes. The argument presents a false dilemma, suggesting that there are only two mutually exclusive options when, in reality, there could be other possibilities (e.g., one could support women's rights but prefer a different candidate).

2.3. **Check for Inappropriate Reason (IR)**:
   - Does the reason provided logically support the proposition? This doesn't apply here since the problem is in the enumeration of options.

2.4. **Check for Redundant Reason (RR)**:
   - Does it restate the proposition? No, the proposition is not being restated in different words.

2.5. **Check for Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - Is the reason not compelling enough? This is not relevant in this context.

2.6. **Check for False Universals (FU)**:
   - Does it assert universally agreed points without proof? No, it's not asserting an unanalyzed universal truth but instead limiting the choices artificially.

2.7. **Check for Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**:
   - Is the statement open to dual interpretation? This doesn't seem to fit the dual interpretation criteria.

#### Step 3: Validation

3.1. **Validate the argument type identified**:
   - The argument lists fewer options than actually exist, creating a false dichotomy, which corresponds to **False Enumeration (FE)**.

#### Step 4: Conclusion

4.1. **Conclude which defective argument type <s> represents**:
   - The argument, "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights," falls under **False Enumeration (FE)**.

### Conclusion

By following the structured approach (IDAA), we identified that the argument "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" corresponds to the defective argument type **False Enumeration (FE)**.
