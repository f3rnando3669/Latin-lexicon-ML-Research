For 
Let's apply the decomposition steps of <IDAA> to the given argument string: "Vote for Smith or live through four more years of higher taxes."

### Step-by-Step Execution of <IDAA>:

**Step 1: Identify the claim type.**
   - Analyze if the argument is offering a limited number of options.
   - The argument presents a binary choice: Vote for Smith or endure higher taxes for the next four years.

**Step 2: Match the claim to a defective argument type.**
   - Check against our defective argument types to find the best fit.
   - The argument fits the pattern of **<FE> (False Enumeration)** because it implies that there are only two options (voting for Smith or facing higher taxes) without considering other possible candidates or outcomes.

### Conclusion:
Applying <IDAA> to the string "Vote for Smith or live through four more years of higher taxes," we identify that the argument type is **<FE> (False Enumeration)**.
