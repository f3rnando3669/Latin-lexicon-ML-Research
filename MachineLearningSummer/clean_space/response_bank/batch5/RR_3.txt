For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people," follow the decomposition steps:

1. **Understand the Content of <s>**:
   - The statement suggests a solution for fixing the judicial system by electing new people. 

2. **Analyze the Argument Structure**:
   - Determine the nature of the statement. It is proposing a solution to a perceived problem by making an assertion about the solution's effectiveness based solely on the action of electing new people.

3. **Map to Defective Argument Type**:
   - Here, the statement implies that merely electing new people will fix a complex problem like a broken judicial system. Without a detailed rationale or evidence to support why this specific action would address the complex issues within the system, this reasoning seems to present an Inappropriate Reason (<IR>).

4. **Verify Context**:
   - The argument does not provide a logical support that electing new people would resolve the issues in the judicial system. It lacks depth and specific details on how new elections would lead to the desired systemic improvements.

Therefore, the defective argument type for the statement "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people" is best identified as:

**<IR> (Inappropriate Reason):** The proposition of electing new people to fix a broken judicial system is not sufficiently supported by logical evidence.
