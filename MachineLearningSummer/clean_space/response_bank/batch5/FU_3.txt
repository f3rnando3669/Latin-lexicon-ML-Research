For 
To apply the task \(<IDAA>\) to the given string "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way.", we'll follow the decomposition process:

### Decomposition \(<D>\) of \(<IDA>\):
1. **Step 1: Read and analyze the given string \(<s>\).**
2. **Step 2: Compare \(<s>\) to the definitions and examples of defective argument types.**
3. **Step 3: Match \(<s>\) to the most appropriate defective argument type.**

### Applying \(<IDAA>\):
**Step 1: Read and analyze the string.**
- The string is: "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way."

**Step 2: Compare to definitions:**
- **<G>: Generalization**: Claiming a general truth based on specific instances. This doesn't quite fit since the string isn't generalizing from a specific instance.
- **<FE>: False Enumeration**: Listing fewer or more options than actually exist. This doesn't fit since there are no options being listed.
- **<IR>: Inappropriate Reason**: Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition. This string seems to be providing a reason but let’s check others first.
- **<RR>: Redundant Reason**: Saying the same thing as the proposition but in other words. This isn’t repeating the same idea.
- **<WCB>: Weak Causal Basis**: Offering a non-compelling reason. The string doesn’t provide a weak causation.
- **<FU>: False Universals**: Asserting universally agreed points without proof. This string fits this category as it relies on the idea that if others are doing something, you should too without any substantial proof or reasoning.
- **<DEP>: Double-Edged Phrases**: Using statements open to dual interpretations. This doesn’t contain dual interpretations.

**Step 3: Match to defective argument type:**
- The argument "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way." fits well with **<FU>: False Universals**.
  - This is because it relies on the assumption that one should do something simply because others are doing it, a form of bandwagon fallacy which is a type of false universal.

Therefore, the defective argument type in the given string is **<FU>: False Universals**.
