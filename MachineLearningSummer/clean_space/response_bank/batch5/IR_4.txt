Let's apply the structured decomposition steps defined in <IDAA> to the string in question to identify the defective argument type present.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

#### Step 1: Parse the string

Here's the string provided:

"Perhaps the most classic example of this fallacy is the argument for the existence of God. Due to the understanding of nature through science, many of the arguments that used to be used for God (or gods) were abandoned, only to be replaced with new ones, usually involving questions to which science has not definitively answered yet. The move from creationism to intelligent design is a prime example. Currently, the origin of life is a popular argument for God (although a classic argument from ignorance), and an area where we very well may have a scientific answer in the next decade, at which time, the “origin of life” argument will fade away and be replaced by another, thus moving the figurative goalposts farther back as our understanding of the natural world increases. Exception: This fallacy should not be confused with an argument or set of arguments, with multiple propositions inherent in the argument. The reason for the difference between this kind of argument and the moving the goalposts fallacy, is a subtle one, but indicated by a strong initial claim (“has to be”, “must”, “required for”, etc.) that gets answered and/or what appears to be ad hoc objections that follow eventually leading to an impossible request for proof. Fun Fact: The name “moving the goalposts” comes from the analogy of kicking a perfect field goal in American football, only to have the goalposts be moved on you. This would be very unfair. References: This a logical fallacy frequently used on the Internet. No academic sources could be found. Questions about this fallacy? Ask our community!"

#### Step 2: Identify the nature of the claim

The string outlines a logical fallacy known as "moving the goalposts," which describes a situation where once a particular argument is answered, the goalposts are moved to another scrutiny point, making it difficult or impossible to meet the new criteria.

#### Step 3: Match the claim to the defective argument types

Analyzing the provided definitions:

- **Generalization (<G>):** The text doesn't generalize based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>):** It doesn't list fewer or more options than exist.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** The argument discussed isn't providing an invalid reason but describes a situation of shifting criteria.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** There's no redundancy in the provided argument.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** There's no weak causal connection being argued.
- **False Universals (<FU>):** It's not asserting an unproven universal truth.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** There's no dual interpretation in this context.

None of the predefined defective argument types apply precisely because it's describing the mechanics of a fallacy rather than using a fallacious argument itself.

#### Step 4: Assign the appropriate defective argument type

Based on the content of the string, it primarily describes the concept of "moving the goalposts" rather than committing one of the outlined defective arguments. Therefore, it doesn't match any of the specific defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP> described earlier. 

### Conclusion

The string provided is an explanation of a specific logical fallacy known as "moving the goalposts." Since this fallacy is descriptive and doesn't fit one of the defined defective argument types, it cannot be classified under <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>. This indicates that not all logical fallacies might be encompassed by these categories, and the fallacy described here is specifically about shifting criteria ("moving the goalposts") rather than fitting into the provided classification scheme.
