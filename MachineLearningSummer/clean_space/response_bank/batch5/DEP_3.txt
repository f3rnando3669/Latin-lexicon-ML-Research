For 
Certainly! Let's apply the process of \(IDA\) (Identifying the type of defective argument) using the \(IDAA\) framework to the given argument.

### Argument String (\(s\))
"Speaker 1: We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change.
Speaker 2: Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."

### Steps for \(IDAA\) on \(IDA\)

1. **Step 1**: Parse the argument.
   - **Speaker 1's Premise**: "We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change."
   - **Speaker 2's Conclusion**: "I can’t be a part of this because I was always taught that it’s wrong to use people."

2. **Step 2**: Match against patterns.
   - **Speaker 2's Argument**: Speaker 2 concludes that they cannot be part of the effort due to their belief that "using people" is wrong. This conclusion is based on interpreting Speaker 1's use of "using people" in a literal sense.

3. **Step 3**: Identify the category.
   - This argument appears to be mixing two possible interpretations of "using people":
     - **Literal interpretation** (leveraging human resources).
     - **Ethical interpretation** (exploiting people).
   - This fits the pattern of Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>), where a phrase can be interpreted in two different ways, potentially misleading the listener.

4. **Step 4**: Cross-check the identification.
   - The argument relies on a dual interpretation of the phrase "using people."
   - This matches the definition of Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>).

5. **Step 5**: Output.
   - The identified defective argument type is **<DEP>**.

### Conclusion
Based on the \(IDAA\) approach, the argument made by Speaker 2 ("Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people.") is an example of **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)**. The argument exploits the dual interpretations of the phrase "using people," thereby leading to a logically defective conclusion.
