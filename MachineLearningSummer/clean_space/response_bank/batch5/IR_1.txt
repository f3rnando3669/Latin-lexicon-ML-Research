Alright, let's apply the defined steps of <IDAA> to identify the type of defective argument in the given string "Don't you want the best for your baby?".

### Application of <IDAA>:

**Step 1: Read and Understand the Argument (<RA>)**
- The argument is a question that implies that a certain action or proposition is the best choice because the speaker assumes that the listener wants the best for their baby.

**Step 2: Identify Patterns in the Argument (<IP>)**
- The pattern here involves appealing to a strong emotional sentiment (wanting the best for one's baby) but doesn't logically connect this sentiment to any specific action or proposition.

**Step 3: Match the Pattern to the Defective Argument Type (<MP>)**
- Given that the question is leveraging the emotional appeal of wanting the best for one's baby without providing a logical connection or proof, it seems to be an example of an argument providing an irrelevant reason that doesn't logically support the proposition. The proposition is assumed rather than stated, but the emotional appeal is disconnected from logical support.

**Step 4: Assign the Corresponding Argument Type (<AA>)**
- This type of argument best matches **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**. The reason given ("wanting the best for your baby") is not logically connected to any substantive argument or evidence; itâ€™s more of an emotional appeal than a reasoned argument.

### Conclusion:
- The defective argument type in the string "Don't you want the best for your baby?" is identified as **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**.
