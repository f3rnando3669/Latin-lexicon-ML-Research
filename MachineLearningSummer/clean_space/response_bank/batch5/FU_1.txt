For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of decomposition to identifying defective arguments) to the given string, "Mormonism is one of the fastest growing sects of Christianity today so that whole story about Joseph Smith getting the golden plates that, unfortunately, disappeared back into heaven, must be true!", we can follow these steps:

1. **Task Description (IDA):**
   - Identify the type of defective argument given the string.

2. **Decomposition (D):**
   - a. Read and understand the given string.
   - b. Identify key components and claims within the string.
   - c. Compare the identified components against the definitions of defective argument types.
   - d. Determine which argument type best fits the given string.

3. **Application (IDAA):**

   **Step 1:** Parse the string and extract the key claim or argument.
   - Given string: "Mormonism is one of the fastest growing sects of Christianity today so that whole story about Joseph Smith getting the golden plates that, unfortunately, disappeared back into heaven, must be true!"

   **Step 2:** Analyze the extracted claim.
   - Key claim: The growth of Mormonism as a sect is being used to validate the story about Joseph Smith and the golden plates.

   **Step 3:** Compare with definitions of defective argument types:
   - **<G> Generalization:** Not applicable here as this is not a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - **<FE> False Enumeration:** Not applicable here as this argument does not involve listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - **<IR> Inappropriate Reason:** Somewhat relevant because popularity growth is not a logical proof for the verity of religious claims.
   - **<RR> Redundant Reason:** Not applicable here as it does not simply restate the proposition.
   - **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis:** Similar, but the primary fallacy relates to the assertion based on popularity.
   - **<FU> False Universals:** Most relevant as it suggests universally accepted points without adequate proof. It implies that the popularity of the religion validates its foundational story.
   - **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases:** Not applicable here as it doesn't use dual interpretations.

   **Step 4:** Conclude the argument type.
   - The provided string is an example of **False Universals (FU)** because it implies that the broad acceptance or growth popularity of Mormonism serves as validation for the historical accuracy of its foundational story without proper evidence.

By systematically breaking down the task, we've determined that the argument in the string "Mormonism is one of the fastest growing sects of Christianity today so that whole story about Joseph Smith getting the golden plates that, unfortunately, disappeared back into heaven, must be true!" is an example of **<FU> False Universals**.
