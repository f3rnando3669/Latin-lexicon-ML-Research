### Task Decomposition for Identifying Defective Arguments (<IDAA>)

Let's apply the structured steps of <IDAA> to analyze the given string: "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far."

#### Step 1: Identify and Clarify the Proposition
Extract the main proposition or primary claim from the given string. In this case:
   - **Proposition**: "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far."

#### Step 2: Categorize the Type of Argument
Determine which category the argument falls into based on the definitions provided:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
   - **False Universals (<FU>)**
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**

#### Step 3: Compare the Proposition and Reason
Evaluate the relationship between the proposition and the provided reasoning:
   - The claim suggests a causal relationship between "liberals taking political correctness too far" and "Donald Trump getting elected."

#### Step 4: Determine the Specific Fallacy
Identify the specific type of defective argument based on the analysis:

- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The given argument is claiming a cause-and-effect relationship without sufficiently compelling evidence to support it. It simplifies the complex phenomenon of an election outcome to a single reason, which is unlikely to be a sufficient or comprehensive explanation.

### Conclusion
Based on the steps above, "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far" is an example of a **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.

It suggests a direct causation without providing compelling evidence or considering the multifaceted nature of electoral politics, thus failing to convincingly support the proposition.
