For 
To apply the decomposition of the task <IDA> (Identifying the type of defective argument <s> has) in the context of the provided statement, we will follow the systematic steps outlined in <IDAA>. Here's the argument we will analyze:

> "I see nobody on the road," said Alice.  
> "I only wish I had such eyes," the king remarked...  
> "To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why it's as much as I can do to see real people, by this light."

### Step-by-Step <IDAA>:

1. **Understand the Argument**:
   - Alice claims that she sees "nobody" on the road.
   - The King misinterprets Alice's statement as if she has the ability to see an entity named "Nobody".

2. **Identify Key Characteristics**:
   - Core claim by Alice: There is no one on the road (implicitly claiming the non-existence of people on the road).
   - Supporting statements by the King: He remarks on the fantastical ability to see an entity named "Nobody" at a distance.

3. **Match with Defective Argument Types**:
   - **<G> (Generalization)**: This is not a generalization based on a specific instance.
   - **<FE> (False Enumeration)**: No enumeration of options is present.
   - **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**: The King’s reasoning doesn't logically pertain to the proposition Alice made, indicating some level of inappropriate reasoning due to misunderstanding. However, this is not the most fitting classification.
   - **<RR> (Redundant Reason)**: The statements aren’t redundant but involve a misunderstanding. This does not fit.
   - **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**: There’s no causal relationship implied here.
   - **<FU> (False Universals)**: The argument doesn’t assert a universally agreed point without proof.
   - **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)**: This involves statements open to dual interpretations.

4. **Classify the Argument**:
   - The argument most fittingly classifies under **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)**.

5. **Provide Explanation**:
   - The statement "I see nobody on the road," said Alice:
     The King’s response, misinterpreting "nobody" as an entity named "Nobody,” opens the phrase to a dual interpretation. Alice meant that there is no person on the road, while the King comments as if "Nobody" is a visible entity. This humor arises from the dual meanings of the word "Nobody."

Therefore, the argument provided fits best under **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)** because of the humorous misinterpretation arising from the phrase "nobody" being taken to mean an entity named "Nobody" rather than the absence of anyone.
