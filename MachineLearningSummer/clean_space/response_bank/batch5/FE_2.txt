For 
Let's apply the decomposition steps to identify the defective argument type for the given string:

String: "The museum's new gemstones and precious minerals exhibit needs more security guards. If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal a piece of the exhibit."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of Identifying Defective Argument (<IDAA>)

1. **Understand the Argument**:
   - The main claim is that the museumâ€™s exhibit needs more security guards.
   - Additionally, it provides a conditional statement implying that disagreement suggests an intent to steal.

2. **Identify Keywords and Structure**:
   - Key phrases include "If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal."
   - This suggests a binary choice: either agree with the security increase or be suspected of theft.

3. **Match Argument Type**:
   - The constructed argument provides only two options and excludes other alternate possibilities (e.g., disagreeing for reasons unrelated to theft, such as budget constraints or different security strategies).

4. **Label the Argument**:
   - Given the specific characteristics of the argument, it aligns with **False Enumeration** (<FE>), because it limits the options to just two and ignores other valid possibilities.

### Conclusion
The defective argument type for the string "The museum's new gemstones and precious minerals exhibit needs more security guards. If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal a piece of the exhibit." is identified as **False Enumeration** (<FE>).
