For 
Sure! Let's apply the decomposed steps (<D>) for identifying the type of defective argument (<IDA>) in the string <s> provided:

### Steps for <IDAA>
1. **Step 1: Understand the Proposition**
   - **Proposition:** Visiting the doctor was worth the $200 visit fee.

2. **Step 2: Identify Supporting Reason or Evidence**
   - **Evidence:** After talking to the doctor, the headache started to subside, and the person was all better the next day.

3. **Step 3: Match the Pattern**
   - **<G>:** Is the argument generalizing from a specific instance? No, it doesn't generalize but reflects on a specific event.
   - **<FE>:** Does <s> enumerate options? No, it does not list multiple options.
   - **<IR>:** Does the supporting reason logically support the proposition? Let's examine further.
   - **<RR>:** Is the reason redundant? No, it is not just rephrasing the proposition. 
   - **<WCB>:** Is the causal link weak or unconvincing? Yes, the link between talking to the doctor and the headache subsiding could be seen as weak or coincidental.
   - **<FU>:** Does the argument assume universal agreement without proof? No, it discusses a personal experience.
   - **<DEP>:** Is the statement open to dual interpretations? No, it is quite specific in its interpretation.

4. **Step 4: Determine Defective Argument Type**
   - The most fitting match is **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**. The causal relationship between talking to the doctor and the headache subsiding is weak and possibly coincidental.

5. **Step 5: Validate and Confirm**
   - Confirmed. The statement attributes the subsiding of a headache and subsequent recovery to talking with the doctor, which implies a weak causal connection and fits the definition of a Weak Causal Basis.

### Conclusion
The defective argument type for the string "I had a real bad headache, then saw my doctor. Just by talking with him, my headache started to subside, and I was all better the next day. It was well worth the $200 visit fee." is **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**.
