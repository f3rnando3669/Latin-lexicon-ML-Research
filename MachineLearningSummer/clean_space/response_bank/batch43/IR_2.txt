For 
Let's proceed step by step as outlined in the definitions to classify the string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you."

### Step 1: Apply <IDFA> to classify the string as a family of defective arguments of type <DP>, <DR>, <DPR>.

1. **Analyze the argument structure:**
   - **Proposition (<P>):** "I’m not going to talk to you."
   - **Reason (<R>):** "My best friend says you’re a liar."

2. **Determine the family of defective arguments:**
   - The reason (<R>) provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (<P>). The assertion that the best friend calls someone a liar is not a sufficient causal basis for deciding not to talk to that person.
   
   Based on this analysis, the argument appears to involve <DR> (Defects in Reason).

### Step 2: Apply <IDA> to classify the string as a defective argument of type <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

1. **Check within <DR> types:**
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason does not directly support the proposition, as labeling someone a liar based on hearsay does not conclusively prove the person should be avoided.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal basis provided (the friend's assertion) is weak and not compelling for the proposition (deciding not to talk to someone).
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Not applicable in this case as the reason is not a mere repetition of the proposition.

2. **Narrow down to the most fitting type:**
   - Despite both <IR> and <WCB> appearing relevant, <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) is the more accurate classification because the reason provided is an assertion without sufficient proof; it fails to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.

### Conclusion:

Applying the decomposition of task <IDAA>, the string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you." is classified as follows:

- **Family of defective arguments:** <DR> (Defects in Reason)
- **Type of defective argument:** <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)

Hence, the argument "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you." is identified as having an inconclusive reason where the causal basis is weak and insufficiently supports the proposition.
