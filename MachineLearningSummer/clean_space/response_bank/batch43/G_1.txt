For 
To apply the procedure defined by <IDAA> to the given string, "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!", we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Decompose the task <t> into specific steps:
1. **Classify** whether the string fits into the family of defective arguments: <DP>, <DR>, or <DPR>.
2. **Identify** the specific type of defective argument within the determined family.

### Step 2: Apply the first step to classify the string into <DP>, <DR>, or <DPR>:
- The proposition (P) in the given string is an assertion about guilt based on a general premise about the Catholic Church.
- The Reason (R) appears to rely on an association or generalization about the Catholic Church to conclude the guilt of an individual.

From this, it seems like the defect is primarily in the proposition (P), given that the conclusion about the neighborâ€™s guilt is based on an overgeneralization.

Therefore, the string falls into the family of defective arguments in <DP>.

### Step 3: Identify the specific defective argument type (e.g., <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>) within <DP>:
- The argument makes a generalization about a vast group (Catholic Church) and then applies this generalization to an individual without sufficient evidence specific to that individual.

This type of defective argument is known as a **Generalization** (<G>).

### Conclusion:
The string "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!" is classified as:
1. Type: <DP> (Defects in <P>)
2. Specific Type: <G> (Generalization)

Thus, by applying <IDAA> step-by-step, we classified the string under the category of faulty reasoning due to overgeneralization.
