For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given argument "Farmer McDonald: Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain. I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature.", we will break the process down step by step.

### Step 1: Classify the Argument as One of the Families of Defective Arguments (<IDFA>)

1. **Identify if the argument has a defect in Proposition (<DP>):**
   - Does the proposition make a generalized assertion based on insufficient evidence? 
   - Does it fail to enumerate all possibilities?

2. **Identify if the argument has a defect in Reason (<DR>):**
   - Does the reason fail to conclusively support the proposition?
   - Is the causal basis weak or insufficient?
   - Does the reason simply restate the proposition?

3. **Identify if the argument has a defect in Proof of Reason (<DPR>):**
   - Is there an assumption of consensus that is not justified?
   - Is there ambiguous language?

**Analysis of the provided argument:**

- Proposition (P): "Mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature."
- Reason (R): "Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain."

The main claim or proposition is that mankind is meddling with nature in a negative way. The reason provided is that the power plant installation has coincided with the absence of rain.

### Step 2: Determine the Type of Defective Argument (<DR> identified in step 1)

Given the analysis, it seems the primary issue is the Reason (R):

- The causal basis that the new power plant caused the lack of rain is weak and not substantiated.

Therefore, we classify the argument as having a defect in Reason (<DR>).

Now we need to identify the specific type of defect in Reason (<IDA>):

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument fails to conclusively link the power plant and lack of rain.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The provided causal link (power plant causing no rain) is weak.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Doesn't apply since it is not simply repeating the proposition.

The argument fits <WCB> because the causal basis that the power plant is impacting the rain is weak and lacks compelling evidence.

### Step 3: Decomposition and Detailed Classification (<IDAA> Application)

1. **Decompose and identify the defective family (<IDFA>):**
   - The family of defective argument identified is <DR> (Defects in Reason).

2. **Classify the specific type within the family (<IDA>):**
   - The specific type of defect in Reason is <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).

### Summary

The argument "Farmer McDonald: Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain. I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature." is a defective argument of type <DR>, specifically <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
