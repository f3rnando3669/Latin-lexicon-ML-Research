Sure, let's apply the structured approach of \(IDAA\) to analyze the statement "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people." and classify the logical fallacy involved.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition <D>:

1. **Apply <IDFA>: Classify the statement within the families of defective arguments (\(DP\), \(DR\), \(DPR\))**
2. **Apply <IDA>: Classify the statement within the specific types of defective arguments (\(G\), \(FE\), \(IR\), \(RR\), \(WCB\), \(FU\), \(DEP\))**

### Step 1: Apply <IDFA>

1. **Determine if the statement has a Defect in Proposition (\(DP\)):**
    - Proposition (\(P\)): "We need to fix our broken judicial system."
    - We need to check if the proposition (\(P\)) is defective.

    - **Generalization (G)**: The proposition does not appear to be a generalization about a group of people or a majority, so it doesn't seem to fit \(G\).
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement doesn't claim to have a complete enumeration of possibilities, so it doesn't fit \(FE\).

2. **Determine if the statement has a Defect in Reason (\(DR\)):**
    - Reason (\(R\)): "by electing new people."
    - We need to check if the reason (\(R\)) is defective.

    - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Electing new people does not conclusively demonstrate that fixing the judicial system would occur. This is a plausible option to consider.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The reason given might not be compelling enough to establish the cause-effect relationship. This is also worth considering.
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason provided doesnâ€™t merely repeat the proposition, so it doesn't fit \(RR\).

3. **Determine if the statement has a Defect in Proof of Reason (\(DPR\)):**
    - Proof of Reason (\(PR\)): Not explicitly provided in this statement.
    - We need to check if there's an assumed proof or ambiguous language.

    - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument does not appeal to a consensus or universal agreement, so it doesn't fit \(FU\).
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The argument doesn't seem to use ambiguous language either.

### Step 2: Apply <IDA>

Based on our analysis so far, the statement could potentially have a Defect in Reason (\(DR\)) specifically involving an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** or **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason "by electing new people" does not necessarily follow that doing so will definitively fix the judicial system. It's a common logical fallacy known as a Non Sequitur, where the conclusion does not follow logically from the premises.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal link provided ("by electing new people") is not strong enough to support the proposition that it will fix the judicial system. The reasoning doesn't provide a compelling causal basis.

### Conclusion

Upon careful analysis, the statement "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people." contains a defective argument primarily categorized under **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

The analysis proceeds as follows:
- Step 1: Classified the family as \(\text{Defect in Reason (DR)}\).
- Step 2: Identified the specific defect type within \(DR\) as \(\text{Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)}\).

So, "This logical fallacy is called Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)."
