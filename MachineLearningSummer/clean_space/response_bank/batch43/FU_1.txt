For 
Let's apply the process as described through the defined steps:

### Step 1: Apply <IDFA> (classifying the string as a family of defective arguments)

1. **Identify the family of defective arguments:** We need to determine if the argument falls under the family of defective arguments <DP>, <DR>, or <DPR>.

Given the statement: "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong."

- The argument appeals to the popularity of Verizon by stating that a large number of people use it.
- It assumes that because many people use Verizon, it must be a good choice.
- This suggests an appeal to consensus or popularity.

This aligns with the family of defective arguments under <DPR> (Defects in Proof of Reason):
- We classify this argument under <DPR> because it is trying to establish proof for its reason based on consensus.

### Step 2: Apply <IDA> (classifying the string as a specific type of defective argument within the identified family)

2. **Classify the specific type of defective argument:** Now, we need to classify the defective argument type within the <DPR> family.

Given the identified family <DPR>:
- We need to decide between the two types in <DPR>: <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus) and <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use).

- "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong." uses the popularity of Verizon (1 billion users) as proof for the proposition.
- It assumes that because a large number of people agree or use it, the proposition must be correct without addressing other substantive reasons for choosing Verizon beyond its popularity.

This matches <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):
- The argument assumes consensus (popularity) and takes it as proof of proposition accuracy.

### Conclusion:
The string “Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong.” is classified as follows:

**Family of defective arguments:** <DPR> (Defects in Proof of Reason)

**Specific type of defective argument:** <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)

Thus, applying **<IDAA>** to “Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong.” results in:

**Classification:** **<DPR>** family, specifically **<FU>** (Presumptuous Consensus).
