To apply the process of IDAA to the statement "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today." we will decompose the task into specific steps as follows:
 
### Step 1: Identify the Family of Defective Argument (IDFA)
First, we classify the string as belonging to one of the families of defective arguments: <DP>, <DR>, or <DPR>.

#### Analysis:
1. **Proposition (<P>)**: "I thought you were a good person" – This is the main assertion.
2. **Reason (<R>)**: "you weren’t in class today" – The statement provides the causal basis.
  
Given that the statement links the absence in class (reason) with the assertion of not being a good person (proposition), we need to evaluate the causal basis (reason) providing support for the proposition.

Since the reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the assertion, it seems to fall under the family of defective arguments concerning reasons.

Thus, we conclude it belongs to:
- **<DR>: Defects in <R>**

### Step 2: Identify the Specific Type of Defective Argument (IDA)
Second, we classify the string into one of the defective argument types within the identified family (<IR>, <WCB>, or <RR>).

#### Analysis of Argument Type:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided ("you weren’t in class today") does not conclusively demonstrate that the person is not good.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis (absence in class) is not compelling enough to support the assertion.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The reason does not just restate the proposition, so <RR> does not apply.

Given that the provided reason is not conclusive and does not logically or necessarily follow that the person’s absence in class makes them a bad person, it indicates that the causal basis is insufficient.

Thus, we classify it as:
- **<IR>: Inconclusive Reason**

### Summary:
Applying IDAA to "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today." we decompose and identify it as follows:
- **<IDFA>**: \(\textbf{<DR>}\) (Defects in Reason)
- **<IDA>**: \(\textbf{<IR>}\) (Inconclusive Reason)

Therefore, the final classification of the argument is:
**<DR>: <IR>**
