Alright, let's apply <IDAA> to the given statement "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being.  Fetuses are innocent human beings.  Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses." by decomposing it into specific steps.

### Step 1: **Apply <IDFA> to classify the family of defective arguments**

<s> = "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being.  Fetuses are innocent human beings.  Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."

First, we need to determine which family of defective arguments this string falls into: <DP>, <DR>, or <DPR>.

- **Defects in Proposition (<DP>)**: Examines whether the initial proposition (P) has inherent flaws.
- **Defects in Reason (<DR>)**: Examines whether the reasoning (R) established to support the proposition (P) is faulty.
- **Defects in Proof (<DPR>)**: Examines whether the proof given (PR) to support the reason (R) is problematic.

In this case, the statement is making a proposition and providing reasons to support it. The structure follows a chain of logic, so it seems more relevant to focus on potential issues in the reasoning.

### Step 2: **Apply <IDA> to classify the specific types of defective arguments**

Since we identified potential defects in the reasoning, we should now classify <s> under the relevant subtypes of defective arguments within <DR>:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: When the reason (R) does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition (P).
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: When the causal basis provided (R) is not compelling.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: When the reason (R) is essentially just restating the proposition (P) without providing distinct support.

Let's analyze the given argument:

1. **Proposition (P)**: "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being."
2. **Reason (R)**: "Fetuses are innocent human beings."
3. **Conclusion**: "Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."

Here, the reasoning seems to be that since fetuses fall under the category of innocent human beings, Proposition (P) applies to them, leading to the conclusion.

Upon closer examination, it appears that the argument does not present an independent reason that directly supports (P) but rather assumes that (P) is inherently applicable to the case of fetuses.

This type of reasoning fits under **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)** because the provided reason (R) merely reiterates what is already implied by (P) without substantial new information or evidence.

**Conclusion:**
The given statement "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being.  Fetuses are innocent human beings.  Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses." is classified as a defective argument of type **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**, which belongs to the family of **Defects in Reason (<DR>)**.
