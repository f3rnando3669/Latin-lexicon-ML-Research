For 
To apply <IDAA> to "In the race for mayor, Lara says a vote for her opponent will lead to you losing your job. What fallacy has she committed?", we will follow the steps of decomposing the task of classifying the string into specific steps and then classifying it accordingly.

Step 1: Decompose the Task (<D> applied to <IDFA> followed by <IDA>)

1. **Decomposition:** 
   - Step 1.1: Identify if the argument belongs to a family of defective arguments (<DP>, <DR>, <DPR>).
   - Step 1.2: Classify the specific type of defective argument within the identified family (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>).

Step 2: Identify Family (<DP>, <DR>, <DPR>)

- The statement made by Lara is "a vote for her opponent will lead to you losing your job." This statement is asserting a consequence without a thorough basis, implying a forced choice between two options and not recognizing other possibilities or nuances.
- Given this analysis, this defective argument seems to fall under the family of defective arguments concerning the Proposition (<DP>), as it involves a potential flaw in the complete enumeration or presentation of possibilities in the proposition.

So, it likely falls under <DP> (Defects in <P>).

Step 3: Classify the Specific Type of Defective Argument (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>)

- The specific defect here is that it simplifies the situation into a binary choice and misses out on other pertinent possibilities (i.e., there could be other outcomes than just "you will lose your job" if someone else wins).
- This is known as Incomplete Enumeration.

Thus, the specific type of defective argument is <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration).

Conclusion:

The fallacy committed by Lara in the statement "In the race for mayor, Lara says a vote for her opponent will lead to you losing your job." is classified as:
- **Family of defective argument**: <DP> (Defects in <P>)
- **Specific type**: <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)

Therefore, applying <IDAA> to the given sentence, the fallacy Lara has committed is Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>).
