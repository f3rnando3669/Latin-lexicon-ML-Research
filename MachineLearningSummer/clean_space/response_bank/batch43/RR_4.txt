For 
To apply <IDAA> to the argument "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there," let's break this down step by step.

1. **Classify \( s \) as a family of defective arguments of type \( <DP> \), \( <DR> \), \( <DPR> \) (this is \( <IDFA> \)):**

   - **Proposition \( <P> \):** "That restaurant is popular."
   - **Reason \( <R> \):** "Because everyone in town goes there."

   Here, we need to assess whether \( <P> \) and \( <R> \) fit into any defective argument families \( <DP> \), \( <DR> \), or \( <DPR> \).

   - The reason \( <R> \) "Because everyone in town goes there" seems to be asserting a causal relationship that might be suspect. It seems more related to \( <DR> \) since it is a defect in reasoning about the causality.
   - Thus, the argument appears to fall under the family \( <DR> \).

2. **Classify \( s \) as a defective argument of type \( <G> \), \( <FE> \), \( <IR> \), \( <RR> \), \( <WCB> \), \( <FU> \), or \( <DEP> \) (this is \( <IDA> \)):**

   - Now that we have identified \( <DR> \), we need to determine which specific type within \( <DR> \) it is. Let's evaluate:

     - **Inconclusive Reason \( <IR> \):** Would apply if the reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis \( <WCB> \):** Would apply if the reason does not provide a compelling causal basis for the proposition.
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition \( <RR> \):** Would apply if the reason is merely a repetition of the proposition stated in different words.

     The reason given ("Because everyone in town goes there") is supposed to explain why the restaurant is popular. However, it is more an appeal to popularity rather than a compelling causal basis. It makes an assumption that since everyone goes there, it must indeed be popular, but this does not actually explore *why* it is popular (e.g., quality of food, service, etc.).

   - This leads us to classify it as \( <FU> \) (Presumptuous Consensus). It falls under \( <FU> \) because it presumes that the popularity is validated simply by the claim that "everyone in town goes there." It assumes a consensus without addressing the actual merit that might make the restaurant popular.

Therefore, the application of \( <IDAA> \) to "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there" results in the classification:

- **Family of defective arguments \( <DR> \):** Defects in Reason.
- **Type of defective argument \( <FU> \):** Presumptuous Consensus.
