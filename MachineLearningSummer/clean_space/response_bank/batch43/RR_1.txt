For 
To apply <IDAA> (which involves decomposing the task and then classifying the defects in the argument), we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Apply <IDFA> to classify the family of the defective argument.

Given argument: "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** "Paranormal activity is real."
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** "I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."

Now, we need to classify <R> to determine whether it is a defective argument related to <P>:

- **Does the Reason (<R>) belong to any defective argument in <DP> (Defects in Proposition)?**
  - No, the proposition itself does not seem generalized or based on incomplete enumeration.
  
- **Does the Reason (<R>) belong to any defective argument in <DR> (Defects in Reason)?**
  - There might be an issue here. The reason provided ("I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity") does not conclusively prove the proposition ("Paranormal activity is real").
  - This seems like an inconclusive reason where the personal experience does not conclusively prove the general claim.

Thus, the defective argument belongs to the family of **<DR> (Defects in Reason)**.

### Step 2: Apply <IDA> to classify the defective argument specifically.

Since the argument falls under <DR>, let's classify it among the types within <DR>:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** <R> does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of <P>.
   - The reason based on personal experience does not provide sufficient proof for the claim that paranormal activity is universally real.

2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** <R> is weak if the causal basis for <P> is not compelling.
   - The personal experience provided as a reason might not be compelling enough to support the claim.

3. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** <R> repeats <P>.
   - This does not seem to be a repetition of the proposition.

Based on the argument given, the most fitting classification is:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason ("I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity") does not provide conclusive evidence for the general proposition ("Paranormal activity is real").

Thus, the given argument is classified as **<DR>, specifically <IR>**.

### Conclusion
Using <IDAA>, we decomposed the task into identifying the defective argument family first and then specifying the exact type of defect. The final classification of the argument "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity." is:

- **Family:** <DR> (Defects in Reason)
- **Type:** <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)
