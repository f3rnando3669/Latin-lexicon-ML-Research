For 
To apply the classification process <IDAA> to the provided argument "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess all the other classes will all fail it, too.", let's break down the process step by step:

### Step 1: Apply <IDFA> to Classify the String <s> as a Family of Defective Arguments

#### Analysis:
The given argument makes a broad claim about the performance of all other classes based on a small sample size from one class.

1. **Defects in Proposition (<DP>)**:
   - This family includes defects that are specifically related to the proposition statement.

2. **Defects in Reason (<DR>)**:
   - This family includes defects related to the reasoning or causal basis for the proposition.

3. **Defects in Proof (<DPR>)**:
   - This family includes defects in the proof or justification backing the reasoning.

### Conclusion for Step 1:
The argument's flaw lies in the proposition's broad generalization from a small sample size to the entire population. Hence, it belongs to the family of defect arguments called **Defects in Proposition (<DP>)**.

### Step 2: Apply <IDA> to Classify the Defective Argument Type Within <DP>

#### Types within <DP>:
1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The proposition generalizes from a single instance or subset to an entire group.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The proposition claims to present all possible options but omits some relevant ones.

#### Analysis for Step 2:
- The proposition "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess all the other classes will all fail it, too." is a clear case of generalization. It makes a broad assertion regarding the performance of all other classes based on the performance of three students in one particular class.

### Conclusion for Step 2:
The specific type of defective argument within the family <DP> is **Generalization (<G>)**.

### Final Conclusion through <IDAA>:
Given the steps above, the string "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess all the other classes will all fail it, too." is classified as follows:

- **Family of Defective Arguments (<IDFA>):** Defects in Proposition (<DP>)
- **Specific Defective Argument Type (<IDA>):** Generalization (<G>)

Thus, the argument is identified as a defective argument of type **<G>** under the family **<DP>**.
