For 
To apply IDAA to the string "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far," we will follow the decomposition of the task into specific steps, which include classifying the string into a family of defective arguments (IDFA) and then identifying the specific type of defective argument (IDA).

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D)

**Step 1: Classify into Family of Defective Arguments (IDFA)**

Identify whether the string "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far" falls into the family of Defects in Proposition (\<DP\>), Defects in Reason (\<DR\>), or Defects in Proof of Reason (\<DPR\>).

#### Classification into Family (IDFA):

1. **Analyze the Proposition (P) and Reason (R):**
   - Proposition \(P\): Donald Trump got elected.
   - Reason \(R\): Because liberals took political correctness too far.

2. **Identify the Defective Aspect:**
   - If the problem lies in establishing or asserting the main proposition, it would be in \(DP\).
   - If the problem lies in the reason provided to support the proposition, it would be in \(DR\).
   - If the problem lies in the proof of the reason, it would be in \(DPR\).

Given this analysis, the statement seems to suggest a causal relationship (reason) that is potentially weak or insufficient. Thus, it likely falls under **Defects in Reason (DR)**.

**Conclusion of Step 1:**
The family of defective arguments for the given string is **\<DR\>**.

**Step 2: Classify into Specific Type of Defective Arguments (IDA)**

Now, identify the specific type of defective argument within the family of Defects in Reason (\<DR\>):

#### Classification into Specific Type (IDA):

1. **Identify Candidate Types:**
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis provided for the proposition is weak.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason is just a repetition of the proposition.

2. **Match the String to the Appropriate Type:**
   - The proposition ("Donald Trump got elected") and the reason ("liberals took political correctness too far") do not conclusively demonstrate a direct causal relationship. This suggests a weak or insufficient causal basis.
   - There is an attempt to link a broad social trend ("political correctness") to a complex political outcome (Trump's election), which is not fully justified by the provided reason.

Therefore, this argument seems to fall most clearly under **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** due to the weak connection between the reason provided and the proposition.

**Conclusion of Step 2:**
The specific type of defective argument for the given string is **\<WCB\>** (Insufficient Causal Basis).

### Final Classification (IDAA)
Combining both steps:

1. **Family of Defective Arguments:** **\<DR\>**
2. **Specific Type of Defective Argument:** **\<WCB\>**

**Full Application of IDAA:**
The argument "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far" is classified as a defective argument of type **\<DR, WCB\>** under IDAA.
