To apply IDAA (the application of decomposing the task of identifying a family of defective arguments followed by identifying the specific type) to the string provided, we'll follow the steps systematically.

1. **Applying IDFA - Identify the family of defective arguments:**

    The string discusses logical fallacies, specifically focusing on arguments used for the existence of God and how they change over time (i.e., "moving the goalposts"). This falls under the category of defective arguments.

2. **Determining the family:**
    
    - **Defects in Proposition (<DP>):** Not applicable here as there isn’t a specific proposition and defect according to the definitions provided.
    
    - **Defects in Reason (<DR>):** The string questions the reasons provided in the context of arguments for God’s existence over time.
    
    - **Defects in Proof (<DPR>):** Not applicable as this isn't directly dealing with the proof of reason, but rather the changing nature of arguments.

    Since the primary context is about reasons changing over time which leads us to potentially consider weak or inconclusive reasons, we determine that it belongs to the family:
    - **<DR> - Defects in Reason**

3. **Applying IDA - Identify the specific type:**
    
    Given that it's under Defects in Reason, we need to classify it further under:
    - **<IR> - Inconclusive Reason:** This involves reasons that don’t conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
    
    - **<WCB> - Insufficient Causal Basis:** This involves a weak causal basis not being compelling.
    
    - **<RR> - Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** This involves repetition without new reasoning.

    Among these, the correct classification appears to be:
    - **<IR> - Inconclusive Reason**

    The given string argues that arguments for the existence of God often shift to new grounds as science progresses, which doesn’t provide conclusive reasoning but rather shifts positions when challenged.

So, our decomposition confirms that the provided string can be categorized under:
- **Family of defective arguments:** <DR> - Defects in Reason
- **Specific type of defective argument:** <IR> - Inconclusive Reason

This step-by-step application of IDAA correctly identifies and classifies the defect in the argument.
