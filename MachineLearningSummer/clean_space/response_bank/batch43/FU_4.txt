For 
Let's apply the process of identifying and classifying the given string "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" according to the definition of <IDAA>.

### Step 1: Perform <IDFA>
**Task: Classify the argument family of defective arguments: <DP>, <DR>, <DPR>.**

We need to determine if the argument falls into:
- **<DP> (Defects in Proposition)**
- **<DR> (Defects in Reason)**
- **<DPR> (Defects in Proof of Reason)**

Here, the string "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" suggests that the argument relies on the consensus of others to validate a proposition. This corresponds to a defect in the proof of reason since it assumes something to be true or valid on the ground of presumed consensus. This class of argument fits more with <DPR> due to its reliance on the questionable consensus.

**Result of <IDFA>:** <DPR>

### Step 2: Perform <IDA>
**Task: Classify the argument type: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>.**

Now that we know the argument belongs to the family <DPR> (Defects in Proof of Reason), we look for specific types within this family. The relevant defective argument types under <DPR> are:

- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**
- **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**

The statement "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" clearly hinges on the idea that because something is popularly done, it is therefore correct or should be done, which is a classic example of **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**.

**Result of <IDA>:** <FU>

### Summary

**Complete Classification:** The string "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" is classified as <DPR> (Defects in Proof of Reason) of type <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).

This is the application of **<IDAA>** to the given argument:

1. Identify the family: **<DPR>**.
2. Identify the exact type within the family: **<FU>**.
