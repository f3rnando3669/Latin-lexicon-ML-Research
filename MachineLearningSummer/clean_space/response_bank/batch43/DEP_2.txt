For 
To apply <IDAA> to the provided argument, we'll first decompose the task <t> of classifying the argument into specific steps within <IDFA> and then further within <IDA>.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>):

1. **Identify the defect family** for the argument.
   - Determine if the defective argument is a part of:
      - <DP> (Defects in <P>)
      - <DR> (Defects in <R>)
      - <DPR> (Defects in <PR>)

2. Within the identified defect family, **classify the specific defect type**.
   - If in <DP>, classify as:
      - <G> (Generalization)
      - <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)
   - If in <DR>, classify as:
      - <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)
      - <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)
      - <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)
   - If in <DPR>, classify as:
      - <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)
      - <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)

### Application to the Provided Argument:

1. **Identify the Defect Family** (<IDFA>):
   The conversation can be summarized as follows:
   - **Proposition** (<P>): Thousands of people are being used to spread the word about social injustice and the need for change.
   - **Response:** That is ethically wrong because I was taught that using people is wrong.

   The response calls into question the reason <R> - why using people to spread the word could be wrong. It suggests a moral or ethical defect in using people.

2. **Classify the Specific Defect Type** (<IDA>):
    Analyzing the response:
   - The speaker refutes the action of "using people" as inherently wrong, which implies an ethical stance.
   - They conflated the ethical concern over "using people" with the context of activism and spreading important social messages.

This response can be seen as an **Inconclusive Reason**:
   - **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: The response given does not conclusively demonstrate why the use of people to spread the word about social injustice is wrong in all contexts. It provides an ethical objection without thoroughly addressing the specific scenario at hand.

### Conclusion:

Based on <IDAA>, we classify the argument as follows:

<s> = "Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."
- **Defect Family**: <DR> (Defects in <R>)
- **Specific Defect Type**: <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)

Thus, "Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people." is classified as an <IR> type of defective argument within the <DR> family.
