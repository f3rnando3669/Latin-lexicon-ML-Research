For 
Certainly! To apply <IDAA> to the given statement, we will decompose the task into steps and perform the classifications accordingly.

### Step 1: Apply <IDFA>
First, we need to classify the string as a family of defective arguments of type <DP>, <DR>, or <DPR>.

Let’s analyze the string:

"I see nobody on the road," said Alice.
"I only wish I had such eyes," the king remarked..."To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why it's as much as I can do to see real people, by this light."

In this conversation, the king misinterprets Alice’s use of "nobody" as if she can see an actual person named Nobody, which is a play on words and represents a misunderstanding rather than a logical defect in proposition, reason, or proof.

- **<DP> (Defects in Proposition)**: This usually involves overgeneralization or incomplete enumeration.
- **<DR> (Defects in Reason)**: This includes inconclusive reason, insufficient causal basis, or faulty repetition of the proposition.
- **<DPR> (Defects in Proof)**: This involves presumptuous consensus or ambiguous language use.

### Classification: <DPR>

The king's remark plays upon the ambiguous use of the term "nobody." Alice used "nobody" to mean that no person was on the road, while the king interprets it literally as if "Nobody" was a specific entity that could be seen.

### Step 2: Apply <IDA>
Next, we classify the statement as a defective argument of type <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

Given that we've identified <DPR> and the nature of the defect:

- **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: This is where a term or phrase can be interpreted in more than one way, which skews the argument or makes it confusing.

The king's misunderstanding of "nobody" fits perfectly within the scope of ambiguous language use, where the term "nobody" is taken in another sense than Alice intended.

### Classification: <DEP>

### Summary
Applying <IDAA> to the statement results in:
- Family of Defective Argument: <DPR> (Defects in Proof)
- Specific Type of Defective Argument: <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)

Thus, the analyzed statement is an instance of ambiguous language use, classified under defective arguments in proof.
