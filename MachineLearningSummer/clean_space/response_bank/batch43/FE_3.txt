Sure, let's break down the task using the defined concepts and then apply them step by step to the given string "People either like coffee or hate it."

### Step 1: Apply <IDFA>
The first step in <IDAA> is to classify the string as a family of defective arguments: <DP>, <DR>, or <DPR>.

- **Defects in Proposition (<DP>)** involve fundamental issues with the proposition itself.
- **Defects in Reason (<DR>)** indicate that the reason given for a proposition is flawed.
- **Defects in Proof (<DPR>)** concern issues with the corroboration of the reason.

The string "People either like coffee or hate it" is a proposition. It sets forth what the speaker intends to assert. This suggests that if there is an issue, it lies within <DP>.

Therefore, we classify "People either like coffee or hate it" under <DP>.

### Step 2: Apply <IDA>
Now that we know the string is in the family <DP>, we need to classify it as a specific defective argument type within <DP>.

- **Generalization (<G>)** occurs when an assertion applies to all based on an insufficient subset.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** occurs when the enumeration of possibilities is incomplete.

The statement "People either like coffee or hate it" presents a binary choice and ignores other possibilities. This fits the definition of **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** since it excludes other potential stances people might have about coffee (e.g., being indifferent, liking it sometimes, or having no opinion).

Therefore, we classify "People either like coffee or hate it" as <FE>.

### Summary
Applying **<IDAA>** to the string "People either like coffee or hate it":
1. **<IDFA>:** Classify the string as a family of defective arguments.
   - The string is in <DP> (Defective Proposition).
   
2. **<IDA>:** Classify the string as a type of defective argument within <DP>.
   - The string is an <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration).

So, the string "People either like coffee or hate it" is identified as an **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** within the family of Defective Propositions (<DP>).
