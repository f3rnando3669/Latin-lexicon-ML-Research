For 
Applying <IDAA> to the given string involves decomposing the task first into identifying the family of defective arguments (<IDFA>), and then further classifying the specific type of defective argument (<IDA>).

### Step 1: Identify the Family of Defective Arguments (<IDFA>)

Let's first determine whether the given argument falls into the category of <DP>, <DR>, or <DPR>.

Here is the provided string: 
"One of our clients doubled their conversions after changing all their landing page text to bright red. Therefore, changing all text to red is a proven way to double conversions."

- **Proposition (<P>)**: "Changing all text to red is a proven way to double conversions."
- **Reason (<R>)**: "One of our clients doubled their conversions after changing all their landing page text to bright red."
- **Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: None provided; the statement directly connects P to R without additional arguments.

### Analysis:
1. **Does the statement mainly concern the proposition (<DP>)?**
   - The proposition appears to be based on the experience of a single client.
   - This suggests an issue with generalizing the results.

    So it appears we are dealing with a Defective Argument in terms of the **Proposition** (<DP>).

### Step 2: Classify the Specific Type of Defective Argument (<IDA>)

Next, we classify the specific type of defective argument within the family <DP>.

Types within <DP>:
- **Generalization (G)**: An assertion based on some part but applied to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Claiming completeness but missing other pertinent possibilities.

### Analysis:
- The argument takes the result from a single client ("one of our clients doubled their conversions") and generalizes it to all situations ("changing all text to red is a proven way to double conversions").

This fits the definition of **Generalization (G)**:

### Conclusion:
Combining the steps and outcome, the detailed classification is:
- **Family of Defective Argument (<IDFA>)**: <DP>
- **Specific Type of Defective Argument (<IDA>)**: <G>

Thus, the given string is classified as a **Generalization (G)**, which is a type of defective argument within the family of **Defects in Proposition (DP)**.
