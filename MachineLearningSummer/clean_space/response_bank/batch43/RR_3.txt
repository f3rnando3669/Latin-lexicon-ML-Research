For 
Certainly! Let's apply the concept of <IDAA> to the given passage step-by-step.

### Step 1: Apply <IDFA> - Identifying the Family of Defective Arguments

1. **Identifying any instance where the Proposition (<P>) might be defective.**
   - We start by looking for any potential defect in the initial proposition made by Speaker 1.
   - Proposition: "Jesus was not really crucified."

2. **Identifying any instance where the Reason (<R>) could be defective.**
   - We evaluate the reasons given in support of the proposition.
   - Reason 1: "Because the Quran says so."
   - Reason 2: "Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true."

3. **Identifying any instance where the Proof of Reason (<PR>) could be defective.**
   - We evaluate the proof provided for the reasons.
   - Proof 1: "Because God tells us so, here in the Koran."

On analyzing the step-by-step interactions, we observe that the faulty reasoning is primarily centered around the reasons given (section <DR>) and potentially proof of these reasons (section <DPR>).

### Step 2: Apply <IDA> - Identifying the Specific Defective Argument Type

**For Defective Reason (<DR>):**

- **Reason 1 Analysis: "Because the Quran says so."**
  - This reason solely relies on the authority of the Quran without additional supporting evidence.
  - Possible Defective Types:
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason essentially reiterates the proposition without providing new supporting evidence.

- **Reason 2 Analysis: "Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true."**
  - This reasoning chains one assertion to another, relying on the initial premise that the Quran is infallible, which hasn't been proven.
  - Possible Defective Types:
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis, that the Quran is the Word of God, is not sufficiently proven to establish the proposition.
    - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reasoning is not conclusive enough to substantiate the initial claim.

**For Proof of Reason (<DPR>):**

- **Proof Analysis: "Because God tells us so, here in the Koran."**
  - This proof presumes the truth of the Quran on the basis of circular reasoning, essentially claiming the Quran is true because the Quran says it is true.
  - Possible Defective Types:
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There's an appeal to the assumed universal truth of the Quran without independent verification or dispute resolution.

### Step 3: Summarize the classification under <IDAA>

After decomposing and analyzing the given dialogue, the classifications are as follows:

- **<DR> (Defective Arguments in Reason):**
  - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason given is essentially a repetition of the proposition ("Because the Quran says so").
  - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason fails to conclusively prove the proposition ("Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true").

- **<DPR> (Defective Arguments in Proof of Reason):**
  - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The proof assumes universal agreement on the Quran's truth without independent verification ("Because God tells us so, here in the Koran").

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the provided string leads us to classify the argument into specific defective types, highlighting issues in reasoning and proof rooted in faulty repetition, inconclusiveness, and presumptuous consensus.
