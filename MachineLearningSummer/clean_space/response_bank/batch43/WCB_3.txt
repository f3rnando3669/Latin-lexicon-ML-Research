For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task IDFA into specific steps followed by IDA) to the statement "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick," we'll proceed step by step as follows:

### Step 1: Apply IDFA
**Task: Classify the given argument as a defect in Proposition (DP), Reason (DR), or Proof of Reason (DPR).**

1. **Identify the parts of the argument:**
   - **Proposition (P):** "The water must have made me sick."
   - **Reason (R):** "I drank bottled water and now I am sick."
   - **The given statement does not directly state a Proof of Reason (PR), so we can ignore DPR for now.**

2. **Determine if there is a defect in P, R, or PR by examining the components.**

By analysis:
- The proposition (P) directly states a conclusion based on the given reason.
- The reason (R) provided ("I drank bottled water and now I am sick") attempts to establish a causal relationship.

Given that the focus is on the reason (R) "I drank bottled water and now I am sick," we will examine the possible defects in R.

**Conclusion:** The classification falls under DR (Defective Reason).

### Step 2: Apply IDA
**Task: Classify the defective argument in DR as one of its types - IR, RR, or WCB.**

1. **Examine the defective reason (R):**
   - **R:** "I drank bottled water and now I am sick."

2. **Determine if the reason is inconclusive (IR), repeats the proposition (RR), or has an insufficient causal basis (WCB):**

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does the reason definitively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
  - The reason fails to conclusively demonstrate that the bottled water caused the sickness. 

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Does the reason simply restate the proposition in different words?
  - No, the reason does provide a different statement from the proposition.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Does the reason provide a weak causal basis?
  - Yes, the reason assumes causation from correlation without strong evidence. Just because the person drank bottled water and then became sick does not provide a compelling causal link to definitively conclude that the water caused the sickness.

**Conclusion:** The argument is a <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) type of defective reasoning in the DR category.

### Final Answer:
The logical fallacy used in the statement "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick" is **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
