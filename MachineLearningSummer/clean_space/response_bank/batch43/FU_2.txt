For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way," let's follow the defined steps:

### Step 1: Apply <IDFA> to classify the statement into a family of defective arguments <DP>, <DR>, or <DPR>.

Given the statement, it seems to suggest a type of argument that is based on consensus or group action, which hints that it might involve a defect related to presumed consensus or popularity.

- **<DP> (Defects in Proposition):** This category deals with defects in the proposition itself, such as generalizations or incomplete enumerations. The given statement does not directly imply a defect in the proposition.
  
- **<DR> (Defects in Reason):** This category deals with issues in the reasoning supporting the proposition, such as inconclusive reasons, insufficient causal bases, or faulty repetition. The given statement does not directly suggest an issue with the reasoning part.
  
- **<DPR> (Defects in Proof of Reason):** This category concerns defective proofs related to the reasoning. Given that the statement talks about encouraging action based on what others are doing, it seems to invoke a faulty proof based on presumed consensus.

With this, it appears that the statement falls under the family **<DPR>**.

### Step 2: Apply <IDA> to classify the statement as a specific type of defective argument.

Within the family <DPR>, we have:

- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):** This relates to assuming something is true because it is universally agreed upon or popular—even though it might still be in dispute.
  
- **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):** This involves ambiguous use of language in the reasoning.

The given statement clearly fits the pattern of **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)** since it encourages action based on the idea that many people are doing the same thing, implying a form of validation through popularity.

Therefore, the detailed application of <IDAA> classifies the statement "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way." as **<DPR> and specifically <FU>**:

1. **<DPR>**: Family of Defective Arguments — Defects in Proof of Reason
2. **<FU>**: Presumptuous Consensus
