For 
Sure, let's apply the defined procedure <IDAA> to the provided string: "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."

**Step 1: Apply <IDFA> to the given string.**

First, let's classify the argument as one of the families of defective arguments: <DP>, <DR>, or <DPR>.

The given string suggests that there are only two mutually exclusive options: supporting Hillary Clinton or not believing in women's rights. This is a form of false dichotomy, which falls under the category of <DP> (Defects in Proposition).

Thus, the given string is classified as <DP>.

**Step 2: Apply <IDA> to the given string.**

Next, we identify the specific type of defective argument under the <DP> family (Defects in Proposition). 

In this case, the argument is suggesting an incomplete enumeration of possibilities:
"You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."

This statement is forcing a choice between two extreme options and ignoring other possible viewpoints that could exist between them. This matches the definition of <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration).

Thus, the given string is classified as <FE>.

**Result of Applying <IDAA>:**

- **<IDFA> Classification**: <DP>
- **<IDA> Classification**: <FE> 

Hence, the string "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" is an example of a defective argument that belongs to the family <DP> and is specifically of the type <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration).
