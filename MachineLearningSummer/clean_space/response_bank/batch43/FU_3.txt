For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding," we need to follow the steps for decomposing the advanced task and then classifying the argument.

### Step 1: Decompose the task <IDFA> into specific steps:
- Identify the type of defective argument family.
    - Here we need to determine whether the argument is part of a defective proposition (<DP>), defective reason (<DR>), or defective proof of reason (<DPR>).

### Step 2: Apply <IDFA> to the given string:
- The argument presented here seems to rely on the notion that the speaker's actions are justified because others were behaving similarly.

Given the argument:
"Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding."

We can identify this as part of the **defective proof of reason family (<DPR>)** because the argument assumes that behavior is justified because a presumed consensus of behavior exists.

### Step 3: Apply <IDA> to classify the specific type of defective argument:
- Specific types of defective arguments within <DPR> are:
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**

Given the nature of the argument, it appeals to the fact that the behavior was common among others as a form of validation:
"This argument is faulty because it assumes that because others are engaging in the behavior, it is justified or correct."

- The argument exemplifies a **Presumptuous Consensus** (<FU>).

### Conclusion:
Applying <IDAA> to "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding." results in the classification of the argument as follows:
- <IDFA> classification: **<DPR>**
- <IDA> classification: **<FU>**

Therefore, this argument can be classified as a defective argument type **<FU>** within the family **<DPR>** which is **Presumptuous Consensus**.
