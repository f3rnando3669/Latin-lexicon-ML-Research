To apply the detailed decomposition of the task (<IDAA>) to the statement "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity," follow the steps outlined:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA>:

1. **Step 1: Input Parsing**
   - **Objective:** Identify and parse the input string <s> that needs to be classified.
   - **Action:** Extract the content of <s>.

   **Parsed Input:** "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."

2. **Step 2: Identify Key Indicators**
   - **Objective:** Determine the presence of words or phrases that indicate potential argument types.
   - **Action:** Search for keywords or patterns associated with each type (e.g., "all", "always" for <G>).

   **Key Indicators Identified:** The phrase "because I have experienced" suggests a reason is being provided for the proposition.

3. **Step 3: Preliminary Classification**
   - **Objective:** Based on key indicators, make a preliminary classification of <s>.
   - **Action:** Tentatively assign <s> to one of the listed types (<G>, <FE>, etc.).

   **Tentative Type:** Likely a <RR> (Redundant Reason), since the reason provided restates the initial proposition in different words.

4. **Step 4: Evaluate Logical Structure**
   - **Objective:** Analyze the logical structure of <s> to validate the preliminary classification.
   - **Action:** Verify if the logical structure of <s> aligns with the characteristics of the preliminary classification.

   **Analysis:** 
   - **Proposition:** Paranormal activity is real.
   - **Reason:** Because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity.

   The reason provided essentially rephrases the proposition, suggesting the same idea without giving new information or a separate line of evidence.

5. **Step 5: Cross-Validation against Types**
   - **Objective:** Cross-verify the argument type by comparing <s> with definitions of all types.
   - **Action:** For each argument type, check for matching inconsistencies or patterns in <s>.

   - **<G> (Generalization):** No broad generalization from a specific instance.
   - **<FE> (False Enumeration):** No listing of more/fewer options.
   - **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason):** Reason is not unrelated but redundant.
   - **<RR> (Redundant Reason):** Matches as it restates the proposition.
   - **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis):** Not applicable here.
   - **<FU> (False Universals):** No universally agreed point asserted.
   - **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases):** No dual interpretation.

   **Verification:** No other types match better. <RR> remains most fitting.

6. **Step 6: Final Classification**
   - **Objective:** Finalize the classification of <s> based on the evaluation and cross-validation steps.
   - **Action:** Assign the most appropriate defective argument type to <s>.

   **Final Type:** <RR> (Redundant Reason).

7. **Step 7: Documentation and Justification**
   - **Objective:** Document the classification decision and provide a justification.
   - **Action:** Record the chosen argument type and explain why <s> fits this classification.

   **Documented Decision:** <s> classified as <RR> (Redundant Reason).
   - **Justification:** The statement "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity" uses reasoning that merely rephrases the proposition, offering no new evidence or separate logic, making it a case of redundant reason.

Thus, the string has been classified as <RR> (Redundant Reason) following the step-by-step decomposition method.
