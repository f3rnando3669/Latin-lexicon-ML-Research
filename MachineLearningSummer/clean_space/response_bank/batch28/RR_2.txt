For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people." and classify it under the appropriate defective argument type, we will follow the decomposition steps outlined.

### Step 1: Understanding the Argument Types

We first need to recall the definitions of each defective argument type:
- **Generalization (<G>)**: Broad claim based on a single instance.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Incorrect number of options listed.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Reason provided does not logically support the conclusion.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Reason restates the proposition in different words.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Weak or insufficient causal connection.
- **False Universals (<FU>)**: Universally claimed points without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Statements with dual interpretations.

### Step 2: Parsing the String

Read and parse the given string:
- \( <s> \) = "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people."
- Proposition: "We need to fix our broken judicial system."
- Suggested Action: "by electing new people."

### Step 3: Identifying Key Words and Phrases

- Key element: "fix our broken judicial system"
- Suggested solution: "by electing new people"

### Step 4: Comparing with Definitions

Now, we compare the parsed argument structure to the characteristics defined for each argument type:
- **Generalization (<G>)**: Not applicable. The argument is not making a sweeping generalization based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not applicable. The argument doesn't list options.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: This appears to be the best match. The suggested reason for fixing the judicial system (electing new people) may not logically follow or directly address the problems within the judicial system. The logic implicitly assumes that simply electing new people will repair the judicial system's issues, which may not be sufficient or relevant.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Not applicable. The argument does not restate the proposition using different words.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This is another possible match. The causal connection ("fix our broken judicial system by electing new people") may be weak or insufficient, as changing personnel alone may not address systemic issues.
- **False Universals (<FU>)**: Not applicable. There are no universally claimed points without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Not applicable. The argument does not have statements that could be interpreted in dual ways that undercut the speaker.

### Step 5: Classification

Based on the matching step:

- The argument "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people." best fits with **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**, as the reason provided does not logically support the proposition of fixing the judicial system.
- It also has elements of **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**, suggesting a weak or insufficient causal relationship between electing new people and fixing the judicial system.

### Conclusion

Thus, \( <s> \) = "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people." is best classified as:
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)** with a consideration that it also weakly fits Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>), but the primary classification is <IR>.
