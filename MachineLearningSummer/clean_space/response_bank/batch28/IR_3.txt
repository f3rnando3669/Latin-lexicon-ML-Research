For 
The given string is quite detailed and involves a sequence of logical explanations and examples relating to a fallacy known as "moving the goalposts." To classify it according to the argument types defined, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Understanding the task and the definitions

We are aiming to classify the string based on the definitions provided. 

### Step 2: Defining Subtasks

#### Subtask 2.1: Identify key attributes and characteristics of each argument type
We have:
- **<G>: Generalization - broad claims from specific instances.
- **<FE>: False Enumeration - fewer/more options than exist.
- **<IR>: Inappropriate Reason - irrelevant reasons to the proposition.
- **<RR>: Redundant Reason - repeating proposition in different words.
- **<WCB>: Weak Causal Basis - weak causal links.
- **<FU>: False Universals - universally agreed points without proof.
- **<DEP>: Double-Edged Phrases - dual interpretations against the speaker.

#### Subtask 2.2: Develop criteria/questions for each argument type
We’ll use these criteria to evaluate the string.

### Step 3: Apply criteria/questions to classify the string (s)

#### Subtask 3.1: Analyze the string
The string discusses the fallacy of "moving the goalposts" and provides examples to explain the concept. It doesn’t make a broad claim based on a single instance, it doesn't limit or overextend options, nor does it provide irrelevant reasons. 

#### Subtask 3.2: Apply the developed criteria

- **For <G>:** Does the string make a broad claim based on a single or few instances?
  - No, it explains the concept with multiple examples.

- **For <FE>:** Does the string list fewer or more options than actually exist?
  - No, it explains the concept and provides a range of examples.

- **For <IR>:** Is the reason provided irrelevant to the proposition?
  - No, all points are relevant to explaining the concept.

- **For <RR>:** Does the string repeat the proposition in different words as a new reason?
  - No, the explanations are varied and substantive.

- **For <WCB>:** Is there a weak or insufficient causal link?
  - No, the reasoning is sound and illustrative.

- **For <FU>:** Does the string assume universally agreed points without proof?
  - Yes and no. It mostly explains a common fallacy but does not assert universally agreed points without proof. However, it does state at the end, "This is a logical fallacy frequently used on the Internet. No academic sources could be found," which might lean toward <FU> but is not definitive.

- **For <DEP>:** Does the string use statements that can be interpreted in dual and potentially opposing ways?
  - No, the string is clear and addresses its points directly.

### Step 4: Final Classification

Based on the criteria and the content of the string, the closest fit seems to be **<FU> False Universals**, particularly towards the end where it generalizes the usage of the fallacy on the Internet without academic sources. However, it is worth noting that the bulk of the string is more explanatory and educational rather than fitting neatly into the defective argument types provided.

### Conclusion

The string could be partially classified as **<FU> False Universals** due to its general claim about the fallacy's frequent use on the Internet without academic backing, but it primarily serves as an explanatory text rather than an outright defective argument.
