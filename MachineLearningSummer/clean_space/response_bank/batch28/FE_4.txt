Sure, let's apply the decomposition steps (<IDAA>) to classify the string "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition**:
    - The main proposition is that the person addressed is not a good person.

2. **Analyze the Argument**:
    - Premise: "You weren’t in class today."
    - Conclusion: "You were not a good person."

3. **Compare with Definitions**:
    - <G> Generalization: This does not seem like a generalization based on a specific instance applied to a wider group.
    - <FE> False Enumeration: There is no enumeration of options here.
    - <IR> Inappropriate Reason: The reason given (not being in class) does not logically support the conclusion (the person is not good).
    - <RR> Redundant Reason: The proposition and its reason are not just saying the same thing in different words.
    - <WCB> Weak Causal Basis: There isn’t a causal relationship being unjustifiably implied.
    - <FU> False Universals: This is not an assertion of a universal truth.
    - <DEP> Double-Edged Phrases: No dual interpretation seems to be present.

4. **Classify the Argument**:
    - The statement "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today." seems to be best classified as <IR> (Inappropriate Reason). The absence from class does not logically justify the conclusion that the person is not good.

Therefore, the defective argument type for the given string is **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**.
