For 
Let's apply the step-by-step classification procedure (IDAA) to the given statement: "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far."

### Step-by-Step Classification (IDAA):

1. **Understand the Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - **False Enumeration (FE)**: Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**: Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
   - **Redundant Reason (RR)**: Reiterating the same reason in different words.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**: Offering a causal basis that is not compelling enough.
   - **False Universals (FU)**: Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**: Statements open to dual interpretations.

2. **Identify the Proposition in <s>**:
   - Proposition: "The reason Donald Trump got elected."

3. **Identify the Reasoning in <s>**:
   - Reasoning: "because liberals took political correctness too far."

4. **Compare Against Definitions**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: Not applicable, as it's not claiming a general truth based on a single instance.
   - **False Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable, as it’s not listing options.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**: Potentially relevant. The statement suggests that "liberals taking political correctness too far" is the reason for Donald Trump's election. This reason may not logically track as the sole cause or even a major cause of his election.
   - **Redundant Reason (RR)**: Not applicable, as it’s not restating the proposition in different words.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**: This is also a possible category. The causal claim made here ("liberals taking political correctness too far" led to Trump's election) might not be compelling enough without further evidence.
   - **False Universals (FU)**: Not applicable, as it's not asserting a universally agreed point without proof.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**: Not applicable, as it’s not a statement open to dual interpretations that could potentially hurt the speaker.

5. **Apply Classification**:
   - The statement "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far" can be classified as:
     - **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**, because the reason provided does not necessarily logically support the proposition.
     - **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**, because the causal connection is not sufficiently compelling or well-supported.

Final classification: **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)** and **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**. 

Given the context and function, <IR> seems more directly relevant because the reasoning provided is not necessarily a logical or strong basis for the proposition made.
