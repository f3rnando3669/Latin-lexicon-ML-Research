For 
To apply the process of decomposition (<D>) to the task of classifying the given string from "Alice in Wonderland" into one of the specified defective argument types (<IDA>), we will proceed step by step according to the <IDAA> framework:

### Step 1: Initial Reading and Understanding
**Goal:** Get an initial understanding of the argument presented in the string.
**Action:** Carefully read the given string.

Given String: 
```"I see nobody on the road," said Alice.
"I only wish I had such eyes," the king remarked..."To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why it's as much as I can do to see real people, by this light."
```

### Step 2: Identification of Argument Type Keywords and Phrases
**Goal:** Identify any keywords or phrases that may indicate a specific type of defective argument.
**Action:** Look for keywords or phrases that fit the definitions provided for each defect type.

- Keywords identified: "see nobody", "such eyes", "see Nobody", "distance", "real people"

### Step 3: Check for Generalization (<G>)
**Goal:** Determine if the argument is making a broad statement based on a specific instance.
**Action:** See if the string contains language that extends a specific observation to all cases.
- The string doesn't seem to make a broad statement based on a specific instance.
- Conclusion: Not <G>.

### Step 4: Check for False Enumeration (<FE>)
**Goal:** Determine if the argument is listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
**Action:** See if the string constrains the choices to a false dichotomy or limited set of options.
- The string doesn't present a limited number of choices.
- Conclusion: Not <FE>.

### Step 5: Check for Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)
**Goal:** Determine if the argument contains a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition.
**Action:** See if the string presents an irrelevant reason to dismiss a proposition.
- The string doesn't use an irrelevant reason to dismiss a proposition.
- Conclusion: Not <IR>.

### Step 6: Check for Redundant Reason (<RR>)
**Goal:** Determine if the argument presents a reason that is just a restatement of the proposition.
**Action:** Check if the string states the same point in different words.
- The string doesn't appear to restate the same point in different words.
- Conclusion: Not <RR>.

### Step 7: Check for Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)
**Goal:** Determine if the argument offers an insufficient causal basis for the proposition.
**Action:** See if the string relies on weak causal connections.
- The string doesn't offer causal connections.
- Conclusion: Not <WCB>.

### Step 8: Check for False Universals (<FU>)
**Goal:** Determine if the argument asserts universally agreed points without proof.
**Action:** Check if the string makes broad, unsupported claims about universal beliefs or behaviors.
- The string doesn’t claim universal agreement or behavior.
- Conclusion: Not <FU>.

### Step 9: Check for Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)
**Goal:** Determine if the argument uses statements that can be interpreted in dual potentially antagonistic ways.
**Action:** See if the string contains ambiguous statements that can have dual meanings.
- The conversation between Alice and the King involves an ambiguous statement about "seeing Nobody," which can be interpreted both as seeing no one and seeing the character "Nobody."
- Conclusion: This involves a double-edged phrase, making it a potential case of <DEP>.

### Step 10: Classification
**Goal:** Assign the identified defective argument type to the given string.
**Action:** Based on the indicators observed, classify the string.

- Classification: <DEP>

### Step 11: Final Verification
**Goal:** Ensure that the classification is accurate.
**Action:** Revisit the initial understanding and the identified indicators.

- Upon review, the string's dual interpretation aligns with the definition of <DEP>.

**Final Classification:** <DEP>

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the given string from "Alice in Wonderland" results in the classification of <DEP> due to the use of a double-edged phrase.
