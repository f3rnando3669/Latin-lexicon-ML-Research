For 
Let's apply the decomposition steps of <IDAA> to classify the provided string "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there."

### Applying Step-by-Step <IDAA> to the Example String

**Example String <s>:** "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there."

1. **Step 1: Initial Identification**
   - **Argument statement:** "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there."
   - Proposition: The restaurant is popular.
   - Supporting premise: Everyone in town goes there.

2. **Step 2: Determine Key Argument Features**
   - Identify key characteristics:
     - The argument asserts a causal relationship (reason given for popularity is attendance by everyone in town).
     - The argument implies universal agreement (everyone in town goes there).
     - The argument might reflect a redundant reason (the reasoning for popularity is that everyone goes there, essentially reiterating the proposition differently).

3. **Step 3: Match Features to Defective Argument Types**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** Not fitting; it doesn't claim a general truth from a specific instance.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Not fitting; it doesn't list options.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** This may be fitting if the reason provided (people going there) does not logically support the inherent quality of being popular.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** This could fit if the premise merely restates the proposition differently.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Not fitting; there's an implicit causal assertion but not challenged on strength here.
   - **False Universals (<FU>):** Fits well; it implies universal agreement or behavior without proof (everyone in town goes there).
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Not fitting; no dual interpretation involves.

4. **Step 4: Analyze and Classify**
   - Based on the detailed features:
     - **False Universals (<FU>):** "Everyone in town goes there," is an assumed universally agreed point without proof.
     - **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** "The restaurant is popular" because "everyone in town goes there" could be seen as restating the issue using different words.

5. **Step 5: Validation**
   - Rechecking the features:
     - The argument asserts universal agreement ("everyone in town goes there").
     - The reason does not logically support the proposition as there is no inherent quality of popularity explained, just restating attendance likely contributing more to a "false universal".
   - Final classification decided: **<FU>** (False Universals).

### Conclusion

The classified type for the given string "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there." is **<FU>** (False Universals).
