To apply IDAA to the given string, we will follow the step-by-step decomposition to classify the defective argument type:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) and Application (IDAA)

**Given String (<s>):**
"Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified.
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so.
Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct?
Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran."

**Step 1: Identify the Argument Structure**
- **Proposition:** Jesus was not really crucified.
- **Reason 1:** Because the Quran says so.
- **Reason 2:** The Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.
- **Reason 3:** Because God tells us so, here in the Koran.

**Step 2: Categorize the Type of Argument**
- The answers appear to be based on circular or repetitive reasoning, where the proposition supports itself through restating the initial proposition in different terms.

**Step 3-10: Analyze each type (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP)**
- **Analyze for Generalization (G):**
  - Does not make a broad generalization based on a specific instance.
  
- **Analyze for False Enumeration (FE):**
  - Does not list fewer or more options than actually exist.
  
- **Analyze for Inappropriate Reason (IR):**
  - Does not provide a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition. The reasons given are repetitive rather than inappropriate.
  
- **Analyze for Redundant Reason (RR):**
  - **First part:**
    - Proposition: Jesus was not really crucified.
    - Reason: Because the Quran says so.
  - **Second part:**
    - Proposition: Because the Quran says so (regarded as true because it’s the Word of God).
    - Reason: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran.
  - This is redundant reasoning as it presents the proposition and restates it multiple times without adding new information.
  
- **Analyze for Weak Causal Basis (WCB):**
  - No weak causal argument.
  
- **Analyze for False Universals (FU):**
  - Does not assert universally agreed points without proof.
  
- **Analyze for Double-Edged Phrases (DEP):**
  - No statements open to dual interpretations.

**Step 11: Document and Justify the Classification**
Based on the analysis, this argument is classified as:

**Classification: <RR> (Redundant Reason)**
**Justification:**
- The reasoning presented in the argument simply restates different forms of the same underlying proposition. Each response cycles back to a former point without providing additional, independent evidence or logic to support the original proposition, thus employing redundant reasoning.

This decomposed and applied IDAA classifies the given string as <RR>, demonstrating the use of redundant reasons throughout the argument.
