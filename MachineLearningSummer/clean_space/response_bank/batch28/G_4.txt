For 
To classify the string "<s>: 'Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess all the other classes will all fail it, too.'" using the IDAA approach, we'll follow the steps outlined above.

### Steps for IDAA:

1. **Understanding the Types of Defective Arguments**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Saying the same thing as the proposition using different words, presented as a new reason.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Offering a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
   - **False Universals (<FU>)**: Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Using statements open to dual interpretations.

2. **Step 1 – Input the Argument**:
   - Argument: "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess all the other classes will all fail it, too."

3. **Step 2 – Identify Key Characteristics**:
   - The argument is making a broad claim about all classes based on the performance of three kids in one class.

4. **Step 3 – Matching with Definition**:
   
   a. **Generalization (G)**:
      - The statement makes a sweeping conclusion about all classes' performance based on a few instances (three kids in one class).
      - **Indicator**: Broad claim based on a specific instance.

   b. **False Enumeration (FE)**:
      - The argument doesn't present a limited or false set of options.

   c. **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**:
      - The reasoning provided is not unrelated but rather is making a broad generalization.

   d. **Redundant Reason (RR)**:
      - The argument does not restate the proposition in different words.

   e. **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**:
      - The argument is not making a weak causal connection but rather a broad assumption.

   f. **False Universals (FU)**:
      - It does not assert a universally agreed point without proof but instead generalizes from specific instances.

   g. **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**:
      - There is no dual interpretation in the statement.

5. **Step 4 – Classify the Argument**:
   - Based on the identified characteristic, the argument makes a broad claim based on a limited instance, which matches the **Generalization (G)** category.

6. **Step 5 – Validate the Classification**:
   - Review if the argument fits Generalization: The conclusion about all the other classes failing is drawn from the specific instance of three kids failing, making it a clear case of Generalization.

7. **Step 6 – Output the Result**:
   - The argument classified as **Generalization (G)**.

### Classification Result:
- The argument "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess all the other classes will all fail it, too." is classified as **<G>**.
