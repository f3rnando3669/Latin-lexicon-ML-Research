For 
To classify the string "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses." using the outlined steps of <IDAA>, proceed as follows:

### Decomposition of Task \(<IDA>\) (\(<D>\)):
1. **Identify the Proposition**
2. **Analyze the Supporting Reasoning**
3. **Match the Reasoning to Fallacy Types**
4. **Classify the String**

### Application of Decomposition (\(<IDAA>\)):

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition
- The main claim or proposition being made is: "It is immoral to kill fetuses."

#### Step 2: Analyze the Supporting Reasoning
- The supporting reasoning provided is:
  1. "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being."
  2. "Fetuses are innocent human beings."
  3. Conclusion: "Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."
  
- The reasoning follows a syllogistic structure where a general moral principle (major premise) and a specific observation (minor premise) lead to a conclusion.

#### Step 3: Match the Reasoning to Fallacy Types
- Evaluate the provided reasoning against the defined fallacy types (\(G\), \(FE\), \(IR\), \(RR\), \(WCB\), \(FU\), \(DEP\)):
 
  - **Generalization (\(<G>\)):** The argument does not appear to generalize from a specific instance; it follows a logical structure.
  
  - **False Enumeration (\(<FE>\)):** The argument does not present a limited number of options; it simply presents a syllogism.
  
  - **Inappropriate Reason (\(<IR>\)):** The premises provided appear to be logically connected to the conclusion, not irrelevant.
  
  - **Redundant Reason (\(<RR>\)):** There is no redundant or restated reason; the premises introduce new points.
  
  - **Weak Causal Basis (\(<WCB>\)):** The argument is based on a logical connection rather than a weak causal link, so it does not fit here.
  
  - **False Universals (\(<FU>\)):** The argument does not assert universal agreement without proof, nor does it appeal to popularity or common belief.
  
  - **Double-Edged Phrases (\(<DEP>\)):** The statement does not have an interpretation that could backfire or a dual meaning.

#### Step 4: Classify the String
- After comparative analysis, the argument appears to be of a form that logically deduces a conclusion from premises. It does not fit any of the defective argument types defined (\(G\), \(FE\), \(IR\), \(RR\), \(WCB\), \(FU\), \(DEP\)). 

Therefore, the argument "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses." does not match any of the specified fallacy types and instead appears to be a logically structured argument based on valid premises, assuming the definitions and logical framework are accepted as sound.
