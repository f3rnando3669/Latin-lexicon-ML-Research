For 
To classify the string “Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding.” using the decomposed steps defined in <IDAA>, we follow this sequence:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>) and Application to <IDA> (<IDAA>):

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition
- The main proposition here is: "I wasn't speeding."

#### Step 2: Determine Argument Type Candidates
- The argument justifies not speeding by comparing the driver's speed to everyone around them. Possible candidates might include <IR> (Inappropriate Reason), <FU> (False Universals), or possibly others based on further analysis.

#### Step 3: Apply Definitions
- <G>: Generalization based on specific instances.
- <FE>: False Enumeration listing fewer/more options.
- <IR>: Inappropriate Reason providing illogical support.
- <RR>: Redundant Reason restating the proposition.
- <WCB>: Weak Causal Basis.
- <FU>: False Universals.
- <DEP>: Double-Edged Phrases open to dual interpretations.

#### Step 4: Analyze Logical Structure
- The argument is stating that the speaker was not speeding simply because they were matching the speed of others. This does not logically support the claim that the speaker wasn't speeding, as others might be speeding too.

#### Step 5: Make a Tentative Classification
- Tentatively classify the argument as <IR> (Inappropriate Reason), as the reason given does not logically support the proposition of not speeding.

#### Step 6: Review and Confirm
- Revisiting the definitions, <IR> refers to providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition. The proposition that "I wasn't speeding" is inappropriately supported by stating "I was only driving as fast as everyone around me."

#### Step 7: Finalize Classification
- Confidently finalize the classification as <IR> (Inappropriate Reason).

Therefore, the string "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding." would be classified as providing an Inappropriate Reason (<IR>).
