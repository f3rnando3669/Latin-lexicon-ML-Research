For 
To classify the given string as one of the types defined, follow the systematic steps outlined in IDAA:

### Given String:
"Speaker 1: We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change.
Speaker: Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions
Ensure clear understanding of each defective argument type. 

### Step 2: Analyzing the Structure of the String
Identify the core propositions and reasoning:
- **Speaker 1**: Proposes that utilizing thousands of people for door-to-door advocacy on social injustice is helpful.
- **Speaker**: Rejects participation based on a belief that it's wrong to "use people."

### Step 3: Checking for Generalization (<G>)
- **Generalization**: Does it claim a general truth based on a specific instance?
  - No, the statement does not generalize from a single instance to a broad conclusion.

### Step 4: Checking for False Enumeration (<FE>)
- **False Enumeration**: Does it list fewer or more options than exist?
  - No, there aren’t any listings of limited or exaggerated choices to force a decision.

### Step 5: Checking for Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)
- **Inappropriate Reason**: Does the given reason logically support the proposition?
  - The refusal is based on the belief that "using people" is wrong, but "using people" in this context may not logically align with exploitation. The term "use" here is subject to interpretation.

### Step 6: Checking for Redundant Reason (<RR>)
- **Redundant Reason**: Is the reasoning merely a rephrasing of the proposition?
  - No, the reason (it's wrong to "use people") isn't just a rephrasing of the initial proposition (door-to-door advocacy).

### Step 7: Checking for Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- **Weak Causal Basis**: Is the causation weak or anecdotal?
  - No specific causation is presented in Speaker’s refusal to participate.

### Step 8: Checking for False Universals (<FU>)
- **False Universals**: Does it assert universally agreed points without proof?
  - No broad societal norms or popular opinion assertions apparent here.

### Step 9: Checking for Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)
- **Double-Edged Phrases**: Could the statement be interpreted in multiple ways that undermine the intent?
  - The phrase "I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people” can be interpreted in two ways:
    1. Literally, using people is wrong (interpreting "use" as exploit).
    2. Using people to help with advocacy isn't inherently exploitative but beneficial, thus undermining the speaker's refusal.

### Step 10: Decision Making
Based on the analysis:
- The string could be interpreted dual ways, and this dual interpretation might undermine the speaker's point.

**Conclusion**: The statement provided by the second speaker is classified as **<DEP>** (Double-Edged Phrases).
