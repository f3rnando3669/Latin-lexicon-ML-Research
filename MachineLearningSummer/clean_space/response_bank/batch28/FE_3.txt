For 
Let's apply the decomposition of task \(\<t>\) into specific steps (\(\<D>\)) to the task of classifying the argument "People either like coffee or hate it." as one of the defective argument types (\(\<IDAA>\)). Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

### Step 1: Preliminary Analysis
1. **Read the argument**: "People either like coffee or hate it."
2. **Identify the claim and reasoning**: 
   - **Claim**: People have a binary preference towards coffee.
   - **Reasoning**: The argument implies that there are only two possible opinions about coffee.

### Step 2: Determine Argument Type
3. **Match patterns**: Compare the argument against common patterns for each defined defective argument type:
    - **Generalization (\(<G>\))**: This doesn’t seem to be claiming a general truth from a specific instance.
    - **False Enumeration (\(<FE>\))**: Check if it lists fewer options than actually exist.
    - **Inappropriate Reason (\(<IR>\))**: Evaluate if the reason is unrelated or doesn't support the claim.
    - **Redundant Reason (\(<RR>\))**: Check for redundancy in reasoning.
    - **Weak Causal Basis (\(<WCB>\))**: Look for weak causal connection.
    - **False Universals (\(<FU>\))**: Evaluate if it's making a universally agreed point without proof.
    - **Double-Edged Phrases (\(<DEP>\))**: Check for dual interpretations.

### Step 3: Detailed Analysis
4. **Identify key indicators**:
    - For \(<FE>\): Look for arguments that falsely present limited choices. The phrase "People either like coffee or hate it." implies there are only two possible opinions, ignoring neutral or mixed feelings.
  
5. **Cross-reference definitions**: Confirm that the indicators match the definition of False Enumeration. According to the definition:
   - False Enumeration (\(<FE>\)): Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.

### Step 4: Final Classification
6. **Determine the closest match**: The argument "People either like coffee or hate it." is providing a false dichotomy by reducing the opinions on coffee to only two extremes, thereby fitting the False Enumeration (\(<FE>\)) pattern.
7. **Label the argument**: Classify the argument as \(\<FE>\).

### Step 5: Validation
8. **Review and validate**: Ensure that the classification consistently aligns with the definition of False Enumeration, confirming that the argument fails to acknowledge that people can have neutral or mixed feelings about coffee.

Thus, the argument "People either like coffee or hate it." is classified as \(<FE>\) (False Enumeration).
