Sure, let's apply the steps outlined in \(IDAA\) to the string **"Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way."**.

### Step-by-Step Application of \(D\) to Perform \(IDA\):

#### Step 1: Identify the Propositional Statement
The statement is: "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way."

#### Step 2: Analyze the Argument
- The statement is advocating for action based on the behavior of others.
- It posits that because other people are acting in a certain way, one should join or act the same.

#### Step 3: Check Against Definitions
Let's compare this with the definitions provided for each defective argument type:
- **Generalization ( \( <G> \) )**: The statement is not making a broad claim about a group based on specific instances.
- **False Enumeration ( \( <FE> \) )**: No enumeration of options is involved.
- **Inappropriate Reason ( \( <IR> \) )**: The reason—the behavior of other people—is not irrelevant, but whether it is logical is under consideration.
- **Redundant Reason ( \( <RR> \) )**: The statement isn't simply rephrasing the proposition.
- **Weak Causal Basis ( \( <WCB> \) )**: The statement does not provide a causal basis.
- **False Universals ( \( <FU> \) )**: This seems to fit because it is encouraging action based on the presumed universal behavior or belief that others are doing it.
- **Double-Edged Phrases ( \( <DEP> \) )**: There’s no dual interpretation involved.

#### Step 4: Classify the Argument
The argument fits the classification of **False Universals ( \( <FU> \) )** because it is appealing to the presumed universality of the actions of others to validate or encourage similar behavior without providing substantial evidence or reasoning. This kind of logic assumes agreement or correctness based on popularity or common action, which corresponds to the definitions provided under **\( <FU> \)**:

- "Stating that something should be done (or agreed to) because everyone else thinks this way."
- "You appealed to popularity or the fact that many people do something as an attempted form of validation."

So, the string **"Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way."** is classified as **\( <FU> \)**.

By systematically applying each step of \( D \), we have performed \( IDAA \) on the provided string.
