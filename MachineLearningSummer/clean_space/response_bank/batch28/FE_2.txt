For 
To classify the string "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" using the \(<IDAA>\) method, we will follow the steps as outlined previously.

### Step 1: Understand the Types
Revisit the definitions of each defective argument type to ensure familiarity:
- **Generalization (\(G\))**: A broad claim based on a single or limited set of instances.
- **False Enumeration (\(FE\))**: Presenting too few or too many options than there actually are.
- **Inappropriate Reason (\(IR\))**: Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the argument.
- **Redundant Reason (\(RR\))**: Offering a reason that restates the proposition in a different way rather than providing new information.
- **Weak Causal Basis (\(WCB\))**: Providing a causal explanation that is insufficient or not compelling.
- **False Universals (\(FU\))**: Assuming universally agreed points without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (\(DEP\))**: Making statements open to dual interpretations, which can be counterproductive to the speaker's intent.

### Step 2: Parse the String
Break down the string \(<s>\) to understand its grammatical structure and the main argument it presents. Identify the proposition and supporting statements/claims made.
- Proposition: "You either support Hillary Clinton for President..."
- Supporting statement: "...or you don't believe in women's rights."

### Step 3: Identify the Type of Defect
Evaluate the argument presented in \(<s>\):
- **\(G\)**: It does not appear to be making a broad claim based on limited instances.
- **\(FE\)**: The argument presents a dichotomy (two choices).
- **\(IR\)**: The supporting statement is not irrelevant to the claim.
- **\(RR\)**: The reason does not merely reformulate the proposition.
- **\(WCB\)**: No causal relationship is presented.
- **\(FU\)**: It does not assert a universally agreed point without proof.
- **\(DEP\)**: It is not open to dual interpretations in a counterproductive way.

### Step 4: Match with Example Templates
Compare \(<s>\) with example templates for each defective argument type.
- This aligns closely with \(<FE>\): "Presenting too few or too many options than there actually are."

### Step 5: Assign the Correct Defective Argument Type
The string "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" presents a false dilemma by reducing the options to only two when more might exist. This matches the definition of False Enumeration (\(FE\)).

Thus, the string "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" is of type \(<FE>\).
