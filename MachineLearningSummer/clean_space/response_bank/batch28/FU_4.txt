### Applying <IDAA> to "“Everyone else is doing it, so should you”"

Let's decompose the task of classifying the given string step-by-step following the outlined method for <IDAA>.

**String (<s>)**: "“Everyone else is doing it, so should you”."

#### 1. Read and Understand the String (<s>)
- **Meaning**: The statement is suggesting that because everyone else is participating in a certain action or behavior, you should also participate. It relies on the idea that the popularity or commonality of an action is a reason for you to follow suit.

#### 2. Identify Premise and Conclusion
- **Premise**: Everyone else is doing it.
- **Conclusion**: Therefore, you should do it as well.

#### 3. Compare with Defective Argument Types
a. **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement is not making a general claim based on specific instances.
b. **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement is not listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
c. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: The statement’s reason does not seem logically inappropriate if we consider it purely on the grounds of popularity.
d. **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: The statement does not repeat the conclusion using different words.
e. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The statement does not provide a causal relationship.
f. **False Universals (<FU>)**: The statement asserts a universally agreed point without proof. It appeals to the popularity of an action as justification.
g. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: The statement is not open to dual interpretations that could be potentially against the speaker.

#### 4. Select the Defective Argument Type
- Based on the comparison, the argument best fits **False Universals (<FU>)** since it appeals to the idea that because many people are doing something, it must be the right action for you to take as well.

### Conclusion:
The string "“Everyone else is doing it, so should you”." is an example of **False Universals (<FU>)**.
