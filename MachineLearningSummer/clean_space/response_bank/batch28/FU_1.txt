For 
To apply the task <IDAA> to the argument "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong," we will follow the decomposed steps outlined earlier:

### Step 1: Identify the core claim of the argument
Core Claim: "Get Verizon."

### Step 2: Identify the supporting rationale or evidence
Supporting Rationale: "1 billion people can't be wrong."

### Step 3: Compare with definitions of defective argument types

- **<G> Generalization:** The argument does not generalize based on a specific instance.
- **<FE> False Enumeration:** The argument does not list options.
- **<IR> Inappropriate Reason:** While the reason given (1 billion people use Verizon) might not directly assess the quality or suitability of Verizon for all, there may be a more fitting defective type.
- **<RR> Redundant Reason:** The argument does not restate its proposition using different words.
- **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis:** The presence of many users does not inherently prove that Verizon is the best choice for everyone, but this is not an issue of weak causality as defined.
- **<FU> False Universals:** The argument relies on the appeal to popularity (the fact that many people use Verizon) as a form of validation without proof.
- **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases:** The argument does not use phrases open to dual interpretations.

### Step 4: Classify the argument
The argument fits the definition of <FU> False Universals, as it asserts that a large number of people using Verizon validates that it is the best choice, without any substantive proof.

### Step 5: Double-check classification
Reviewing the identified patterns confirms that the argument indeed fits <FU> because it relies on the assumed correctness of the choice based on the popularity of Verizon.

Hence, the argument string "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong" is classified as type <FU> False Universals.
