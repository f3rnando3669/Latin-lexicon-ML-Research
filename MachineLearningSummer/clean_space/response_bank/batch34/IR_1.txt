Sure, let's apply the task of classifying the defective argument type (IDA) to the given statement "Don't you want the best for your baby?" by decomposing it into specific steps (D). Here are the steps to classify it:

**Step 1: Identify the proposition or claim.**
The claim in the statement "Don't you want the best for your baby?" seems implicit. It suggests that if you disagree, then you do not want the best for your baby.

**Step 2: Evaluate whether the claim fits any specific argument type definitions.**
- **Generalization (G):** This doesn't appear to make a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (FE):** This isn't listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **Inappropriate Reason (IR):** The reason given might connect to an emotive appeal but isn’t necessarily logically supporting another proposition.
- **Redundant Reason (RR):** It isn't offering a new reason that says the same thing again.
- **Weak Causal Basis (WCB):** There isn’t any causal basis offered here.
- **False Universals (FU):** This doesn't seem to assert universally agreed points without proof.

**Step 3: Check for Double-Edged Phrases (DEP) or any other types.**
The statement employs a form of emotional appeal or potentially manipulative phrasing. It pressures the listener into agreeing by implying that not agreeing means not wanting the best for the baby.

**Step 4: Match the argument type with the closest definition.**
The most fitting for the given argument fallacy is Inappropriate Reason (IR) because it presents a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.

**Step 5: Conclude the classification.**
Given that it fits best with IR:

The statement "Don't you want the best for your baby?" would be classified under <IR> Inappropriate Reason as it provides an emotionally charged question that doesn't logically contribute to the validity of its implied claim.

Thus, the resulting classification is:
<s> = "Don't you want the best for your baby?"
**<IR>**
