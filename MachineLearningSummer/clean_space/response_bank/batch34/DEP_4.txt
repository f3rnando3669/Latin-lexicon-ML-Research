For 
To apply <IDAA> (i.e., the application of decomposition to the task of identifying the logical fallacy in the given string), we need to break down the classification process into clear and specific steps. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### Step 1: Identify the Components of the Statement
First, we need to break down the statement into its component parts, examining each part's role in the overall argument.

- **Premise 1:** "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being."
- **Premise 2:** "Fetuses are innocent human beings."
- **Conclusion:** "Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."

### Step 2: Determine the Type of Reasoning
Identify what type of reasoning is being employed in this argument. Here, the argument uses deductive reasoning, where the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.

### Step 3: Match with Known Fallacies
Compare the statement with the definitions of each defective argument type to see if any fallacies match the reasoning or structure of the argument.

- **Generalization (G):** Not applicable, as the argument is not based on a specific instance to generalize a broader truth.
- **False Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable, as the argument does not list fewer or more options than exist.
- **Inappropriate Reason (IR):** Might be considered, as we need to verify if the reasons logically support the conclusion.
- **Redundant Reason (RR):** Not applicable, as no redundant reasoning is presented.
- **Weak Causal Basis (WCB):** Not applicable, as the argument is not about a weak causal link.
- **False Universals (FU):** Could be considered, as it might assert universally agreed points without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP):** Not applicable, as there are no ambiguous statements open to dual interpretations.

### Step 4: Analyze Appropriateness of the Reason
Examine whether Premise 1 and Premise 2 logically and appropriately support the conclusion. 

Premise 1 states a moral principle ("It is immoral to kill an innocent human being"). Premise 2 defines a group as fitting within the category of "innocent human beings". The conclusion that follows is deduced from these premises.

### Step 5: Determine if there is a Fallacy Based on Definitions
Identify if the argument commits a logical fallacy as defined:

- **Inappropriate Reason (IR):** Examine if "Fetuses are innocent human beings" logically supports the conclusion when combined with Premise 1. If fetuses are included in the category stipulated by Premise 1, the reasoning may not be inappropriate.

- **False Universals (FU):** Determine if the premises assume universally agreed points without proof. The moral claim in Premise 1 and the classification in Premise 2 might assume general agreement without addressing opposing viewpoints.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the argument seems to contain elements that might be seen as appealing to universally accepted points without proof, akin to **False Universals (FU)**. It relies on the assumption that everyone agrees with the moral stance presented and the classification of fetuses without addressing potential complexities or differing viewpoints.

Therefore, the statement "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses." can be classified under the fallacy of **False Universals (FU)**.
