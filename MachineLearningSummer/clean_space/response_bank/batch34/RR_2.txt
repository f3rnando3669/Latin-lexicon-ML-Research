For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the argument "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people." as one of the defined defective argument types, we will decompose and then classify the argument step by step:

1. **Identify the proposition:**
   - The main proposition here is: "We need to fix our broken judicial system."

2. **Identify the supporting reason provided:**
   - The reason provided is: "by electing new people."

3. **Evaluate the reasoning:**
   - Check if the reason logically supports the proposition.
   - Assess if the reason is an appropriate and strong basis for supporting the proposition.

4. **Match the reasoning to the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>):**

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

**Step 1: Identify the proposition:**
- The proposition is "We need to fix our broken judicial system."

**Step 2: Identify the supporting reason provided:**
- The reason provided is "by electing new people."

**Step 3: Evaluate the reason:**
- Does electing new people logically and compellingly support the need to fix a broken judicial system? This seems to be an attempt at establishing a causal link between the cause (electing new people) and the effect (fixing the judicial system).

**Step 4: Match the reasoning to the defective argument types:**
- **<G> (Generalization):** This does not involve a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **<FE> (False Enumeration):** This does not offer limited or false choices.
- **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason):** The reason provided ("by electing new people") might be considered inappropriate because merely electing new people does not directly guarantee or explain how the judicial system will be fixed; it lacks logical support.
- **<RR> (Redundant Reason):** It is not a redundant reason.
- **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis):** The causal basis here is weak. It suggests that electing new people by itself will fix the system without providing compelling evidence as to why this specific action will lead to the intended outcome.
- **<FU> (False Universals):** This does not rely on universally agreed points without proof.
- **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases):** This does not involve a statement with dual interpretations.

Based on the evaluation, the argument provided:
- "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people." This logical fallacy is best classified under **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**.
