To apply the method of decomposition (<D>) to the task of classifying the given argument ("The teenagers were rude and disrespectful, therefore all teenagers are rude and disrespectful.") into one of the defective argument types (<IDA>), follow these steps:

1. **Identify the proposition:** Recognize the main statement or claim in the argument.
   - In this case, the claim is: "All teenagers are rude and disrespectful."

2. **Analyze the evidence provided:** Look for the specific instance or reasoning given to support the proposition.
   - Here, the specific instance is: "The teenagers were rude and disrespectful."

3. **Match the argument to the definitions:**
    - <G>: Generalization - claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
    - <FE>: False Enumeration - listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
    - <IR>: Inappropriate Reason - providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
    - <RR>: Redundant Reason - a reason that says the same thing as the proposition using different words.
    - <WCB>: Weak Causal Basis - offering a weak causal basis that is not compelling enough.
    - <FU>: False Universals - asserting universally agreed points without proof.
    - <DEP>: Double-Edged Phrases - using statements open to dual interpretations.

4. **Determine which defective argument type fits:**
    - In this scenario, the argument "The teenagers were rude and disrespectful, therefore all teenagers are rude and disrespectful" exhibits characteristics of a Generalization because it is claiming a general truth (all teenagers are rude and disrespectful) based on a specific instance (the teenagers were rude and disrespectful).

Based on these steps, the classification of the argument ("The teenagers were rude and disrespectful therefore all teenagers are rude and disrespectful.") is:
   - **Defective argument type:** <G> (Generalization)
