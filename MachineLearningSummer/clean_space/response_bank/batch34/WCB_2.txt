To apply <IDAA> to the string "Farmer McDonald: Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain. I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature.", let's follow the defined steps:

### Step 1: Identify the argument
First, let's break down the string into its component arguments:
- Farmer McDonald claims there has been no rain since the new power plant was installed ("Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain.")
- Farmer McDonald concludes that human interference with nature, such as putting up power plants, is responsible for this lack of rain ("I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature.")

### Step 2: Classify the arguments with respect to the provided defective argument types
We must determine which defective argument type(s) the statements fall under.

1. **First Argument: "Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain."**
   - This presents a causal claim without sufficient evidence to support it. It suggests that the existence of the power plant has directly caused a lack of rain.
   - This resembles the **Weak Causal Basis** type because the causal link between the power plant and the lack of rain isn't sufficiently established.

2. **Second Argument: "I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature."**
   - This assertion generalizes from a specific instance and suggests a broader, likely unwarranted, view regarding mankind's interference with nature.
   - This fits the **Generalization** type because it claims a general truth based on a specific instance.

### Step 3: Consolidate the classification
Both arguments combine to create Farmer McDonald's overall claim:
- Primary type:
  - **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**: The primary argument lacks compelling evidence to support the causal link.
- Secondary type:
  - **Generalization (G)**: The overall statement generalizes from a specific instance to a broader conclusion.

### Step 4: Deliver the final classification
Based on our analysis steps, the classification of the string "Farmer McDonald: Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain. I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature." is:

- **Primary Defective Argument Type: Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Secondary Defective Argument Type: Generalization (G)**

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the sentence, we find it primarily exhibits a **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)** and secondarily a **Generalization (G)**.
