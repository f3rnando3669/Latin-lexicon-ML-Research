For 
To apply <IDAA> to "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there.", we will decompose the <IDA> task (classifying the sentence into one of the defective argument types) into specific steps.

**Step 1: Understand and Break Down the Argument**
- The given sentence is: "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there."
- Break down the argument to understand what it is conveying:
  - **Proposition:** "That restaurant is popular"
  - **Reason provided:** "because everyone in town goes there"

**Step 2: Identify Key Characteristics**
- Identify the characteristics of the reason provided:
  - The reason suggests that the reason for the restaurant's popularity is the fact that everyone in town frequents it.

**Step 3: Compare with Defective Argument Types**
- Compare this reasoning with the types of defective arguments we have defined:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - This argument type does not fit because the statement does not generalize based on a single instance.

2. **False Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - This type does not fit because the argument is not about listing options.

3. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):**
   - Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
   - The reason provided (popularity due to everyone going there) is related but not properly substantiated.

4. **Redundant Reason (<RR>):**
   - Saying the same thing as the proposition using different words.
   - The argument is not merely restating the proposition differently.

5. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Offering a causal basis not compelling enough to support the proposition.
   - The causality provided may be weak, but it's not our best match here.

6. **False Universals (<FU>):**
   - Asserting universally agreed points or appealing to popularity.
   - This clearly matches our sentence. "Everyone in town" going to the restaurant is an appeal to popularity to justify its popularity.

7. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):**
   - Using statements open to dual interpretations.
   - This type does not fit as the argument is not open to dual interpretations.

**Step 4: Determine the Most Accurate Classification**
- Based on the characteristics:
  - The sentence best fits **False Universals (FU)** as it appeals to the idea that popularity (everyone in town going there) is the reason for its popularity, which is an appeal to the widespread belief.

**Conclusion**
- Applying the decomposition to classify the given sentence yields:
  - "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there." is an example of **False Universals (<FU>)**.

So, the classification result of <IDA> for the given sentence is: **<FU>**

Therefore, following <IDAA> to classify "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there." step-by-step leads us to identify it as a **False Universals (FU)** type of defective argument.
