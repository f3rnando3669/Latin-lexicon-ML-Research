To apply IDAA to the given text, we must follow the steps to decompose the task into specific steps to classify the string as type <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step 1: Understand and Extract Key Elements
First, we must carefully read and understand the text provided to identify the core argument and any potential fallacy. Let's extract the main statements and claims.

### Step 2: Summarize the Core Argument
The core argument involves discussing a fallacy related to arguments for the existence of God. It mentions how arguments have shifted from creationism to intelligent design and currently focus on the origin of life, suggesting these shifts occur as science progresses.

### Step 3: Identify the Argument Type
Next, we need to identify which of the defined defective argument types, if any, the text most closely resembles:
- **Generalization (<G>):** A general statement lacks a broad basis.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Limiting options unfairly.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Reasons irrelevant to the argument.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Reworded same proposition as a reason.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Unsatisfactory causal relationships.
- **False Universals (<FU>):** Asserting universally accepted points without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Statements too ambiguous or dual in interpretation.

### Step 4: Match to a Defective Argument Type
Consider the argument in the text: It suggests that proponents of the existence of God shift their arguments to areas less explained by science (this shift in argument seems to aim at areas not yet scientifically explained, pushing the need for proof farther as science answers more questions).

**Candidate Logical Fallacy:** This resembles a form of special pleading where each resolved argument is replaced by a new one to perpetuate a claim without definitive support. Notably, the text discusses how the goalposts are moved as science provides answers, indicating an ongoing, reactionary pattern.

### Step 5: Validate Against Definitions
Review definitions:
- **False Universals (FU):**
  - While the argument touches on broad claims about why arguments for God's existence change, **it does not assert these as universally agreed points without proof.**
  
- **Generalization (G):**
  - Suggests a universal claim based on specific instances, which seems less relevant here as the argument is more about the reactionary nature of these shifts rather than making a generalization without evidence.

### Step 6: Identify Specific Argument:
None of the specific types exactly fit, but the closest pattern can be found in how the text discusses a form of ongoing, reactive argument shifts (not a perfect fit but closest to <FU> due to implications of assumed required proof not universally accepted).

### Conclusion

The argument most closely aligns with a form of logical fallacy (possibly near Idle abandonment and special pleading rather than directly fitting into given categories). It suggests repeated replacement of arguments not because of valid reasons but due to evasion as existing points get addressed by science.

While we have conducted <IDAA> mostly to highlight potential alignment with <FU>, the given defective argument type does not perfectly match existing definitions and may require acknowledgment of a unique, recognized logical fallacy.

Thus:

Applying IDAA stages surfaced <FU> as the closest but not exact fit for the described fallacy.
