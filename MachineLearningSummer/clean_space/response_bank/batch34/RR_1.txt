For 
Sure. Let's take it step by step by first decomposing the task of <IDA>, which is classifying the defective argument type, into specific steps. Here is the decomposition of <t> (in this case, classifying a defective argument) into specific steps:

1. **Identify the proposition**: Determine what is being asserted.
2. **Examine the reason/justification given**: Identify what reason is provided to support the proposition.
3. **Compare with definitions of defective argument types**: Match the reason with the defined types of defective arguments: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.
4. **Classify the argument**: Based on the comparison, classify the argument type.

Now, let's apply <IDAA> (the application of the detailed decomposition) to the given string:
"Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition
The proposition here is:
- "Paranormal activity is real."

### Step 2: Examine the Reason/Justification Given
The reason provided for the proposition is:
- "Because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."

### Step 3: Compare with Definitions of Defective Argument Types

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This does not seem to extrapolate a general truth based on a specific instance.
2. **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: This does not list options or enumerate possibilities.
3. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: This could be checked if the reason logically supports the proposition.
4. **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: This checks if the reason is simply restating the proposition.
5. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This checks if the reason provided has a weak causal relationship.
6. **False Universals (<FU>)**: This asserts universality without proof, usually involving popularity or unverified consensus.
7. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: This involves statements open to dual interpretations.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
- The argument essentially states that paranormal activity is real because the speaker has experienced it. This is not introducing new evidence but is rephrasing the proposition; it asserts that the proposition is true because of the occurrence labeled by the same proposition.
- Since this falls under restating the proposition using different words, this matches the definition of **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**.

**Conclusion:** The argument "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity." is an example of a **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**.
