To apply the IDAA to the task of classifying the statement "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way," we need to follow a step-by-step decomposition of the classification task (IDA).

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Step 1: Identify potential argument types involved in the definition.**
    - Generalization (<G>)
    - False Enumeration (<FE>)
    - Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)
    - Redundant Reason (<RR>)
    - Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)
    - False Universals (<FU>)
    - Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)

2. **Step 2: Understand the meaning of the given statement.**
    - The statement suggests the audience should act or join a group merely because others are doing the same.

3. **Step 3: Compare the statement against definitions of defective argument types.**

    - **Generalization (<G>):** Making a general statement based on a specific instance.
      - Not applicable here, because the statement is not generalizing from a specific instance.
      
    - **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Listing fewer or more options than exist.
      - Not applicable, as no such listing is involved.

    - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
      - Not applicable, although could be contextually relevant. Primary focus seems elsewhere.
      
    - **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Rewording the proposition as the reason.
      - Not applicable, as it's not restating the proposition.

    - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Offering a weak causal link.
      - Not applicable, as no causal link is being provided.

    - **False Universals (<FU>):** Asserting universally agreed points without proof, often appealing to popularity.
      - Applicable. The statement asks the audience to act based on the widespread behavior, implying "everybody is doing it, so you should too."

    - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Using ambiguous statements open to dual interpretations.
      - Not applicable, as there's no dual interpretation involved.

4. **Step 4: Match the statement with the most closely aligned argument type.**

- The statement "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way" most closely aligns with the logic behind "False Universals" (<FU>).

### Conclusion:
Applying IDAA, the classification of the statement is <FU>.
