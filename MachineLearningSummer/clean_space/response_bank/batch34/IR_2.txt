For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you," we need to decompose the task of classifying the argument type (<IDA>) into specific steps (<D>). Let's break this down:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>) of <IDA>:

1. **Identify the Claim and Reason Provided:**
   - **Claim:** "I’m not going to talk to you."
   - **Reason Provided:** "My best friend says you’re a liar."

2. **Match the Argument Against Defined Defective Types:**
   - **<G> Generalization:** Does the argument claim a general truth based on a specific instance? No, it doesn't generalize beyond the specific instance cited.
   - **<FE> False Enumeration:** Does the argument list fewer or more options than actually exist? No, enumeration of options is not the issue here.
   - **<IR> Inappropriate Reason:** Does the reason logically support the proposition? Consider whether the friend's statement ("My best friend says you’re a liar") logically supports the action ("I’m not going to talk to you").
   - **<RR> Redundant Reason:** Is the reason just a rephrased form of the proposition? No, the reason provided is not a rephrasing of the claim.
   - **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis:** Is the causal connection compelling enough? Consider if the friend's opinion is a compelling enough reason to support the conclusion.
   - **<FU> False Universals:** Does the argument assert universally agreed points without proof? No, the argument is not appealing to universal agreement.
   - **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases:** Are statements open to dual interpretations? The argument does not use ambiguous terms open to dual interpretations.

3. **Analyze the Logical Consistency of the Reason:**
   - The statement "My best friend says you’re a liar" does not provide a logically valid reason to not talk to someone. The credibility of the best friend or the context of the friend’s statement is not addressed.

4. **Determine the Closest Match from Defective Argument Types:**
   - **<IR> Inappropriate Reason** seems the most accurate as the friendship and the friend's opinion doesn't logically support the conclusion to not speak to the person. It’s essentially saying, "Because someone else has an opinion about you, I will act on it," which is not logically sound and does not substantiate the action proposed.

### Conclusion:
Upon applying <IDAA> to the statement "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you," we classify it as:

**<IR> Inappropriate Reason**
