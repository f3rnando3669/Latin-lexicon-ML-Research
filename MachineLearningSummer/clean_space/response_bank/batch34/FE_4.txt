For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today.", we need to decompose the task of classifying the defective argument type into specific steps. Here is the detailed process:

### Step 1: Identify the Components of the Statement
First, break down the statement into its parts to understand what is being asserted and how it is being connected.

- **Assertion:** "I thought you were a good person"
- **Reason:** "but you weren’t in class today"

### Step 2: Determine the Type of Defective Argument
Examine the connection between the assertion and the reason to classify the type of defective argument. Based on our predefined types, let's analyze each possibility:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - Is the argument making a general truth based on a specific instance?
   - The argument does not seem to generalize about all good people, but rather makes an observation about one specific person.
  
2. **False Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Is the argument listing fewer or more options than actually exist?
   - The statement does not list options, so this type does not apply.
  
3. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):**
   - Is the reason provided logically supporting the proposition?
   - There appears to be a disconnect between the virtue of being a "good person" and the specific action of not attending class. The reason doesn’t logically support the proposition.
    
4. **Redundant Reason (<RR>):**
   - Is the reason repeating the proposition in different words?
   - The reason is not a restatement of the proposition in different words.
  
5. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Is the causal basis offered not compelling enough to support the proposition?
   - The basis here is more of an associated event rather than a causal relationship.
    
6. **False Universals (<FU>):**
   - Is the argument asserting universally agreed points without proof?
   - The statement does not claim universal agreement.
    
7. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):**
   - Are there statements that are open to dual interpretations?
   - There doesn't seem to be dual interpretations here, though it might imply an expectation that being a good person includes attending class.

### Step 3: Match the Analysis to the Most Appropriate Type
After evaluating the given statement against all definitions, it most appropriately fits the description of:

- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):**
  - "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today." provides a reason (not being in class) that doesn't logically support the claim about the person's character (being good).

### Step 4: Conclude with the Classification
The final classification of the statement "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today." is:

- **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**

Hence, the application of <IDAA> to the given statement results in identifying it as a defective argument of type <IR>.
