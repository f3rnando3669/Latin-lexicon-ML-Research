For 
To apply \(<IDAA>\) to the string "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong," we will follow the step-by-step process of \(<D>\), which involves decomposing the task into specific steps for classifying the given string according to the defective argument types.

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Identify the argument presented in the string:** 
   - The argument is suggesting that one should get Verizon because 1 billion people use it, implying that such a large number of people can't be wrong about the choice.

2. **Determine the core proposition and reasoning:**
   - Core proposition: "Get Verizon."
   - Reasoning provided: "1 billion people use it."

3. **Compare the reasoning against the definitions of each defective argument type:**

   - **Generalization (G):** Claims a general truth based on specific instances. 
     - This argument doesn't fit the generalization type because it isn't claiming a general characteristic about a specific group from limited observations.

   - **False Enumeration (FE):** Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
     - This argument doesn't fit the false enumeration type as it does not concern a limited or exaggerated number of options.

   - **Inappropriate Reason (IR):** Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
     - While "1 billion people use it" isn't entirely connected logically to the quality of the service, this isn't the central issue here.

   - **Redundant Reason (RR):** Repeats the same thing in different words.
     - This argument doesn't just repeat itself in different wording.

   - **Weak Causal Basis (WCB):** Offers a not compelling causal basis.
     - The argument doesn't present a clearly weak causal relationship.

   - **False Universals (FU):** Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
     - This is the most fitting type because the argument relies on the appeal to popularity ("1 billion people can't be wrong") to validate the proposition, suggesting that the large number of users implies correctness although it is not a logically valid proof.

   - **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP):** Uses statements open to dual interpretations.
     - This argument isn't open to dual interpretations that could work against the speaker.

4. **Match the string with the closest defective argument type:**
   - The reasoning primarily fits with **False Universals (FU)** because it appeals to the popularity of Verizon's user base to validate the proposition without providing concrete evidence about the service's quality or actual merits.

### Conclusion

The given string "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong." is categorized under the defective argument type: **False Universals (FU)**.
