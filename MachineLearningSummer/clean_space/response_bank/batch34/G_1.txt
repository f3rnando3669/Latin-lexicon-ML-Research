For 
Sure, let's apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to the given statement. Here is the step-by-step decomposition:

1. **Identify the key components of the argument in the given string \( s \)**:
    - Identify the specific instance or example given: "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up."
    - Identify the general claim or conclusion inferred from the specific instance: "Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well."

2. **Assess whether the general claim is justified by the specific instance**:
    - Check if the specific instance logically supports the general claim.

3. **Compare with definitions of defective argument types**:
    - \( \text{<G>} \): Generalizing based on a specific instance.
    - \( \text{<FE>} \): False Enumeration by listing incomplete or excessive options.
    - \( \text{<IR>} \): Providing an inappropriate reason.
    - \( \text{<RR>} \): Redundant Reason restating in different words.
    - \( \text{<WCB>} \): Weak Causal Basis.
    - \( \text{<FU>} \): False Universals.
    - \( \text{<DEP>} \): Double-Edged Phrases.

4. **Identify if the argument fits any of the defective argument types**:
    - The argument makes a broad and unjustified generalization about all Catholics being guilty because a specific instance (a scandal involving the Church) occurred.
    - It does not fit the structure of False Enumeration \( \text{<FE>} \).
    - It is not providing an inappropriate reason \( \text{<IR>} \).
    - It is not just restating a reason \( \text{<RR>} \).
    - It is not based on weak causal linkage \( \text{<WCB>} \).
    - It is not relying on universal claims without proof \( \text{<FU>} \).
    - It does not involve ambiguous or dual-interpretation phrases \( \text{<DEP>} \).

5. **Determine the type of defective argument**:
    - The argumentâ€™s structure fits the definition of \( \text{<G>} \), as it involves making a broad generalization based on a specific instance.

**Conclusion**:
The given string "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!" is classified as type \( \text{<G>} \) (Generalization).
