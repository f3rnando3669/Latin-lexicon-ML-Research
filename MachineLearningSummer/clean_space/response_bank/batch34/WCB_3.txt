For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick," we must first decompose the task of identifying the particular defective argument type into specific steps, and then execute those steps.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for <IDA>:

1. **Identify proposition and reason within the statement.**
2. **Assess the logical validity of the connection between the proposition and reason.**
3. **Compare the reasoning pattern against known types of defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.**
4. **Classify the statement with the matching defective argument type.**

#### Step 1: Identify Proposition and Reason
- **Proposition:** "The water must have made me sick."
- **Reason:** "I drank bottled water and now I am sick."

#### Step 2: Assess Logical Validity
- The reasoning suggests a direct causal relationship between drinking bottled water and becoming sick.

#### Step 3: Compare with Known Defective Argument Types
- **<G> (Generalization):** This does not fit as it does not generalize a universal truth from a specific instance.
- **<FE> (False Enumeration):** This does not fit as it does not list fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason):** This does not fit as there is a reason given, but the appropriateness is questioned.
- **<RR> (Redundant Reason):** This does not fit as it does not restate the proposition with different words.
- **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis):** The causal relationship is assumed without compelling evidence or a proper basis.
- **<FU> (False Universals):** This does not fit as it does not assert universally agreed points without proof.
- **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases):** This does not fit as it does not involve statements open to dual interpretations.

#### Step 4: Classify
- The statement fits best with **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)** because it asserts a causal link between drinking the water and becoming sick without sufficient evidence to support this claim.

### Conclusion

The logical fallacy used in the statement "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick" is classified as **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**.
