For 
Let's apply <IDAA> to the given string "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."

1. **Task Definition (<IDA>)**: The task is to classify the given string as one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

2. **Decompose the task into specific steps (<D>)**:
   1. **Identify the main proposition**: Determine the primary claim or assertion being made in the statement.
   2. **Analyze the type of reasoning**: Look at the reasoning used to support the main proposition.
   3. **Compare to known defective argument types**: Match the identified reasoning with the characteristics of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.
   4. **Classify accordingly**: Assign the argument to one of the predefined defective argument types.

3. **Apply decomposition to the task (<IDAA>)**:

   a. **Identify the main proposition**:
      - The main proposition in the statement is that supporting Hillary Clinton for President is equivalent to believing in women's rights.
   
   b. **Analyze the type of reasoning**:
      - The reasoning given is dichotomous, suggesting that there are only two options: either you support Hillary Clinton, or you don't believe in women's rights.

   c. **Compare to known defective argument types**:
      - <G> (Generalization): Not a case of generalization based on a specific instance.
      - <FE> (False Enumeration): Suggests fewer options than actually exist.
      - <IR> (Inappropriate Reason): The reason seems logical if one equates supporting Clinton with women's rights, but it's primarily about limiting choices.
      - <RR> (Redundant Reason): Does not repeat the proposition in different words.
      - <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis): Not providing a causal basis for an event or condition.
      - <FU> (False Universals): Doesn't assert a universal point needing proof.
      - <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases): Not open to dual interpretations that can be twisted against the speaker.

   d. **Classify accordingly**:
      - The statement best fits the definition of <FE> (False Enumeration) because it falsely limits the options to two: either support Hillary Clinton or don't believe in women's rights, while in reality, there can be other stances.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the given argument "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" is classified as <FE> (False Enumeration).
