Applying <IDAA> to the argument "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far." involves breaking down the task of classifying the argument into specific steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

#### Step 1: Identify the Core Proposition
- **Proposition:** "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far."

#### Step 2: Examine the Provided Reason
- **Reason Given:** "Liberals took political correctness too far."

#### Step 3: Evaluate the Logical Connection
- Determine whether the reason logically supports the proposition that Donald Trump's election was due to this specific cause.

#### Step 4: Identify the Argument Type
- Based on the reason's logical validity, classify the argument into one of the defective argument types defined earlier.

### Applying Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Step 1: Identify the Core Proposition
- The core proposition is the claim that Donald Trump’s election was caused by an overemphasis on political correctness by liberals.

#### Step 2: Examine the Provided Reason
- The reason given for Trump's election is the claim that liberals took political correctness too far. 

#### Step 3: Evaluate the Logical Connection
- Evaluate whether taking political correctness too far is a logically compelling and sufficient reason to explain Trump's election. Consider the complexity and multitude of factors involved in an election.

#### Step 4: Identify the Argument Type

- **Generalization (<G>):** Not applicable since the argument isn't generalizing based on a specific instance.

- **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Not applicable as the argument isn’t listing limited options.

- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Potentially applicable because the causal relationship provided (political correctness by liberals) may not logically support the proposition that it led to Donald Trump's election. There are numerous factors in an election, and pinpointing political correctness alone as the reason may not be sufficient.

- **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Not applicable since the reason provided isn't merely a rephrasing of the proposition.

- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Also potentially applicable. The argument that "liberals took political correctness too far" is cited as the cause, which is a weak and overly simplistic basis considering the complexity of political elections.

- **False Universals (<FU>):** Not applicable since the argument isn’t appealing to universally agreed points without proof.

- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Not applicable since there isn’t a dual interpretation.

### Conclusion:
Based on the steps outlined and the analysis performed:

- The argument appears to primarily suffer from a weak causal basis (<WCB>) due to the overly simplistic attribution of Donald Trump’s election to a single factor (political correctness).
- Additionally, it can be argued that it may also be providing an inappropriate reason (<IR>), as the reason does not sufficiently and logically support the proposition, considering the multifaceted nature of election outcomes.

Thus, the classification of the argument:

**Primary Classification:** <WCB>
**Secondary Classification:** <IR>
