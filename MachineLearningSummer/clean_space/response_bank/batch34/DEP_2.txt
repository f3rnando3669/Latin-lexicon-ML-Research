For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given argument, follow these specific steps to classify the defective argument type:

**Step 1: Break down the argument into its primary components.**
- Identify the specific instance being stated or argued.
- Identify the general conclusion or proposition being derived from the instance.

**Step 2: Analyze the logical relationship or reasoning in the argument.**
- Evaluate whether the reasoning is appropriate, logical, and supports the proposition.
- Check for any fallacy type as defined: Generalization (<G>), False Enumeration (<FE>), Inappropriate Reason (<IR>), Redundant Reason (<RR>), Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>), False Universals (<FU>), or Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>).

**Step 3: Apply each fallacy criterion to the argument.**
- Determine if the argument matches the characteristics of any of the specific defective argument types.

**Step 4: Classify the argument according to the most fitting defective argument type.**
- Finalize the type of fallacy based on your analysis.

Let's apply these steps to the given texts:

**Step 1: Break down the argument into its primary components.**
- Speaker 1's statement: "We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change."
- Speaker 2's statement: "Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."

**Step 2: Analyze the logical relationship or reasoning in the argument.**
- Speaker 1 is making a statement of fact about an effort to spread awareness regarding social injustice by involving many people.
- Speaker 2 is providing a reason for why they cannot be part of this effort based on a belief that it is wrong to 'use' people.

**Step 3: Apply each fallacy criterion to the argument.**
- <G>: There is no generalization based on a specific instance here. 
- <FE>: No false enumeration of options.
- <IR>: Speaker 2's reason ("it’s wrong to use people") does not logically align with the context provided by Speaker 1. The interpretation of ‘using people’ is not suitable or logical in this context. The plea to avoid involvement is not supported reasonably because the term 'use' in Speaker 1’s context is benign and non-exploitative.
- <RR>: No redundant reasoning appears here.
- <WCB>: The causal basis, in this case, is not weak but rather inappropriate.
- <FU>: No false universal is stated.
- <DEP>: There is no double-edged phrase in the argument.

**Step 4: Classify the argument according to the most fitting defective argument type.**
- The defective argument type that aligns best with the given argument is <IR> (Inappropriate Reason). Speaker 2's reasoning that it’s wrong to 'use people' does not logically support the proposition of rejecting participation in a campaign intended for a positive social cause.

Thus, the argument is classified as:
- <IR>
