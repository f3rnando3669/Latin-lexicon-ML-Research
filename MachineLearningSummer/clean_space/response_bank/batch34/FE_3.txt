For 
To apply the task of classifying a defective argument type (IDA) step-by-step, we will decompose this task (D) and then apply this decomposition (IDAA) to the statement "People either like coffee or hate it." 

### Decomposition (D) of IDA:
1. **Identify and Understand the Argument:**
   - Read and comprehend the argument presented.
   
2. **Analyze the Structure of the Argument:**
   - Determine the main assertion or claim being made.
   - Examine the reasoning or evidence provided to support the assertion.

3. **Compare with Defined Defective Argument Types:**
   - Check if the argument fits the characteristics of each defined defective argument type (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

4. **Classify the Argument:**
   - Classify the argument under the most appropriate defective argument type based on the comparison.

### Application of D to IDA:

**Step 1: Identify and Understand the Argument**
- Argument: "People either like coffee or hate it."

**Step 2: Analyze the Structure of the Argument**
- Main Assertation: The statement asserts that there are only two possible attitudes towards coffeeâ€”liking it or hating it.
- Reasoning/Evidence: No additional reasoning or evidence is provided; it is a declarative statement.

**Step 3: Compare with Defined Defective Argument Types**

- **<G> Generalization:**
  - Not applicable as it does not claim a general truth based solely on a specific instance.
   
- **<FE> False Enumeration:**
  - This argument presents a binary choice (like or hate), which is a limited set of options compared to the range of possible attitudes people might have towards coffee (e.g., indifference, occasional liking, preference only for certain types).

- **<IR> Inappropriate Reason:**
  - Not applicable as no additional reasoning provided.

- **<RR> Redundant Reason:**
  - Not applicable as the assertion is not restated in different terms.

- **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis:**
  - Not applicable as no causal relationship is being claimed here.

- **<FU> False Universals:**
  - Not applicable as the statement does not rely on universally agreed points without proof.

- **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases:**
  - Not applicable as there are no dual interpretations that could work against the speaker.

**Step 4: Classify the Argument**
- Based on the comparison, the argument "People either like coffee or hate it." is best classified as <FE> False Enumeration because it incorrectly limits the possible attitudes towards coffee to only two options.

### Conclusion:
The argument "People either like coffee or hate it." is classified under the defective argument type <FE> (False Enumeration).
