Sure, let's apply the steps of <IDAA> to classify the string "Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified. Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true? Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so. Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct? Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true. Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true? Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of the Task (D)

1. **Identify Key Propositions and Claims:**
   - Speaker 1 claims "Jesus was not really crucified."
   - Speaker 1 supports this claim by referring to the Quran.
   - When asked about the validity of the Quran, Speaker 1 claims it is true because it is the Word of God.
   - Speaker 1 further supports the claim by saying that God confirms it in the Quran.

2. **Analyze the Logical Structure of Arguments:**
   - Assess whether the reasons given logically support the proposition.
   - Evaluate if the reasoning involves circular logic, redundant explanations, or assumptions not logically justified.

3. **Classify Each Argument Type:**
   - Compare each step of reasoning to the definitions provided: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>.

### Application of Decomposition to the Given Text

1. **Identify Key Propositions and Claims:**
   - Initial Claim: "Jesus was not really crucified."
   - Reason Provided: "Because the Quran says so."
   - Challenge to Reason: "How do I know the Quran is correct?"
   - Justification: "Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true."
   - Further Challenge: "How do I know that’s true?"
   - Final Justification: "Because God tells us so, here in the Koran."

2. **Analyze the Logical Structure of Arguments:**
   - The argument relies on the Quran as the primary source of truth.
   - The validity of the Quran is justified by stating it is the Word of God.
   - This justification itself refers back to the Quran for validation, creating a circular reasoning.

3. **Classify Each Argument Type:**
   - The primary flaw here is circular reasoning: the proposition is validated by referencing itself without independent support.

### Classification of the Argument Type

The argument type presented here falls under:

- **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason):** The reason provided to support the claim ("the Quran says so") does not logically support the proposition by independent or verifiable means. It relies on circular reasoning, making the justification invalid as it refers back to itself without external validation.

Hence, the classification of the string is **<IR>**.
