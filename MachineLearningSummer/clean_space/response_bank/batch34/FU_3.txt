For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding.", we'll perform the following steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of Task <IDA> (Identifying Defective Argument Type)
1. **Identify the proposition or argument being made in the string.**
2. **Determine the logical structure and reasoning used in the argument.**
3. **Compare the argument structure against the definitions of each defective argument type: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.**
4. **Classify the argument based on which defective argument type it most closely matches.**

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition or Argument
- The argument being made is: "I wasn't speeding because I was driving as fast as everyone around me."

### Step 2: Determine the Logical Structure and Reasoning
- The driver is providing a justifying reason for not being guilty of speeding, which is that everyone else was driving at the same speed.

### Step 3: Compare Against Definitions of Defective Argument Types
- **<G> (Generalization):** The argument does not claim a general truth based on a specific instance. This is about the driver's specific situation.
- **<FE> (False Enumeration):** The argument does not list options; it provides a reason for a specific claim.
- **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason):** The argument might be giving a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition. However, this needs closer inspection.
- **<RR> (Redundant Reason):** The argument is not repeating itself in different words.
- **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis):** The argument does not provide a weak causal relationship.
- **<FU> (False Universals):** The argument appeals to what others are doing as validation for the driverâ€™s own actions, making it a case of appealing to popularity.
- **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases):** The argument does not use statements open to dual interpretations.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
- The argument "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me." matches the definition of **<FU> (False Universals)** since it appeals to the fact that many people (everyone around) were doing the same thing as an attempt to validate not being guilty of speeding.

### Conclusion
The defective argument type for the given string "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding." is **<FU> (False Universals)**.
