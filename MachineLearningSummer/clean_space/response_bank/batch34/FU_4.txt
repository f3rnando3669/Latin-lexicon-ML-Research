For 
To apply <IDAA> to "Everyone else is doing it, so should you", we will decompose the task <IDA> of classifying the string as one of the given defective argument types into specific steps. Here is the decomposition of the classification task:

1. **Identify and Understand the Proposition**: Analyze the statement to understand what is being claimed.
2. **Compare with Definitions**: Compare the statement against the definitions of each defective argument type (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).
3. **Match Identification**: Determine which definition best fits the given statement.
4. **Justify the Classification**: Provide reasoning for why the identified definition is the best fit.

### Step 1: Identify and Understand the Proposition

The proposition in the statement "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" is essentially arguing that the action should be taken because it is a popular choice among others.

### Step 2: Compare with Definitions

- **<G> (Generalization)**: Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance. This doesn't seem to apply because it is not making a generalization based on a single instance.
- **<FE> (False Enumeration)**: Listing fewer or more options than actually exist. This doesn't seem to apply as the statement is not enumerating options.
- **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**: Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition. Though it could be seen as inappropriate, it doesn't fit this category robustly.
- **<RR> (Redundant Reason)**: Reasoning that just restates the proposition differently. The statement does not seem redundant.
- **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**: Offering a weak causal basis. The statement is more of a social reasoning than causality.
- **<FU> (False Universals)**: Asserting universally agreed points without proof. The statement closely fits this, as it appeals to the popularity of an action without providing actual proof.
- **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)**: Using statements open to dual interpretations. This does not apply.

### Step 3: Match Identification

The statement "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" best matches the definition of **<FU> (False Universals)**, which asserts a point (that you should do something) based on the popularity of the action without providing substantive proof.

### Step 4: Justify the Classification

This classification as **<FU>** is justified because the argument relies on the popularity of the action ("everyone else is doing it") to validate the proposition ("so should you"), which is an example of an appeal to popularity, a common type of false universal reasoning.

So, the string "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" is classified as type **<FU> (False Universals)**.
