For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given statement, "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess all the other classes will all fail it, too," we'll follow these steps:

1. **Decompose the Task (<D>):**
   - Step 1: Identify the components of the statement.
   - Step 2: Analyze the nature of the argument provided in the statement.
   - Step 3: Compare the argument's characteristics to the defined defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).
   - Step 4: Classify the statement as one of the defective argument types.

2. **Apply the Decomposition to <IDA> (Classifying the Type):**

### Step 1: Identify the Components of the Statement
- Statement: "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess all the other classes will all fail it, too."

### Step 2: Analyze the Nature of the Argument Provided in the Statement
- The argument starts with a specific instance: "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz."
- It concludes with a generalization: "all the other classes will all fail it, too."

### Step 3: Compare the Argument's Characteristics to the Defined Defective Argument Types
- **<G> Generalization:** This type involves claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
  - The statement moves from three kids in one class failing a quiz to a broad claim about all other classes.
- **<FE> False Enumeration:** This type involves wrongly limiting or expanding the number of options.
  - The statement doesn’t involve offering fewer or more options.
- **<IR> Inappropriate Reason:** This involves providing an illogical reason for a conclusion.
  - The statement doesn’t offer an illogical reason; it just generalizes.
- **<RR> Redundant Reason:** This type uses different words to assert the same proposition.
  - The statement doesn’t redundantly restate a proposition.
- **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis:** This type provides a weak causal basis for a proposition.
  - The statement isn’t based on a weak causal relationship.
- **<FU> False Universals:** This asserts universally agreed points without proof.
  - The statement doesn’t assert something universally agreed upon.
- **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases:** This involves statements open to dual interpretations.
  - The statement doesn’t use double-edged phrases open to dual interpretations.

### Step 4: Classify the Statement as One of the Defective Argument Types
- Based on the analysis, the given statement is a **Generalization (G)** because it claims a general truth based on a specific instance.

Thus, the classification <IDA> of the statement "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess all the other classes will all fail it, too." is:
- **<G>**
