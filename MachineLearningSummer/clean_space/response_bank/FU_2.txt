To determine the type of defective argument present in the statement "Ninety percent of all people surveyed said that McDonald's is better than Burger King so it must be true," let's break this down using the step-by-step approach:

1. **Step 1**: Read and understand the argument in the string.
   - Statement: "Ninety percent of all people surveyed said that McDonald's is better than Burger King so it must be true."

2. **Step 2**: Identify the proposition being argued.
   - Proposition: "It must be true that McDonald's is better than Burger King."

3. **Step 3**: Check if the reason provided supports the proposition.
   - Reason: "Ninety percent of all people surveyed said that McDonald's is better than Burger King."

   - This reason is based on a survey, so it does provide support, but we need to see if it's logical.

4. **Step 4**: Examine if the proposition claims a general truth derived from a specific instance.
   - In this case, it is using data from a survey, so it represents a collective opinion rather than a single instance. This doesn't fit the **<G>** category.

5. **Step 5**: Evaluate if the argument involves an incomplete or faulty enumeration.
   - The argument doesn't limit options but references survey results. This doesn’t fit **<FE>**.

6. **Step 6**: Determine if the argument merely restates the proposition in different words.
   - The statement "Ninety percent of people surveyed said X, so X must be true" isn’t a restatement. This doesn’t fit **<RR>**.

7. **Step 7**: Assess if the reason given is weak or not compelling enough to support the proposition.
   - The compellingness of the survey data can be questioned based on sampling bias, but not inherently weak enough for **<WCB>**.

8. **Step 8**: Check if the argument asserts universally agreed points without proof.
   - The statement is about survey results, not an assertion of a universal point. This doesn’t fit **<FU>**.

9. **Step 9**: Identify if the statement can be interpreted in multiple (often contradictory) ways.
   - The statement is straightforward, based on survey data. This doesn’t fit **<DEP>**.

Here, the argument in the statement "Ninety percent of all people surveyed said that McDonald's is better than Burger King so it must be true" seems to rely on the **appeal to popular opinion** or **bandwagon fallacy**:
- It’s trying to logic that because many people believe something, it must be true. While not explicitly presented in your defective argument types, it most closely matches:

### Logical Fallacy Framework:
- The appeal to popularity ignores potential biases in surveyed populations and does not logically prove the proposition true regardless of popularity.

Given the provided categories, we don’t fit it precisely within **<G>**, **<FE>**, **<IR>**, **<RR>**, **<WCB>**, **<FU>**, or **<DEP>**. But if we had to choose, it might be seen as **<WCB>** in a roundabout way because the reasoning (popularity) is not compelling enough alone to conclusively support the claim. 

 So applying **<IDAA>**, **<WCB>** (Weakly Compelling Basis) might be an appropriate fit. Specifically, if survey credibility is questioned, the reason doesn't robustly prove the proposition.
