For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "The Bible is the Word of God because God tells us it is... in the Bible," we need to decompose the task of classifying <s> into specific steps and then execute those steps methodically.

Let's start by breaking down <IDA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition <P>:** This is the assertion we intend to prove.
   - <P>: "The Bible is the Word of God."

2. **Identify the Reason <R>:** This is the causal basis for the proposition.
   - <R>: "Because God tells us it is... in the Bible."

3. **Classify the Defective Argument:**
   - We need to compare <R> with defective argument types to find the match.

Now, let's analyze the string step by step:

### Step 1: Generalization (G)
- Check if <P> is an assertion based on some part or majority of individuals but not necessarily applicable to all.
  - This doesn't apply because the assertion isn't about individuals.

### Step 2: Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
- Check if the argument is claiming a complete enumeration of possibilities but misses some.
  - This doesn't apply because there’s no enumeration of possibilities.

### Step 3: Inconclusive Reason (IR)
- Check if <R> does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of <P>.
  - <R> uses the Bible as evidence that the Bible is the Word of God. This doesn’t conclusively prove <P> because it relies on the source it is trying to validate.

### Step 4: Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
- Check if <R> is essentially just a repetition of <P>.
  - Let's break it down:
    - <P>: "The Bible is the Word of God."
    - <R>: "Because God tells us it is... in the Bible."
    - <R> is claiming <P> using <P> itself as evidence (circular reasoning).

### Step 5: Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
- Check if <R> is weak or not compelling in establishing <P>.
  - The reasoning here is circular rather than weak in causal basis.

### Step 6: Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
- Check if the argument assumes consensus or popularity as proof.
  - This doesn't seem to apply because it doesn’t rely on popularity or general consensus.

### Step 7: Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)
- Check if there's any ambiguous language.
  - The language is clear; the issue is rather with the reasoning, not ambiguity.

After analysis, it's clear that the given argument fits **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** since it states:

- <P>: "The Bible is the Word of God."
- <R>: "Because God tells us it is... in the Bible."

The reason is just a reiteration of the proposition attempting to validate itself.

Therefore, the classification <s> is:
- **<s>: RR**
