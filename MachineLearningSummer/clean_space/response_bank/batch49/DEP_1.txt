For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying <s> as a specific type of defective argument) to the string "I didn’t steal your pen—I borrowed it", we will follow a series of steps. 

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Step 1: Identify the Argument's Core Components
First, we need to dissect the statement to understand its core components: 
- **Proposition (P)**: "I didn’t steal your pen"
- **Reason (R)**: "I borrowed it"

#### Step 2: Identify the Nature of Any Defective Argument
Next, we analyze whether this statement fits into any of the defective argument categories defined:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Not applicable. The statement is specific and does not generalize based on a small subset.
  
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not applicable. The statement doesn’t claim to cover all possible scenarios or options.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Not applicable. The reason provided here isn’t attacking another position but giving a reason for a specific claim.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Not applicable. The reason given isn't inherently cited as a causal basis that is insufficient.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Not applicable. The statement doesn't repeat the proposition in its reason.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Not applicable. There is no assumed certainty based on universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: This appears to be a match. The term "borrowed" can be interpreted in different ways:
    - Borrowing typically implies permission and intention to return, which is not explicitly clear in this context.
    - The speaker might be using "borrowed" to downplay what the other person considers "stealing."

#### Step 3: Confirm and Classify
Finally, confirm the classification:
- The ambiguity lies in the use of the term "borrowed". Far from stealing, borrowing usually implies both permission and intent to return the pen, which is not clarified in this context.

### Classification
Thus, the most fitting classification for the statement "I didn’t steal your pen—I borrowed it" is:

**<DEP>** (Ambiguous Language Use). 

This concludes the application of IDAA to the given string.
