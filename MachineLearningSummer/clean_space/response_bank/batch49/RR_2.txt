For 
To apply the task of <IDAA> (the application of decomposing <IDA> into specific steps) to classify the string "Only a mentally ill person would kill someone, so anyone who kills someone is automatically mentally ill.", we break the task <IDA> into specific steps as follows:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) in the argument:**
   - "Anyone who kills someone is automatically mentally ill."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>) provided to support the Proposition:**
   - "Only a mentally ill person would kill someone."

3. **Classify the argument based on the defective argument types:**

   - **Generalization (<G>):**
     - The argument seems to involve overgeneralization, as it takes a specific characteristic (mentally ill people being capable of killing) and applies it universally to all individuals who kill. It assumes that all killers must be mentally ill without sufficient evidence to support this claim.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
     - The argument doesn’t appear to list multiple possibilities or alternatives, so it doesn't fit into this category.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
     - The reason provided "Only a mentally ill person would kill someone" doesn’t conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. It doesn’t provide concrete evidence as to why this assertion is true, indicating that the reason may be inconclusive.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
     - The causal basis "Only a mentally ill person would kill someone" is not compelling enough. It assumes a direct causal relationship without substantial proof.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
     - The reason provided is not simply a repetition of the proposition; it attempts to provide a basis, so this does not apply.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
     - The argument doesn’t rely on a presumed consensus but rather makes a general assertion, so this category doesn’t apply.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
     - The language used here is not ambiguous or open to different interpretations in a way that would change the meaning significantly.

After examining the defective arguments, we found that:
1. It predominantly fits into the **Generalization (<G>)** category because it assumes a characteristic (mental illness) applies universally.
2. It also notably aligns with **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**, as it lacks solid evidence and causality.

Given the instruction to choose <G> if <s> fits in that category, we classify the argument as:

**<G>**
