For 
To apply the IDAA (the application of the decomposition of the IDA task) to the string "You can tell that guy's Mexican - he's wearing a sombrero.", we need to break down the process into specific steps to classify which type of defective argument it is.

### Decomposition Steps (<D>):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Determine what the main claim or assertion is.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Determine what the supporting reason for the proposition is.
3. **Classify the Argument:** Based on the identified proposition and reason, classify the argument into one of the defective types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

### Application of <IDAA>:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- **Proposition:** "You can tell that guy's Mexican."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- **Reason:** "He's wearing a sombrero."

#### Step 3: Classify the Argument
Now we determine which category the argument fits into based on the proposition and reason:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - This occurs when a general statement is made based on limited evidence.
   - The given proposition is that the person must be Mexican based on wearing a sombrero, which is a generalization based on a stereotype.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - This applies when options are limited to just a few, ignoring other possibilities.
   - This does not fit as well here because the argument does not enumerate possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Here, <R> does not conclusively prove <P>.
   - Wearing a sombrero is not a conclusive reason to determine someone's nationality. However, this argument is more about stereotypical generalization rather than inconclusiveness alone.
   
4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - This happens when the reason is a rephrasing of the proposition.
   - This does not apply because the reason is not simply repeating the proposition.
   
5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - This is when the cause provided does not sufficiently justify the proposition.
   - While the causal link here is weak, it is more specifically about generalizing a single characteristic to an entire population.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - This is assuming something is true based on the supposed agreement of others.
   - This does not fit well as the argument does not rely on universal consensus.
   
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - This occurs if the language can be taken in more than one way.
   - The argument here is not ambiguous but rather basing a nationality on an item of clothing.

Given the types of defective arguments, the argument "You can tell that guy's Mexican - he's wearing a sombrero." fits best into the category of **Generalization (G)**, as it makes an assertion about a person's nationality based on a stereotypical attribute. Consequently, <s> should be classified as <G>.

### Classification:
<s> = "You can tell that guy's Mexican - he's wearing a sombrero."
Classification: <G>
