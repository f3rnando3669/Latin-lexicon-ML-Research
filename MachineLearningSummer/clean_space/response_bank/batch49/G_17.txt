For 
To apply <IDAA> (the process of decomposing the classification task IDA into specific steps) to the argument "We can’t freeze the academic year because then students won’t graduate on time. Next thing you know most people will be unemployed and will resort to crime. The crime rate will skyrocket and society will collapse," we need to break down the task of identifying the logical fallacy into smaller steps. Let's proceed step by step:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Proposition: "We can’t freeze the academic year."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Reason: "because then students won’t graduate on time."

3. **Identify any Proof of Reason (PR) provided:**
   - Proof of Reason: "Next thing you know most people will be unemployed and will resort to crime. The crime rate will skyrocket and society will collapse."

4. **Analyze the Reason for clarity and conclusiveness:**
   - The Reason assumes that students not graduating on time directly leads to unemployment and crime. This is a causal chain with multiple steps that are not demonstrated.

5. **Check for Presence of Common Logical Fallacies:**
   - **Generalization (G):** Not applicable, as the argument is not making a broad generalization about a group.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable, there’s no claim of exhaustive options.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** These reasons don’t conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason provided is different from the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis provided does not compellingly support the proposition due to the many unsubstantiated intermediate steps.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This argument does not rely on a supposed universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** No ambiguous language is present.

6. **Determine the best fit for the argument:**
   - The best fit for this argument is <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis), because the causal chain provided (students not graduating on time leads to unemployment, which leads to crime and societal collapse) is weak and based on many unproven assumptions.

### Conclusion:
The argument "We can’t freeze the academic year because then students won’t graduate on time. Next thing you know most people will be unemployed and will resort to crime. The crime rate will skyrocket and society will collapse." is best classified under <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).

By following these steps, we have decomposed the complex task into manageable parts and determined the defective argument type.
