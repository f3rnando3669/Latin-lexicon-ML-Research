For 
To apply the IDAA to the string "Jews are lice; They cause typhus (Painful/deadly disease)," we need to decompose the advanced task of classifying the argument into specific steps and then apply those steps to the string for analysis. 

Hereâ€™s the process:

1. **Identify the Proposition \( \text{P} \) and Reason \( \text{R} \)**:
   - Proposition \( \text{P} \): "Jews are lice"
   - Reason \( \text{R} \): "They cause typhus (Painful/deadly disease)"

2. **Determine if the Proposition \( \text{P} \) fits into a defective argument type \(\text{G}\)**:
   - A Generalization argument \( \text{G} \) occurs when the argument makes an assertion about a whole group based on some one part or majority of individuals. 
   - Here, \( \text{P} \) is saying that "Jews are lice," which is a sweeping generalization suggesting a characteristic (lice) applies to all Jews, making it a \( \text{G} \).
   
Since the argument fits into the category of \( \text{G} \), we classify it accordingly. 

Therefore, the argument "Jews are lice; They cause typhus (Painful/deadly disease)" is identified as a defective argument type Generalization \(\text{G}\).
