For 
To apply IDAA (the application of the decomposition of an advanced task into specific steps) to classify the string "Everyone seems to support the changes in the vacation policy, and if everyone likes them, they must be good." as one of the defective argument types, we will break down the task into smaller steps and apply them sequentially.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition <P>:**
   - The proposition (what is intended to be proved) is: "the changes in the vacation policy are good."

2. **Identify the Reason <R>:**
   - The reason given to support the proposition is: "everyone seems to support the changes in the vacation policy."

3. **Analyze the Reason and Identify Proof of Reason <PR>:**
   - The proof of the reason is implied by the clause: "if everyone likes them, they must be good."

4. **Classify the Argument:**
   - Next, we need to classify the argument based on the defective argument types defined (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Is it a Generalization (<G>)?**
   - The argument is not directly stating that an attribute of some individuals applies to all.

2. **Is it an Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)?**
   - The argument is not presenting a limited choice and claiming it to be exhaustive.

3. **Is it an Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)?**
   - The argument's reason does not seem inherently correct or incorrect based on the reason's conclusion.

4. **Is it a Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)?**
   - The reason provided is not a direct repetition of the proposition.

5. **Is it an Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)?**
   - The argument does not hinge on an insufficient causal basis.

6. **Is it a Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)?**
   - The argument is assuming that because "everyone" supports the changes, the changes must be good. This does fit the category of Presumptuous Consensus because it appeals to popularity ("if everyone likes them, they must be good").

7. **Is it Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)?**
   - The argument does not rely on an ambiguous use of language.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above step-by-step analysis, the argument "Everyone seems to support the changes in the vacation policy, and if everyone likes them, they must be good." fits the classification of **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**.

So, applying IDAA to the given string, we classify it as:

**Classification: FU**
