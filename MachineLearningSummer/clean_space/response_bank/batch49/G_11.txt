For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to the given string "Some students who attend tutoring over the summer are not very intelligent. Since Beth attended summer tutoring, she is not a very good student," we will decompose the task \( \text{IDA} \) step by step to classify the string according to the provided defective argument types. 

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for \( \text{IDAA} \):

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( P \)) in the string:**
    - The proposition is "Since Beth attended summer tutoring, she is not a very good student."

2. **Identify the Reason (\( R \)) given for the \( P \):**
    - The reason provided is "Some students who attend tutoring over the summer are not very intelligent."

3. **Examine if the \( R \) and \( P \) are logically connected and supported:**
    - Determine if the reason conclusively supports the proposition.

### Detailed Analysis and Classification:

1. **Is the statement a Generalization (\( G \)):**
    - Check if the assertion is based on a part or majority and is incorrectly applied to all.
    - "Some students who attend tutoring over the summer are not very intelligent" generalizes from "some" to include "since Beth attended summer tutoring, she is not a very good student."
    - This fits the definition of a Generalization (\( G \)).

2. **Is the statement an Incomplete Enumeration (\( FE \)):**
    - Check for claiming a complete enumeration of possibilities but miss some.
    - The string does not enumerate possibilities.

3. **Is the statement presenting an Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \)):**
    - Determine if the reason fails to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
    - Though it may be inconclusive, if a better match is found earlier, we prioritize that.

4. **Is the statement indicating an Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \)):**
    - Evaluate if the causal basis is compelling.
    - The causal connection between attending tutoring and intelligence is weak, but a better match is found earlier.

5. **Is the statement a Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( RR \)):**
    - Determine if the reason repeats the proposition.
    - No repetition of the same idea.

6. **Is the statement showing Presumptuous Consensus (\( FU \)):**
    - Check if a fact is claimed based on presumed universal agreement.
    - There is no appeal to popularity.

7. **Is the statement using Ambiguous Language (\( DEP \)):**
    - Determine if language is intended or interpreted ambiguously.
    - There is no ambiguous language use.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above analysis, the string fits in category \( G \) (Generalization). Therefore, the classification is:

"The string 'Some students who attend tutoring over the summer are not very intelligent. Since Beth attended summer tutoring, she is not a very good student' is classified as \( G \) (Generalization)."
