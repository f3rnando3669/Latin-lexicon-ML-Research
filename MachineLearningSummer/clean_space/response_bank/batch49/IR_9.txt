To apply the process of decomposition and classification to the argument "Studies show that it takes up to seven years for the human body to digest a piece of gum," we'll follow a structured approach using the definitions provided. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Decompose the Argument
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition (<P>): "It takes up to seven years for the human body to digest a piece of gum."
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason (<R>): "Studies show that…"

### Step 2: Classify the Argument (Apply <IDA>)
1. **Check for Generalization (<G>):**
   - A generalization would assert that an attribute of one or several cases is true for all cases. Here the claim is about the digestion time of gum, but there is no mention of a generalization across a population.
   - **Result:** Not <G>.

2. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - This fallacy involves ensuring all possibilities are considered in an enumeration. The argument doesn't present a false dichotomy or limited choices.
   - **Result:** Not <FE>.

3. **Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - In this case, the reasoning provided includes "Studies show that…", which attempts to give empirical support. If these studies are inconclusive or misinterpreted, it could fit into <IR>.
   - **Situation Analysis:** The claim about digestion is a myth and not based on actual studies. Hence, the statement could be labeled as inconclusive reasoning.
   - **Result:** Leaning towards <IR>.

4. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - In this case, the proposition is not simply being repeated in the reason. The reason and proposition are distinct, though the reason is unclear.
   - **Result:** Not <RR>.

5. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - If the causal basis itself is weak or unclear. If the "Studies" referenced are either misquoted or weakly linked to the claim, this could fit under <WCB>.
   - **Result:** Could fit, but we're supposed to choose <IR> if it's a match.

6. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - Here might be the situation where it's assumed everyone believes it because "Studies show…" which may presume consensus on a disputed or myth-based fact.
   - **Result:** Can be argued, but not conclusive as it's more about incorrect empirical support rather than assumed consensus.

7. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - The terms aren't used in a way that they can be interpreted in multiple ways.
   - **Result:** Not <DEP>.

### Step 3: Final Classification Based on Decomposition
Given the above analysis:

- **Primary Defective Argument Type:** **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**

The strength and relevance of the evidence (studies) cited don't conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition that gum takes seven years to digest. This is recognized as the argument primarily presenting an inconclusive reason.

### Conclusion:

The correct classification of the string "Studies show that it takes up to seven years for the human body to digest a piece of gum," following the decomposition and analysis framework, is **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**.
