For 
To apply the task <IDAA> to classify the string "You moved the goalposts or made up an exception when your claim was shown to be false." as one of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>), we will need to decompose the task into specific steps and then classify the string step by step.

### Decomposition of <t> into specific steps:
1. **Identify the meaning of the statement.**
2. **Determine the nature of the defect in the argument, if any.**
3. **Match the identified defect with one of the known defective argument types.**
4. **Classify the string accordingly.**

### Step-by-Step Application of <D> to <IDA>:

**Step 1: Identify the meaning of the statement.**
- The statement "You moved the goalposts or made up an exception when your claim was shown to be false" generally refers to a situation where someone changes the criteria for success or finding truth after their original claim has been disproven.

**Step 2: Determine the nature of the defect in the argument, if any.**
- This type of behavior indicates an attempt to avoid admitting being wrong by constantly shifting the standards or introducing exceptions that were not originally part of the argument.

**Step 3: Match the identified defect with one of the known defective argument types.**
- Let's review the defective argument types:
  - **<G>: Generalization** - Not applicable, as there's no broad assertion based on a limited sample.
  - **<FE>: Incomplete Enumeration** - Not applicable, as there's no incomplete listing of options in this context.
  - **<IR>: Inconclusive Reason** - Not applicable, as this isn't about a reason failing to support a proposition.
  - **<WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis** - Not applicable, as there's no weak causal link being discussed here.
  - **<RR>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition** - Not applicable, as there's no repetition of the proposition.
  - **<FU>: Presumptuous Consensus** - Not applicable, as this isn't about claiming something is true because itâ€™s universally agreed upon.
  - **<DEP>: Ambiguous Language Use** - Not applicable, as there's no ambiguous language.

**Step 4: Classify the string accordingly.**
- None of the listed defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) directly match the behavior described in the string "You moved the goalposts or made up an exception when your claim was shown to be false."
- However, in critical thinking and logic, this behavior is often referred to as the **"Moving the Goalposts"** fallacy, which involves changing the criteria to win an argument after the original criteria have failed. This specific fallacy isn't listed among the defective argument types provided, but it is recognized as a common logical fallacy.

### Conclusion:
The provided defective argument types do not directly cover the "Moving the Goalposts" fallacy. Therefore, based on the given types, the statement cannot be classified under <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>. The string "You moved the goalposts or made up an exception when your claim was shown to be false." represents the "Moving the Goalposts" fallacy, which is not among the types defined in the original instructions.
