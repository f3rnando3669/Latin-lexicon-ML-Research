For 
To apply IDAA to the statement "Is your stupidity inborn?", we will decompose the task of identifying the logical fallacy into specific steps and then apply these steps to classify the statement.

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Identify the Proposition (P) and Reason (R)**:
   - Establish what is being claimed or suggested in the statement "Is your stupidity inborn?"

2. **Evaluate the Proposition (P)**:
   - Determine if the proposition makes a general assertion or a universal claim.

3. **Analyze the Reason (R)**:
   - Determine if the reason provided (implicitly or explicitly) supports the proposition.

4. **Cross-check against Defective Argument Types**:
   - Compare the argument against each defective argument type definition to determine the best fit.

### Application to "Is your stupidity inborn?"

1. **Identify the Proposition (P) and Reason (R)**:
   - Proposition (P): The statement implies that the person's stupidity is a result of an inborn trait.
   - Reason (R): The reason is implied to be the inborn characteristic of stupidity.

2. **Evaluate the Proposition (P)**:
   - The proposition is an assertion about the nature (inborn) of a character trait (stupidity).

3. **Analyze the Reason (R)**:
   - The reason is based on the assumption that stupidity is determined at birth (nature over nurture argument), but it does not provide a scientific basis or evidence to support this claim.

4. **Cross-check against Defective Argument Types**:
   - **<G> Generalization**: This does not fit as it does not generalize from a sample to a population.
   - **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: This is not a case of presenting limited choices.
   - **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The suggestion does not provide a sound reason.
   - **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: The reason is not simply a repetition of the proposition.
   - **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: There is no compelling causal link provided to establish the inborn nature of stupidity.
   - **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: The statement does not assume universal agreement.
   - **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: There is no ambiguity in the language used here.

### Final Classification:

The most fitting defective argument type for the statement "Is your stupidity inborn?" is **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**, as it makes a claim (stupidity is inborn) without providing a compelling causal basis for the statement.

Thus, the classification for the statement:

**"Is your stupidity inborn?"** -> **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**
