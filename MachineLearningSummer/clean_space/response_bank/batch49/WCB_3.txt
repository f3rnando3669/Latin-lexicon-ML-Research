For 
To apply <IDAA> (Decomposition of the task of classifying a string as a defective argument type into specific steps) to the given string, we'll proceed step by step to determine the category of the argument presented:

1. **Read and Understand the Argument**:
   - The report suggests that 'the rise in violent offending and the explosion in the sales of iPods and other portable media devices is more than coincidental,' and asks, rather provocatively, 'Is There an iCrime Wave?'
   - The report notes that nationally, violent crime fell every year from 1993 to 2004, before rising in 2005 and 2006, just as 'America’s streets filled with millions of people visibly wearing, and being distracted by, expensive electronic gear.'

2. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - The proposition is that there is a potential link ("more than coincidental") between the rise in violent offending and the explosion in the sales of iPods and other portable media devices.

3. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - The reason provided is the correlation observed: violent crime fell from 1993 to 2004 but then rose in 2005 and 2006, coinciding with the rise in the use of portable media devices.

4. **Analyze the Argument**:
   - Determine if the reason conclusively establishes the truth of the proposition.
   - Evaluate if the reasoning is logically sound or if it falls into one of the defective argument types.

5. **Check for Defective Argument Types**:
   - **<G> Generalization**:
     - Does it generalize from a subset of the data and apply it to all cases? No, this is not a broad generalization.
   - **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**:
     - Does it falsely present limited choices or possibilities? No, it doesn’t present a dichotomy.
   - **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**:
     - Does the reason not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition? Look closer. 
       - The reasoning relies on correlation rather than causation—it implies that because two events occurred together, one must have caused the other, which is not necessarily true.
   - **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**:
     - Does the reason merely repeat the proposition? No.
   - **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**:
     - Does the reason not provide a strong causal link? Yes, the causal link is suggested but not substantiated with direct evidence establishing causality.
   - **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**:
     - Does it assume consensus without support? No, it does not presume universal agreement.
   - **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**:
     - Is there ambiguous language? No apparent ambiguous language in the provided context.

6. **Determine the Most Fitting Defective Argument Type**:
   - The argument suggests a causation based merely on correlation without robust evidence to support that one event caused the other.
   - This can be classified as <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) because the correlation between the rise in violent crime and the increase in the sale of iPods does not conclusively demonstrate that the former is caused by the latter.

Therefore, the string can be classified as:
**<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**.
