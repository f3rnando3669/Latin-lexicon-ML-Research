For 
Sure, let's apply the process <IDAA> to classify the given string "The United States is the wealthiest nation in the world. So every American is wealthy." step by step.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: 
   - **P** here is "Every American is wealthy."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: 
   - **R** here is "The United States is the wealthiest nation in the world."

3. **Examine the Argument Type**:
   - According to the definitions of defective argument types provided:
     - **G (Generalization)** involves making an assertion based on some or the majority but not necessarily applicable to all.
     - **FE (Incomplete Enumeration)** is when all possibilities are not considered.
     - **IR (Inconclusive Reason)** is when the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition.
     - **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)** is when the reason says the same thing as the proposition.
     - **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)** is when the causal basis is weak.
     - **FU (Presumptuous Consensus)** is assuming something as true because it is allegedly universally agreed upon.
     - **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use)** refers to ambiguity in the proof's language.

### Application of Decomposition to the String:

1. **Classification based on P and R**:
   - The proposition "Every American is wealthy" is based on the reason "The United States is the wealthiest nation in the world." 
   - The reasoning connects wealth of a nation directly to each individualâ€™s wealth, which oversimplifies and generalizes the matter.

2. **Matching the Argument Type**:
   - This fits the definition of **G (Generalization)**. The argument makes a broad assertion about all Americans based on the status of the nation as a whole.

### Conclusion:
After decomposing the advanced task and examining the argument, we can categorize the given string "The United States is the wealthiest nation in the world. So every American is wealthy." as type **G (Generalization)**.

Therefore, the classification <s> of the given string is **G**.
