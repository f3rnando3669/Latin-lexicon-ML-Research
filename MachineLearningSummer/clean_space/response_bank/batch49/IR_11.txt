For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given statement, let's break down the process step by step:

1. **Understand the Statement (s):**
   - "The Supreme Court right now is deciding whether it is right to execute insane people who have committed murder. I think it is all right to execute insane people. If we ban executions of insane people, then everybody on death row will suddenly decide they are insane and purposely fail sanity tests. It would result in chaos."

2. **Break Down the Statement:**
   - Proposition (P): The main assertion here is "It is all right to execute insane people."
   - Reason (R): The reason provided is that banning executions of insane people would lead to everyone on death row claiming insanity and failing sanity tests purposely.
   - Proof of Reason (PR): This essentially claims that banning the execution of insane people would result in chaos.

3. **Identify the Defective Argument Types (IDA):**
   - Check for Generalization (<G>): Is the statement making a broad assertion based on a limited sample?
     - No, it's not making a generalization about a group of people.
   - Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>): Is the statement presenting a false dichotomy or ignoring other possibilities?
     - Yes, it presents a false dichotomy. It claims that the only two possibilities are executing insane people or having everyone on death row claiming insanity. This fits the description of Incomplete Enumeration.
   - Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>): Is the reason provided insufficient to conclusively prove the proposition?
     - The reason given is not directly addressing whether it is morally right to execute insane people, just the potential consequence of not doing so.
   - Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>): Is the stated causal relationship weak or unsubstantiated?
     - The causal relationship is weak and based on an assumption that everyone would claim insanity, which is not substantiated.
   - Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>): Is the Proposition repeated in the Reason?
     - No, the Reason provides a different point.
   - Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>): Is there an assumption that something is universally agreed upon?
     - No, this is not present in the statement.
   - Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>): Is there any vague or ambiguous language?
     - No, the language is quite clear.

4. **Determine the Predominant Defective Argument Type:**
   - Based on the identified potential issues, the statement mostly represents an Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), as it falsely presents a limited set of possibilities.

5. **Classify the Statement:**
   - Therefore, the logical fallacy in the statement is best classified as <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration).

This completes the application of <IDAA> to classify the given statement:
"The Supreme Court right now is deciding whether it is right to execute insane people who have committed murder. I think it is all right to execute insane people. If we ban executions of insane people, then everybody on death row will suddenly decide they are insane and purposely fail sanity tests. It would result in chaos." is classified as <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration).
