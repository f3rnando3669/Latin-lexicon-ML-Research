For 
Applying \<IDAA\> (the application of decomposed tasks) to the given string "It’s getting late, and we still have to decide on the school budget. What do you say we just leave it as is and we can call it a night?", the steps are as follows:

1. **Identify the Type of Defective Argument (\<IDA\>) for the string (\<s\>)**:
    - Determine which defective argument type (\<G\>, \<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<RR\>, \<WCB\>, \<FU\>, or \<DEP\>) applies to the given statement.

2. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
    - **Step 1: Recognize and understand the proposition (\<P\>)**:
        - In the statement, the proposition is: "We should leave the school budget as it is."
    
    - **Step 2: Identify the reason (\<R\>) given to support the proposition**:
        - The reason provided is: "It’s getting late."
    
    - **Step 3: Determine if the reason (\<R\>) is relevant and conclusive**:
        - Evaluate whether the reason given ("It’s getting late") is a strong basis to support the proposition about leaving the school budget unchanged.
    
    - **Step 4: Check for common patterns related to defective arguments**:
        - Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>): Claims only two options without considering other alternatives.
        - Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>): The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
        - Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>): The causal basis is weak or not compelling.
        - Others as defined.

3. **Categorize the Argument**:
    - The provided reason ("It’s getting late") does not adequately support the proposition ("We should leave the school budget as it is").
    - This is a case where the reason given is irrelevant or does not sufficiently justify the proposition, making it an example of **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**.

**Conclusion**:
The statement "It’s getting late, and we still have to decide on the school budget. What do you say we just leave it as is and we can call it a night?" is classified as:
- **\<IR\>** - Inconclusive Reason, because the reason given ("It’s getting late") does not sufficiently justify or conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition ("We should leave the school budget as it is").

Thus:
- Applying **IDAA** to the given string, we conclude that the argument belongs to the category **\<IR\>**.
