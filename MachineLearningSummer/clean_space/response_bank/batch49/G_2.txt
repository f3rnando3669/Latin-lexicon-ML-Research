For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task IDA into specific steps) to the given string "The more things change, the more they remain the same.", we need to systematically classify the argument based on the provided defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

Let's break this down into specific steps:

**Step 1: Preliminary Evaluation**
- Read the string: "The more things change, the more they remain the same."
- Identify the type of argument it presents by looking for telltale signs of defective argumentation.

**Step 2: Check for Generalization (<G>)**
- Determine if the statement is a broad assertion based on limited evidence.
- In this case, the statement seems to be a general saying or aphorism and does not provide evidence regarding a subset of a group.

**Step 3: Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
- Determine if the statement suggests a limited set of options or outcomes, missing out on other possibilities.
- The statement does not list options or possibilities; it asserts a constant outcome related to change.

**Step 4: Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- Look for a reason that does not conclusively prove the proposition.
- The statement provides no explicit reasoning; it states an aphorism that doesn’t have an argument structure with a reason and a conclusion.

**Step 5: Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
- Evaluate if there is a weak causal claim.
- This statement does not emphasize a causal relationship or any reasoning submitted for a proposition.

**Step 6: Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**
- Assess if the reason given is the same as the proposition.
- There’s no reasoning given that restates the proposition.

**Step 7: Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
- Check if it relies on a consensus that is questionable or in dispute.
- The statement does not appeal to universal agreement; it’s a general aphorism without appealing to popular opinion.

**Step 8: Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**
- Determine if the statement can be taken in another sense than intended.
- The phrase seems consistent in its intended meaning and doesn’t lend itself to significant ambiguity.

**Step 9: Conclusion**
- Based on the above steps, identify which category (if any) this string falls into.

The string "The more things change, the more they remain the same." does not clearly fall into any of the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>. This statement functions more as a paradoxical aphorism rather than a structured argument with identifiable flaws.

Thus, the IDAA application here suggests that this string does not fit into any of the predefined defective argument categories.
