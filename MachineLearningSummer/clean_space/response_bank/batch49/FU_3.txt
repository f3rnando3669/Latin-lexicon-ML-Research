For 
To apply IDAA to the given string "Trump cites (biased) poll results showing that people think he’s a strong leader to prove a point that he is a strong leader.

ABC News/Washington Post Poll (wrong big on election) said almost all stand by their vote on me & 53% said strong leader.", we need to follow a systematic procedure to classify the argument:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
First, determine what the proposition is in the given text. A proposition sets forth summarily what is intended to be proven.

**Proposition (P):** Trump is a strong leader.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
Next, identify the reason given to support the proposition. This is the causal basis establishing the truth of what is being urged.

**Reason (R):** Poll results showing that people think he’s a strong leader.

### Step 3: Identify additional elements if they exist
In this example, we do not have a clearly distinct Proof of Reason (PR) needing corroboration, so we focus more on evaluating the causal basis.

### Step 4: Classify the argument based on defect types
Now, we need to classify the argument <s> based on the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>:

- **Generalization (G):** Refers to applying an assertion based on incomplete or biased information to a whole group.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Refers to claiming incomplete options are complete.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Refers to a reason that does not conclusively support the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Refers to a weak causal basis for the proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Refers to repeating the proposition in the reason without adding new information.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Refers to assuming consensus or widespread belief as proof.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Refers to using language that can be misinterpreted.

### Step 5: Evaluate <s> for defect classification

1. **Is this a Generalization? 
   - No, the argument is not making an overgeneralization based on just a part of the population. It's citing a specific poll.

2. **Is this Incomplete Enumeration? 
   - No, the argument is not trying to limit options to an incomplete list.

3. **Is this Inconclusive Reason? 
   - Partially, yes. Citing poll results is inconclusive because poll results reflect opinions, not necessarily factual leadership qualities.

4. **Is this Insufficient Causal Basis? 
   - Yes, strongly suggests this. Citing a poll is weak evidence because the causal link between being believed to be a strong leader and actually being one is not strong.

5. **Is this Faulty Repetition of Proposition?
   - No, it's not repeating the proposition; it is providing poll results as reason.

6. **Is this Presumptuous Consensus? 
   - Yes, it falls under this category as well. It assumes that because many people in a poll say he is a strong leader, he must be one.

7. **Is this Ambiguous Language Use? 
   - No, the language in the text does not seem ambiguous or open to multiple interpretations. 

### Step 6: Conclusion
After evaluating the defective argument types, we classify the given argument as most aligning with **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** and **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**. Since <IDA> specifies choosing <G> if applicable first and we determined it is not a Generalization, our final classification should reflect the most fitting defect type based on the provided options.

**Classification:** <FU> - Presumptuous Consensus

Thus, the argument "Trump cites (biased) poll results showing that people think he’s a strong leader to prove a point that he is a strong leader..." fits primarily under **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** due to its reliance on assumed popular opinion as validation.
