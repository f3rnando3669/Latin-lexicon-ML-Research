For 
To apply \(<IDAA>\) to the string "Eat lamb--could thousands of coyotes be wrong?", we need to break down the process of identifying the logical fallacy step by step, as per the defined classifications. Let's proceed with \(<D>\):

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (\(D\)):

1. **Identify the Proposition (\(P\))**: 
   - Determine the main assertion or claim being made.

2. **Identify the Reason (\(R\))**: 
   - Identify the causal basis or reasoning provided for the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\(PR\))**: 
   - See if any additional arguments support the reason.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument (\(IDA\))**:
   - Determine if the argument fits any of the predefined defective argument categories **<G>**, **<FE>**, **<IR>**, **<RR>**, **<WCB>**, **<FU>**, or **<DEP>** based on the definitions provided.

### Application of Decomposition (\(IDAA\)):

1. **Identify the Proposition (\(P\))**:
   - Proposition: The implied main claim is "You should eat lamb."

2. **Identify the Reason (\(R\))**:
   - Reason: It is suggested that "Thousands of coyotes can't be wrong," implying that because many coyotes eat lamb, humans should too.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\(PR\))**:
   - There is no explicit proof provided beyond the reason itself, but the implication of a consensus among coyotes serves as the reason.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument (\(IDA\))**:
   - Assessing the reason:
     - The argument relies on the idea that if many do something (in this case, coyotes eating lamb), it must be correct or advisable for humans to do the same.
     - This aligns with the definition of **<FU>** (Presumptuous Consensus), where the argument assumes something is correct or advisable because it implies that it is "universally agreed upon."

Thus, "Eat lamb--could thousands of coyotes be wrong?" falls under the defective argument type **<FU>** (Presumptuous Consensus). This is because it appeals to the fact that many coyotes eat lamb as an attempted form of validation that humans should also eat lamb.
