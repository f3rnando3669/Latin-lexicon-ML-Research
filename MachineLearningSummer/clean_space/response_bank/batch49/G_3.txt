For 
To apply IDAA to the statement "An environmental group illegally blocked loggers and workers at a nuclear plant. Therefore, environmentalists are radicals who take the law into their own hands.", we need to decompose the task of classification into specific steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
The proposition in the given statement is: "Environmentalists are radicals who take the law into their own hands."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
The reason in the statement is: "An environmental group illegally blocked loggers and workers at a nuclear plant."

### Step 3: Determine if the Reason <R> Supports the Proposition <P> Properly
- We need to check if the given reason <R> adequately provides a causal basis to establish the truth of the proposition <P>.
- In this case, the reason describes an action performed by a particular group of environmentalists and attempts to generalize this behavior to all environmentalists.

### Step 4: Check for the Type of Defective Argument
We need to determine which type of defective argument applies here:
- **Generalization (<G>)**: The proposition is taking the actions of a specific environmental group and extending that to all environmentalists, which fits well with the definition of <G> because it generalizes the behavior of a part to the whole group.

### Step 5: Confirm if Other Defective Arguments Apply
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Does not seem to apply as the statement is not presenting a limited set of complete possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason itself does not seem weak in terms of irrelevance but more inappropriately generalized.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: More about weak evidence, not strictly generalization.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: No repetition observed.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: No assumption of universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: No ambiguous terms.

### Step 6: Make the Final Classification
Based on our detailed analysis, the argument type that best fits is <G> (Generalization).

### Conclusion
The given string "An environmental group illegally blocked loggers and workers at a nuclear plant. Therefore, environmentalists are radicals who take the law into their own hands." is classified as <G> (Generalization).
