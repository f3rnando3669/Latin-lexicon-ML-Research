For 
Certainly! Let's apply the process of breaking down the advanced task of classifying the statement into specific steps and then execute each step to determine the type of defective argument.

The statement we need to classify is: "Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist and perhaps the foremost expert in the field, says that evolution is true. Therefore, it's true."

### Decomposition (D):
1. **Identify the Proposition (P) in the statement.**
2. **Identify the Reason (R) given to support the Proposition.**
3. **Determine if the Reason (R) conclusively supports the Proposition (P) or if it exhibits any defects.**
   - **Check for Generalization (G)**
   - **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
   - **Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
   - **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
   - **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
   - **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
   - **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**

Let's apply these steps:

### Step-by-Step Application:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Proposition (P): "Evolution is true."

2. **Identify the Reason (R) given to support the Proposition:**
   - Reason (R): "Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist and perhaps the foremost expert in the field, says that evolution is true."

3. **Determine if the Reason (R) conclusively supports the Proposition (P) or if it exhibits any defects:**

   - **Check for Generalization (G):**
     - Not applicable here as the argument does not generalize from a few instances to many.

   - **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
     - Not applicable, as there is no enumeration of possibilities.

   - **Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
     - **Applies.**
     - Just because Richard Dawkins, an expert in the field, claims something is true, it does not conclusively prove the proposition. The truth of evolution doesn't solely rest on the authority of an individual, even if he is an expert.

   - **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
     - Not applicable, there isn't a weak causal basis being used here.

   - **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
     - Not applicable, the Reason (R) and the Proposition (P) are not saying exactly the same thing.

   - **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
     - Not applicable, the argument doesn't rely on a presumed universal agreement.

   - **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
     - Not applicable, there is no ambiguity in language.

Given the steps applied, the statement fits the category of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. The Reason (R) provided (an appeal to authority) does not conclusively demonstrate the truth of the Proposition (P).

So, the classification of the string is:

### <IR>
