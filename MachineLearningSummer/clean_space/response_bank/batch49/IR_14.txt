Certainly! Let's apply the process of decomposing the task of classifying the string "Did John ever give up his bad habits?" into specific steps for identification.

### Step-by-Step Classification Process

1. **Identify the Argument Structure**: Assess whether the string "Did John ever give up his bad habits?" fits the structure of a Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), or Proof of Reason (<PR>).

2. **Determine Defective Argument Type**: Evaluate the string against each defective argument type to find which one it matches, if any. 

3. **Prioritize Generalization (<G>)**: If the string matches the characteristics of Generalization, default to classifying it as <G>.

### Applying the Steps:

#### Step 1: Identify the Argument Structure
First, analyze if the string "Did John ever give up his bad habits?" contains any reasoning or proposition:
- It is a question, not a declaration or an argument.
- It does not set forth a claim (Proposition) or provide evidence (Reason).

#### Step 2: Determine Defective Argument Type
Evaluate the string against each defective argument type criteria:

- **<G> (Generalization)**: It has no explicit assertion based on a part or majority, applied to all.
  
- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: It is not making a complete enumeration claim of the possibilities.
  
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: There’s no explicit reasoning provided in this question.
  
- **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: There’s no repetition present.
  
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: There’s no causal reasoning provided.
  
- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: The question doesn’t assume consensus.
  
- **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: This could be the best fit because the language is ambiguous. "Bad habits" is a broad term that can be interpreted in multiple ways, depending on what the speaker and the listener understand by "bad habits."

#### Step 3: Classification
After evaluating the string against the defective argument types, it seems to fit best with **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)** due to the ambiguous nature of "bad habits."

### Final Classification

The string "Did John ever give up his bad habits?" is classified as **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)** because it can be taken in another sense than the speaker or listener might intend, leading to different interpretations.

Thus, the output of <IDAA> for the string "Did John ever give up his bad habits?" is:

**<DEP>**
