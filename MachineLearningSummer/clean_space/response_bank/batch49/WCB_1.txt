For 
To classify the given statement "President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up. Jones is responsible for the rise in crime." using <IDAA> (the application of decomposing the classification task into specific steps), we can follow this structured approach:

1. **Identification of Key Components:**
   - Locate the <P> (Proposition): The proposition here is implicitly that "Jones is responsible for the rise in crime."
   - Locate the <R> (Reason): The causal basis provided is "President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up."

2. **Analyze the Reason:**
   - Evaluate whether the reason <R> conclusively establishes the correctness of the proposition <P>. 

3. **Classify the Argument:**
   - Identify if the reason <R> commits any fallacies.

Step-by-Step Breakdown:
   
1. **Understanding the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The argument essentially claims that President Jones's action of raising taxes is responsible for the increase in violent crime rates.

2. **Analyzing the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason is that there is a correlation between two events: President Jones raising taxes and the subsequent increase in violent crime rates.
   - However, correlation does not necessarily imply causation. The reason presented does not provide a direct causal link between raising taxes and the rise in crime.

3. **Evaluating for Fallacies:**
   - Given the above analysis, the main issue with this argument seems to be that it suggests a causal relationship without sufficient proof of causation.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument (<IDA>):**
   - This argument type is best classified as <IR> (Inconclusive Reason). The reason given does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition that President Jones is responsible for the rise in crime. 

   Thus, the statement "President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up. Jones is responsible for the rise in crime." falls under the category of <IR> because the provided reason does not sufficiently establish the causality implied in the proposition.

To summarize the classification using <IDAA>:
- The argument contains a proposition <P>: "Jones is responsible for the rise in crime."
- The reason <R> given is: "President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up."
- The reason is inconclusive in demonstrating the correctness of the proposition.
- Hence, the defective argument type is <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
