For 
Sure, let's apply the procedure \( \text{IDAA} \) to classify the given string:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (\( \text{D} \))

1. **Identify the Proposition \( \text{P} \)**: Determine the assertion being made.
2. **Identify the Reason \( \text{R} \)**: Understand the causal basis provided for \( \text{P} \).
3. **Classify the Fallacy**:
   - Check if it falls under \( \text{G} \) (Generalization).
   - If not \( \text{G} \), check for \( \text{FE} \) (Incomplete Enumeration).
   - If not \( \text{FE} \), check for \( \text{IR} \) (Inconclusive Reason).
   - If not \( \text{IR} \), check for \( \text{RR} \) (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
   - If not \( \text{RR} \), check for \( \text{WCB} \) (Insufficient Causal Basis).
   - If not \( \text{WCB} \), check for \( \text{FU} \) (Presumptuous Consensus).
   - If not \( \text{FU} \), check for \( \text{DEP} \) (Ambiguous Language Use).

### Application to the Statement:

**Statement**: "You must obey the law, because it's illegal to break the law."

1. **Identify the Proposition \( \text{P} \)**:
   - \( \text{P} \) (Proposition): "You must obey the law."

2. **Identify the Reason \( \text{R} \)**:
   - \( \text{R} \) (Reason): "because it's illegal to break the law."

3. **Classify the Fallacy**:
   - **Is it \( \text{G} \) (Generalization)?**
     - No, the statement does not involve a generalization based on one part or a majority.
   - **Is it \( \text{FE} \) (Incomplete Enumeration)?**
     - No, the argument is not about an exhaustive list of possibilities.
   - **Is it \( \text{IR} \) (Inconclusive Reason)?**
     - No, the reason does not fail to demonstrate \( \text{P} \). It's more about repeating the \( \text{P} \).
   - **Is it \( \text{RR} \) (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)?**
     - Yes, the reason given ("it's illegal to break the law") essentially restates the proposition ("You must obey the law") without providing additional justification. This is a clear instance of Faulty Repetition of Proposition.
   - **Is it \( \text{WCB} \) (Insufficient Causal Basis)?**
     - No, the reason provided is not a causal basis, it is just repeating the statement.
   - **Is it \( \text{FU} \) (Presumptuous Consensus)?**
     - No, the argument is not based on a presumed consensus.
   - **Is it \( \text{DEP} \) (Ambiguous Language Use)?**
     - No, there is no ambiguity in the language used.

### Conclusion:
The logical fallacy in the statement "You must obey the law, because it's illegal to break the law" is classified as \( \text{RR} \) (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
