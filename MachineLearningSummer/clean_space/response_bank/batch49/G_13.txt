Sure, let's apply the process of decomposing the task of classifying the string into specific steps and then using those steps to classify the given string. Here are the steps:

1. **Identify Proposition (<P>):**
   - In this task, determine the main proposition(s) set forth in the argument.

2. **Identify Reason (<R>):**
   - Identify the causal basis or reasoning that the argument uses to support the proposition.

3. **Identify Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Determine if there are any proofs or additional arguments that support the reason.

4. **Examine for Defective Argument Types:**
   - Check for the presence of any defective argument types such as Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

5. **Classify the Argument:**
   - Based on the examination in step 4, classify the argument into the appropriate defective argument type.

Now, let's apply these steps to the given string:

### Argument: "Men score better on math than women do. Jerry is a man. Therefore, Jerry is better at math than Sylvia, who is a woman."

1. **Identify Proposition (<P>):**

   - The proposition here can be thought of as: "Jerry is better at math than Sylvia."

2. **Identify Reason (<R>):**

   - The reasoning given is that: "Men score better on math than women do."

3. **Identify Proof of Reason (<PR>):**

   - There isn't an additional proof presented; the reasoning is based on a general statement about gender and math performance.

4. **Examine for Defective Argument Types:**
   - **<G> (Generalization):** The argument makes a general claim about men and women and applies it to individuals (Jerry and Sylvia) without supporting it with enough evidence to make it universally applicable. This is a clear case of overgeneralizing.

     > "Men score better on math than women do" is an assertion based on a general statement about groups and is being applied to individuals, Jerry and Sylvia.

5. **Classify the Argument:**

   - Given the examination, the argument fits the Generalization (<G>) category. It takes a generalization about the average performance of men and women in math and applies it to specific individuals without adequate evidence.

Therefore, the argument "Men score better on math than women do. Jerry is a man. Therefore, Jerry is better at math than Sylvia, who is a woman." is classified as type <G>, Generalization.
