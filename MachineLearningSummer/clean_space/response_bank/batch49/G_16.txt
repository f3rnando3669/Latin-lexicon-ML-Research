For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to classify the string "My first day of basketball practice was easy, so it will always be easy," we need to decompose the task into specific steps and then follow them to identify the logical fallacy in the given string.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of Task \( \text{IDA} \):

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( \text{P} \))**: Distill the main assertion or claim from the string.
2. **Identify the Reason (\( \text{R} \))**: Determine the reasoning or basis provided for the Proposition.
3. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**: Match the identified Proposition and Reason with one of the predefined defective argument types \(\{ \text{G}, \text{FE}, \text{IR}, \text{RR}, \text{WCB}, \text{FU}, \text{DEP} \}\).

### Step-by-Step Application of \( \text{D} \) to \( \text{IDA} \):

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\( \text{P} \))
- The main assertion (\( \text{P} \)) in the given string is: "it [basketball practice] will always be easy."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\( \text{R} \))
- The reasoning (\( \text{R} \)) provided for this assertion is: "My first day of basketball practice was easy."

#### Step 3: Classify the Defective Argument Type
- Now, we need to determine which defective argument type best fits the structure of \( \text{P} \) and \( \text{R} \).

Given the structure:

- Proposition (\( \text{P} \)): "It will always be easy."
- Reason (\( \text{R} \)): "My first day of basketball practice was easy."

This argument takes a single instance (the first day) and generalizes it to all possible instances (always easy).

### Classification:
- Since the argument generalizes from one specific instance to a universal claim without sufficient evidence, it fits the defective argument type **Generalization** (\( \text{G} \)).

### Conclusion:
The logical fallacy represented in the string "My first day of basketball practice was easy, so it will always be easy" is of type \( \text{G} \) (Generalization).
