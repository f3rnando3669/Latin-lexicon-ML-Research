To classify the given statement using the advanced task of decomposing it into specific steps, we need to apply <IDAA> as defined. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   The statement presented should consist of a proposition that can be clearly identified. In this case, the implicit proposition is:
   - "You shouldn't listen to Andrea Starkk's arguments about the media harming women’s body image."

2. **Determine the Reason (<R>)**:
   The reason given for the proposition is:
   - "Starkk is an ugly, bitter person."

3. **Evaluate for Defective Argument Types**:
   We now need to see if the identified parts fit into any of the defective argument types.

   - **<G> Generalization**: The statement is not making an assertion about a majority being applied to all.
   - **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: The statement does not present an enumeration of possibilities.
   - **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: This evaluates if <R> does not conclusively support <P>. The personal attack on Starkk’s character (calling her ugly and bitter) does not demonstrate why her arguments about media harm to women's body image are invalid.
   - **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: <R> is not a repetition of <P>.
   - **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: This checks if the causal relation presented is weak. The reason (attacking Starkk’s characters) does not logically cause the conclusion about her argument's validity.
   - **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: The statement does not assume a consensus to validate the argument.
   - **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: There is no use of language that could be interpreted in multiple ways other than intended.

4. **Select the Best-fitting Defective Argument**:
   The statement that "Starkk is an ugly, bitter person, so you shouldn't listen to her" fits best under <IR> Inconclusive Reason because it attacks the character of the person rather than addressing the validity of their arguments. This type of fallacy is often referred to as an **ad hominem** fallacy.

Therefore, the task <IDA> applied to the string "Andrea Starkk has written several books arguing that the media harms women when it comes to body image. But Starkk is an ugly, bitter person, so you shouldn't listen to her" results in classification as:
### <IR>
