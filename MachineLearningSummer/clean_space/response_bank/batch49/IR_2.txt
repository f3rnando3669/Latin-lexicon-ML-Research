For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string, "After Sally presents an eloquent and compelling case for a more equitable taxation system, Sam asks the audience whether we should believe anything from a woman who isn't married, was once arrested, and smells a bit weird," we need to decompose the task (<t>) of classifying this string step-by-step. Here's the decomposition (<D>):

1. **Identify and understand the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition (what is being argued): Sally is advocating for a more equitable taxation system.

2. **Identify and understand the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason (the causal basis for the Proposition): The argument presented by Sam does not provide a substantive reason but instead attacks Sally's personal characteristics.

3. **Identify and understand the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Proof of Reason (support for the Reason): Sam's statement is an attempt to discredit Sally based on irrelevant personal attributes rather than addressing the merits of her argument.

4. **Classify each part based on definitions of defective arguments:**
   - We now need to see which type of defective argument fits best with our analysis.

Given the decomposition, the defective argument can be classified as:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason Sam presents for dismissing Sally's argument is not relevant to the Proposition (the merits of the equitable taxation system). Sam's focus on Sally's marital status, past arrest, and smell does not provide a substantive rebuttal to her argument about taxation.

**Final Classification:**
The given string fits the category of **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**. 

So, the classification of the string "After Sally presents an eloquent and compelling case for a more equitable taxation system, Sam asks the audience whether we should believe anything from a woman who isn't married, was once arrested, and smells a bit weird." is **<IR>**.
