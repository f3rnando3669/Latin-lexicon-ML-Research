For 
To apply <IDAA> to determine the logical fallacy in the statement "Ghosts exist.... because I saw a ghost in my closet," we will decompose the task into specific steps as follows:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of <IDA>

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**
3. **Evaluate the Reason's Validity in Supporting the Proposition**
4. **Match the Argument with Known Defective Argument Types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>**

### Step-by-Step Application (IDAA) to the Statement

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - **Extract Proposition (P):** "Ghosts exist"

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - **Extract Reason (R):** "because I saw a ghost in my closet"

3. **Evaluate the Reason's Validity in Supporting the Proposition:**
   - The reason given is based on a single personal experience. It attempts to generalize the existence of ghosts from this singular encounter.

4. **Match the Argument with Known Defective Argument Types:**
   - The identified Reason (R) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition (P); it uses a specific instance to infer a general truth.
   - The reason is an example of a **Generalization** (Type <G>).

### Conclusion:
The statement "Ghosts exist.... because I saw a ghost in my closet," is an example of the logical fallacy **Generalization (G)**. 

The type <G> is chosen because the argument claims the existence of ghosts based on a single, isolated personal experience, thus generalizing from one instance to a broader conclusion without sufficient evidence.
