For 
To apply the Advanced Task Decomposition (IDAA) to the given statement, we will follow the steps outlined previously:

### Given Statement for IDA:
"Speaker 1: We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change.
Speaker: Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."

### Steps for IDA:

1. **Analyze the Statement:**
   - We have a dialogue where Speaker 1 discusses a campaign to spread the word about social injustice using volunteers.
   - Speaker 2 rejects participation because they believe it's wrong to "use people."

2. **Compare with Definitions:**
   - Check each defective argument type to see if it matches the characteristics of the statement.

### Applying Advanced Task Decomposition (IDAA) to IDA:

**Pre-processing:**
- **Step 1:** Normalize the statement if necessary (Text already seems clear and structured).
- **Step 2:** Break down the statement into logical components:
  - **Component 1 (Speaker 1):** “We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change.”
  - **Component 2 (Speaker 2):** “Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people.”

**Identification Process:**
- **Step 3:** Check for Generalization (<G>): No generalization from a specific instance is present.
- **Step 4:** Check for False Enumeration (<FE>): No listing of false options is present.
- **Step 5:** Check for Inappropriate Reason (<IR>): The reason given (“it’s wrong to use people”) does not logically follow from the proposition made by Speaker 1. Speaker 1 intended to demonstrate community effort for a cause, not exploitation.
- **Step 6:** Check for Redundant Reason (<RR>): The reason provided is not simply restating the proposition in different words.
- **Step 7:** Check for Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>): The reason might be seen as weak, but it does not fit here.
- **Step 8:** Check for False Universals (<FU>): No appeal to universals is being made directly.
- **Step 9:** Check for Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>): The statement from Speaker 2 could ambiguously imply ethical exploitation versus literal usage, but this doesn't entirely fit the core issue.

**Validation:**
- **Step 10:** Validate the identified defective argument type:
  - The most fitting type is Inappropriate Reason (<IR>) because the ethical stance against “using people” doesn’t logically counter the campaign’s goal to spread awareness via volunteers.
- **Step 11:** Return the identified defective argument type.

### Conclusion:
The defective argument type in the given statement is **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**. Speaker 2's response provides a reason that does not logically support their unwillingness to participate in the campaign as explained by Speaker 1.
