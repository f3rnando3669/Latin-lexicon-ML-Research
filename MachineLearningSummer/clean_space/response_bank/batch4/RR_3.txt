For 
Let's apply the structured approach <IDAA> to the statement: "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people."

### Steps for <IDAA>

1. **Identification of Keywords**: 
   - Keywords here include: "fix," "broken," "judicial system," "electing new people."

2. **Contextual Analysis**:
   - The statement asserts that the judicial system is broken and offers a solution to fix it by electing new people. We need to analyze whether the reason (electing new people) logically supports the proposition (fixing the broken judicial system).

3. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: Does this statement generalize a specific instance to a universal truth? Not directly.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Does this statement list fewer or more options than actually exist? It suggests a specific solution without considering other alternatives, but it's not explicitly listing options.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Does electing new people logically support fixing the judicial system? Are there sufficient grounds provided for why electing new people would fix it?
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Is it just restating the problem in different terms? Not in this case.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Is the argument for electing new people compelling enough to address the issue of the broken system?
   - **False Universals (<FU>)**: Are there universally assumed points without proof? Not directly.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Is there ambiguity in its interpretation? Not here.

4. **Double-check & Validate**:
   - Electing new people might not logically or sufficiently support fixing a complex system like the judicial system without further elaboration on how that would solve the inherent problems. It's a simplistic solution to a complex problem.

### Conclusion:
The statement "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people." primarily exhibits a weak causal basis.

**This logical fallacy is called**: "<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)"

It offers a reason (electing new people) that is not compelling or detailed enough to support the proposition (fixing the judicial system).
