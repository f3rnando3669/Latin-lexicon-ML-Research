For 
Let's apply the decomposition approach (<D>) to identify the defective argument type in the statement provided ("The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far.") using the steps of <IDAA>.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Step 1: Understand the Argument**:
   - Carefully read the argument presented in the string <s>.
   - In this case, the argument implies a causal relationship between liberals taking political correctness too far and Donald Trumpâ€™s election.

2. **Step 2: Identify the Proposition and Reasoning**:
   - **Proposition**: Donald Trump got elected.
   - **Reasoning**: Because liberals took political correctness too far.

3. **Step 3: Compare with Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: This isn't making a general truth claim based on a specific instance.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: This doesn't involve listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided seems related and not completely out of context, but further examination is needed.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: The reasoning isn't simply restating the proposition.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This seems to be the most pertinent category. The argument suggests a cause ("liberals took political correctness too far") for Trump's election, but the causal link is weak and oversimplified.
   - **False Universals (<FU>)**: Not asserting a universally agreed point without proof in this case.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: No dual interpretation of statements at play here.

4. **Step 4: Match and Conclude**:
   - Based on the comparison, the reasoning fits the definition of **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
     - The argument presents a causal relationship that is not compelling enough to fully explain the proposition.
     - The election of Donald Trump is a complex event influenced by many factors, and attributing it solely to liberals taking political correctness too far oversimplifies and weakens the causal claim.

**Conclusion**:
The argument "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far." is an example of a **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
