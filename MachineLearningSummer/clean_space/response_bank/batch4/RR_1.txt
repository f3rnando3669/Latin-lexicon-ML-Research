For 
Certainly! Let's apply the steps of decomposition to the string "This legislation is sinful because it is the wrong thing to do."

### Decomposition Steps Applied to the String:

1. **Understand the Proposition**:
   - Proposition: "This legislation is sinful."

2. **Identify the Reasoning**:
   - Reasoning provided: "because it is the wrong thing to do."

3. **Match with Argument Types**:
   - We need to see if the reasoning matches any of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

4. **Determine Specificity**:
   - The claim and reasoning are rather specific to the context of the legislation in question.

5. **Analyze Logical Consistency**:
   - We need to check if the reasoning logically supports the proposition. In this case, "it is the wrong thing to do" is just restating "sinful" without providing a separate rationale.

6. **Check for Generalization and Universals**:
   - Not applicable here as there is no broad statement or universal claim.

7. **Evaluate Enumeration**:
   - Enumeration does not seem to be relevant here.

8. **Assess for Redundancy or Causality**:
   - The reason provided is essentially a restatement of the proposition in different words, suggesting a redundant reason.

9. **Interpret for Ambiguity**:
   - No interpretation ambiguity; it is a straightforward restatement.

### Conclusion:
By thoroughly following the decomposition steps, it is clear that the defective argument type exemplified by the string "This legislation is sinful because it is the wrong thing to do." is **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**.

Therefore, applying <IDAA> to the string leads to the identification of the Redundant Reason (RR) argument type.
