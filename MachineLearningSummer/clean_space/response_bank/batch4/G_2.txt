For 
Let's apply the steps of the <IDAA> process to the given string "<s>":

### Given String:
"I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!"

---

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition**:
   - The main proposition is: "My 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well."

2. **Analyze the Reasoning**:
   - The reasoning provided to support the proposition is: "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up."
   - The implication here is that because one part of the Catholic Church was involved in a scandal, all members, including the 102-year-old neighbor, are guilty.

3. **Compare with Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: This involves making a broad generalization from a specific instance.
     - The argument makes a broad accusation that since the Catholic Church had members involved in a scandal, all members, including an elderly neighbor, are guilty.
     - This reasoning is a classic case of overgeneralization, attributing the characteristics or actions of a group to all individual members without sufficient justification.

4. **Match the Pattern**:
   - The pattern clearly matches with the **Generalization (<G>)** because it extrapolates a specific instance (a broader Church scandal) to an individual (the 102-year-old neighbor) without specific evidence for that individual.

5. **Conclude the Identifier**:
   - Therefore, the identifier for the defective argument type in the given string is **Generalization (<G>)**.

### Conclusion:
The logical fallacy represented in the string "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!" is a **Generalization (<G>)**.
