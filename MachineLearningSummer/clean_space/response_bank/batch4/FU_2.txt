### Decomposition of IDA into Specific Steps (D):

1. **Understand the Argument:** Read the string <s> carefully to ensure you understand the entire argument being presented.
2. **Identify the Claim:** Determine the main claim or proposition in <s>.
3. **Analyze the Reasoning:** Look at the supporting reasoning or evidence provided for the claim.
4. **Match Definitions:** Compare the reasoning against the definitions of defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.
5. **Check for Logical Flaws:** Identify any logical inconsistencies, overgeneralizations, inappropriate reasons, redundant reasons, weak causal links, false universals, or ambiguous phrases in the argument.
6. **Select Defective Argument Type:** Based on the analysis, select the defective argument type that best matches the reasoning provided in <s>.
7. **Provide Explanation:** Clearly explain why <s> falls under the chosen defective argument type.

### Application to the String <s>: "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong."

#### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Understand the Argument:**
   - The argument suggests you should choose Verizon because 1 billion people have made that choice.

2. **Identify the Claim:**
   - Claim: You should get Verizon.

3. **Analyze the Reasoning:**
   - Reasoning: The argument is based on the fact that 1 billion people have chosen Verizon.

4. **Match Definitions:**
   - Compare the reasoning against descriptions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

5. **Check for Logical Flaws:**
   - The argument uses the number of people who have chosen Verizon as the reason to get Verizon. This aligns with the definition of <FU>, where an assertion is made based on the number of people doing it, implying that popularity or widespread adoption is a sufficient basis for the claim.

6. **Select Defective Argument Type:**
   - The defective argument type is <FU> (False Universals).

7. **Provide Explanation:**
   - Explanation: The argument is a false universal because it assumes that something must be true (Verizon being the best choice) simply because a large number of people have chosen it. The popularity of Verizon does not necessarily validate it as the best choice for everyone, making this a fallacious argument based on the appeal to popularity.

Thus, we have successfully decomposed the task of identifying the defective argument in this string and concluded that it is an instance of <FU> (False Universals).
