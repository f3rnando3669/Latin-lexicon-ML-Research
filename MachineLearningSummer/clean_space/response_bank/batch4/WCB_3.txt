For 
Let's apply the decomposition of identifying a defective argument (\<IDAA\>) to the given argument "Farmer McDonald: Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain. I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature."

**Step-by-Step Process (\<IDAA\>):**

### 1. Understand the Argument (\<s\>):

**Argument**: "Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain. I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature."

### 2. Identify Key Elements of the Argument:
- **Main Claim**: "Mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature."
- **Supporting Reason**: "Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain."

### 3. Compare Against Definitions:

**Generalization (\<G\>):**
- Is there a general truth claimed based on a specific instance?
  - No, the argument is not generalizing about a category based on one instance.

**False Enumeration (\<FE\>):**
- Is the argument listing fewer or more options than actually exist?
  - No, there is no enumeration in this argument.

**Inappropriate Reason (\<IR\>):**
- Does the reason provided logically support the proposition?
  - In this case, the reason provided (no rain since the power plant was built) is supposed to support the claim "mankind fiddling with nature." The support is weak and may not be appropriate.

**Redundant Reason (\<RR\>):**
- Is the reason just a restatement of the proposition?
  - No, the reason is not merely restating the main claim.

**Weak Causal Basis (\<WCB\>):**
- Is the reason provided not compelling enough to support the proposition?
  - Yes, stating that the lack of rain is due to the new power plant provides a weak causal connection and is not compelling enough.

**False Universals (\<FU\>):**
- Does the argument assert universally agreed points without proof?
  - No, this argument does not rely on universally agreed points.

**Double-Edged Phrases (\<DEP\>):**
- Does the argument use statements open to dual interpretations?
  - No, there are no dual interpretations in the given statement.

### 4. Match with the Defective Argument Type:
By the process of elimination and fitting characteristics, it appears the argument aligns closely with **Weak Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**. 

### 5. Validation:
Double-checking against the definition:

- **Definition of \<WCB\>**: Offering a reason that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
- **Argument Fit**: The claim that the new power plant is responsible for the absence of rain is a weak causal connection and does not adequately support the larger claim about mankind's impact on nature.

Thus, the argument type for the given statement is **\<WCB\> (Weak Causal Basis)**.
