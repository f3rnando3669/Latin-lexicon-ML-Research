To identify the type of defective argument in the given string, "I had a real bad headache, then saw my doctor. Just by talking with him, my headache started to subside, and I was all better the next day. It was well worth the $200 visit fee," we will apply the step-by-step decomposition process (<IDAA>).

### Step-by-Step Decomposition Process for <IDA> (<IDAA>)

1. **Identify the Argument within the String:**
   - The argument suggests that talking to the doctor caused the improvement in the headache.

2. **Determine the Claim being Made:**
   - The claim is: "Talking to the doctor made my headache improve, and the visit was worth the $200 fee."

3. **Examine the Basis for the Claim:**
   - The basis is that the headache started to subside just by talking with the doctor, and this improvement justifies the $200 fee.

4. **Map the Claim to Defective Argument Types:**
   - <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis): This type is characterized by offering a reason that is not compelling enough to support the proposition. The improvement in the headache might not necessarily be causally related to talking to the doctor; there could be other reasons for the improvement, and justifying the $200 fee based purely on this anecdotal causality is weak.

5. **Validate the Argument Type:**
   - The argument is indeed based on a weak causal link between talking to the doctor and the improvement of the headache without considering other possible explanations or providing stronger evidence. This matches the characteristics outlined for <WCB>.

### Result of <IDA> for the String (Applying <IDAA>):

```plaintext
The logical fallacy represented here is <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis).
