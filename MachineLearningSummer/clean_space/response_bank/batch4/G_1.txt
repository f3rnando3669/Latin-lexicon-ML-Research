For 
To apply **<IDAA>** to the string "**All sports car drivers are too aggressive!**", let's follow the defined steps:

### Steps of <IDAA> Applied:

1. **Understand the Argument**:
   - The argument claims that all sports car drivers exhibit aggressive behavior.

2. **Identify Argument Type Clues**:
   - The keyword here is "All," which indicates a sweeping statement about a whole group based on a specific characteristic or behavior.

3. **Match Against Defined Types**:
   - Compare the argument to the defined defective argument types:
     - **Generalization (G)**: Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
     - **False Enumeration (FE)**: Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
     - **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**: Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
     - **Redundant Reason (RR)**: Stating the same thing as the proposition but in other words.
     - **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**: Offering a weak reason that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
     - **False Universals (FU)**: Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
     - **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**: Using statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.

4. **Conclude the Type**:
   - The argument "**All sports car drivers are too aggressive!**" most closely fits the definition of **Generalization (G)**. It claims a general truth about all sports car drivers based on the presumably specific behavior of some or none without sufficient evidence.

### Conclusion:

The argument type for the string "**All sports car drivers are too aggressive!**" is **Generalization (G)**.
