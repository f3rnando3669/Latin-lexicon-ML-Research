For 
To apply the decomposition process <D> to the task of identifying the defective argument type <IDA> for the statement "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights," we will follow the specific steps:

### Steps for <IDA>:
1. **Understand the proposition (<s>)**: Comprehend the provided statement.
2. **Classify the argument**: Determine which predefined defective argument type it matches.
3. **Verify and validate**: Ensure the classification is correct by comparing against the definitions and examples.

### Apply Decomposition to Identify Defective Argument Task <IDAA>:

#### Step 1: Segment the complex statement
The entire statement is a single proposition:
- "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."

#### Step 2: Identify context and main argument
- **Context**: The statement proposes a conditional relationship between supporting Hillary Clinton for President and believing in women's rights.
- **Main argument**: It suggests a binary choice: either you support Hillary Clinton or you do not believe in women's rights.

#### Step 3: Compare with definitions
- **Comparing with <FE>** (False Enumeration): This statement presents only two options for the listener without considering other possibilities. It suggests that not supporting Hillary Clinton exclusively means not believing in women's rights, ignoring the possible existence of other candidates or reasons for supporting women's rights.

#### Step 4: Classify
- The argument fits the definition of **False Enumeration (<FE>)**, because it lists only two oppositional choices and omits other potential options and nuances.

#### Step 5: Justify
- **Justification**: The statement presents a false dichotomy by suggesting that the only options are to support Hillary Clinton for President or reject women's rights. This is a clear case of **False Enumeration (<FE>)** since it does not acknowledge other candidates who may also support women's rights or other reasons for oneâ€™s stance on women's rights.

### Conclusion
After applying the decomposition process to the task, we have identified that the statement "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" is an example of **False Enumeration (<FE>)**.
