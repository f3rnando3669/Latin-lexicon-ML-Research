For 
Let's apply <IDAA> to analyze the given string:

### Example <s>:
"In the race for mayor, Lara says a vote for her opponent will lead to you losing your job."

1. **Identify the Argument:**
   - Argument: Voting for Laraâ€™s opponent will lead to job loss.

2. **Analyze the Structure:**
   - Proposition: Voting for the opponent.
   - Predicted Outcome: Losing your job.
   - Implied Causality: There is a direct causation suggested between voting for the opponent and job loss.

3. **Match to Definitions:**
   - The argument suggests that there are only two possibilities: either you vote for Lara, or you risk job loss.
   - Lara is presenting limited options (voting for her or losing your job), which oversimplifies the situation.

4. **Determine the Fallacy:**
   - This argument closely aligns with the definition of <FE> (False Enumeration): listing fewer or more options than actually exist.

Therefore, the type of defective argument in the given string <s> is **<FE> False Enumeration**.
