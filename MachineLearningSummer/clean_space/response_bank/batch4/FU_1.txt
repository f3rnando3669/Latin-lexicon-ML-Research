### Steps for IDAA (Application of D to IDA)
1. **Extract the Argument**: Identify the key components of the argument from string <s>.
   
2. **Identify the proposition and reason**:
   - What's being claimed? (Proposition)
   - What reason is provided to support the claim? (Reason)

3. **Match the argument to the defective types**:
   - Compare the provided reason and proposition with the definitions of defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.
   
4. **Classify the argument**:
   - Determine if the argument matches one or more of the defective types.

5. **Verify and refine**:
   - Double-check if the classification is accurate and ensure no other defective type fits better.
   - Refine the classification if necessary.

### Example Application

Let's apply these steps to the example "Mormonism is one of the fastest growing sects of Christianity today so that whole story about Joseph Smith getting the golden plates that, unfortunately, disappeared back into heaven, must be true!"

**Step 1: Extract the Argument**:
   - Argument: "Mormonism is one of the fastest growing sects of Christianity today so that whole story about Joseph Smith getting the golden plates that, unfortunately, disappeared back into heaven, must be true!"

**Step 2: Identify the Proposition and Reason**:
   - Proposition: The story about Joseph Smith getting the golden plates is true.
   - Reason: Mormonism is one of the fastest growing sects of Christianity today.

**Step 3: Match the Argument to the Defective Types**:
   - This argument asserts that the popularity and growth of Mormonism validate the truth of Joseph Smith’s story. This fits the definition of **False Universals (<FU>)** since it uses a generally agreed-upon fact (the growth of Mormonism) without actual evidence directly supporting the truth of the specific claim (Joseph Smith’s story).

**Step 4: Classify the Argument**:
   - The argument fits the definition of <FU>.

**Step 5: Verify and Refine**:
   - There are no other defective types that fit better in this context. The classification is accurate.

Hence, the logical fallacy of the given string is **<FU> (False Universals)**.
