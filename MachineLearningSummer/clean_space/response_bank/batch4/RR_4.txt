For 
To apply the structured approach <IDAA> to the given conversation and identify the defective argument type, we will follow the decomposition steps <D>:

### Decomposition Steps (`<D>`)

1. **Extract Proposition**:
   - Identify the core propositions or claims in the argument.

2. **Analyze Supporting Reason**:
   - Determine the reason or evidence provided for each proposition.

3. **Identify Type of Reasoning**:
   - Compare the reasoning used against known defective argument types (`<G>`, `<FE>`, `<IR>`, `<RR>`, `<WCB>`, `<FU>`, `<DEP>`).

4. **Match with Categories**:
   - Match the identified reasoning against the specific defective argument type definitions.

5. **Finalize Identification**:
   - Confirm the type of defective argument and label it accordingly.

Let's apply these steps to the dialogue:

**Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified.**
- **Proposition**: Jesus was not crucified.

**Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?**
- **Question**: Request for evidence or reason to believe the first proposition.

**Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so.**
- **Proposition**: The Quran states that Jesus was not crucified.
- **Supporting Reason**: The Quran says so.

**Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct?**
- **Question**: Request for evidence or reason to believe the Quran is accurate.

**Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.**
- **Proposition**: The Quran is the Word of God and it is inherently true.
- **Supporting Reason**: The Quran is correct because it is the Word of God.

**Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?**
- **Question**: Request for evidence or reason to believe the Quran is the Word of God.

**Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran.**
- **Proposition**: The Quran states it is the Word of God.
- **Supporting Reason**: God tells us so in the Quran itself.

### Identify Reasoning and Match with Categories

1. **Core Proposition**: Jesus was not really crucified.
2. **Supporting Reason 1**: Because the Quran says so.
- **Type of Reasoning**: Reliance on the Quran's authority.
  
3. **Core Proposition**: The Quran is correct.
4. **Supporting Reason 2**: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.
- **Type of Reasoning**: Argument based on claimed divine authority of the Quran.

5. **Core Proposition**: The Quran is the Word of God.
6. **Supporting Reason 3**: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran.
- **Type of Reasoning**: Circular reasoning (the Quran is true because it says it is the Word of God).

### Finalize Identification

- The argument uses circular reasoning by asserting the Quran is true because it says it is the Word of God. This is a form of <RR> Redundant Reason because it essentially restates the proposition in different terms without providing external validation or independent supporting evidence.

Thus, the defective argument type present in this dialogue is primarily **Redundant Reason `<RR>`**.
