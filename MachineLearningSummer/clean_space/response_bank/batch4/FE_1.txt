For 
To identify the type of defective argument in the string "Vote for Smith or live through four more years of higher taxes," we'll apply the decomposed steps of <IDAA> as previously outlined.

### <IDAA> Application:

**Decomposed Steps:**

1. **Step 1**: Understand the argument provided in <s>.
2. **Step 2**: Compare the argument against defined categories (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).
3. **Step 3**: Evaluate which definition best matches the argument in <s>.
4. **Step 4**: Assign the corresponding defective argument type to <s>.

**Evaluation:**

1. **Step 1**: Understand the argument.
   - The claim is that you must either vote for Smith or endure four more years of higher taxes. This presents a binary choice, implying these are the only two possible outcomes.
  
2. **Step 2**: Compare the argument against defined categories:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: Not applicable; this argument doesn't generalize from a specific instance.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Likely applicable; it appears to list fewer options than actually exist.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Not applicable; the reason given is pertinent to the proposition, though restrictive.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Not applicable; the argument doesnâ€™t simply rephrase the proposition.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Not applicable; it's not focusing on weak causation.
   - **False Universals (<FU>)**: Not applicable; it's not making a universally agreed point without proof.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Not applicable; it's not open to dual interpretations.

3. **Step 3**: Evaluate the best match.
   - The argument most closely matches False Enumeration (<FE>), as it incorrectly presents only two options where more likely exist (e.g., other candidates, different outcomes, etc.).

4. **Step 4**: Assign the corresponding type.
   - The defective argument type for "Vote for Smith or live through four more years of higher taxes." is <FE> (False Enumeration).

Hence, by applying the decomposed steps of <IDAA>, we have identified that the argument type is <FE>.
