To identify the type of defective argument in the given string, we can decompose the task into specific steps as outlined by <IDAA>. Let's go through each step in detail:

### Decomposition of <IDA> into Steps (<D>):
1. **Step 1**: Read and understand the argument.
   - Argument: "Perhaps the most classic example of this fallacy is the argument for the existence of God. Due to the understanding of nature through science, many of the arguments that used to be used for God (or gods) were abandoned, only to be replaced with new ones, usually involving questions to which science has not definitively answered yet. The move from creationism to intelligent design is a prime example. Currently the origin of life is a popular argument for God (although a classic argument from ignorance), and an area where we very well may have a scientific answer in the next decade, at which time, the ‘origin of life’ argument will fade away and be replaced by another, thus moving the figurative goalposts farther back as our understanding of the natural world increases. Exception: This fallacy should not be confused with an argument or set of arguments, with multiple propositions inherent in the argument. The reason for the difference between this kind of argument and the moving the goalposts fallacy, is a subtle one, but indicated by a strong initial claim (‘has to be’, ‘must’, ‘required for’, etc.) that gets answered and/or what appears to be ad hoc objections that follow eventually leading to an impossible request for proof. Fun Fact: The name ‘moving the goalposts’ comes from the analogy of kicking a perfect field goal in American football, only to have the goalposts be moved on you. This would be very unfair. References: This a logical fallacy frequently used on the Internet. No academic sources could be found. Questions about this fallacy? Ask our community!"

2. **Step 2**: Identify the core claim and supporting reasons.
   - Core Claim: The argument about the existence of God continually shifts its basis as new scientific understanding invalidates previous arguments.
   - Supporting Reasons: Historical shift from creationism to intelligent design, and the current focus on the origin of life as an argument for God's existence.

3. **Step 3**: Compare with defective argument types:
   - **<G>** Generalization: No specific generalization based on a single instance.
   - **<FE>** False Enumeration: No mention of limiting the options to fewer or more than actually exist.
   - **<IR>** Inappropriate Reason: Examining the reasons provided.
   - **<RR>** Redundant Reason: The argument does not merely restate the proposition.
   - **<WCB>** Weak Causal Basis: The argument does not present a weak causal relationship.
   - **<FU>** False Universals: The argument does not claim universal agreements without proof.
   - **<DEP>** Double-Edged Phrases: The argument does not involve statements open to dual interpretations.

   Given the context and description, the argument portrays the "moving the goalposts" fallacy, which involves shifting the criteria for proof or argument as previous criteria are addressed.

4. **Step 4**: Determine the category that fits best:
   - The argument presents an "Inappropriate Reason" by shifting arguments to avoid definitive answers and changing the criteria for proving or disproving God's existence, characterized as moving the goalposts.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis according to <IDAA>, the defective argument type of the provided argument is best classified under **<IR>** (Inappropriate Reason), specifically the subset known as "moving the goalposts," where shifting arguments continuously change the basis of proof as each argument gets addressed by scientific understanding.
