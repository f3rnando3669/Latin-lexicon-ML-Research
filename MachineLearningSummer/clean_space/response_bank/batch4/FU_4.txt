For 
To apply the IDAA (application of decomposition to the task of identifying defective arguments) to the provided string:

"Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding."

we need to follow the specific steps of decomposition:

1. **Read and Understand**:
   - Read the string carefully to grasp the main proposition. The person is justifying their driving speed by comparing it to the speed of other drivers around them.

2. **Identify Keywords and Structure**:
   - Keywords: "only driving as fast as everyone around me"
   - Structure: Comparison, implied justification based on others' actions.

3. **Match with Definition Patterns**:
   - Identify if the argument matches any of the predefined defective argument types:
     - Generalization (<G>): No, it's not claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
     - False Enumeration (<FE>): No, it’s not listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
     - Inappropriate Reason (<IR>): No, it’s not providing a reason unrelated to the logic of the proposition.
     - Redundant Reason (<RR>): No, it’s not repeating restating the same thing as the proposition.
     - Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>): No, it’s not offering a weak causal reason.
     - False Universals (<FU>): Yes, it implies justification because “everyone around me” was doing it, assuming universal agreement without proof.
     - Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>): No, it’s not using a statement open to dual interpretations.

4. **Cross-Check**:
   - Compare with the definition of False Universals (<FU>): Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
   - “Everyone around me” implies a universal behavior, used as justification for the individual's behavior without offering proof that this makes it acceptable.

5. **Select and Confirm**:
   - Select <FU> as the defective argument type.
   - Confirm the selection: The statement matches the definition and example of False Universals as it relies on a supposed common behavior (everyone driving fast) to validate the speaker's own actions.

Final determination: The given string "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding." is an instance of False Universals (<FU>).

By following the systematic decomposition process, we have identified that the defective argument type for the given string is <FU> (False Universals).
