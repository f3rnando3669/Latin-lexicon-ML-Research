Sure, let's apply the decomposed steps of identifying a defective argument to the given string using the definition and approach outlined above.

### Given String:
"I see nobody on the road," said Alice.
"I only wish I had such eyes," the king remarkedâ€¦"To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why it's as much as I can do to see real people, by this light."

### Step 1: Analyzing the Argument
- The dialogue involves a humorous exchange where the king interprets 'nobody' as an actual entity that Alice can see.
- The king then makes a remark that involves a dual interpretation of the word "Nobody".

### Step 2: Matching the Argument Type
- The statement made by the king is a playful misinterpretation of Alice's words, suggesting a dual interpretation.
- This kind of statement fits the category of Double-Edged Phrases (\<DEP\>) due to its potential for dual interpretations, leading to an illogical conclusion based on the different meanings.

### Step 3: Conclusion
- Based on the analysis and matching, the given string exemplifies a Double-Edged Phrase (\<DEP\>).

Therefore, the defective argument type for the given string is `<DEP>`.
