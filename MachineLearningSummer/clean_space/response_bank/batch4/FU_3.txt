For 
Let's apply the task decomposition <IDAA> to the given statement: "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way."

### Task Decomposition <IDAA> for the Given Statement

1. **Initial Reading and Comprehension**:
    - **Step 1.1**: Read the argument or statement presented in string <s> thoroughly.
        - Statement: "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way."
    - **Step 1.2**: Understand the context and the claim of the argument.
        - The claim is essentially suggesting that others should act in a certain way because others are already doing so.

2. **Preliminary Classification**:
    - **Step 2.1**: Identify if the argument fits a general pattern of logical fallacies or defective argument types.
        - The statement seems to suggest a behavior based on popularity or the actions of others, indicating it might relate to common logical fallacies like bandwagon or appeal to popularity.

3. **Match Against Defined Defective Argument Types**:
    - **Step 3.1**: Check for Generalization (<G>).
        - This doesn't appear to be claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
    - **Step 3.2**: Check for False Enumeration (<FE>).
        - This isn't listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
    - **Step 3.3**: Check for Inappropriate Reason (<IR>).
        - This isn't providing an irrelevant reason to the proposition.
    - **Step 3.4**: Check for Redundant Reason (<RR>).
        - This isn't saying the same thing as the proposition in other words.
    - **Step 3.5**: Check for Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>).
        - This isn't providing a weak causal reason.
    - **Step 3.6**: Check for False Universals (<FU>).
        - This seems to fit well here as it asserts universally agreed points without proof, aligning with the example that suggests something should be done or agreed to because everyone else is doing it.
        - Example provided in the definition: "You appealed to popularity or the fact that many people do something as an attempted form of validation."
    - **Step 3.7**: Check for Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>).
        - This isn't using language open to dual interpretations that can be used against the speaker.

4. **Confirm the Identified Defective Argument Type**:
    - **Step 4.1**: Validate the classification by checking the argument against detailed examples and definitions.
        - The argument aligns strongly with the definition of False Universals (<FU>), as it encourages an action based on the fact that others are doing it, without any inherent proof or logical reason.
    - **Step 4.2**: Ensure no other defective argument types are a better fit.
        - None of the other categories fit as well as <FU>.
    - **Step 4.3**: Conclusively identify and document the defective argument type as <FU>.

5. **Review and Adjust** (if necessary):
    - **Step 5.1**: Re-read the argument and the steps above to ensure accurate classification.
        - Re-reading confirms that the argument fits the <FU> category well.
    - **Step 5.2**: Amend the classification if other details or a reevaluation suggests a different defective argument type.
        - No changes needed based on our reevaluation.

### Final Identification
The defective argument type for the statement "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way." is conclusively identified as:

**<FU> False Universals**
