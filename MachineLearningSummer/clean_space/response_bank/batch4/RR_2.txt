For 
To apply **<IDAA>** (the decomposition of the task of identifying the type of defective argument) to the string "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity," we follow these steps:

### Step 1: Initial Identification
Identify the main proposition or claim in the string.

- **Main Proposition:** Paranormal activity is real.

### Step 2: Classifying the Argument
Determine which category of defective argument types the claim fits into.

1. **Analysis of the Provided Reason:**
   - The reason given for the main proposition is, "I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."

2. **Assessment:**
   - The reason provided is essentially restating the proposition but just from a personal experience perspective. It does not add any new or different supportive evidence but simply rephrases the main proposition.

### Conclusion
From our definitions, this matches the type called **Redundant Reason (RR)** because it says the same thing as the proposition but in other words.

Thus, the argument "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity" represents the defective argument type **Redundant Reason (RR)**.
