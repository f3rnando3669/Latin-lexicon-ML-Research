Applying the process of decomposition to identify the defective argument for the given string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you." involves the following steps:

- **Step 1**: Read and understand the string.
  - "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you."

- **Step 2**: Compare \(<s>\) against the known types of defective arguments (\<G\>, \<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<RR\>, \<WCB\>, \<FU\>, and \<DEP\>).
  - The string provides a reason for not talking to someone based solely on another person's claim.
  - The reason provided ("My best friend says you’re a liar") does not logically support the decision not to talk to someone; it is an appeal to authority without substantiation.

- **Step 3**: Select the defective argument type that best fits the characteristics of \(<s>\).
  - This matches the definition of **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**.

- **Step 4**: Justify the selected defective argument type by explaining why the specific instance in \(<s>\) matches the chosen type’s definition.
  - The statement fits **Inappropriate Reason (IR)** because it uses a reason ("My best friend says you’re a liar") that does not logically support the conclusion ("I’m not going to talk to you"). This is based on an appeal to an authority (the best friend) without any relevant evidence or logical connection to the conclusion.

Thus, the defective argument type for \(<s>\) is **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**.
