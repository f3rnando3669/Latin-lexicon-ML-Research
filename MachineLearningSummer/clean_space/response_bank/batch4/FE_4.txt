Sure! Let's apply the previously defined decomposition steps (<D>) to the given string to identify the type of defective argument it represents.

### Given String <s>:
"People either like coffee or hate it."

### Applying <D> to <IDA>:

1. **Read and Comprehend the String:**
   - The string says, "People either like coffee or hate it."

2. **Identify Key Components:**
   - Keywords: "either", "like coffee", "hate it."

3. **Check Against Defined Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: This doesn't fit as it is not based on a specific instance claiming a general truth.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: This fits because it lists only two options ("like coffee" or "hate it") when in reality, there could be more options (e.g., being indifferent to coffee).
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: This doesn't fit as there is no reason given to support a proposition.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: This doesn't fit as it isn’t repeating the same idea in different words.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This isn’t about a weak cause-effect scenario.
   - **False Universals (<FU>)**: This doesn’t fit as the string isn't asserting a universal truth without proof.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: This doesn’t fit as the statement is not open to dual interpretations.

4. **Assign the Argument Type:**
   - The argument type is **False Enumeration (<FE>)**, as it lists only two options when there are actually more possibilities.

Thus, by applying <IDAA> to the given string "People either like coffee or hate it.", we identify that the defective argument type is **False Enumeration (<FE>)**.
