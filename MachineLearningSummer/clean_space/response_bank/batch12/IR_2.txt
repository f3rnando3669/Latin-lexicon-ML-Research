To identify the type of defective argument in the statement "In the race for mayor, Lara says a vote for her opponent will lead to you losing your job." we will apply the decomposed approach (\<IDAA>) as defined.

### Step-by-Step Application of \<IDAA>:

1. **Step 1: Read the Argument**
   - **Objective**: Understand the content and context of the given argument.
   - **Given Argument**: "In the race for mayor, Lara says a vote for her opponent will lead to you losing your job."

2. **Step 2: Identify Keywords and Phrases**
   - **Objective**: Look for specific keywords or phrases that might indicate the type of defective argument.
   - **Keywords/Phrases Identified**: "a vote for her opponent will lead to you losing your job."

3. **Step 3: Cross-Reference with Definitions**
   - **Objective**: Compare the noted keywords and context from Step 2 with the provided list of defective argument types.

   **Comparison with Each Type**:
   - \<G> (Generalization): This isn't a broad claim about many people based on one instance.
   - \<FE> (False Enumeration): The argument doesn't present a false choice with limited options.
   - \<IR> (Inappropriate Reason): There isn't an illogical reason given here.
   - \<RR> (Redundant Reason): The argument doesn't simply restate itself.
   - \<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis): The claim that voting for an opponent will result in job loss lacks a compelling causal basis.
   - \<FU> (False Universals): The argument doesn’t assert a universally agreed point without proof.
   - \<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases): The statement isn’t open to dual interpretations.

4. **Step 4: Determine the Type of Defective Argument**
   - **Objective**: Match the argument (\<s>) to the most fitting type of defective argument based on the comparison in Step 3.
   - **Determination**: The argument "a vote for her opponent will lead to you losing your job" suggests a weak causal relationship without substantial evidence.

     The closest matching type based on the provided definitions would be: \<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis) because it argues that one action (voting for her opponent) will directly cause an unrelated outcome (losing your job) without providing adequate justification or proof for such a causation.

5. **Step 5: Validate the Identification**
   - **Objective**: Ensure that the chosen defective argument type accurately reflects the argument, considering any nuances or secondary characteristics.
   - **Validation**: The argument fits under \<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis) as it makes an unsubstantiated claim about the causation between voting choices and job security.

### Conclusion:
By following these decomposed steps (\<IDAA>), we identify that the fallacy committed in the statement "In the race for mayor, Lara says a vote for her opponent will lead to you losing your job." is best classified as \<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis).
