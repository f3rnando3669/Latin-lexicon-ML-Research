For 
To apply the IDAA method to the argument "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses.", we follow the step-by-step process described.

### Steps for Identifying Defective Argument Type (IDA)
1. **Standardize the Argument:** Ensure the argument is in a clear, understandable format.
2. **Identify Key Elements:** Determine the core claim and supporting statement(s).
3. **Classify the Defective Argument:** Use the definitions provided to match the argument to the appropriate defective argument type.

### Decomposition of IDA (IDAA)
1. **Read and Understand the Argument:**
   - Carefully read the given argument to understand its meaning.
2. **Identify the Core Proposition and Reasoning:**
   - Extract the main claim (proposition) being made.
   - Identify the supporting statement or reasoning provided for the claim.
3. **Compare with Definitions:**
   - Compare the extracted proposition and reasoning with each type of defective argument as defined (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).
   - Look for keyword indicators or structural clues.
4. **Select the Best Fit:**
   - Choose the defective argument type that best matches the identified elements of the argument.
5. **Validate the Classification:**
   - Re-check the selected defective argument type to ensure it correctly fits the argument.

### Analysis
**Argument:** "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."

1. **Read and Understand:**
   - The argument consists of three statements: a general moral rule, a classification of fetuses, and the conclusion that follows from these premises.
   
2. **Identify the Core Proposition and Reasoning:**
   - **Proposition:** It is immoral to kill fetuses.
   - **Supporting Reasoning:** 
     1. It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. (General moral principle)
     2. Fetuses are innocent human beings.

3. **Compare with Definitions:**
   - **Generalization (G):** Doesn't fit, as the argument doesn't make a broad claim based on a specific instance.
   - **False Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable, since the argument doesn't present a limited set of options.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (IR):** The reasons provided do appear logically connected to the conclusion.
   - **Redundant Reason (RR):** The argument isn't repeating itself in different words.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (WCB):** Not appropriate since the reasoning isn't about weak causality.
   - **False Universals (FU):** Not applicable, as the argument isn't asserting universally agreed points without proof.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP):** Not relevant here since the phrases used are not open to dual interpretations.

Given this analysis, the argument appears to present a logical syllogism (if both premises are accepted as true, the conclusion follows).

**Conclusion:**
The provided argument "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses." does not clearly fit into any of the defined defective argument categories (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP). Based on the decomposed steps, it seems to follow a logical structure and may not be an example of a defective argument as defined by the listed categories.

Thus, it might be an example of a non-defective argument or a valid argument outside the scope of the provided defective argument types.
