For 
Certainly! Let's apply <IDAA> to the argument "Everyone else is doing it, so should you."

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition
- **Proposition:** You should do something because everyone else is doing it.

### Step 2: Analyze the Supporting Evidence
- **Evidence:** The only evidence provided is the assertion that everyone else is engaging in the activity, implying a social consensus or majority behavior as the reasoning.

### Step 3: Categorize the Argument Type
- **Comparison to Argument Types:**
  - **<G>:** No, this is not claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
  - **<FE>:** No, it isn’t listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
  - **<IR>:** No, this isn’t providing an inappropriate reason unrelated to the proposition.
  - **<RR>:** No, this isn’t merely restating the proposition in different words.
  - **<WCB>:** No, it isn’t providing a weak causal relationship.
  - **<FU>:** Yes, the argument asserts what everyone else is doing as a universal reason without any proof other than the supposed popularity.
  - **<DEP>:** No, this isn’t a statement open to dual interpretations.

- **Identified Type:** <FU> (False Universals).

### Step 4: Justify the Categorization
- **Rationale:** The argument "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" exemplifies the <FU> fallacy (False Universals) because it appeals to the popularity of an action as a legitimate reason for an individual to do the same. It assumes that since a majority or everyone else is doing it, it is a universally acceptable or correct action without providing any substantive basis or proof beyond the appeal to popularity.

By following these systematic steps, we can clearly identify that the defective argument type in "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" is <FU> (False Universals).
