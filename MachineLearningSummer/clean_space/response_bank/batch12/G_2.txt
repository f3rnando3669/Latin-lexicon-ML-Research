Sure, let's apply the steps of <IDAA> to classify the defective argument type for the provided string:

<s> = "The teenagers were rude and disrespectful; therefore, all teenagers are rude and disrespectful."

### Steps for Identifying the Type of Defective Argument

1. **Input Analysis**:
    - Read the given argument carefully: "The teenagers were rude and disrespectful; therefore, all teenagers are rude and disrespectful."
    - This string implies that because some teenagers were observed to be rude and disrespectful, all teenagers must be the same.

2. **Category Comparison**:
    - Recall the categories of defective arguments: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>.
    - We need to compare the given argument <s> against these categories to find the best match.

3. **Identification of Key Features**:
    - The phrase "The teenagers were rude and disrespectful" describes an observed specific instance.
    - The conclusion "therefore, all teenagers are rude and disrespectful" generalizes this observation to an entire group.

4. **Match with Definitions**:
    - Compare the identified features with the definitions:
        - <G> (Generalization): Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
        - <FE> (False Enumeration): Lists fewer or more options than exist.
        - <IR> (Inappropriate Reason): Provides a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition.
        - <RR> (Redundant Reason): Says the same thing as the proposition but in other words.
        - <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis): Offers a reason that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
        - <FU> (False Universals): Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
        - <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases): Uses statements open to dual interpretations.

5. **Classification**:
    - The argument starts with an instance ("The teenagers were rude") and jumps to a sweeping statement about all teenagers.
    - This clearly matches <G> — Generalization, as it is claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.

6. **Confirmation**:
    - Review the reasoning to ensure it aligns with the definition of <G>.
    - The observed behavior of some teenagers is used to make a sweeping statement about all teenagers, which perfectly fits the definition of Generalization.

### Conclusion:

Based on the structured analysis, the argument:

<s> = "The teenagers were rude and disrespectful; therefore, all teenagers are rude and disrespectful."

is classified as:

<**G**> — Generalization.
