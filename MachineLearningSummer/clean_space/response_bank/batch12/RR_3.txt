For 
To identify the type of defective argument in the provided dialogue, we will apply the outlined steps of IDAA. 

### String \( s \):
"Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified.
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so.
Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct?
Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran."

### Decomposition of IDAA:

1. **Parse the Input:**
   - The argument presented involves multiple claims and justifications.
   - Primary claim: Jesus was not really crucified.

2. **Preliminary Analysis:**
   - Claim: Jesus was not really crucified.
   - First Justification: Because the Quran says so.
   - Secondary Justification: The Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.
   - Tertiary Justification: Because God tells us so, here in the Quran.

3. **Classify the Argument:**
   - Compare against:
     1. **Generalization (<G>):** Not claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
     2. **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Not listing fewer or more options than exist.
     3. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** It's not clear inappropriate reasoning since the argument is about validation.
     4. **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** The argument seems to be saying, "The Quran is true because it is the Word of God," which is a restatement in other words.
     5. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Not offering a weak reason to support a proposition.
     6. **False Universals (<FU>):** It does not assert universally agreed points without proof but attempts to use the text for validation.
     7. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Does not use statements open to dual interpretations.

4. **Matching and Decision:**
   - The argument fits **Redundant Reason (RR)** as it says the Quran is true because it says it's the Word of God, which is the same idea restated without additional proof.

5. **Return the Identification:**
   - **<RR>**

### Result:
For the dialogue provided, the identified defective argument type is **<RR>** (Redundant Reason).

This structured approach ensures that the argument is systematically analyzed, compared, and correctly classified among the predefined defective argument types.
