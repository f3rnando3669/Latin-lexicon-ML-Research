For 
To apply the task of <IDAA> to the argument "People either like coffee or hate it," we will follow the structured decomposition steps to identify the type of defective argument encapsulated in this string.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDA

1. **Understand the Argument**:
    - **Read the argument carefully**: The statement here claims that there are only two possible attitudes people can have towards coffeeâ€”either they like it, or they hate it.
    - **Identify the proposition and the supporting statements**: The proposition is the dichotomy presented: people either like coffee or hate it. There is no additional supporting statement provided.

2. **Identify Key Patterns and Indicators**:
    - **Look for generalizations**: The argument isn't necessarily making a general truth from a specific instance, but it's generalizing people's attitudes towards coffee.
    - **Check for enumerations**: This argument lists two options (like or hate), suggesting these are the only possible attitudes.
    - **Evaluate the reasons given**: There is no explicit reason given here.
    - **Redundancy checks**: Doesn't seem to restate the proposition.
    - **Causal basis**: There is no causal argument present.
    - **Universal claims**: It assumes a universal stance by implying everyone fits into one of these two categories.
    - **Ambiguity**: The statement is clear without any dual interpretations.

3. **Match to Definitions**:
    - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: This argument claims there are only two options (like or hate), excluding neutral or indifferent feelings towards coffee.

4. **Assignment of Defective Argument Type**:
    - The most fitting defective argument type for this string is: **<FE> - False Enumeration.** This argument falsely limits the number of possible attitudes towards coffee to just two, neglecting other possibilities such as indifference or mixed feelings.

Therefore, the defective argument type for "People either like coffee or hate it." is **<FE>**.
