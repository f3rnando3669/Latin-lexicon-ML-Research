For 
Let’s apply the decomposition steps of <IDAA> to the statement: "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."

### Step-by-Step Application of <IDAA>:

1. **Read the Argument:**
    - The argument here is: "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."

2. **Identify Key Elements:**
    - The key elements are the words "either" and "or," indicating a binary choice is being presented.

3. **Compare with Definitions:**
    - Based on the key elements, let’s compare this argument with the provided definitions:
        - **<G> (Generalization):** No evidence of broad claims based on specific instances.
        - **<FE> (False Enumeration):** This definition includes arguments listing fewer or more options than actually exist, typically framed as either/or situations.
        - **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason):** No indication that the reason provided is not logically supporting the proposition.
        - **<RR> (Redundant Reason):** Not a case of redundancy or circular reasoning.
        - **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis):** No weak causal relationship presented here.
        - **<FU> (False Universals):** No universally agreed points without proof presented.
        - **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases):** Not using statements open to dual interpretations.

    - The argument matches the definition of **<FE> (False Enumeration)** as it presents a false binary choice, suggesting that there are only two mutually exclusive options regarding support for Hillary Clinton and belief in women's rights.

4. **Assign Type:**
    - The corresponding defective argument type for the given string is **<FE> (False Enumeration)**.

5. **Verify:**
    - Double-checking, the context and language indicate the argument falls into the category of presenting a limited set of options when more may exist, matching the False Enumeration type.

### Conclusion:
The argument "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" is an instance of **<FE> (False Enumeration)**.
