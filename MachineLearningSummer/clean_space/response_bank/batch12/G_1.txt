For 
Let's apply the steps of <IDAA> to the given argument: "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!"

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Read and Understand the Argument**:
   - We have a statement that makes a claim about the guilt of an individual based on an affiliation with an organization that has been accused of wrongdoing.

2. **Identify Key Components**:
   - **Premise**: The Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up.
   - **Conclusion**: Therefore, the 102-year-old Catholic neighbor is guilty as well.

3. **Classify the Argument Type**:
   - This argument applies a broad accusation (involvement in a sex scandal cover-up) to an individual based solely on their affiliation (being Catholic and attending Church).

4. **Match Argument to Definition**:
   - The argument seems to be making an unjustified generalization about an individual based on the specific instance involving the organization. It is assuming that specific guilt applies universally to all members of that organization.
   - This falls under the category of <G> (Generalization), as it generalizes the guilt of a specific group to a particular individual without direct evidence of the individual's involvement.

5. **Provide Justification**:
   - This argument is classified as <G> (Generalization) because it takes the action of the Catholic Church (being involved in a cover-up) and unjustly extends the guilt to a specific member (the 102-year-old neighbor) simply based on their association with the Church, without any specific evidence of the neighbor's involvement.

Thus, the argument "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!" is identified as a **Generalization (<G>)**.
