### Decomposition and Application Process

We will now apply the decomposition process (<IDAA>) to identify the defective argument in the string "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people."

#### Step 1: Parse the Argument
- **Proposition**: "We need to fix our broken judicial system."
- **Supporting Statement**: "By electing new people."

#### Step 2: Identify Key Features
- **Keywords/Patterns**: 
  - A general statement about the judicial system being "broken."
  - A proposed solution of "electing new people."

#### Step 3: Compare with Known Types
- **Generalization (<G>)**: This does not seem to be a claim of a general truth based only on specific instances.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: There is a proposition that electing new people is the only solution, which may indicate fewer options than exist.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided (electing new people) does not logically follow as the only method to fix the judicial system.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: This does not seem to repeat the proposition in different words.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The link between electing new people and fixing the judicial system is weak without further substantiation.
- **False Universals (<FU>)**: There isn't an assertion that represents a universally agreed point without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: No dual interpretations are evident that work against the speaker.

#### Step 4: Determine the Defective Argument Type
- **Comparison Result**: 
  - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Suggesting that electing new people is the singular solution.
  - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)** or **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The solution proposed (electing new people) does not logically or convincingly follow from the identified problem of the judicial system being "broken."

Considering the argument, the strongest matches are <FE>, <IR>, and <WCB>. Upon closer examination, the best fit is <IR> because the reason provided (electing new people) does not logically support the complexity of fixing a "broken judicial system."

### Conclusion
The defective argument type for the provided string is **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**.
