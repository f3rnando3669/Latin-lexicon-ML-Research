For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far," let's follow the decomposed steps:

### Step-by-Step Breakdown of <IDA> (Applying Decomposition to Argument Identification):

1. **Read and Understand the String (<s>)**:
   - Carefully read the given string to understand the argument being made.
   - The argument suggests that the election of Donald Trump is due to liberals taking political correctness too far.

2. **Identify Keywords and Phrases**:
   - Key phrases: "The reason Donald Trump got elected," "liberals took political correctness too far."

3. **Compare with Argument Type Definitions**:
   - **<G> (Generalization)**: This doesn't seem to be making a broad generalization based on a specific instance.
   - **<FE> (False Enumeration)**: This argument is not presenting a limited set of choices; it's providing a reason for an event.
   - **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**: This could fit if the reason provided (liberals taking political correctness too far) doesn't logically support the main proposition (why Donald Trump got elected).
   - **<RR> (Redundant Reason)**: The argument is not restating the same idea in different words.
   - **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**: This seems to fit if the causal link suggested is weak or unsubstantiated.
   - **<FU> (False Universals)**: This is not asserting universally agreed points without proof.
   - **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)**: This doesn't appear to involve dual interpretations.

4. **Cross-Check Multiple Categories**:
   - The argument doesn't fit well with generalization, false enumeration, redundant reasoning, false universals, or double-edged phrases.
   - It appears to suggest a causal relationship that may be weak or not compelling (weak causal basis).

5. **Assign Argument Type**:
   - Based on the characteristics and comparison, the defective argument type seems to best fit the description of <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis).

6. **Verify and Validate**:
   - Double-check the classification.
   - The argument suggests a singular, perhaps exaggerated reason for a complex event like an election, which typically has many contributing factors. This implies a weak causal link.

### Conclusion:
The string "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far." most appropriately fits the defective argument type <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis).

**Result**: <WCB>
