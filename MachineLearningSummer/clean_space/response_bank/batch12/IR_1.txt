For 
Let's apply IDAA to the string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you." by decomposing the task of identifying the type of defective argument.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Argument

1. **Read through the string:**
   - The statement is: "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you."

2. **Determine the main assertion:**
   - The speaker is asserting that they will not talk to the listener because their best friend claims the listener is a liar.

3. **Note any examples or reasons:**
   - The reason provided for not talking to the listener is based on the best friend's claim about the listener being a liar.

### Step 2: Identify Key Features

1. **Identify clues in the argument:**
   - The main claim is that the speaker will not engage in conversation with the listener.
   - The supporting reason is that the speaker's best friend has labeled the listener as a liar.

2. **Look for indicators of defective argument types:**
   - Does the argument rely on a single opinion to make a general judgment about the listener? Yes.
   - Is the reason provided (best friend's opinion) appropriate and logical to support the main claim? No, it relies on hearsay.

### Step 3: Classify the Argument

1. **Compare identified features with predefined types:**

   - **Generalization (G):** No, this argument is not making a broad statement about a group based on a specific instance.
   - **False Enumeration (FE):** No, the argument is not presenting false dichotomies or options.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (IR):** Yes, the reason (the best friend's claim) does not logically support the proposition (not talking to the listener). It relies on second-hand information without direct evidence.
   - **Redundant Reason (RR):** No, the argument does not simply restate the proposition in different words.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (WCB):** There is no causal link provided.
   - **False Universals (FU):** No, the argument is not asserting universally agreed points.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP):** No, the argument does not involve dual interpretations.

2. **Determine the best-fit category:**
   - The argument in the string relies on an inappropriate reason — the opinion of the best friend — to support the action of not talking to the listener. This matches the characteristics of **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, we classify the argument in the string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you." as **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**.
