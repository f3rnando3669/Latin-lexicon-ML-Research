Applying the process of identifying the defective argument type to the string "Get Verizon—1 billion people can't be wrong." involves several steps. Here is how we decompose and systematically analyze it:

### Step 1: Understand the Claim
- **Proposition**: "You should get Verizon."
- **Reason**: "1 billion people can't be wrong."

### Step 2: Categorize the Argument
We need to categorize this argument by matching it against the definitions of each defective argument type:

- **Generalization** (`<G>`): This doesn't seem to generalize based on a few instances but rather relies on the number of people.
  
- **False Enumeration** (`<FE>`): This doesn't provide a choice or dichotomy.
  
- **Inappropriate Reason** (`<IR>`): The given reason points to a large number of people rather than a logical or direct support to why Verizon should be chosen.
  
- **Redundant Reason** (`<RR>`): The argument is not just repeating the proposition in different words.
  
- **Weak Causal Basis** (`<WCB>`): It doesn't imply a weak causal link but rather focuses on the popularity to justify the choice.
  
- **False Universals** (`<FU>`): This seems promising as it appeals to the popularity of Verizon among 1 billion people without providing substantive proof that this makes Verizon the best choice.
  
- **Double-Edged Phrases** (`<DEP>`): The argument does not have a dual interpretation issue.

### Step 3: Match Example to Category
Upon reviewing the definitions and examples, this argument aligns with `<FU>` (False Universals):

- **False Universals** (`<FU>`): "Get Verizon—1 billion people can't be wrong." makes a universal claim based on popularity. The implication here is that since many people have chosen Verizon, it must be the correct choice. This type of reasoning applies popularity as an attempt to validate the proposition without substantial evidence.

### Step 4: Conclusion
- The string "Get Verizon—1 billion people can't be wrong." falls under the category of `<FU>` (False Universals).

Therefore, the defective argument type for the given string is `<FU>`.
