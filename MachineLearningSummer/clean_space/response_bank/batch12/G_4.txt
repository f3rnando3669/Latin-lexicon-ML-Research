Sure, let's apply the IDAA process to the statement: "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess, all the other classes will all fail it, too."

1. **Preliminary Analysis**:
   - The statement mentions that three kids in one class failed a quiz and jumps to the conclusion that all other classes will fail it as well.

2. **Classification Prompt Check**:
   - **<G>**: The statement seems to make a general claim based on the specific instance of three kids failing in one class.
   - **<FE>**: It does not list binary or incorrect options.
   - **<IR>**: The reason seems to be related but leads to an illogical conclusion.
   - **<RR>**: The statement does not simply restate the proposition.
   - **<WCB>**: Thereâ€™s a weak causal connection implied.
   - **<FU>**: It does not appeal to popular opinion or generalizations without proof.
   - **<DEP>**: Does not use ambiguous language open to dual interpretations.

3. **Keyword Identification**:
   - The phrases like "I guess" and generalization from "three kids" to "all the other classes" are key.

4. **Contextual Cross-Referencing**:
   - The argument is generalizing from a small specific instance to a broader population without sufficient justification.

5. **Categorical Matching**:
   - **<G>**: Fits because it claims something general (all other classes failing) based on a specific instance (three kids in one class failing).

6. **Validation and Verification**:
   - Rereading the argument confirms it jumps from three kids in one class to all classes, a clear case of generalization from an insufficient sample.

Thus, the statement "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess, all the other classes will all fail it, too." is best identified as <G> (Generalization).
