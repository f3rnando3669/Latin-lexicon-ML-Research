For 
Sure, let's apply the steps outlined in <IDAA> to analyze and classify the string:

### String <s>: 
"Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding."

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understand the Argument:**
   - **Proposition:** The speaker claims they were not speeding.
   - **Reasoning:** The justification is that they were driving as fast as everyone else around them.

2. **Identify Defense Mechanism:**
   - The defense mechanism hinges on comparing the speaker's speed to that of others, implying that conformity with the crowd exempts one from individual wrongdoing.

3. **Compare with Definitions:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** Does not apply here as the argument is not about making a general truth from a specific instance.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Does not apply since no options are being enumerated.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Could apply since the reasoning might not logically support the proposition. However, it seems more apt to a different category.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Does not apply as the argument is not using redundancy.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Does not fit because the causality aspect is weak here.
   - **False Universals (<FU>):** This might be a strong candidate because it asserts a point of universal behavior (everyone speeding) without evidence and uses it as a reason for the correctness of the action.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Does not fit because there is no dual interpretation problem here.

4. **Classify the Argument:**
   - The argument falls under the defective argument type **False Universals (<FU>)**. The reasoning relies on the implied universal behavior (everyone is speeding), suggesting that what is universally done must be accepted, which is fallacious.

### Conclusion:
The string "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding." is identified as a **False Universals (FU)** type of defective argument.
