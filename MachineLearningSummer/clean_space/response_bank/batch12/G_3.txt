Sure, let's apply the structured approach (<IDAA>) to the provided string "One of our clients doubled their conversions after changing all their landing page text to bright red. Therefore, changing all text to red is a proven way to double conversions."

### Steps of <IDAA>

#### 1. Decompose the Argument:
- **Proposition or Claim:** Changing all text to red is a proven way to double conversions.
- **Supporting Reason:** One of our clients doubled their conversions after changing all their landing page text to bright red.

#### 2. Match with Definitions:
- Compare the structure of the argument with the definitions of the defective arguments (Generalization <G>, False Enumeration <FE>, Inappropriate Reason <IR>, Redundant Reason <RR>, Weak Causal Basis <WCB>, False Universals <FU>, and Double-Edged Phrases <DEP>).

#### 3. Classification:

1. **Generalization <G>:**
   - The argument claims a general truth ("changing all text to red is a proven way to double conversions") based on a single instance ("one of our clients doubled their conversions").
   - It fits the definition because it draws a broad conclusion from a specific case.

Therefore, the argument type identified in the string is <G> (Generalization).

### Conclusion

Using the **IDAA** method, we deconstructed the argument, matched it with the defect definitions, and classified it as <G> (Generalization). The string "One of our clients doubled their conversions after changing all their landing page text to bright red. Therefore, changing all text to red is a proven way to double conversions." is an example of Generalization.
