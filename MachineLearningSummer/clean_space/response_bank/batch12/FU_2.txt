For 
Sure, let's apply <IDAA> to analyze the argument "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way."

### Step-by-Step Breakdown of <IDA> into <IDAA>:

**Step 1: Reading and Comprehension**
- The argument suggests that the audience should join a group or act in a certain way simply because others are doing the same.

**Step 2: Identification of Key Features**
- The key feature of this argument is the reliance on the behavior of others as the main reason to take action. It essentially promotes conformity based on popularity or majority behavior.

**Step 3: Comparison to Definitions**
- An argument that encourages action based on what others are doing aligns with the idea of asserting a universally agreed point without proof. This is specifically about using the popularity of an action as validation and encouraging others to follow suit.

**Step 4: Matching**
- Comparing the key features of the argument with the definitions provided, this matches with the definition of False Universals (<FU>).

**Step 5: Verification**
- Verification confirms that the argument fits with <FU> because it relies on the flawed reasoning that the actions of others, without independent justification or proof, are a valid reason to act in the same way.

### Conclusion
The statement "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way." is an example of <FU> (False Universals). It suggests that one should follow the actions of others merely because they are popular or widely accepted, which is a classic example of asserting a universal point without proper proof.

By systematically decomposing the identification process into these steps, we've accurately identified the defective argument type as <FU>.
