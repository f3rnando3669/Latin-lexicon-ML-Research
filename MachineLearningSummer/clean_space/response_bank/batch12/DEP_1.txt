For 
To apply <IDAA> to "When the judge asked the defendant why he hadn't paid his parking fines, he said that he shouldn't have to pay them because the sign said 'Fine for parking here' and so he naturally presumed that it would be fine to park there.", we will follow the outlined steps of decomposition and identification:

### Step-by-Step Application

1. **Input Analysis**:
   1.1. **Identify and parse the given string <s>**:
        - **String <s>**: "When the judge asked the defendant why he hadn't paid his parking fines, he said that he shouldn't have to pay them because the sign said 'Fine for parking here' and so he naturally presumed that it would be fine to park there."
   1.2. **Extract key components or phrases**:
        - Judge's question: Why hadn't he paid his parking fines?
        - Defendant's reason: The sign said "Fine for parking here".
        - Defendant's presumption: It would be fine to park there.

2. **Category Evaluation**:
   2.1. **Compare the extracted components with definitions of defective argument types**:
        - The key component is the interpretation of the word "Fine" in the context of parking.
   2.2. **Look for keywords or patterns**:
        - The phrase "Fine for parking here" being interpreted as 'acceptable' instead of 'penalized' suggests a dual interpretation.

3. **Decision Making**:
   3.1. **Evaluate if the argument in <s> fits into any category**:
        - Generalization (<G>): No indication of a broad generalization.
        - False Enumeration (<FE>): Not presenting limited options.
        - Inappropriate Reason (<IR>): Not providing an irrelevant reason.
        - Redundant Reason (<RR>): Not reiterating the same proposition.
        - Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>): Not offering a weak causal link.
        - False Universals (<FU>): Not asserting a universal point.
        - Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):
            - Yes, the argument hinges on the dual interpretation of the word "Fine."

4. **Output Generation**:
   4.1. **Categorization and justification**:
        - The defective argument type for <s> is **Double-Edged Phrases** (<DEP>).
        - **Justification**: The phrase "Fine for parking here" can be interpreted as either acceptable or subject to a fine. The defendant's argument relies on this dual interpretation to justify parking there without paying fines.

### Conclusion
Based on the evaluation, the argument in the given string "When the judge asked the defendant why he hadn't paid his parking fines, he said that he shouldn't have to pay them because the sign said 'Fine for parking here' and so he naturally presumed that it would be fine to park there." falls under the defective argument type <DEP>, Double-Edged Phrases. This is because the defendant exploits the dual interpretation of the word "Fine" to argue his misunderstanding of the parking rule.
