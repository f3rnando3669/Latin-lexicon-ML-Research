To apply the process of decomposition to identify the type of defective argument in the given string, we will follow the steps outlined in <IDAA>:

**Step 1: Read and fully comprehend the argument in <s>.**
The argument discusses the fallacy often used to argue for the existence of God, stating that as science advances, old arguments are replaced by new ones involving unanswered scientific questions. Additionally, it differentiates this fallacy from other complex arguments by highlighting the shifting nature of the claim ("moving the goalposts").

**Step 2: Identify the main claim or proposition within the argument.**
The main claim is that arguments for the existence of God often fall into the "moving the goalposts" fallacy, where old arguments are abandoned for new ones as science provides answers.

**Step 3: Analyze how the evidence or reasoning is related to the claim.**
The evidence presented includes historical shifts from creationism to intelligent design, and more recent arguments involving the origin of life. The reasoning is that as scientific understanding increases, the arguments for God shift to new, currently unexplained phenomena.

**Step 4: Identify any logical structures or common fallacies present.**
The argument appears to be describing a pattern where proponents of a position change their criteria for evidence in response to refutations or new informationâ€”specifically, "moving the goalposts."

**Step 5: Compare these structures or fallacies to the known definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.**
- <G> (Generalization): Not appropriate because the argument is not based on a single specific instance.
- <FE> (False Enumeration): Not relevant because the argument is not about listing options.
- <IR> (Inappropriate Reason): Not suitable because it doesn't provide unrelated evidence.
- <RR> (Redundant Reason): Not applicable because it does not restate the proposition in different words.
- <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis): Not exactly relevant, although the arguments could vary in strength, the claim here focuses on shifting grounds rather than weak causality.
- <FU> (False Universals): Not the main focus, although the argument suggests a broad trend over time.
- <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases): Doesn't fit as the argument is not using ambiguous phrases.

**Step 6: Look for specific markers or keywords that are characteristic of each type.**
The argument uses phrases related to shifting criteria or standards ("moving the goalposts"), indicating a continuous change in the standards of proof required.

**Step 7: Select the defective argument type that best matches the identified characteristics.**
Given the analysis, the pattern described most aligns with "moving the goalposts," a concept where the requirements for proving a claim are continuously changed to avoid refutation. However, this specific fallacy isn't directly listed among <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

**Step 8: Provide a justification for the selected defective argument type based on the analysis.**
Though the specific fallacy "moving the goalposts" isn't directly listed, the description involves elements of shifting standards which could indirectly relate to Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>), as it involves changing the requirements when current arguments weaken. It most closely interacts with the nature of Weak Causal Basis by continuously altering what is deemed necessary to point to a different cause as counter-arguments arise.

Thus, the defective argument described in the string can be best associated with a variant of <WCB> due to the persistent shifting of what constitutes a causal link or sufficient evidence in response to counter-arguments.
