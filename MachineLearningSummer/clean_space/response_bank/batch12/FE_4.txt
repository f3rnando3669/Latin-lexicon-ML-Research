For 
Let's apply the decomposition approach (<IDAA>) to the given argument string:

**Argument <s>:**
"I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today."

**Step-by-Step Application (<IDAA>):**

1. **Read and Understand the Argument:**
   - The argument claims that not being in class today is a reason to doubt someone's goodness.

2. **Identify Potential Keywords or Phrases:**
   - The phrase "I thought you were a good person, but" followed by "you weren’t in class today" indicates a reason for challenging the person's character.

3. **Match with Defective Argument Types:**
   - Generalization (<G>): This argument does not involve making a broad claim based on a specific instance.
   - False Enumeration (<FE>): The argument does not list options.
   - Inappropriate Reason (<IR>): The reason given ("you weren’t in class today") does not logically support the proposition ("you were a good person").
   - Redundant Reason (<RR>): The argument does not restate the same point in different words.
   - Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>): The argument does not provide a weak causal link.
   - False Universals (<FU>): The argument does not assert a universally agreed point without proof.
   - Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>): The argument does not use a statement open to dual interpretations.

4. **Determine the Most Likely Defective Argument Type:**
   - The argument best matches Inappropriate Reason (<IR>): The fact that someone wasn't in class today does not logically imply that they are not a good person.

5. **Justify the Identification:**
   - The argument provides an irrelevant or insufficient reason ("you weren’t in class today") for doubting someone's character ("you were a good person"), which aligns with the definition of Inappropriate Reason.

**Result:**
The argument in <s> is identified as Inappropriate Reason <IR>.
