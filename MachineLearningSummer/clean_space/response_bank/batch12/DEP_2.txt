For 
Applying the task of identifying the type of defective argument in the given string using the decomposition approach, we proceed through the following steps:

### Given Argument
**String \( s \)**:
"Speaker 1: We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change.
Speaker: Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."

### Application of Decomposition to the Task: \( IDAA \)

1. **Parse the Argument (Step 1)**:
   - Understand the argument presented by Speaker 1 and the response by Speaker 2.
   - Speaker 1 is discussing a positive use of people to spread awareness.
   - Speaker 2 rejects participation on the grounds that "using people" is inherently wrong.

2. **Identify Key Features (Step 2)**:
   - Notice the phrase "using people" and its dual interpretations.
   - Speaker 1 uses "using" in a context of having people participate voluntarily.
   - Speaker 2 interprets "using" as exploitation or manipulation.

3. **Match to Definitions (Step 3)**:
   - Compare the identified feature (dual interpretation) against the definitions.
   - This matches the pattern of <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases), where the same term/phrase can be understood in two different ways, potentially misguiding the argument.

4. **Select the Best Fit (Step 4)**:
   - Since the argument's crux is the interpretation of "using" people, leading to a logical misstep, the argument type is <DEP>.

5. **Output the Result (Step 5)**:
   - The identified defective argument type for the string \( s \) is \( \mathbf{<DEP>} \).

### Final Identified Argument Type
The defective argument type in the given string is:

\[ \mathbf{<DEP>} \]
