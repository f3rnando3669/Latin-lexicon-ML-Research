Let's apply the decomposition approach (IDAA) to the argument: "The museum's new gemstones and precious minerals exhibit needs more security guards. If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal a piece of the exhibit."

**Step 1: Read An Argument Carefully**
Carefully read the given string to understand the argument being presented:
- "The museum's new gemstones and precious minerals exhibit needs more security guards."
- "If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal a piece of the exhibit."

**Step 2: Identify Key Components**
Identify the premise(s) and conclusion of the argument:
- Premise: "The museum's new gemstones and precious minerals exhibit needs more security guards."
- Conclusion: "If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal a piece of the exhibit."

**Step 3: Classify the Argument**
Classify how the argument is being made:
- The argument implies only two possibilities: either you agree that more security guards are needed, or you are planning to steal something from the exhibit.
- This formulation excludes other possible reasons someone might disagree (e.g., belief in the adequacy of current security measures).

**Step 4: Match with Defined Types**
Match the components and nature of the argument with the predefined types:
- This argument fits the description of False Enumeration (<FE>), as it presents a limited set of options (agreeing or planning to steal) and ignores other valid alternatives.

**Step 5: Final Determination**
Based on the analysis, identify the specific type of defective argument:
- The argument is a case of False Enumeration (<FE>).

Thus, using the decomposition approach, we have determined that the argument "The museum's new gemstones and precious minerals exhibit needs more security guards. If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal a piece of the exhibit." represents a False Enumeration defective argument (<FE>).
