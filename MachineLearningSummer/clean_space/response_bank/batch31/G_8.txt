For 
To apply the decomposition of the advanced task (<IDAA>) to the string "Sarah likes to run. All girls must like to run.," we'll follow the outlined steps for task <IDA>.

### Steps to Decompose <IDA> (Argument Classification) Task:

1. **Understand the Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Offers an apparent new reason that essentially says the same thing as the proposition.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Presents a weak causal relationship that doesnâ€™t compellingly support the proposition.
   - **False Universals (<FU>)**: Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Uses statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.

2. **Extract Key Elements of <s>**:
   - Specific instance: "Sarah likes to run."
   - General proposition: "All girls must like to run."

3. **Match Features to Definitions**:
   - The argument takes a specific instance (Sarah likes to run) and generalizes it to apply to all members of a group (All girls must like to run).
   - This matches the definition of Generalization (<G>), as it claims a general truth based on a specific instance.

4. **Determine the Closest Match**:
   - Based on the comparison, this argument aligns closely with <G> (Generalization).

5. **Validate the Classification**:
   - Ensuring the fit:
     - The specific example is "Sarah likes to run."
     - The generalized conclusion is "All girls must like to run."
   - This follows the pattern of making a broad generalization from a specific case, confirming that <s> is an example of <G>.

### Conclusion:
The string "Sarah likes to run. All girls must like to run." falls under the defective argument type of Generalization (<G>).

By following these steps systematically, we successfully classified the defective argument type in the example string.
