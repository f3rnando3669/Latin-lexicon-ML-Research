For 
Let's apply the step-by-step decomposition (IDAA) to the statement "But professor, I got all these facts from a program I saw on TV once... I don’t remember the name of it though."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (IDAA)

1. **Identify the Argument Presented in <s>:**
   - **Task:** Break down the statement into its components, identifying the premises and the conclusion, if any.
   - **Example for current statement:** 
     - Premises: The speaker claims they got their information from a TV program.
     - Conclusion: The implied conclusion is that the content from this TV program should be accepted as valid evidence in the discussion.

2. **Classify Based on Argument Structure:**
   - **Task:** Determine the general shape or form of the argument provided. Is it attempting to generalize, list options, provide a reason, etc.?
   - **Example for current statement:**
     - The structure involves providing a reason or source to support the validity of the speaker's facts.

3. **Match the Defective Argument Type:**
   - **Task:** Compare the argument structure to the definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.
   - **Example for current statement:**
     - The core issue with the argument is the use of a weak or inappropriate source without proper attribution or verifiability.

4. **Validate and Confirm the Match:**
   - **Task:** Check if the selected defective argument type sufficiently covers the logical shortcomings, ensuring that it is the most appropriate classification.
   - **Example for current statement:**
     - The argument relies on an unspecified and unverified TV program as its sole basis, which is insufficient to validate the facts being presented. 

### Applying IDAA to the Sample Statement

#### Step 1: Identify the Argument
- **Premises:** The facts were obtained from a TV program.
- **Conclusion:** The facts should be considered valid evidence in the discussion.

#### Step 2: Classify Based on Argument Structure
- The structure suggests that the argument is providing a reason (the TV program) to support the validity of the facts.

#### Step 3: Match the Defective Argument Type
- <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis): The argument provides a weak basis for the proposition. The reliance on an unspecified and unverified TV program isn’t compelling enough to establish the facts as valid.

#### Step 4: Validate and Confirm the Match
- The speaker's argument hinges entirely on the credibility of an unremembered TV program. This basis is insufficient and doesn't logically support the claimed facts, confirming it falls under <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis).

Thus, the statement "But professor, I got all these facts from a program I saw on TV once... I don’t remember the name of it though." can be classified as <WCB> based on the IDAA methodology.
