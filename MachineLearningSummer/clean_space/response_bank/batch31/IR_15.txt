For 
Let's apply the step-by-step decomposition \(<IDAA>\) to classify the argument string \(<s>\) "There's no point listening to you. Everybody knows you're just a little do-gooder."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for \(<IDAA>\):

1. **Step 1: Understand the Definitions**
   - We need to recall the definitions for each defective argument type:
     - **Generalization (<G>)**
     - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**
     - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**
     - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**
     - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
     - **False Universals (<FU>)**
     - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**

2. **Step 2: Analyze the Assertion or Claim in String \(<s>\)**
   - The main assertion is that there's no point in listening to the person being addressed.
   - The reason given is that "Everybody knows you're just a little do-gooder."

3. **Step 3: Evaluate the Logical Structure**
   - The argument connects the claim "there’s no point in listening to you" with the reasoning that "Everybody knows you're just a little do-gooder."
   - This implies a rejection of the person’s opinion based on a perceived characteristic ("do-gooder").

4. **Step 4: Match the Pattern**
   - Compare the logical structure of this argument to the definitions of the defective argument types. 

5. **Step 5: Identify Key Indicators**
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: Not applicable here as it doesn’t claim a general truth from a specific instance.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not applicable as it doesn’t list incorrect options.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: This might be a candidate since the reason provided ("do-gooder") does not logically support the claim (lack of worthiness in listening).
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Not applicable as the statement does not repeat the proposition.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Doesn't fit, as there's no weak causal relationship implied.
   - **False Universals (<FU>)**: Could be another candidate, as it uses "Everybody knows" to assert a universal point without proof.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: This isn’t relevant as there's no dual interpretable phrase.

6. **Step 6: Eliminate Incorrect Classes**
   - Eliminate **<G>**, **<FE>**, **<RR>**, **<WCB>**, and **<DEP>** based on the analysis.
   - Focus on **<IR>** and **<FU>** as potential classifications.

7. **Step 7: Make the Classification**
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: The argument dismisses listening to the individual based on the reason that they're a "do-gooder," which is an irrelevant reason for the claim that the person's opinion is not worth listening to.
   - **False Universals (<FU>)**: The argument employs "Everybody knows" as a universal assertion without proof, which attempts to validate the claim based on supposed universal agreement.

Given that the primary flaw seems to be tying the inappropriateness of the opinion to being a "do-gooder" (which doesn't logically justify dismissing the opinion), the most fitting defective argument type for \(<s>\) would be:

### Classification:
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**

"There's no point listening to you. Everybody knows you're just a little do-gooder." is best classified as **<IR>** because the reason provided does not logically support the claim.
