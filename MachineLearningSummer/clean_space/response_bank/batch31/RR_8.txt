For 
Let's apply <IDAA> to the provided statement: "You must obey the law, because it's illegal to break the law." We'll follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

### Step by Step Classification <D> as applied to <IDA>

#### Step 1: Understanding and Identifying Argument Types

As a reminder, here are the defective argument types we are considering:
- **<G>**: Generalization
- **<FE>**: False Enumeration
- **<IR>**: Inappropriate Reason
- **<RR>**: Redundant Reason
- **<WCB>**: Weak Causal Basis
- **<FU>**: False Universals
- **<DEP>**: Double-Edged Phrases

#### Step 2: Preparation

The string <s> is:
"You must obey the law, because it's illegal to break the law."

#### Step 3: Classification Process

Let's analyze the statement against each defective argument type defined.

- **Generalization (<G>)**: 
  - Does <s> make a broad claim based on a specific instance?
  - Analysis: No, the statement is not making a broad claim based on a specific instance.

- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**:
  - Does <s> list fewer or more options than actually exist?
  - Analysis: No, the statement does not present a situation of limited options.

- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**:
  - Does <s> provide a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition?
  - Analysis: The reason given is that we should obey the law because it's illegal to break the law. While circular, it does not provide an unrelated reason.

- **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**:
  - Does <s> present a new reason that essentially repeats the proposition?
  - Analysis: Yes, "You must obey the law" and "because it's illegal to break the law" are the same concept expressed differently. The reason given does not provide new information but rather restates what is already implied in the proposition.

- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
  - Does <s> offer a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition?
  - Analysis: The statement implies causation but does not explicitly present a weak causal basis. It’s more about the redundancy of the reason.

- **False Universals (<FU>)**:
  - Does <s> assert universally agreed points without proof?
  - Analysis: No, the statement does not make an assertion based on universally agreed points.

- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**:
  - Does <s> use statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker?
  - Analysis: No, the statement does not have a double-edged interpretation.

#### Step 4: Validation

Reviewing the analysis:

- The statement "You must obey the law, because it's illegal to break the law" fits best as a **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**. It appears to give a new reason, but in reality, it just rephrases the proposition using different words without adding new information.

Therefore, the classification of the statement "You must obey the law, because it's illegal to break the law." is <RR>.

### Final Classification

**The string "You must obey the law, because it's illegal to break the law." is classified as <RR> (Redundant Reason).**
