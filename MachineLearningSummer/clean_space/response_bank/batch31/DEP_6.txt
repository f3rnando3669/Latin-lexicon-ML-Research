### Step 1: Understand the String <s>
The string to analyze is:
"Of course I can read Spanish! Look, I just finished this book by Jorge Luis Borges!"
"You lie! Borges isn't Spanish. He's from Argentina."

### Step 2: Identify Key Characteristics
- The first part claims an ability to read Spanish based on finishing a book by Jorge Luis Borges.
- The second part presents a counter-argument that Borges is not Spanish but Argentine.

### Step 3: Compare with Argument Types
We need to determine if the initial claim or the counter-argument fits into one of the defective argument types:
- **<G> (Generalization):** Broad claims based on limited evidence.
- **<FE> (False Enumeration):** Limited or excessive listing of options.
- **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason):** Reason not logically supporting the conclusion.
- **<RR> (Redundant Reason):** Restating the argument in different words without adding new support.
- **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis):** Weak causal links.
- **<FU> (False Universals):** Universal claims without proof.
- **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases):** Ambiguous statements open to multiple interpretations.

### Step 4: Check for Specific Indicators
- The initial claim implies a general ability ("I can read Spanish") based on a specific instance (reading a book by Jorge Luis Borges).
- The counter-argument highlights a factual error but doesn’t directly address the initial claim about the ability to read Spanish.

### Step 5: Match and Classify <s>
- The initial claim fits the definition of **<G>** (Generalization), as it generalizes the ability to read Spanish from a specific instance of reading a book by a particular author.
- The counter-argument doesn’t directly apply to the defective argument types as defined.

### Step 6: Review and Confirm
- The initial claim, "Of course I can read Spanish! Look, I just finished this book by Jorge Luis Borges!" generalizes the person’s ability to read Spanish based on reading a book by Borges. This aligns with the markers of a generalization.
- The counter-argument corrects a factual inaccuracy but doesn’t pertain to a specific defective argument type defined here.

### Conclusion
The string <s>, specifically the claim, "Of course I can read Spanish! Look, I just finished this book by Jorge Luis Borges!" is classified as **<G> (Generalization)**.
