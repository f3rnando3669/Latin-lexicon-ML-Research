Sure, let's break down the process step-by-step for the provided string:

**Given String: "Appealing to popularity or the fact that many people do something as an attempted form of validation"**

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA>:

#### Step 1: Identify the Claim and Context
- **Claim:** "Many people do something as an attempted form of validation."
- **Context:** The sentence is discussing a logical fallacy, specifically appealing to popularity.

#### Step 2: Analyze the Claim against each Defective Argument Type
1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - Not applicable; the claim is not about a specific instance generalizing to a universal truth.

2. **False Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Not applicable; the claim does not list options but instead categorizes a type of reasoning.

3. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):**
   - Not applicable; the sentence does not provide a reason that fails to support a specific proposition but rather describes a type of reasoning.

4. **Redundant Reason (<RR>):**
   - Not applicable; the sentence does not rephrase the same proposition differently.

5. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Not applicable; there is no causal relationship being explained.

6. **False Universals (<FU>):**
   - Applicable; the claim discusses "Appealing to popularity" as a form of validation, which typically involves asserting something is true or valid because many people believe or do it, a form of universally agreed point without proper proof.

7. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):**
   - Not applicable; the sentence does not present a statement open to dual interpretations.

#### Step 3: Classify the Argument Type
- After analyzing, the string fits best under **<FU> (False Universals)** because it describes a logical fallacy about validating something based on its popularity.

Thus, the output for <IDAA> when applied to the string "Appealing to popularity or the fact that many people do something as an attempted form of validation" is **<FU>**.
