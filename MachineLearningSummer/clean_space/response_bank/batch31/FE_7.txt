To classify the argument type of the string "There are two kinds of people in this world: those who like penguins, and those who are terrible monsters." using the decomposition of the task (<IDAA>), we will follow the step-by-step approach outlined:

### Step-by-Step <IDAA> Application

1. **Step 1: Understand the Argument Types**
   - We need to refer to the provided definitions of the defective argument types: G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, and DEP.

2. **Step 2: Parse the Input String**
   - Proposition: "There are two kinds of people in this world"
   - Supporting statement: "those who like penguins, and those who are terrible monsters"

3. **Step 3: Identify Key Characteristics**
   - The statement categorizes people into two groups only: those who like penguins and those who are terrible monsters.
   - This presents a binary choice, implying there are no other types of people.

4. **Step 4: Compare Against Definitions**
   - **G (Generalization)**: Not applicable; it doesn't claim a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - **FE (False Enumeration)**: Potential fit, because the argument lists only two types of people, possibly not accounting for other categories.
   - **IR (Inappropriate Reason)**: Not applicable; it doesn’t provide a logically inappropriate reason.
   - **RR (Redundant Reason)**: Not applicable; it doesn’t restate the proposition using different words.
   - **WCB (Weak Causal Basis)**: Not applicable; it doesn’t provide a weak causal relationship.
   - **FU (False Universals)**: Not applicable; it isn’t asserting a universally agreed point without proof, although it does seem exaggerated.
   - **DEP (Double-Edged Phrases)**: Not applicable; no dual interpretations that could go against the speaker.

5. **Step 5: Classify the Argument Type**
   - Based on the comparison, the statement matches the characteristics of **False Enumeration (FE)**, as it suggests a limited number of categories (i.e., only two types of people).

6. **Step 6: Validate the Classification**
   - Ensure that the classification of **False Enumeration (FE)** is correct by reviewing the logic. The statement does indeed limit people to just two groups, not considering other possibilities.

The final classification for the string "There are two kinds of people in this world: those who like penguins, and those who are terrible monsters." is <FE> (False Enumeration).
