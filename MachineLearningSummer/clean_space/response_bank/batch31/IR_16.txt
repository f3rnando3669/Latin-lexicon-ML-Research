Sure, let's apply the systematic decomposition and classification process (<IDAA>) to the given string:

<s> = "There you are cheating on your husband, how could you ever tell us anything meaningful about ethics?"

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition
The main proposition is:
"How could you ever tell us anything meaningful about ethics?"

### Step 2: Determine the Argument Format
Assessing the structure of the argument:
- The argument is dismissing a speaker's credibility on the topic of ethics based on their personal behavior (cheating on their husband).

### Step 3: Match to Argument Type
We compare this structure against our defective argument definitions:
- <IR> (Inappropriate Reason): Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
Based on the comparison, the argument fits the definition of:
- <IR> (Inappropriate Reason)

### Step 5: Provide Justification
The justification for this classification:
- The proposition "How could you ever tell us anything meaningful about ethics?" dismisses the speaker's ability to discuss ethics purely based on their personal misconduct (cheating on their husband). This dismissal does not logically support the proposition that the person cannot make meaningful or valid points about ethics. This matches the definition of an <IR> (Inappropriate Reason) argument type, where the reason provided does not logically support the conclusion.

By following these steps, we have systematically decomposed and classified the argument as an <IR> (Inappropriate Reason).
