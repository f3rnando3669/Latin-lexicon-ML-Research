To classify the statement "Hillary Clinton wants to take your guns away, and she wants to abolish the Second Amendment." using the IDAA process, we'll follow the detailed steps:

### Step-by-Step Classification

#### Step 1: Understand the Task
The task is to classify the given string into one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

#### Step 2: Identify Key Features of Each Type
- **<G> Generalization**: Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **<FE> False Enumeration**: Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **<IR> Inappropriate Reason**: Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- **<RR> Redundant Reason**: Presents the same idea as the proposition in different words as a new reason.
- **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis**: Offers an insufficient causal basis to support the proposition.
- **<FU> False Universals**: Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
- **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases**: Uses statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.

#### Step 3: Preprocessing the Input
Ensure the input string is clear and doesn't contain extraneous information. The string "Hillary Clinton wants to take your guns away, and she wants to abolish the Second Amendment." is clear and meant as an argument.

#### Step 4: Feature Extraction
Extract key elements from the string:
- The focus is on Hillary Clinton’s alleged intentions.
- Claims about taking guns away and abolishing the Second Amendment.

#### Step 5: Matching Features to Types
Compare the extracted features with the key features of each defective argument type.

1. **<G>**: Does this claim make a general truth based on a specific instance? 
   - No, this isn’t a clear case of generalizing from a specific instance.
   
2. **<FE>**: Does this present limited or exaggerated options?
   - No, it doesn’t present an enumeration of choices but makes an assertion about intentions.

3. **<IR>**: Does the reason logically support the conclusion?
   - The statement doesn’t clearly present a reason and then a conclusion. It just asserts two related intentions.

4. **<RR>**: Is it repeating the same idea in different words?
   - Arguably, the statement "wants to take your guns away" and "abolish the Second Amendment" could be seen as overlapping or redundant. However, while related, they technically claim two actions, not an outright repetition.

5. **<WCB>**: Is the causal relationship strong and compelling?
   - There aren't explicit causal claims made here.

6. **<FU>**: Is it a claim made without sufficient proof and generalized as universally true?
   - Yes, it makes sweeping claims about Hillary Clinton’s intentions without providing evidence. It uses sensational language "wants to take your guns away" and "wants to abolish the Second Amendment."

7. **<DEP>**: Is the statement open to dual interpretations?
   - No, the statement isn’t open to dual interpretations in a way that would contradict the speaker directly.

#### Step 6: Classification
Based on the extracted features and comparison, this statement fits best under **<FU>** (False Universals) because it asserts claims about universally known truths (Hillary Clinton’s intentions) without providing clear evidence for these sweeping assertions.

#### Step 7: Verification
Re-reviewing the statement confirms that:
- It does not present a generalization from specific instances.
- It does not list enumerated choices.
- It does not provide reasons which are then concluded.
- Its overlapping nature is minimal.
- No significant causal basis is presented.
- There's no clear double-edged phrase.
- The best fit remains as **<FU>**, given the lack of evidence for broad claims.

### Conclusion
Using the IDAA process, the statement "Hillary Clinton wants to take your guns away, and she wants to abolish the Second Amendment." is identified as **<FU>** (False Universals).
