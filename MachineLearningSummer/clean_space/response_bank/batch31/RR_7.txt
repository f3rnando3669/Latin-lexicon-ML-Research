For 
To classify the given string "Plagiarism is deceitful because it is dishonest." using the structured approach outlined in IDAA, follow these specific steps:

### Step 1: Understanding the Argument Types
Reaffirm the definitions and characteristics of each defective argument type:
- **<G>: Generalization** - A claim of a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **<FE>: False Enumeration** - Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **<IR>: Inappropriate Reason** - Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- **<RR>: Redundant Reason** - Providing a reason that repeats the proposition using different words.
- **<WCB>: Weak Causal Basis** - Offering a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
- **<FU>: False Universals** - Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
- **<DEP>: Double-Edged Phrases** - Using statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.

### Step 2: Identifying Key Indicators
Identify key indicators or patterns in the string:
- **<G> indicators**: Overgeneralizations (e.g., "all", "every", "never", "always").
- **<FE> indicators**: Limited choices or false dilemmas (e.g., "either...or", "you must", "choose between").
- **<IR> indicators**: Irrelevant or illogical reasons.
- **<RR> indicators**: Reasons that restate the proposition in different words.
- **<WCB> indicators**: Weak causal links or fallacious causal arguments.
- **<FU> indicators**: Universal agreement without evidence.
- **<DEP> indicators**: Ambiguous statements open to dual interpretations.

### Step 3: Input String Analysis
Analyze the string "Plagiarism is deceitful because it is dishonest." to spot the presence of key indicators:
- The proposition: "Plagiarism is deceitful."
- The reason provided: "because it is dishonest."

### Step 4: Mapping to Argument Types
Map the identified indicators from the string to the corresponding defective argument types.
- The reason "because it is dishonest" essentially restates "Plagiarism is deceitful" without providing new information or a different perspective. 

### Step 5: Classification Decision
Classify the string based on the analysis:
- The redundancy in the reason indicates that the argument is merely repeating the proposition in different words.

Therefore, the string "Plagiarism is deceitful because it is dishonest." falls under the category of **<RR>: Redundant Reason**.

### Conclusion
The defective argument type for the given string is **<RR>: Redundant Reason**.
