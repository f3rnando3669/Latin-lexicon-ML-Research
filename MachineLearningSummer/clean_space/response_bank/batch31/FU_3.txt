For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying the string) to the string "See the movie that everybody's talking about," we will follow the methodical steps outlined in the decomposition.

### Step 1: Identify the Argument in the String

**a. Extract the main proposition or claim from the string.**
- Claim: "See the movie."

**b. Extract supporting premises or reasons provided for the claim.**
- Premise: "That everybody's talking about."

### Step 2: Analyze the Nature of the Argument

**a. Determine if the argument is making a generalization.**
- The argument does not appear to be making a generalization based on a specific instance.

**b. Determine if the argument is listing options (enumeration).**
- The argument does not list multiple options.

**c. Examine the relevance of the reason provided.**
- The reason provided ("everybody's talking about") is meant to suggest that widespread discussion is a good reason to see the movie, but we'll analyze its nature further.

**d. Identify if the reason is just rephrasing the proposition.**
- The reason is not simply a rephrasing of the proposition.

**e. Check if the reason provided suggests a weak causal relationship.**
- The reason provided does not suggest a causal relationship.

**f. Check if the argument asserts a universally agreed point without proof.**
- The argument asserts that "everybody" talking about the movie is a sufficient reason to see it, without any supporting proof. This implies an appeal to popularity.

**g. Determine if the argument includes a statement open to dual interpretations.**
- The statement does not seem to be open to dual interpretations.

### Step 3: Classify the Argument

**f.** Given that the argument is asserting a universally agreed point without proof, and it is essentially using an appeal to popularity (argumentum ad populum), it classifies as a <FU>.

Thus, the classification of the string "See the movie that everybody's talking about" is of type <FU>.
