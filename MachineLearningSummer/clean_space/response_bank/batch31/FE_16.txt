For 
To apply \( <IDAA> \) to the string "When a statement falsely claims or assumes an 'either / or' situation, when in fact there is at least one additional logically valid option, it is called...", we will follow the decomposition steps outlined previously.

### Step 1: Identify Key Elements
- **Main point**: The string describes a situation where a statement falsely claims or assumes an "either/or" scenario.
- **Reason**: It emphasizes that there is at least one additional logically valid option that is not considered.

### Step 2: Compare with Definitions
Let's check the available defective argument types to see which matches our string:
- \( <G> \) Generalization: This type involves making a general truth claim based on a specific instance, which doesn't fit our string.
- \( <FE> \) False Enumeration: This type involves listing fewer or more options than actually exist, which seems to closely match our string’s description of "either/or" situations when other options are available.
- \( <IR> \) Inappropriate Reason: This involves giving a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition, which doesn't fit our string.
- \( <RR> \) Redundant Reason: This is about restating the proposition in different words, which doesn't fit our string.
- \( <WCB> \) Weak Causal Basis: This involves offering an insufficient causal basis, which doesn't fit our string.
- \( <FU> \) False Universals: This involves asserting universally agreed points without proof, which doesn't fit our string.
- \( <DEP> \) Double-Edged Phrases: This involves using statements open to dual interpretations, which doesn't fit our string.

### Step 3: Analyze Specific Indicators
Our string describes a scenario where an "either/or" situation is falsely claimed, implying that not all available options are accounted for.

### Step 4: Make a Determination
The defective argument type that most closely aligns with the situation described in the string is:

- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: The string matches the criterion of listing fewer options than actually exist, typical of a false dichotomy or false dilemma situation.

### Conclusion:
- The given string \( <s> \) is classified as **<FE>**.

By following these steps, we have applied the methodical process of \( <IDAA> \) and determined that the string represents a False Enumeration (\(<FE>\)).
