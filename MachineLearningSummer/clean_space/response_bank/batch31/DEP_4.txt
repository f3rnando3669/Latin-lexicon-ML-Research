For 
Certainly! Letâ€™s apply the decomposition steps \( <IDAA> \) to the statement "Science shows us that improved quality of life comes through research and invention."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify and Understand the Argument:**
   - **Input:** "Science shows us that improved quality of life comes through research and invention."
   - **Process:** Read and understand that this statement is making an assertion about the role of science in improving quality of life through research and invention.

2. **Extract the Key Components:**
   - **Assertion (Proposition):** Improved quality of life comes through research and invention.
   - **Supporting Statement:** Science shows us this outcome.

3. **Compare with Definitions of Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Check for <G> (Generalization):** This does not appear to be a case of generalizing from a single instance. It makes a broad statement but does not cite a specific example.
   - **Check for <FE> (False Enumeration):** The statement does not list options, so this type does not apply.
   - **Check for <IR> (Inappropriate Reason):** The reasoning ("Science shows us") broadly supports the proposition about the benefits of research and invention. It remains reasonable as it references evidence albeit generally.
   - **Check for <RR> (Redundant Reason):** The reasoning is not simply a restatement of the proposition using different words.
   - **Check for <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis):** Assess if saying "Science shows us" provides a compelling causal basis. This phrase is vague and does not detail specific scientific evidence, making it weak in supporting the claim.
   - **Check for <FU> (False Universals):** Determine if it asserts a universally agreed point without proof. Yes, it presumes unanimous agreement that science conclusively shows this result without providing evidence.
   - **Check for <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases):** Look for dual interpretations. There are no ambiguous phrases open to dual interpretations.

4. **Classify the Argument:**
   - Given the comparison:

   - \( <WCB> \) fits because the assertion that "Science shows us" is vague and does not provide compelling evidence for the claimed causal relationship.
   - \( <FU> \) also fits because it assumes universal agreement that science conclusively supports the argument without offering specific proof.

### Conclusion:
The argument "Science shows us that improved quality of life comes through research and invention." can be classified under both \( <WCB> \) (Weak Causal Basis) and \( <FU> \) (False Universals) defective argument types.

However, if asked to choose the more dominant classification based on the provided statement, the best classification would be \( <WCB> \) given that the statement lacks specific compelling evidence more strongly than it presumes universal agreement.

So, the final classification is **\( <WCB> \)** (Weak Causal Basis).
