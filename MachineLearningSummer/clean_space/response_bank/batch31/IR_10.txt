For 
To classify the given string "If you don't start recycling now, our entire planet will be destroyed in ten years." using the decomposed steps of IDA, we'll proceed systematically:

### Steps for Decomposing IDA (Classification Task):

1. **Initial Identification:**
   - Proposition: "If you don't start recycling now, our entire planet will be destroyed in ten years."

2. **Recognize Patterns or Keywords:**
   - The statement includes a conditional "If you don't start recycling now..." and a catastrophic consequence "...our entire planet will be destroyed in ten years."
   - Look for keywords indicating types: extreme consequences (e.g., "entire planet", "destroyed").

3. **Context Analysis:**
   - The statement presents a direct cause-and-effect relationship: failing to recycle now will lead to planetary destruction within a decade.
   - Assess if the causal link is logically supported and sufficiently strong to warrant the conclusion.

4. **Classify Argument Type:**
   - This statement seems to have a weak cause-and-effect relationship, implying that not recycling will directly lead to an extreme outcome (planetary destruction). Given the complexity of environmental degradation, reducing it to a single behavior (recycling) causing total planetary destruction oversimplifies the issue.

5. **Verification:**
   - Review if the classification fits based on the weak causal link:
     - The argument offers a dramatised cause (not recycling) leading to an extreme and unlikely consequence (destruction of the entire planet).
   - The causal basis provided is overly simplistic and not compelling enough to support such a dramatic conclusion.

Therefore, the classification is:
   - <s> = "If you don't start recycling now, our entire planet will be destroyed in ten years." -> <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)

By applying the decomposed steps, we've classified the given string as demonstrating a Weak Causal Basis.
