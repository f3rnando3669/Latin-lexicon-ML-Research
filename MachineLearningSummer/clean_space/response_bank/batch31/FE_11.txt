For 
Certainly! Let's apply the decomposition process <IDAA> to classify the given string "If we are too scared to open the economy completely, then we'll have to keep it closed forever":

### Step 1: Understand the Task of <IDA>
We need to classify the string into one of the predefined defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step 2: Define the Characteristics of Each Type
We have already defined the characteristics in the previous explanation.

### Step 3: Develop Steps for Classification <D>
1. **Step 1**: Parse the string <s> to identify key terms or phrases.
2. **Step 2**: Match the identified terms or phrases to the characteristics defined in Step 2.
3. **Step 3**: Classify the string <s> based on the identified characteristics.

### Step 4: Implement <IDAA>
Let's break it down and apply our decomposition to the task:

1. **Step 1: Parse the string <s>**
   - Analyze the structure of the string: "If we are too scared to open the economy completely, then we'll have to keep it closed forever."

2. **Step 2: Match to Characteristics**
   - Identify the key components:
     - "If we are too scared to open the economy completely"
     - "we'll have to keep it closed forever"

   - Compare with the characteristics:
     - It seems to be offering only two extreme options: opening the economy completely or keeping it closed forever.
     - This appears to be a misrepresentation of the actual number of options available (there can be partial reopening, phased reopening, etc.).

3. **Step 3: Classify the string <s>**
   - The string fits the definition of False Enumeration, as it lists fewer options than actually exist. Therefore, it is classified as <FE>.

### Conclusion
By following the structured approach provided in steps and implementing the defined decomposition, we can classify the string "If we are too scared to open the economy completely, then we'll have to keep it closed forever" as <FE>.
