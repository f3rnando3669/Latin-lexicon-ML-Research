Sure, let's apply the Step-by-Step decomposition \( <D> \) of \( <IDAA> \) to the statement "You're either for America or against her!!!"

### Decomposition \( <D> \) of \( <IDA> \)

1. **Step 1: Parse the Statement**
   - The statement to classify is: "You're either for America or against her!!!"
   
2. **Step 2: Identify Key Features**
   - The statement presents a binary choice: "either for America or against her."
   - The structure suggests a limited set of options.

3. **Step 3: Match Features to Argument Types**
   - The feature of presenting a binary choice matches the characteristic of \( <FE> \) (False Enumeration) as it lists fewer options than actually exist.

4. **Step 4: Classify the Statement**
   - The statement is classified as \( <FE> \) (False Enumeration).

5. **Step 5: Validate**
   - The classification makes sense because the statement forces a false dilemma by suggesting there are only two extreme options, ignoring any middle ground or other possible stances.

Hence, the classification of the statement "You're either for America or against her!!!" is \( <FE> \).

By following the decomposition approach, we ensure that the classification process is thorough and consistent with the definitions provided.
