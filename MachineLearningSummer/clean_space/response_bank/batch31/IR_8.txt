For 
Sure, let's apply <IDAA> to the given statement:

**Statement (s)**: "Jeannette has an upcoming exam in anatomy and physiology. It will cover the four chapters read and discussed over the last month. Jeannette hasn’t studied. Though there are well over 200 terms she will be expected to remember, Jeannette knows that her memory is great. She will remember the terms just from having heard them mentioned in class. After all, because of her excellent memory, she got through high school without studying. Despite her faith in her memory, her lack of studying results in an F on the exam."

### Step-by-Step Classification of the Statement

**Step 1**: Identify the Statement
- "Jeannette hasn’t studied. Though there are well over 200 terms she will be expected to remember, Jeannette knows that her memory is great. She will remember the terms just from having heard them mentioned in class. After all, because of her excellent memory, she got through high school without studying. Despite her faith in her memory, her lack of studying results in an F on the exam."

**Step 2**: Understand the Argument Type Definitions
- Review definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>.

**Step 3**: Preliminary Classification
- Initially, it seems like it might involve a Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>).

**Step 4**: Detailed Analysis
  - **Generalization Analysis (<G>)**: 
    - Does not make a broad claim based on a specific instance. The assertion about Jeannette's memory is quite specific.

  - **False Enumeration Analysis (<FE>)**:
    - Does not present an incorrect number of options or alternatives.

  - **Inappropriate Reason Analysis (<IR>)**:
    - The reason given (great memory) does not entirely support the final outcome (receiving an F due to lack of studying).

  - **Redundant Reason Analysis (<RR>)**:
    - No redundant reasoning present.

  - **Weak Causal Basis Analysis (<WCB>)**:
    - Yes, it suggests that having an excellent memory from high school would be a sufficient basis for passing the test without studying, which fails to account for the complexity and volume of new material.

  - **False Universals Analysis (<FU>)**:
    - Does not rely on universally agreed points without proper proof.

  - **Double-Edged Phrases Analysis (<DEP>)**:
    - No dual interpretation here.

**Step 5**: Compare and Contrast
- Weak Causal Basis: The argument relies on the assumption that past memory performance in high school is a strong enough basis to expect success without studying for a more complex and extensive anatomy and physiology exam.

**Step 6**: Final Classification
- The most fitting classification for the statement is <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis).

**Step 7**: Verification
- Comparing with other examples of <WCB>, the statement fits well. The causal link between having a great memory from high school and succeeding in this specific test is not compelling enough to justify the conclusion.

Thus, the statement is classified as:

**<WCB>** (Weak Causal Basis).

The reasoning in the statement about Jeannette’s expectation of success without studying does not strongly support the desired outcome, making it a clear <WCB>.
