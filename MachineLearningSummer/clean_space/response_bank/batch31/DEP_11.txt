To classify the argument "I had this book that proved that leprechauns are real and have been empirically verified by scientists, but I lost it. I forgot the name of it as well -- and who the author was." using the <IDAA> framework, let's follow the step-by-step process outlined in the decomposition task:

### Step 1: Understand the Definitions
Review the definitions provided:
- **Generalization (<G>)**
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
- **False Universals (<FU>)**
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**

### Step 2: Analyze the Argument in <s>
Carefully read and understand the argument:
- **Proposition**: Leprechauns are real and have been empirically verified by scientists.
- **Reason**: There was a book that proved it, but it's now lost. The author and title are forgotten.

### Step 3: Identify Key Indicators
Examine the argument for signs of each defective argument type:
- The book is claimed to have proven the point, but this proof cannot be verified (the book is lost, and essential details like the title and author are forgotten).

### Step 4: Compare with Definitions
Match the identified indicators against the definitions:
- The claim "I had this book that proved that leprechauns are real and have been empirically verified by scientists" relies on evidence that cannot be presented or verified. This uses an unverifiable source to support the proposition.

This can be identified as a type of **False Universals (<FU>)** because it asserts a point without providing actual proof. It suggests that the empirical verification is universally accepted by mentioning scientists, but fails to produce verifiable evidence or proof, leaning on an unverifiable source (the lost book).

Hence, the argument "I had this book that proved that leprechauns are real and have been empirically verified by scientists, but I lost it. I forgot the name of it as well -- and who the author was." is classified as **<FU>**.
