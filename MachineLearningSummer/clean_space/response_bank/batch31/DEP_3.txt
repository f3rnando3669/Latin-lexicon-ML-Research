Sure! Let's apply IDAA step by step to classify the string (s):

### String: "The police said they suspect several people of setting the fire. Therefore, I can't be under suspicion because I was alone all night."

### Step-by-Step Application of IDAA:

1. **Understanding the Definitions:**
   - Review and understand the definitions of each defective argument type: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>.

2. **Extracting Key Features from the String (s):**
   - Step 2: Main claim: "I can't be under suspicion."
   - Step 3: Supporting statement: "The police said they suspect several people of setting the fire."

3. **Comparing Features to Definitions:**
   - Step 4: Compare with <G>: The statement is not generalizing based on a specific instance; it's a specific situation.
   - Step 5: Compare with <FE>: The statement doesn't list fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - Step 6: Compare with <IR>: The supporting reason provided doesn't logically support the main proposition. The fact that the police suspect multiple people does not exclude the possibility that an individual could also be under suspicion.
   - Step 7: Compare with <RR>: The supporting statement is not a rewording of the main claim.
   - Step 8: Compare with <WCB>: The statement is not about a weak causal basis.
   - Step 9: Compare with <FU>: The statement doesn't assert universally agreed points without proof.
   - Step 10: Compare with <DEP>: The statement isn't open to dual interpretations.

4. **Classifying the String:**
   - Step 11: The string best matches the characteristics of <IR> (Inappropriate Reason), as the supporting statement does not logically support the proposition. The fact they suspect several people does not exonerate the speaker.
   - Step 12: Assign the string to <IR>.

Therefore, the string "The police said they suspect several people of setting the fire. Therefore, I can't be under suspicion because I was alone all night." is classified as <IR> (Inappropriate Reason).
