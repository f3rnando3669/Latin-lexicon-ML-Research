To apply the IDAA process to the statement "I met a tall man who loved to eat cheese. Now I believe that all tall people like cheese," we will go through each specified step:

### Step-by-Step IDAA:

1. **Understand Definitions and Categories**:
   - Reiterate the definitions of each defective argument type to have clear criteria for classification:
     - **Generalization (G)**: Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
     - **False Enumeration (FE)**: Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
     - **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**: Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
     - **Redundant Reason (RR)**: A new reason that says the same thing as the proposition using different words.
     - **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**: Offers a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
     - **False Universals (FU)**: Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
     - **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**: Uses statements open to dual interpretations.

2. **Parse the Statement**:
   - The statement reads: "I met a tall man who loved to eat cheese. Now I believe that all tall people like cheese."

3. **Identify Key Characteristics**:
   - "I met a tall man who loved to eat cheese": A specific instance or anecdote.
   - "Now I believe that all tall people like cheese": A broad, sweeping claim about all tall people.

4. **Match Patterns**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: This pattern matches the statement. The statement starts with a specific instance (meeting a tall man who loves cheese) and extends this observation to all members of the group (all tall people).
     - There is no listing of options (False Enumeration),
     - No irrelevant reason (Inappropriate Reason), 
     - No redundant reason (Redundant Reason),
     - No weak causal link (Weak Causal Basis),
     - No universally agreed points (False Universals),
     - No dual interpretation (Double-Edged Phrases).

5. **Classify the Statement**:
   - The statement "I met a tall man who loved to eat cheese. Now I believe that all tall people like cheese." is classified as **Generalization (G)**.

6. **Verify and Justify**:
   - Verification: The statement fits the pattern of Generalization because it extends a specific observation (one tall man who likes cheese) to a broad claim about all members of that group (all tall people).
   - Justification: This matches the definition of Generalization as it claims a general truth based on a single, specific instance.

By following these steps, we have decomposed the task and classified the statement accordingly as type **\<G\>** (Generalization).
