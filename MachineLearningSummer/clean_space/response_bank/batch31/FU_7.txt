Sure, let's apply the IDAA process to classify the given string:

"When evidence boils down to 'everybody's doing it, so it must be a good thing to do'
'cuando la evidencia se reduce a "todo el mundo lo está haciendo, por lo que debe ser algo bueno'"

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for IDAA

1. **Understanding the Definitions**:
   - Review the definitions of defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>.

2. **Initial Parsing**:
   - The string states that the evidence is based on the fact that "everybody's doing it, so it must be a good thing to do."

3. **Identify Key Components**:
   - Key component here: "everybody's doing it, so it must be a good thing to do."

4. **Match Against Definitions**:
   - Compare this component with the definitions:
     - <G>: It's not about generalizing from a specific instance to a general truth.
     - <FE>: It's not listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
     - <IR>: The reason given is not entirely irrelevant to the proposition.
     - <RR>: It's not presenting a redundant reason that restates the proposition differently.
     - <WCB>: Not offering a causal basis.
     - <FU>: This argument suggests that "everybody's doing it" is enough evidence to conclude that "it must be a good thing to do," relying on universally agreed points without proof.
     - <DEP>: No double-edged phrases in a dual interpretation context.

5. **Eliminate Non-Matching Types**:
   - Based on the content, eliminate <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <DEP>.

6. **Final Classification**:
   - What remains is <FU> (False Universals). The phrase relies on the idea that because everyone is doing it, it must inherently be beneficial, without substantial evidence.

7. **Validation**:
   - Similar examples of <FU> include: "Everybody knows that staying out in the rain can make you sick," and the classic appeal to popularity.

Thus, the string "when evidence boils down to 'everybody's doing it, so it must be a good thing to do' 'cuando la evidencia se reduce a "todo el mundo lo está haciendo, por lo que debe ser algo bueno'" is classified as <FU> using the IDAA process.
