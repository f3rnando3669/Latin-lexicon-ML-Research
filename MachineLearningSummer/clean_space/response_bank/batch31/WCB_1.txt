For 
To apply the task \( <IDAA> \) to the string \( <s> = "Every girl I've dated has been a nurse. I must only be compatible with nurses!" \), we will follow the step-by-step decomposition to classify the argument type.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of \( <IDAA> \) for the Given String:

**Step 1: Understand the Definition of Each Defective Argument Type**
- **<G> (Generalization):** Making a general truth claim based on a specific instance.
- **<FE> (False Enumeration):** Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason):** Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- **<RR> (Redundant Reason):** Re-stating the proposition using different words as if it were a new reason.
- **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis):** Offering a weak causal relationship to support the proposition.
- **<FU> (False Universals):** Asserting universal points without proof.
- **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases):** Using statements open to dual interpretations.

**Step 2: Identify the Key Elements of the Argument in \( <s> \)**
- Main argument: "I must only be compatible with nurses."
- Reasoning: "Every girl I've dated has been a nurse."

**Step 3: Check for Generalization (<G>)**
- **Check: Does \( <s> \) make a general claim based on a specific instance?**
  - Yes, it makes a general claim ("I must only be compatible with nurses") based on specific instances (the girls the person has dated being nurses).
  - This fits the definition of \( <G> \) (Generalization).

**Step 4: Check for False Enumeration (<FE>)**
- **Check: Does \( <s> \) restrict options in a misleadingly limited way or provide excessive options?**
  - No, this statement does not restrict or enumerate options misleadingly.

**Step 5: Check for Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**
- **Check: Does \( <s> \) provide a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition?**
  - No, this isn't about providing an illogical reason for support; it's about making a broad generalization.

**Step 6: Check for Redundant Reason (<RR>)**
- **Check: Does \( <s> \) present a reason that’s essentially a repetition of the proposition using different wording?**
  - No, the proposition and the reasoning are distinct (though logically flawed).

**Step 7: Check for Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
- **Check: Does \( <s> \) offer a causal relationship that is not compelling enough?**
  - No causal relationship is explicitly presented here.

**Step 8: Check for False Universals (<FU>)**
- **Check: Does \( <s> \) assert universally agreed points without proof?**
  - No, this is not about universally agreed points without proof; it is more about extrapolating a general rule from personal experience.

**Step 9: Check for Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**
- **Check: Does \( <s> \) contain statements open to dual interpretations?**
  - No dual interpretations seem relevant here.

**Step 10: Synthesize Findings**

Based on the analysis:
- The string \( <s> \) makes a general claim based on specific instances.
- Therefore, the most fitting classification for this string is \( <G> \) (Generalization).

**Conclusion:**
- \( <s> \) is classified as \( <G> \) (Generalization).

Thus, the string "Every girl I've dated has been a nurse. I must only be compatible with nurses!" fits the definition of a Generalization ( \( <G> \)).
