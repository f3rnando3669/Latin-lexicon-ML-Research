For 
Sure, let's apply the <IDAA> methodology to the given string:

String <s>: "There must be objective rights and wrongs in the universe. If not, how can you possibly say that torturing babies for fun could ever be right?"

1. **Step 1: Understand the Context of the String <s>**
   - The statement is arguing for the existence of objective moral truths by presenting an extreme example (torturing babies for fun) and questioning how it could ever be considered right without objective morals.

2. **Step 2: Identify the Type of Defective Argument**
   - We need to compare the statement with the definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP> to see which logical flaw it might fit.

3. **Step 3: Apply the Specific Characteristics**
   - **<G> Generalization:** Is this making a sweeping generalization based on a specific instance? Not quite, as it's more about establishing a broader principle (objective morality).
   - **<FE> False Enumeration:** Is this listing fewer or more options than actually exist? It isn't presenting options per se.
   - **<IR> Inappropriate Reason:** Is the reason provided not logically supporting the proposition? We'll need to look closer at the reasoning.
   - **<RR> Redundant Reason:** Is the reason merely restating the proposition in different words? Not applicable here.
   - **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis:** Is the causal link weak or not compelling? Not really applicable.
   - **<FU> False Universals:** Is this asserting a universally agreed point without proof? Potentially relevant to the insistence on "objective rights and wrongs."
   - **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases:** Is this open to dual interpretations? Not particularly relevant here.

4. **Step 4: Eliminate Unlikely Candidates**
   - <G>, <FE>, <RR>, <WCB>, and <DEP> are unlikely matches as they do not fit the argument structure of the statement.

5. **Step 5: Confirm the Best Match**
   - The argument states a universally agreed upon point ("torturing babies for fun could ever be right") to support the necessity of objective moral rights and wrongs. It does so without providing adequate proof, suggesting a reliance on shared moral intuitions, thus fitting <FU> False Universals.
   - Alternatively, one might argue it is an inappropriate reason since the extreme example might not logically establish objective morality, aligning it with <IR> Inappropriate Reason.

6. **Step 6: Document the Classification**
   - **Classification: <IR> and potentially <FU>**
   - **Reasoning:**
     - **<IR> Inappropriate Reason:** The argument uses an emotional and extreme example (torturing babies for fun) which may not logically establish the necessity of objective moral truths.
     - **<FU> False Universals:** The argument relies on the strong emotional reaction to the mentioned act to assert a general truth, without providing proof of the broader principle of objective morality.

Given these considerations, the classification leans slightly more towards <IR> for using an inappropriate reason but also has elements of <FU>.
