For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "It is warmer this year in Las Vegas as compared to last year; therefore, global warming is rapidly accelerating," follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understanding the Classification Types
- <G>: Generalization - claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
- <FE>: False Enumeration - listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
- <IR>: Inappropriate Reason - providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- <RR>: Redundant Reason - a new reason that says the same thing as the proposition using different words.
- <WCB>: Weak Causal Basis - offering a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
- <FU>: False Universals - asserting universally agreed points without proof.
- <DEP>: Double-Edged Phrases - using statements open to dual interpretations.

### Step 2: Parsing the Argument
- The argument is: "It is warmer this year in Las Vegas as compared to last year; therefore, global warming is rapidly accelerating."
- Break it down: 
  - Specific observation: "It is warmer this year in Las Vegas as compared to last year."
  - Conclusion: "Therefore, global warming is rapidly accelerating."

### Step 3: Identifying Key Features
- Observation based on a specific instance (temperature in Las Vegas this year compared to last year).
- Broad conclusion drawn (global warming is rapidly accelerating).

### Step 4: Matching Features to Argument Types
- The argument draws a broad conclusion (global warming is rapidly accelerating) based on a specific instance of weather data (warmer this year in Las Vegas).
- This fits closely with the definition of <G> (Generalization), which claims a general truth based on a specific instance.

### Step 5: Classification
- Classify the argument as <G>.

### Step 6: Verification
- Re-examine the argument and the classification to ensure accuracy.
- The classification as <G> logically follows from the identification of the argument as making a generalization based on specific localized weather data.

Therefore, upon completing these steps, we classify the string "It is warmer this year in Las Vegas as compared to last year; therefore, global warming is rapidly accelerating." as <G> (Generalization).
