### Decomposition of <t> (in this case, <IDA>) into specific steps (i.e., <D>):

1. **Identify Keywords and Context**: Determine the central topic and key phrases in the argument.
2. **Analyze Argument Structure**: Break down the components of the argument to understand its framework.
3. **Match Argument to Definitions**: Compare the argument's structure against the definitions of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.
4. **Check for Clear Indicators**: Look for specific indicators or phrases already provided in the definitions.
5. **Classify Argument Type**: Assign the appropriate defective argument type based on the analysis.
6. **Verify Classification**: Ensure that the classification aligns with the initial definitions and examples.

### Application of Decomposition to <IDA> (i.e., <IDAA>):

#### Step-by-Step Example:

**Given String <s>:** “iPhones are the best smartphones on the market because Apple makes the best smartphones.”

1. **Identify Keywords and Context**:
   - Keywords: “iPhones”, “best smartphones”, “Apple”, “makes the best smartphones”.
   - Context: The argument aims to establish that iPhones are the best smartphones by stating that Apple produces the best smartphones.

2. **Analyze Argument Structure**:
   - The argument is structured as follows: 
     - Claim: "iPhones are the best smartphones on the market."
     - Reason: "Because Apple makes the best smartphones."
   - The reason provided is a restatement of the claim without adding any additional evidence or rational support.

3. **Match Argument to Definitions**:
   - <G> (Generalization): This doesn't involve a claim based on a specific instance.
   - <FE> (False Enumeration): This does not involve listing limited or false choices.
   - <IR> (Inappropriate Reason): Although it provides a reason, it isn't necessarily unrelated but rather repetitive.
   - <RR> (Redundant Reason): Fits, as it presents a reason that merely restates the proposition in different words.
   - <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis): It’s more about redundancy than weak causality.
   - <FU> (False Universals): This isn't based on supposedly universally agreed points without proof.
   - <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases): This isn't open to dual interpretations.

4. **Check for Clear Indicators**:
   - The reason provided in the statement essentially repeats the proposition without providing new support, which is characteristic of <RR> (Redundant Reason).

5. **Classify Argument Type**:
   - Based on the analysis, the argument fits the <RR> (Redundant Reason) classification.

6. **Verify Classification**:
   - The classification of <RR> is consistent with the definition, as the reason given merely restates the proposition using different words.

**Conclusion**:
The given string “iPhones are the best smartphones on the market because Apple makes the best smartphones.” is classified as <RR> (Redundant Reason).

By following these steps, we can systematically classify any given argument type, ensuring thorough and logical analysis.
