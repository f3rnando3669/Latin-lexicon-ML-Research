### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA> (Classification Task):

1. **Read and Understanding the Argument:**
   - Argument: "The newest brand jeans that everyone is wearing are called Blue Dogs. Blue Dogs are being worn by all young teens. Be sure to go out and buy your new jeans at your local mall."

2. **Identify General Claim and Supporting Logic:**
   - General Claim: You should buy Blue Dogs jeans.
   - Supporting Logic: Everyone, particularly young teens, are wearing Blue Dogs jeans.

3. **Match with Argument Definitions:**
   - Compare the argument with each defective argument type to identify potential matches.
     - <G> Generalization: Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
     - <FE> False Enumeration: Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
     - <IR> Inappropriate Reason: Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
     - <RR> Redundant Reason: Presents a repetitive reason as if it were a new one.
     - <WCB> Weak Causal Basis: Offers a causal link that's not compelling enough.
     - <FU> False Universals: Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
     - <DEP> Double-Edged Phrases: Uses statements open to dual interpretations.

4. **Classify Based on Characteristics:**
   - The statement asserts that everyone is wearing Blue Dogs jeans and that you should therefore buy them.
   - This statement is appealing to popularity or the fact that many people (particularly young teens) are doing this as an attempted form of validation for purchasing the jeans.

5. **Assign the Correct Defective Argument Type:**
   - The argument falls under <FU> (False Universals). 

6. **Justification:**
   - The string "The newest brand jeans that everyone is wearing are called Blue Dogs. Blue Dogs are being worn by all young teens. Be sure to go out and buy your new jeans at your local mall." is classified as type <FU>. The reasoning that "everyone is wearing them" is used as validation for why you should buy them without providing proof that everyone indeed does so or that popularity is a valid reason for the purchase.

### Application of <D> to <IDA> (IDAA):

1. **Step 1:** Read and understand the argument:
   - "The newest brand jeans that everyone is wearing are called Blue Dogs. Blue Dogs are being worn by all young teens. Be sure to go out and buy your new jeans at your local mall."

2. **Step 2:** Identify the claim and supporting reasoning:
   - Claim: You should buy Blue Dogs jeans.
   - Reasoning: Because everyone, especially young teens, are wearing them.

3. **Step 3:** Compare with definitions of defective argument types:
   - <G>: Does not fit because there's no specific instance leading to a general truth.
   - <FE>: Not applicable since it doesnâ€™t list fewer or more options.
   - <IR>: The reason does support the proposition logically, but the proposition itself may be flawed.
   - <RR>: Not applicable, no redundancy noted.
   - <WCB>: The causal link is fairly straightforward.
   - <FU>: Fits because it claims universal agreement or behavior without proof.
   - <DEP>: Not applicable, no dual interpretations.

4. **Step 4:** Classify based on characteristics found:
   - The argument uses the popularity of the product as the sole reason for buying it, which makes it a False Universal.

5. **Step 5:** Assign the classification and provide justification:
   - The string <s> is classified as type <FU>.
   - Justification: The argument suggests purchasing Blue Dogs jeans simply because they are popular among young teens, which fits the criteria of <FU> by asserting a universally accepted point without proof.

By following these steps, the given argument is classified under the defective argument type <FU>.
