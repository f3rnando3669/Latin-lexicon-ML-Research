For 
Let's apply the step-by-step breakdown of <IDAA> to the given argument:

### Argument String

"Matthew: Everyone believes that teachers get paid enough for the job they do. Therefore, it must be true."

### Step-by-Step Breakdown of <IDAA>

1. **Step 1: Read the Argument (Initialization)**
   - **Input:** "Matthew: Everyone believes that teachers get paid enough for the job they do. Therefore, it must be true."
   - **Action:** Carefully read and understand the argument presented.

2. **Step 2: Identify the Core Proposition**
   - **Input:** "Matthew: Everyone believes that teachers get paid enough for the job they do. Therefore, it must be true."
   - **Action:** The core proposition is that teachers get paid enough for the job they do.

3. **Step 3: Analyze the Supporting Reason(s)**
   - **Input:** "Matthew: Everyone believes that teachers get paid enough for the job they do. Therefore, it must be true."
   - **Action:** The supporting reason provided here is that everyone believes this to be the case.

4. **Step 4: Match Characteristics with Defective Argument Types**
   - **Input:** Core proposition: Teachers get paid enough.
              Supporting reason: Everyone believes it.
   - **Comparison with defect types:**
     - Generalization (<G>): Not relevant here, as it doesnâ€™t claim a general truth based on one instance.
     - False Enumeration (<FE>): No listing of options here.
     - Inappropriate Reason (<IR>): The reason given is not necessarily inappropriate but rather relies on belief.
     - Redundant Reason (<RR>): No redundant logic present.
     - Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>): Doesn't provide a causal basis.
     - False Universals (<FU>): This argument asserts that because everyone believes it, it must be true, which aligns with the definition of False Universals.
     - Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>): No dual interpretation present.

5. **Step 5: Evaluate Potential Matches**
   - **Input:** Characteristics align with False Universals.
   - **Action:** Determine that the argument fits best with the False Universals type.

6. **Step 6: Classify the Argument**
   - **Input:** Classification - False Universals.
   - **Action:** Classify the argument as <FU>.

### Conclusion

By following the above steps for <IDAA>, the argument string "Matthew: Everyone believes that teachers get paid enough for the job they do. Therefore, it must be true." is classified as <FU> (False Universals).
