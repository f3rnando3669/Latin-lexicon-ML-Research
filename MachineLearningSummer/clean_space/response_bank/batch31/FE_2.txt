Let's apply the IDAA (Decomposition of Classified Argument Types) approach step-by-step to the string "You are either with God or against him."

### Step 1: Understand Defective Argument Types

First, we need to ensure we have a clear understanding of each defective argument type:
- **<G>**: Generalization.
- **<FE>**: False Enumeration.
- **<IR>**: Inappropriate Reason.
- **<RR>**: Redundant Reason.
- **<WCB>**: Weak Causal Basis.
- **<FU>**: False Universals.
- **<DEP>**: Double-Edged Phrases.

### Step 2: Identify Key Indicators in the Given String

Examine the string "You are either with God or against him." for keywords or phrases that may indicate a particular defective argument type:
- The phrase "either with God or against him" suggests a binary decision between two extreme options.

### Step 3: Analyze the Logical Structure of the Argument

Determine the logical flow:
- Proposition: The listener must choose a stance concerning God.
- Supporting Reason: The string implies only two possible stances (with God or against Him), excluding any intermediate or neutral positions.

### Step 4: Match Identified Indicators with Definitions

Based on the identified indicators and analysis, match the string to the closest defective argument type:
- The presence of only two extreme options ("with God" or "against Him") points toward a **False Enumeration** because it limits the choice to fewer options than might actually exist.

### Step 5: Make the Classification

- Given the indicators and analysis, the string should be classified as:
  **<FE>: False Enumeration.**

### Summary of IDAA Applied to the Given String

**String:** "You are either with God or against him."

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**
1. **Understand Defective Argument Types**: Knowledge of **False Enumeration**.
2. **Identify Key Indicators**: Binary choice, extreme options.
3. **Analyze the Logical Structure**:
   - Proposition: You must take a stance.
   - Reason: Only binary stances provided.
4. **Match Indicators with Definitions**: **False Enumeration** due to limited extreme choices.
5. **Classification**: **<FE>: False Enumeration.**

By following these steps, we accurately classify the string as **<FE>: False Enumeration.**
