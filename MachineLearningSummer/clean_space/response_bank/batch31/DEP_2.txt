For 
Let's apply the advanced task decomposition (<D>) to classify the given string as one of the defective argument types described:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA> into <IDAA>

#### Given String:
"Why does the law state that you have to be 21 years old to drink?  Does it really make any difference if you are 20 years and 364 days old?  That is absurd.  Therefore, if a single day makes no difference, then a collection of 1095 single days won’t make any difference. Therefore, changing the drinking age to 18 will not make any difference."

#### Step 1: Identify the Claim
- The claim is that changing the drinking age to 18 will not make any difference.

#### Step 2: Understand the Reasoning
- Reasoning: The argument questions the significance of the legal drinking age difference of just one day (i.e., between being 20 years and 364 days old and being 21 years old). It then generalizes this difference over a period (3 years = 1095 days), concluding that this cumulative difference is also insignificant.

#### Step 3: Evaluate the Claim-Reasons Relationship
- The reasoning begins with questioning the rationale behind a one-day difference in the legal drinking age and then generalizes this to argue that an additional 1095 days equally doesn't matter.

#### Step 4: Compare with Fallacy Definitions
- **<G> Generalization**: The argument generalizes the insignificance of a one-day difference to render a three-year period equally insignificant.
- **<FE> False Enumeration**: Not relevant here, as no enumeration of options is presented.
- **<IR> Inappropriate Reason**: The reasoning focuses on the one-day difference which may not logically extend to a three-year period.
- **<RR> Redundant Reason**: The argument starts reasonable but doesn’t restate the claim in a different way.
- **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis**: There’s no strong causal link explaining why those 1095 days don't make a difference legally, only an assumption based on a one-day analogy.
- **<FU> False Universals**: Not relevant, as no universal claim exists without proof.
- **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases**: No ambiguous language is used.

#### Step 5: Select the Best Match
- Best match: **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis**, as the argument relies on an assumed causal link between the significance of a one-day difference in age and the overall three-year period without providing compelling evidence or reasoning for the broadened conclusion.

#### Step 6: Justify the Classification
- The argument "Why does the law state that you have to be 21 years old to drink? Does it really make any difference if you are 20 years and 364 days old? That is absurd. Therefore, if a single day makes no difference, then a collection of 1095 single days won’t make any difference. Therefore, changing the drinking age to 18 will not make any difference." fits into the **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis** category. This is because it weakly infers that a single day’s insignificance extends logically to 1095 days without credible reasoning or supporting evidence that the comparison is valid over such a significantly larger timeframe in terms of legal, social, or developmental impact.
