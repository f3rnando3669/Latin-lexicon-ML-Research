For 
To classify the string "Executions are moral because we must have a death penalty to discourage violent crime." as one of the defective argument types \( <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU> \), or \( <DEP> \), we will follow the decomposition (\( <D> \)) approach:

### Step-by-Step Application:

#### Step 1: Identify and Understand the Proposition
- **Proposition in \( <s> \)**: "Executions are moral because we must have a death penalty to discourage violent crime."
- **Understanding**: The statement argues that executions are morally justified by the necessity of a death penalty as a deterrent to violent crime.

#### Step 2: Identify Keywords and Phrases
- **Keywords/phrases**:
  - **Main Proposition**: "Executions are moral."
  - **Reason**: "we must have a death penalty to discourage violent crime."

#### Step 3: Match Against Definitions
- **<G>**: This is not a generalization based on a specific instance.
- **<FE>**: Does not list limited or false options.
- **<IR>**: The reason provided is related to the main proposition.
- **<RR>**: Possible redundancy here, let's delve deeper. The statement claims morality based on a need which is essentially the claim itself in different terms.
- **<WCB>**: The causal relationship might be weak, but the primary structure hint might tilt towards redundancy rather than pure weakness.
- **<FU>**: Does not rely on universally agreed points without proof.
- **<DEP>**: Does not contain dual interpretations.

#### Step 4: Eliminate Non-matching Types
- **Eliminate**: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>

#### Step 5: Verify with Examples
- Example of **<RR>**: "This legislation is sinful because it is the wrong thing to do." — Here, ‘sinful’ and ‘wrong’ are restating the same idea.
- **Match**: The statement "Executions are moral because we must have a death penalty to discourage violent crime" suggests morality based on a necessity (which loops back to claim), demonstrating repeated reasoning.

#### Step 6: Final Classification
- **Classify the argument**: The classified argument type for \( <s> \) is **<RR>** (Redundant Reason).

Therefore, the string \(<s>\) "Executions are moral because we must have a death penalty to discourage violent crime." is classified as \(<RR>\).
