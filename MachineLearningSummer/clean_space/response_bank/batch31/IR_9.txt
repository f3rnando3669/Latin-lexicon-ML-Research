Sure, let’s apply the decomposition process to classify the argument in the given dialogue:

### Argument: 
Jon: "Go easy on the scotch; you've had three shots already now."
Jeff: "Oh sure, I'll put down my scotch when you put down that tequila. Lay off, man."

### Decomposition of Task (<D>):

1. **Understand the Argument**: Carefully read and comprehend the argument being presented.
2. **Identify Key Elements**: Identify the main proposition and any supporting reasons or premises.
3. **Match Argument Features**: Compare the features of the argument with known characteristics of defective argument types.
4. **Determine the Argument Type**: Decide the defective argument type based on the comparison.
5. **Cross-check for Accuracy**: Ensure that the identified argument type correctly and fully fits the definition provided.

### Application of <D> to <IDA> (<IDAA>):

#### Step-by-step process:

1. **Understand the Argument**:
   - **Jon’s argument:** Jon tells Jeff to go easy on the scotch because Jeff has already had three shots.
   - **Jeff’s response:** Jeff dismisses Jon’s argument by suggesting Jon should put down his tequila first, which implies a counter-response rather than addressing Jon’s concern directly.

2. **Identify Key Elements**:
   - **Main claim by Jon:** "Go easy on the scotch; you've had three shots already now."
   - **Response/Premise by Jeff:** "Oh sure, I'll put down my scotch when you put down that tequila. Lay off, man."

3. **Match Argument Features**:
   - **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**: Jeff is not addressing the concern about his own drinking but rather shifting the focus to Jon’s drinking. This does not logically support why he should or should not put down his scotch.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**: Jeff’s response is open to dual interpretations: it could be seen as a tit-for-tat argument or a dismissal based on Jon’s own actions.

4. **Determine the Argument Type**:
   - The argument type that most closely matches Jeff's response is **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**, since Jeff's reason doesn’t logically support why he should not go easy on the scotch but rather introduces a new element (Jon’s drinking habits) that distracts from the original claim.

5. **Cross-check for Accuracy**:
   - Double-checking the classification reveals that **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)** fits well. Jeff's response is deflective and does not logically address Jon’s concern about his (Jeff's) consumption of scotch.

#### Final Classification:
The given argument by Jeff in response to Jon’s concern is an example of **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**.
