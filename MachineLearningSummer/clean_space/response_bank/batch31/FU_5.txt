For 
To classify the string "Why should you feel guilty for seeking your own happiness when that's what everyone else is doing, too?" as one of the defective argument types, we will follow the step-by-step decomposition for <IDAA>:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for <IDAA>

**Step 1: Understand the Argument Types**
- **Generalization <G>:** Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration <FE>:** Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **Inappropriate Reason <IR>:** Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- **Redundant Reason <RR>:** Presenting a reason that essentially restates the proposition in different words.
- **Weak Causal Basis <WCB>:** Offering a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
- **False Universals <FU>:** Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases <DEP>:** Using statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.

**Step 2: Analyze the String <s>**
- Proposition: "You should not feel guilty for seeking your own happiness."
- Supporting Statement: "That's what everyone else is doing, too."

**Step 3: Compare Argument to Definitions**
- **Does the statement in <s> make a broad generalization?**
  - No, the argument doesn’t claim a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **Does the statement offer limited or exaggerated choices?**
  - No, it doesn’t list fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **Does the supporting reason not logically support the proposition?**
  - No, the supporting reason at least attempts to justify the proposition.
- **Is the same point repeated in different words as if it's new reasoning?**
  - No, the supporting statement is not just repeating the proposition.
- **Is there a weak or non-compelling causal link in the argument?**
  - No, it doesn’t make a weak causal argument.
- **Does the statement assert a universal truth without proof?**
  - Yes, it asserts a universal behavior ("everyone else is doing, too") without providing proof.
- **Can the statement be interpreted in two different and potentially conflicting ways?**
  - No, it is not open to dual interpretations potentially against the speaker.

**Step 4: Match with the Appropriate Type**
- **The assertion "that's what everyone else is doing" fits the definition of False Universals <FU>.**

Final classification for the string <s>: **<FU>**

By following these steps, we accurately classified the string "Why should you feel guilty for seeking your own happiness when that's what everyone else is doing, too?" as **False Universals <FU>**.
