For 
Sure, let's apply the step-by-step decomposition of \( IDA \) (™ the task of classifying a string) to the specified string:

### Example String (\( s \)):
"A 2005 Gallup Poll found that an estimated 25% of Americans over the age of 18 believe in astrology - or that the position of the stars and planets can affect people’s lives. This is roughly 75,000,000 people. Therefore, there must be some truth to astrology!"

#### Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Preliminary Analysis**:
   - The statement is: "A 2005 Gallup Poll found that an estimated 25% of Americans over the age of 18 believe in astrology - or that the position of the stars and planets can affect people’s lives. This is roughly 75,000,000 people. Therefore, there must be some truth to astrology!"

2. **Identify the Argument Type**:
   - The statement provides data from a Gallup Poll and then concludes that because a large number of people believe in astrology, it must contain some truth.

3. **Match with Each Defective Argument Type**:
   
   - **<G> (Generalization)**: The argument does not make a general claim based on a single instance but rather uses a statistical survey.
   
   - **<FE> (False Enumeration)**: The argument does not list options, so this type is not applicable.
   
   - **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**: The reason (belief by a large number of people) does not logically support the proposition that astrology has truth. Thus, it might be seen as an inappropriate reason, but this category better fits under the appeal to popularity.
   
   - **<RR> (Redundant Reason)**: The argument does not restate the proposition in different terms. The conclusion provides new information—that large scale belief implies truth.
   
   - **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**: The basis here is not weak causality; it's more about the assertion of truth based on popularity.
   
   - **<FU> (False Universals)**: The statement asserts that because a large number of people believe in astrology, it must be true. This fits the definition of **False Universals** because it appeals to the fact that many people believe in astrology as a form of validation without proof.

   - **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)**: There are no dual interpretations here.

4. **Provide Justification**:
   - The string "A 2005 Gallup Poll found that an estimated 25% of Americans over the age of 18 believe in astrology - or that the position of the stars and planets can affect people’s lives. This is roughly 75,000,000 people. Therefore, there must be some truth to astrology!" fits the definition of **False Universals (FU)**, as it asserts the truth of astrology based on the popularity of belief without presenting concrete evidence.

Therefore, \( IDAA(s) \) for the given string is identified as:
- **Type**: False Universals (<FU>)
- **Justification**: The argument appeals to the popularity of a belief (many people believe in astrology) as evidence for its truth, which fits under False Universals.
