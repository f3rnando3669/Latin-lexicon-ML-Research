Sure, let's apply the step-by-step decomposition of the task <IDAA> to the string <s>: "If everyone believes it, you should too!"

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for IDAA

1. **Parse and Understand the String (<s>):**
    - Read the string: "If everyone believes it, you should too!"
    - Extract key phrases: "everyone believes it," "you should too."

2. **Identify the Argument Structure:**
    - Proposition: "You should believe it."
    - Supporting premise: "Everyone believes it."

3. **Match with Definite Argument Types:**
    - **Generalization (<G>):** 
        - Does it claim a general truth based on a specific instance? No, this doesn't match <G>.
    - **False Enumeration (<FE>):**
        - Does it list fewer or more options than actually exist? No, this doesn't match <FE>.
    - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):**
        - Does it provide a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition? Potential match, but let's check other types.
    - **Redundant Reason (<RR>):**
        - Does it restate the proposition in different words? No, this doesn't match <RR>.
    - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
        - Does it offer a causal basis that is not compelling? No, this doesn't match <WCB>.
    - **False Universals (<FU>):**
        - Does it assert something as universally agreed upon without proof? Yes, it appeals to popularity by suggesting that because everyone believes it, you should too.
    - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):**
        - Is it open to dual interpretations potentially against the speaker? No, this doesn't match <DEP>.

    Based on the matching criteria, the argument in <s> fits <FU> (False Universals) as it appeals to popularity without providing proof.

4. **Classify <s>:**
    - Classified as <FU> (False Universals).

5. **Validation:**
    - The argument claims that "everyone believes it" as a reason for "you should believe it," which fits the characteristics of <FU> as it relies on an assumed universal agreement or popularity to validate the proposition.

### Classification Result
The string "If everyone believes it, you should too!" is classified as <FU> (False Universals).
