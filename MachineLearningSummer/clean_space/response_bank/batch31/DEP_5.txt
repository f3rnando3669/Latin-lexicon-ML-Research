### Applying Decomposition ( \( <IDAA> \) ) to the Given String

To address the task of classifying the given string \( <s> \) "The fallacy of equivocation occurs when a key term or phrase in an argument is used in an ambiguous way, with one meaning in one portion of the argument and then another meaning in another portion of the argument." as one of the specified defective argument types (\<G>, \<FE>, \<IR>, \<RR>, \<WCB>, \<FU>, or \<DEP>), we'll follow the step-by-step breakdown outlined previously.

**Step 1: Extract Key Elements of the Argument**

- **Main Proposition/Claim:** The fallacy of equivocation occurs when a key term or phrase in an argument is used in an ambiguous way.
- **Supporting Statement/Evidence:** A key term or phrase is used with one meaning in one portion of the argument and then another meaning in another portion of the argument.

**Step 2: Compare Against Definitions**

- **Generalization (\<G\>):** The statement is not making a sweeping generalization based on a specific instance.
  - No. This does not apply here.
- **False Enumeration (\<FE>\):** The argument does not list fewer or more options than exist.
  - No. This does not apply here.
- **Inappropriate Reason (\<IR>\):** The reason provided is logical and supports the claim directly.
  - No. This does not apply here.
- **Redundant Reason (\<RR>\):** The reason presented does not simply restate the proposition in different words.
  - No. This does not apply here.
- **Weak Causal Basis (\<WCB>\):** The argument does not provide a weak causal basis; it defines a concept.
  - No. This does not apply here.
- **False Universals (\<FU>\):** The statement does not make a universal assertion without proof or rely on popularity or widespread belief.
  - No. This does not apply here.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (\<DEP>\):** The statement does not have a dual interpretation that can backfire.
  - No. This does not apply here.

**Step 3: Finalize Classification**

- Based on the analysis, the given string does not fit any of the defective argument types defined (\<G>, \<FE>, \<IR>, \<RR>, \<WCB>, \<FU>, or \<DEP>\).

### Conclusion

The statement "The fallacy of equivocation occurs when a key term or phrase in an argument is used in an ambiguous way, with one meaning in one portion of the argument and then another meaning in another portion of the argument." is a definition of a specific type of logical fallacy (equivocation) and does not fit into any of the defective argument types \( <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP> \). Therefore, it cannot be classified under any of these categories.
