### Applying IDAA to the Given Statement

**Statement:**
- Speaker 1: You should trust the Bible because it’s the Word of God.
- Speaker 2: How do you know it’s the Word of God?
- Speaker 1: Because God tells us it is.
- Speaker 2: Where does God tell us this?
- Speaker 1: Right here, in the Bible.

#### Step 1: Initial Inspection
- **Objective:** Understand the content and context of the statement.
- **Action:** The statement involves a dialogue where Speaker 1 is attempting to justify belief in the Bible using the Bible itself as authoritative proof.

#### Step 2: Identify Key Components
- **Objective:** Highlight key elements.
- **Action:** The critical phrases are:
  - "You should trust the Bible because it’s the Word of God."
  - "Because God tells us it is."
  - "Right here, in the Bible."

#### Step 3: Match Against Definitions
- **Objective:** Compare key phrases to definitions.
- **Action:** The reasoning provided ("Because God tells us it is. Right here, in the Bible.") seems circular, as it relies on the Bible to validate itself. This can be indicative of a fallacy related to inappropriate reasoning.

#### Step 4: Evaluate Logical Structure
- **Objective:** Assess the logical structure of the argument.
- **Action:** The reasoning Speaker 1 uses to justify believing in the Bible depends on accepting the Bible’s authority beforehand. This suggests a problem where the conclusion is used as the premise, which doesn't provide an independent reason to support the proposition.

#### Step 5: Final Classification
- **Objective:** Conclusively determine the type of defective argument.
- **Outcome:** This argument is best classified as <IR> (Inappropriate Reason), as the reason provided (the Bible says it is the Word of God) does not logically support the proposition outside of circular reasoning.

By following the steps of IDAA, we classify the argument as having an Inappropriate Reason (IR).
