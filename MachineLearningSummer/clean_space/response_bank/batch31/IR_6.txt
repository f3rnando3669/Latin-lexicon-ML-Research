For 
To classify the given string "My professor, who has a Ph.D. in Astronomy, once told me that ghosts are real. Therefore, ghosts are real." using the \( IDAA \) methodology, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Definitions
Review the definitions of each defective argument type:
- **<G>**: Generalization based on a specific instance.
- **<FE>**: False Enumeration of options.
- **<IR>**: Inappropriate Reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- **<RR>**: Redundant Reason that merely restates the proposition in different words.
- **<WCB>**: Weak Causal Basis with insufficient causal link.
- **<FU>**: False Universals asserting universality without proof.
- **<DEP>**: Double-Edged Phrases open to dual interpretations.

### Step 2: Preprocessing the Input
The string is clear and readable as it stands.

### Step 3: Identification of Argument Structure
- **Proposition**: "Ghosts are real."
- **Reason**: "My professor, who has a Ph.D. in Astronomy, once told me that ghosts are real."

### Step 4: Analyze Specific Components
Compare the components against the definitions:
1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Not applicable, as it doesn’t generalize from a specific instance to a broad claim.
2. **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not applicable, no options are listed.
3. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Analyze if the reason logically supports the proposition.
   - The reason given is that an authority figure (a professor with a Ph.D. in Astronomy) believes in ghosts.
   - The expertise of the professor in Astronomy does not logically support their claim about ghosts, which falls outside their domain of expertise.
4. **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Not applicable, the reason is not a restatement of the proposition.
5. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Not applicable, no causal link is claimed.
6. **False Universals (<FU>)**: Not applicable, no universal truths are claimed.
7. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Not applicable, no dual-interpretation statement exists.

### Step 5: Identification and Classification
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided (professor's belief) does not logically support the proposition (that ghosts are real), mainly because the professor’s expertise in Astronomy does not validate claims about ghosts.

Therefore, the classification of the string "My professor, who has a Ph.D. in Astronomy, once told me that ghosts are real. Therefore, ghosts are real." is **<IR>**.
