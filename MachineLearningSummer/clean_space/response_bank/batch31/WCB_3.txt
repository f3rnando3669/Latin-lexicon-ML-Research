For 
To apply IDAA to the string "Global chocolate consumption is highest in Switzerland, yet people there are among the trimmest in the industrialized world. Therefore, it’s reasonable to conclude that chocolate helps keep your weight down.", we will decompose the task into specific steps:

### Steps for IDAA:

1. **Identify and understand the argument structure in the string <s>**
2. **Match the structure to known defective argument types**
3. **Check for common keywords and phrases**
4. **Test for logical coherence**
5. **Classify and validate**

### Application of the Steps (IDAA)

#### Example String: "Global chocolate consumption is highest in Switzerland, yet people there are among the trimmest in the industrialized world. Therefore, it’s reasonable to conclude that chocolate helps keep your weight down."

1. **Identify and understand the argument structure:**
    - **Claim:** "Chocolate helps keep your weight down."
    - **Reason:** "Global chocolate consumption is highest in Switzerland, yet people there are among the trimmest in the industrialized world."

2. **Match the structure to known defective argument types:**
    - Analyze if this argument structure corresponds to <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

3. **Check for common keywords and phrases:**
    - Observe phrases like "Global chocolate consumption," "highest in Switzerland," and "trimmest in the industrialized world."
    - This suggests a causal relationship inferred between chocolate consumption and being trim.

4. **Test for logical coherence:**
    - Is it logically sound to conclude that chocolate consumption leads to being trim just because people who consume a lot of chocolate in Switzerland are among the trimmest?
    - No, the argument implies causation based on correlation without strong evidence supporting the causal claim.

5. **Classify and validate:**
    - This fits the definition of <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis), as the causal basis (that chocolate consumption leads to being trim) is not compelling enough to support the proposition.

### Conclusion:
By following the steps of IDAA, we classify the argument "Global chocolate consumption is highest in Switzerland, yet people there are among the trimmest in the industrialized world. Therefore, it’s reasonable to conclude that chocolate helps keep your weight down." as a <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis). This classification is validated by the lack of strong evidence to support the causal relationship implied in the argument.
