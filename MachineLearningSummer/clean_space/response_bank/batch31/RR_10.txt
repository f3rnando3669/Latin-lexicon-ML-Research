For 
Let's apply the decomposed steps of \(<IDAA>\) to the string \(<s>\): "You should always do what you are being told because following the rules is important."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of \(<IDA>\)

1. **Step 1: Initial Parsing and Understanding**  
   - **Parsing**: "You should always do what you are being told because following the rules is important."

2. **Step 2: Identify Key Elements in the Argument**  
   - **Main Claim**: You should always do what you are being told.
   - **Supporting Reason**: Because following the rules is important.

3. **Step 3: Check for Generalization (\(<G>\))**  
   - Does this argument make a sweeping generalization based on a specific instance? 
   - **Analysis**: It doesn't rely on a specific instance but rather implies a broad rule ("always").

4. **Step 4: Check for False Enumeration (\(<FE>\))**  
   - Are there limited or exaggerated options presented?
   - **Analysis**: This statement doesn't enumerate options but asserts a necessity.

5. **Step 5: Check for Inappropriate Reason (\(<IR>\))**  
   - Is the reason logically irrelevant?
   - **Analysis**: The reason given is about following the rules, which is relevant to the main claim about doing what you're told.

6. **Step 6: Check for Redundant Reason (\(<RR>\))**  
   - Is the reason just a restatement?
   - **Analysis**: The reason "following the rules is important" is essentially a restatement of "you should always do what you are being told." It doesn't add new information but reiterates the main claim using different words.

7. **Step 7: Check for Weak Causal Basis (\(<WCB>\))**  
   - Is the causal claim weak?
   - **Analysis**: The causal link ("following the rules is important" implies "you should do what you are told") is somewhat circular but not necessarily weak in suggesting that rule-following is important.

8. **Step 8: Check for False Universals (\(<FU>\))**  
   - Are there unfounded universal claims?
   - **Analysis**: The statement "you should always do what you are being told" and "following the rules is important" doesn't leave room for exceptions or provide evidence that everyone agrees on this principle.

9. **Step 9: Check for Double-Edged Phrases (\(<DEP>\))**  
   - Are there dual interpretations?
   - **Analysis**: There are no statements that can be interpreted in contradictory ways against the speaker.

### Conclusion
The argument in \(<s>\) primarily exhibits characteristics of Redundant Reason (\(<RR>\)), as the reason provided merely restates the main claim in different words without adding new supporting information. There is also a hint of False Universals (\(<FU>\)) due to the absolutist language "always" without acknowledging exceptions or universal agreement. 

Hence, the primary classification is \(<RR>\) with a secondary hint of \(<FU>\).
