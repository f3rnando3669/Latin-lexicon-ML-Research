Sure, let's apply the decomposition process (IDAA) to classify the argument "a connection between two ideas that doesn't always mean that one causes the other (correlation vs. causation) una conexión entre dos ideas que no siempre significa que una causa la otra (correlación vs. causación)".

### Decomposition Steps (D):
1. **Understand the Argument:**
   - Read the given argument string (<s>) carefully.
   - Identify the main claim and any supporting reasons within the argument.

2. **Identify Argument Components:**
   - Determine whether the argument makes a generalization, lists options, provides a reason, or mentions a cause.
   - Look for key phrases or structures that align with known argument types.

3. **Compare with Definitions:**
   - Compare the identified components with the definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.
   - Use the provided examples to match patterns.

4. **Evaluate Appropriateness:**
   - Assess whether the argument's generalization, enumeration, reason, or causal relationship fits the criteria for defectiveness as per the provided definitions.

5. **Classify the Argument:**
   - Determine the most appropriate defective argument type for the given string <s>.
   - If there is ambiguity, consider primary characteristics to finalize classification.

6. **Document the Process:**
   - Clearly mention which characteristics of the argument led to the specific classification.

### Application of IDAA to the Argument:

1. **Understand the Argument:**
   - Claim: A connection between two ideas doesn't always mean that one causes the other.
   - Supporting Reason: The concept of correlation vs. causation.

2. **Identify Argument Components:**
   - Type: Explanation of the distinction between correlation and causation.

3. **Compare with Definitions:**
   - Check if it fits <G> (Generalization): It does not make a broad claim based on a single instance.
   - Check if it fits <FE> (False Enumeration): It does not list fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - Check if it fits <IR> (Inappropriate Reason): It does not provide a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
   - Check if it fits <RR> (Redundant Reason): It does not present the same idea in different words.
   - Check if it fits <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis): It does discuss causation but rather addresses the common misunderstanding of correlation implying causation.
   - Check if it fits <FU> (False Universals): It does not assert universally agreed points without proof.
   - Check if it fits <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases): It does not use statements open to dual interpretations.

4. **Evaluate Appropriateness:**
   - **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)** fits best because the argument addresses the common flaw of assuming that correlation implies causation, thus offering an explanation related to weak causal assumptions.

5. **Classify the Argument:**
   - Classification: <WCB>

6. **Document the Process:**
   - The argument "a connection between two ideas that doesn't always mean that one causes the other (correlation vs. causation) una conexión entre dos ideas que no siempre significa que una causa la otra (correlación vs. causación)" was classified as a Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>) because it highlights the issue of drawing a cause-and-effect relationship from mere correlation, which often constitutes a weak causal argument.

### Conclusion:
<s> is classified as <WCB>.
