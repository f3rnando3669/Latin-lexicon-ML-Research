For 
To classify the given string "All my friends are doing a low carb diet. That must be the only way to lose weight so I will do it too." into one of the defective argument types using the process \(<IDAA>\), we will follow the detailed steps outlined.

### Applying \(D\) to \(IDA\) (Step-by-Step Process of \(IDAA\)):

1. **Understand the Definitions**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: Claiming general truth from a specific instance.
   - **False Enumeration (FE)**: Listing fewer/more options than actually exist.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**: Providing a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition.
   - **Redundant Reason (RR)**: Stating the same thing as the proposition in different words.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**: Offering an unconvincing causal basis.
   - **False Universals (FU)**: Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**: Using statements open to dual interpretations.

2. **Extract the Proposition**:
   - Proposition: “I will do a low carb diet to lose weight.”
   - Reason provided: “All my friends are doing a low carb diet. That must be the only way to lose weight.”

3. **Preliminary Categorization**:
   - The claim "That must be the only way to lose weight" is based on the observation of friends doing a low-carb diet.

4. **Check for Specific Instances**:
   - Does this rely on a specific instance to make a general claim? 
     - Yes, it takes the specific instance of "all my friends are doing a low carb diet" and generalizes it to "that must be the only way to lose weight." (potentially \(G\)).

5. **Assess Reasoning**:
   - Does the reasoning provided logically support the proposition? 
     - No, the argument assumes one specific instance (friends doing the diet) represents a general truth (the only way to lose weight). This could be evaluated under \(G\).

6. **Finalize Classification**:
   - The core issue is the generalization from the specific instance of friends doing a low-carb diet to it being the only way to lose weight.
   - Considering the definitions, this should be classified as \(<G>\) (Generalization).

7. **Provide Justification**:
   - This argument takes the specific instance of friends doing a low-carb diet and generalizes it to a universal truth about the only way to lose weight without substantive proof. Hence, it is classified as \(<G>\).

### Conclusion:
The argument in the given string "All my friends are doing a low carb diet. That must be the only way to lose weight so I will do it too." is identified as \(<G>\), Generalization, for making a sweeping generalization based on a limited observation.
