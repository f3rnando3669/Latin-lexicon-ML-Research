### Step-by-Step Decomposition of \( IDAA \)

**Given String \( s \):** "Everyone is doing it. You should too."

#### Step 1: Identify the Claim and Reasoning Structure
- **Primary Claim:** "You should too."
- **Supporting Element:** "Everyone is doing it."

#### Step 2: Analyze for Each Defective Argument Type

1. **Generalization (\<G>):**
   - **Does \( s \) make a sweeping statement based on a specific instance?**
     - No, it does not generalize a specific instance to a universal claim.

2. **False Enumeration (\<FE>):**
   - **Does \( s \) present a limited or misleading range of options?**
     - No, it does not limit the range of options; it communicates a persuasive suggestion.

3. **Inappropriate Reason (\<IR>):**
   - **Does \( s \) provide a reason that doesnâ€™t logically support the claim?**
     - The reason given ("Everyone is doing it") could be seen as irrelevant to why someone should actually do it, but the irrelevance is more aligned with appealing to popularity, which fits another category better.

4. **Redundant Reason (\<RR>):**
   - **Does \( s \) restate the initial claim using different words?**
     - No, the supporting element is not a restatement of the claim.

5. **Weak Causal Basis (\<WCB>):**
   - **Is the causal relationship weak or not compelling enough?**
     - No, this does not provide a causal basis or explain a result.

6. **False Universals (\<FU>):**
   - **Does \( s \) use universally agreed points without proof or appeal to popularity?**
     - Yes, the phrase "Everyone is doing it" appeals to the popularity of the action as a reason for someone to also do it, indicating conformity without providing evidence why the action is good or necessary.

7. **Double-Edged Phrases (\<DEP>):**
   - **Does \( s \) include phrases that can be understood in more than one way, especially negatively?**
     - No, the phrase has a single, clear intent.

#### Step 3: Classify the Argument
- The argument in the given string \( s \) aligns with **False Universals (\<FU>)** because it asserts a suggestion based on the popularity of the action rather than providing a direct, substantive reason.

**Conclusion:** The string "Everyone is doing it. You should too." represents the defective argument type **False Universals (\<FU>)**.
