For 
Let's apply <IDAA> to the argument: "Only man is rational // No women is man // Therefore, no women is rational."

1. **Step 1: Understanding the Argument Types**

   We need a clear understanding of each defective argument type:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: A reason that says the same thing as the proposition using different words.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Offering a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
   - **False Universals (<FU>)**: Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Using statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.

2. **Step 2: Analyzing the String**
   
   The argument consists of three statements:
   - Premise 1: "Only man is rational."
   - Premise 2: "No women is man."
   - Conclusion: "Therefore, no women is rational."

3. **Step 3: Matching the String Components to Argument Types**
   
   Let's evaluate the argument to see if it matches any of the defective argument types:
   
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: This doesn't seem to be based on a specific instance to claim a general truth.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: This doesn't appear to list options.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: This category might be considered if the premises don't logically support the conclusion.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: The statements don't seem to be merely restating the same thing.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This doesn't seem to offer a causal basis.
   - **False Universals (<FU>)**: This doesn't assert universal points without proof.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: This doesn't appear to have dual interpretations.

4. **Step 4: Classifying the String**

   The closest match seems to be **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)** because the logical structure and content of the premises don't adequately support the conclusion. The statements present a syllogism which could be considered logically valid, but it's an incorrect application: The word "man" in this context is ambiguous, leading to a fallacy known as _equivocation_.

5. **Step 5: Verification and Refinement**
   
   - **Review**: The argument seems to misuse the term "man" (interpreted as human rather than gender-specific), leading to a misleading logical flow.
   - **Refinement**: Given that the problem lies in the logical structure and supporting reasons of the argument that lead to an incorrect conclusion, "Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)" is a suitable classification. However, it is a specialized form of equivocation.

Final Classification: **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**
