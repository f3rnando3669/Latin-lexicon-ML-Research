To classify the statement "Presenting an unqualified person or institution as a source of credible information" based on the decomposition of the task into specific steps (<IDAA>), let's follow the step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Understand the Argument Type Definitions
Carefully review the definitions for each defective argument type:
- Generalization (<G>)
- False Enumeration (<FE>)
- Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)
- Redundant Reason (<RR>)
- Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- False Universals (<FU>)
- Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)

### Step 2: Identify Components of `<s>`
Break down the string `<s>` to recognize its main claim and any supporting reasons or evidence:
- Main Claim: The person or institution presented as credible.
- Supporting Reason: The person or institution is unqualified.

### Step 3: Match Components to Definitions
Compare the identified components of `<s>` against the features of each defective argument type:
- <G>: Does not apply as it's not making a general truth claim based on a specific instance.
- <FE>: Does not apply as it's not listing fewer or more options than exist.
- <IR>: This might be relevant because presenting an unqualified person as credible can be seen as providing a reason that logically doesn't support the proposition.
- <RR>: Does not apply; the supporting reason is not merely restating the proposition.
- <WCB>: Does not apply; it's not offering a causal basis for the argument.
- <FU>: Does not apply as it's not asserting something based on universal agreement without proof.
- <DEP>: Does not apply as it's not using statements open to dual interpretations.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type
Based on the comparison, the statement most closely matches the defective argument type <IR> (Inappropriate Reason):
- Presenting an unqualified person or institution as credible is irrelevant to the claim made because the qualification (or lack thereof) does not logically support the validity of the information provided by the source.

**Classification Result**: `<s>` is of type `<IR>`.

Thus, by following the specific steps of decomposition, we conclude that the statement "Presenting an unqualified person or institution as a source of credible information" should be classified as `<IR>`.
