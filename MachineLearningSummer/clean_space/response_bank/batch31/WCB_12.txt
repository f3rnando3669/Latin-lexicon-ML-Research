### Decomposition (<D>) of Task (<IDA>) for "Every time my brother Bill accompanies me to Fenway Park, the Red Sox are sure to lose":

Let's break down <IDA> (identifying the type of defective argument) into specific steps to classify the given statement.

### Application of <D> to <IDA> (IDAA):

#### Step 1: Comprehend the Statement
   - Understand the statement: The speaker is saying that whenever their brother Bill goes with them to Fenway Park, the Red Sox lose the game.

#### Step 2: Identify the Claim or Proposition
   - The main claim is that the Red Sox losing is somehow related to Bill accompanying the speaker to the game.

#### Step 3: Analyze the Reasoning
   - The reasoning seems to imply a cause-and-effect relationship: Bill's presence at the game causes the Red Sox to lose.

#### Step 4: Compare Against Categories

- **<G> (Generalization):** Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
  - Doesn't Match: This statement isn't a broad generalization about a group based on a specific instance.
  
- **<FE> (False Enumeration):** Limiting to fewer or more options.
  - Doesn't Match: No enumeration of options here.
  
- **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason):** Providing unrelated reason.
  - Doesn't Match: The statement tries to establish a relevant, though flawed, causal relationship.
  
- **<RR> (Redundant Reason):** Reiteration in different words.
  - Doesn't Match: No redundancy in the statement.
  
- **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis):** Weak cause and effect.
  - Matches: The causal basis that Bill's presence causes the Red Sox to lose is not compelling or logically sound.
  
- **<FU> (False Universals):** Unsubstantiated universally agreed points.
  - Doesn't Match: This statement does not assert a universally agreed point.

- **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases):** Dual interpretations.
  - Doesn't Match: There's no dual interpretation here.

#### Step 5: Select the Closest Match

- The defective argument type that best fits the statement is **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**, because it suggests a weak and non-compelling causal relationship between Bill's attendance and the Red Sox losing.

### Conclusion:
The statement "Every time my brother Bill accompanies me to Fenway Park, the Red Sox are sure to lose" is best classified as <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis).

By applying the defined steps, we successfully identified the type of defective argument in the example statement.
