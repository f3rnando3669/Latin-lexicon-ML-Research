For 
Certainly! Let's apply the step-by-step decomposition (<D>) to classify the string "All of those who hate the Duterte administration are CPP-NPA supporters." 

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough (IDAA)

#### Step 1: Understand the Definitions
We will use the definitions specified for the defective argument types: 
- <G>: Generalization
- <FE>: False Enumeration
- <IR>: Inappropriate Reason
- <RR>: Redundant Reason
- <WCB>: Weak Causal Basis
- <FU>: False Universals
- <DEP>: Double-Edged Phrases

#### Step 2: Read the Given String (<s>)
"All of those who hate the Duterte administration are CPP-NPA supporters."

#### Step 3: Identify Key Components
Key components:
- "All of those who hate the Duterte administration..."
- "...are CPP-NPA supporters."

#### Step 4: Match Components to Definitions
- <G>: Yes, this makes a broad generalization based on a specific attribute (hating the Duterte administration) and then labels all such individuals as CPP-NPA supporters.
- <FE>: No, it does not enumerate options or list choices inaccurately.
- <IR>: No, it doesn't provide an inappropriate reason but rather a broad generalization.
- <RR>: No, it's not a redundant or tautological argument.
- <WCB>: No, there's no causal relationship presented here.
- <FU>: No, this doesn't assert a universally agreed point without proof but rather makes a general statement about a group.
- <DEP>: No, it's not a statement open to dual interpretations.

#### Step 5: Classify the String
The string fits the definition of <G> (Generalization) because it claims a general truth ("all of those who hate the Duterte administration") based on a specific instance and labels them as CPP-NPA supporters without evidence.

**Final Classification:** <G>

So, the classification of the string "All of those who hate the Duterte administration are CPP-NPA supporters." is <G>.
