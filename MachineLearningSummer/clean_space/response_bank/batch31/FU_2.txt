For 
Certainly! Let's apply the step-by-step decomposition of the task <IDAA> to the provided string "Everybody else is doing it, why don't you?".

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of the Task <IDAA>:

**Example String**: "Everybody else is doing it, why don't you?"

**Step 1: Initial Identification of the Argument Nature**
- **Objective**: Determine if the string constitutes an argument with a proposition and a reasoning element.
- **Action**: Examine the string for an explicit claim or proposition and any supporting reason provided.
  - **Analysis**: The string is proposing that "you should do it" based on the reason "everybody else is doing it."

**Step 2: Identify Type <G> (Generalization)**
- **Objective**: Check if the argument claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **Action**: Look for keywords indicating broad generalizations.
  - **Analysis**: The argument doesn't generalize based on one instance but rather on assumed collective behavior.

**Step 3: Identify Type <FE> (False Enumeration)**
- **Objective**: Determine if the argument provides an incomplete or inaccurate list of options.
- **Action**: Check if the argument presents limited choices when more options are available.
  - **Analysis**: The argument doesn't list options.

**Step 4: Identify Type <IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**
- **Objective**: Assess if the provided reason is logically unrelated to the proposition.
- **Action**: Evaluate the connection between the reason and the claim.
  - **Analysis**: The reason is related to the proposition, as it suggests you should do it because others are doing it.

**Step 5: Identify Type <RR> (Redundant Reason)**
- **Objective**: Check if the reason merely restates the proposition without adding new information.
- **Action**: See if the argument's reason is a paraphrase of the proposition.
  - **Analysis**: The reason provided is distinct from the proposition.

**Step 6: Identify Type <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**
- **Objective**: Evaluate if the causal connection provided is strong enough to support the claim.
- **Action**: Determine if there is evidence or logic strongly linking the cause to the effect.
  - **Analysis**: There isn’t a causal relationship being established here; rather, it’s an appeal to follow others’ actions.

**Step 7: Identify Type <FU> (False Universals)**
- **Objective**: Check if the argument makes a universal assertion without proof.
- **Action**: Look for sweeping statements assumed to be universally agreed upon without evidence.
  - **Example Check**: The string asserts that because "everybody else" is doing it (a universally agreed upon statement without proof), "you should do it too."

**Step 8: Identify Type <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)**
- **Objective**: Determine if the argument uses ambiguous statements that can be interpreted in multiple ways.
- **Action**: Examine the wording for potential dual interpretations that could work against the speaker.
  - **Analysis**: The statement does not have dual interpretations that could be used against the speaker.

**Step 9: Classify \(\langles\rangle\)**
- **Objective**: Finalize the classification of the given string \(\langles\rangle\) into one of the defective argument types.
- **Action**: Based on the results from Steps 2-8, determine which argument type \(\langles\rangle\) most closely matches.
- **Record**: Assign \(\langles\rangle\) to \(\langle G \rangle\), \(\langle FE \rangle\), \(\langle IR \rangle\), \(\langle RR \rangle\), \(\langle WCB \rangle\), \(\langle FU \rangle\), or \(\langle DEP \rangle\).

### Final Classification:
- The argument "Everybody else is doing it, why don't you?" makes a universally accepted assertion without providing substantial proof, implying the proposition should be followed because of assumed collective behavior.

Thus, the string "Everybody else is doing it, why don't you?" is classified as \(\langle FU \rangle\).
