For 
To classify the given string "Either we pass this ordinance or there will be rioting in the streets." according to the defective argument types, we can apply the decomposed steps of \( <IDAA> \):

### Step 1: Understand Definitions
Review definitions and examples of each defective argument type:
- **Generalization (G)**
- **False Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**
- **Redundant Reason (RR)**
- **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **False Universals (FU)**
- **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**

### Step 2: Analyze the String (\( <s> \))
Read the string carefully:
- Proposition: "Either we pass this ordinance or there will be rioting in the streets."

### Step 3: Identify Key Characteristics
Determine the primary nature of the argument:
- The argument presents two options: passing the ordinance or facing rioting in the streets.

### Step 4: Match Characteristics with Definitions
Compare the identified characteristics with the definitions:
- The string presents a limited set of options (either passing the ordinance or experiencing riots), ignoring other possible alternatives or solutions that might prevent rioting.
- This type of argument matches the definition of **False Enumeration (FE)**, which lists fewer or more options than actually exist (i.e., false dichotomy).

### Step 5: Classify the Argument
Based on the matching characteristics, the argument type is classified.

- The string \( s \) "Either we pass this ordinance or there will be rioting in the streets." is of type \( <FE> \) (False Enumeration).

By applying these decomposition steps, we've correctly classified the argument type of the string \( s \).
