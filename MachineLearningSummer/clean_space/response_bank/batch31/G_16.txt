Sure! Let's apply the process of IDAA to the string "I believe one should never deliberately hurt another person, that’s why I can never be a surgeon."

### Step 1: Understand and Analyze the Given String
- The central claim in this string is that the speaker believes one should never deliberately hurt another person.
- The reasoning provided for why the speaker can never be a surgeon is based on this belief.

### Step 2: Identify Keywords or Phrases
- "One should never deliberately hurt another person" is a moral or ethical statement.
- "That’s why I can never be a surgeon" connects the belief to the profession of being a surgeon.

### Step 3: Compare with Definitions
- **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument doesn't seem to be claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not listing fewer or more options but rather giving a specific reason for the choice.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: This seems likely, as the reason provided (not deliberately hurting another person) does not logically align with the duties of a surgeon, whose goal is to heal, often necessitating temporary harm for long-term benefit.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: The reason is not simply restating the proposition.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal link isn't weak so much as potentially misinterpreted.
- **False Universals (<FU>)**: Not asserting a universally agreed point without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Doesn't seem to be a statement open to dual interpretations against the speaker.

### Step 4: Match the String to the Closest Defective Argument Type
- The inappropriate reasoning is the best match here since the string seems to misunderstand the nature of a surgeon's work, which involves causing temporary harm to achieve healing and betterment.

### Step 5: Classify the String
- The string "I believe one should never deliberately hurt another person, that’s why I can never be a surgeon" is classified as <IR> (Inappropriate Reason).

By following these steps, we conclude that the argument provided is of type <IR> because the reasoning that a surgeon's role involves deliberate harm overlooks the context in which this harm occurs and the ultimate goal of healing.
