### Applying <IDAA> to the given text:

Let's execute the task <IDAA> step by step to classify the argument types present in the text.

1. **Identify the Proposition**:
   - Main Proposition: "The idea of adopting a vegan diet is ludicrous."

2. **Identify the Argument**:
   - The arguments provided in support of the proposition are:
     1. **Argument 1**: Humans have consumed meat for thousands of years without severe problems.
     2. **Argument 2**: Our bodies are capable of benefiting from nutrients in animal foods.
     3. **Argument 3**: There is no health reason to avoid animal foods.
     4. **Argument 4**: It's unnecessary to restrain oneself from consuming meat to enjoy life to the fullest.

3. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**:

    a. **Generalization (<G>)**:
       - The argument "Humans have consumed meat for thousands of years without severe problems" is making a broad claim based on historical practice. This fits <G>.
       - The argument "There are no cases when consuming meat causing severe problems, provided meat is consumed in appropriate amount" also makes a generalization about meat consumption not causing severe problems.

    b. **False Enumeration (<FE>)**:
       - The text does not explicitly limit or enumerate options incorrectly, so <FE> is not applicable here.

    c. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**:
       - The argument "It's unnecessary to restrain oneself from consuming meat to enjoy life to the fullest" does not logically support why veganism is ludicrous. The reason provided (enjoying life to the fullest) does not logically invalidate veganism. This fits <IR>.

    d. **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**:
       - The text does not offer repeated reasons stated differently that are redundant with the proposition.

    e. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
       - The argument "Our bodies are perfectly capable of digesting and benefiting from animal foods" implies a weak causal basis for dismissing veganism since health benefits of animal foods do not directly contradict the health benefits of vegan diets. This fits <WCB>.

    f. **False Universals (<FU>)**:
       - The arguments "Many say that being a vegan means having a healthier, stronger body and mind" and "There is no health reason to completely avoid animal foods" assert claims about health benefits without providing direct proof. This fits <FU>.

    g. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**:
       - No statements in the text offer dual interpretations potentially against the speaker, so <DEP> is not applicable here.

### Summary of Classification in the Text:
- **<G> (Generalization)**: Arguments about historical meat consumption and lack of severe problems.
- **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**: Argument about needing to enjoy life to the fullest as a reason against veganism.
- **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**: Argument about our bodies benefiting from animal nutrients as invalidation of veganism.
- **<FU> (False Universals)**: Arguments asserting no health reason to avoid animal foods and health benefits of animal foods without proof.

### Claims from the Text:
- Adopting a vegan diet is a ludicrous idea.
- Humans have consumed meat historically without severe problems.
- Our bodies can digest and benefit from nutrients in animal foods.
- There is no health reason to avoid animal foods.
- Restricting meat consumption is unnecessary to enjoy life fully.

By classifying these arguments, we see a mix of generalizations, inappropriate reasons, weak causal bases, and false universals presented to support the main claim against the vegan diet.
