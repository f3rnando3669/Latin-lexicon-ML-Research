### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of IDA:

**Step 1: Initial Understanding**
- **a. Read the statement (<s>) carefully:** "Filthy and polluting coal should be banned."
- **b. Identify the core proposition or assertion within the statement:** The statement asserts that coal, described as "filthy and polluting," should be banned.

**Step 2: Identification of Specific Characteristics**
- **a. Identify if the statement deals with a general truth based on specific instances (Possible <G>):** The statement does not generalize from specific instances; rather, it makes a broad assertion about coal.
- **b. Identify if the statement lists fewer or more options than actually exist (Possible <FE>):** The statement does not enumerate options or present a false dichotomy.
- **c. Identify if the statement provides reasoning that does not logically support the proposition (Possible <IR>):** "Filthy and polluting" is a characteristic description intended to justify the banning, so it might be potentially relevant, not necessarily inappropriate.
- **d. Identify if the statement repeats the same idea as a new reason (Possible <RR>):** The statement does not restate the proposition in different terms.
- **e. Identify if the statement offers weak or unconvincing causality (Possible <WCB>):** This might be a consideration if the causality between "filthy and polluting" and the need to ban coal is not compelling enough.
- **f. Identify if the statement asserts universally accepted points without proof (Possible <FU>):** The statement uses "filthy and polluting" as terms that might be taken as universally accepted, potentially without sufficient proof.
- **g. Identify if the statement is open to dual interpretations (Possible <DEP>):** The statement does not seem to be open to dual interpretations.

**Step 3: Matching Assertion to Definitions**
- **a. Compare the identified assertion to the definitions provided for each defective argument type:** 
  - **Generalization (G):** Not applicable here, as there is no generalization based on specific instances.
  - **False Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable, as there is no listing of options.
  - **Inappropriate Reason (IR):** Not directly fitting here since the reason provided ("filthy and polluting") can be considered contextually relevant.
  - **Redundant Reason (RR):** Not applicable as there is no restating of the proposition.
  - **Weak Causal Basis (WCB):** There is a possible connection here if the assertion "filthy and polluting" is not sufficiently strong to support the proposed action of banning.
  - **False Universals (FU):** The terms "filthy and polluting" could be considered as assumed universally known qualities without explicit proof.
  - **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP):** Not applicable.

**Step 4: Final Classification**
- **a. Assign the appropriate label:** The statement could be classified as either <WCB> for potentially offering a weak causal basis or <FU> for asserting universally accepted points without proof.
- **b. Document the reasoning:** The statement "Filthy and polluting coal should be banned" could be classified as <WCB> if the reasoning that coal's characteristics alone justify a ban is seen as weak. Alternatively, it could be classified as <FU> because it assumes that the terms "filthy and polluting" are universally understood and accepted without needing further proof.

### Conclusion
The statement "Filthy and polluting coal should be banned" has been classified as either <WCB> for offering a possibly weak causal basis or <FU> for using assumed universally accepted points without proof. Given the context, it might lean more towards <WCB> as the primary defective argument type, considering the causal assertion's convincibility in the given absence of detailed evidence beyond strong language.
