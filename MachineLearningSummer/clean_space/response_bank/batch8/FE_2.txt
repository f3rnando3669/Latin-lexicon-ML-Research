For 
Let's apply the steps of IDAA (Identifying Argument Type through Decomposition) to the given string: "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."

**Step 1: Read the given argument.**
- Argument: "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."

**Step 2: Compare against definitions of defective argument types.**

- **<G> (Generalization):** 
  - No, it is not claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.

- **<FE> (False Enumeration):** 
  - Yes, it presents two options as if they are the only ones when in reality there can be more, e.g., someone could support women's rights but prefer another candidate.

- **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason):**
  - No, the argument does give a reason that is logically connected to the proposition but invalidates other possible positions.

- **<RR> (Redundant Reason):**
  - No, it is not restating the proposition in other words.

- **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis):**
  - No, it is not offering a causally weak reason to support a proposition.

- **<FU> (False Universals):**
  - No, it does not assert universally agreed points without proof.

- **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases):**
  - No, this argument doesn't seem to be open to dual interpretations.

**Step 3: Determine the best matching defective argument type.**
- From the comparison, the argument "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights." best matches the characteristics of **<FE> (False Enumeration)** since it falsely limits the options to only two.

**Step 4: Label the argument.**
- This argument is an example of **<FE> (False Enumeration)**. 

Thus, we've successfully decomposed and executed the task of identifying the defective argument type for the given string.
