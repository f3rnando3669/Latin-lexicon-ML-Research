For 
Let's apply the analytical decomposition process <IDAA> to identify the type of defective argument in the given dialogue:

### String Analysis:
```
Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified.
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so.
Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct?
Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran.
```

### Steps:

1. **Extract the Argument:**
   - The main argument is a claim that Jesus was not really crucified. The support for this claim is based on the authority of the Quran, which is argued to be valid because it is the Word of God, as stated within the Quran itself.

2. **Classify the Argument:**
   - This argument involves circular reasoning, where the proposition (the truth of the Quran) is used to validate itself without independent evidence.

3. **Validate Against Definitions:**
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** The argument here is essentially saying the same thing in different words without providing an independent reason. Each statement depends on the acceptance of the previous one while ultimately referring back to the initial claim without external validation.
   - It closely fits the **Redundant Reason** category as the argument relies on the Quran being true because it claims itself to be true through circular reasoning.

4. **Conclude the Type:**
   - This is an example of **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**.

**Conclusion**: 
The conversation provided represents the defective argument type **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**, as it involves circular reasoning where the truth of the Quran is used to validate itself without providing additional external support.
