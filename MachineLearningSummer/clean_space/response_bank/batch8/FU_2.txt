For 
To apply the concept of <IDAA> to the given string "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way," I will break down the process using the decomposition strategy.

### Step-by-step Application of IDAA

#### Step 1: Extract the Argument
- Given String <s>: "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way."
- This statement implies that the argument is encouraging behavior based on group conformity.

#### Step 2: Classify the Argument
- To classify, we need to review the definitions of the defective argument types and see which one best fits the given string.

Here are the potential types again for reference:
1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
2. **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
3. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
4. **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Saying the same thing as the proposition but in other words.
5. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Offering a reason that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
6. **False Universals (<FU>)**: Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
7. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Using statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.

By matching the definition of the argument in the string to these defective argument types, we notice that the argument is encouraging an action because others are doing it. This matches closely with the definition of **False Universals (<FU>)**:

- **False Universals (<FU>)**: Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
   - Example: "Stating that something should be done (or agreed to) because everyone else thinks this way."

#### Step 3: Provide Examples and Explanations for the Classification
- Given string: "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way."
- Classification: False Universals (<FU>)
- Explanation:
  - This argument type encourages actions based on the supposed universal behavior of others without providing concrete evidence or a compelling reason. It assumes that because others are doing something, it must be the correct or desired action, which is a typical characteristic of **False Universals**.

### Outcome
The given argument "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way" has been identified as an example of **False Universals (<FU>)**. This classification is based on its encouragement of behavior through the appeal to group conformity without providing substantive reasoning.

Thus, **IDAA** was applied successfully to decompose and identify the logical fallacy in the given argument string.
