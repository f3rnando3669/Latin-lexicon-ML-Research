### Applying IDAA to the Given Argument

**Argument:**
"Perhaps the most classic example of this fallacy is the argument for the existence of God. Due to the understanding of nature through science, many of the arguments that used to be used for God (or gods) were abandoned, only to be replaced with new ones, usually involving questions to which science has not definitively answered yet. The move from creationism to intelligent design is a prime example. Currently the origin of life is a popular argument for God (although a classic argument from ignorance), and an area where we very well may have a scientific answer in the next decade, at which time, the 'origin of life' argument will fade away and be replaced by another, thus moving the figurative goalposts farther back as our understanding of the natural world increases. Exception: This fallacy should not be confused with an argument or set of arguments, with multiple propositions inherent in the argument. The reason for the difference between this kind of argument and the moving the goalposts fallacy is a subtle one, but indicated by a strong initial claim ('has to be,' 'must,' 'required for,' etc.) that gets answered and/or what appears to be ad hoc objections that follow eventually leading to an impossible request for proof. Fun Fact: The name 'moving the goalposts' comes from the analogy of kicking a perfect field goal in American football, only to have the goalposts be moved on you. This would be very unfair.

### Steps for IDAA

1. **Step 1**: Read the argument carefully.
   - The argument describes the fallacy of "moving the goalposts" in the context of arguments for the existence of God. It suggests that as scientific understanding progresses, arguments for God's existence shift to areas where science has not yet provided answers, thereby continuously changing the criteria for proof.

2. **Step 2**: Identify the candidate defective argument types.
   - The candidate defective argument types are G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP.

3. **Step 3**: Compare the argument against each defective type.
   - G (Generalization): The argument does not generalize a specific instance to a general truth.
   - FE (False Enumeration): The argument does not present a false dichotomy or list fewer/more options than exist.
   - IR (Inappropriate Reason): The argument does not present a reason that does not logically support the claim.
   - RR (Redundant Reason): The argument does not simply rephrase the same claim.
   - WCB (Weak Causal Basis): The argument criticizes the causal relationship suggested by "moving the goalposts" rather than offering a weak causal basis.
   - FU (False Universals): The argument does not assert a universal agreement without proof, but rather discusses how arguments for divine existence shift with scientific advances.
   - DEP (Double-Edged Phrases): The argument does not use statements open to dual interpretations.

4. **Step 4**: Validate by example.
   - There is a need to match this argument with the predefined defective argument types. It seems closest to a fallacy of shifting criteria (moving goalposts), which does not directly fit any of the listed defective argument types. 

5. **Step 5**: Conclude the identification based on the closest match.
   - None of the listed defective argument types directly fit the described scenario. The argument discusses "moving the goalposts," a specific fallacy not covered by G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, or DEP. Therefore, this fallacy appears to be distinct from those defined.

### Conclusion
The argument provided primarily describes the "moving the goalposts" fallacy, which is characterized by continuously changing the criteria for proving a point, making it increasingly difficult or impossible to meet the requirements for proof. This specific fallacy does not align directly with any of the predefined defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

However, if forced to categorize under the provided types, one might loosely connect it to **False Universals (FU)** (**very loosely**), as it could imply universally shifting arguments without definitive proof. This application, while not perfect, is the closest available categorically.
