For 
Let's apply the defined steps of IDAA to the given string and identify the defective argument type:

**String:** "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people."

### Step-by-Step Analysis (IDAA):
1. **Step 1: Read and Understand <s>.**
   - The string claims that fixing the broken judicial system requires electing new people.

2. **Step 2: Analyze the logical structure of <s>.**
   - The string implies that the sole or primary solution to the problem of a broken judicial system is to elect new people.

3. **Step 3: Compare <s> with the predefined defective argument types.**
   - This argument may seem to suggest a specific solution without adequate reasoning. 
   - It doesn't explicitly establish why electing new people would specifically fix the judicial system or whether that is the only solution.

4. **Step 4: Identify the most appropriate defective argument type from the list.**
   - The argument appears to limit the options for fixing the judicial system to a single action: electing new people, suggesting a False Enumeration (<FE>).
   - On the other hand, it also lacks a compelling reason or detailed explanation as to why this solution would be effective, hinting at a Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>).

5. **Step 5: Validate the identification to ensure it adheres to the definitions provided.**
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument could be seen as listing fewer options (only electing new people) than might really exist for addressing the problem.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The statement does not provide a strong or detailed reason to support why electing new people would necessarily fix the judicial system.

### Conclusion:
After comparing and validating the steps, the string "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people." best fits the category of Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>) because it provides a reason that is not compelling or sufficiently detailed to support the proposed solution.

**Result:** <WCB>
