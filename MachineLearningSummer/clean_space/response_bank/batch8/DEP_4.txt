For 
To apply IDAA to the string "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses," we will follow the steps of decomposition (D) for identifying defective arguments (IDA).

### Step-by-Step Process (D) for IDA:

1. **Identify Argument**:
   - The argument presented in the string is:
     - Premise 1: "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being."
     - Premise 2: "Fetuses are innocent human beings."
     - Conclusion: "Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."

2. **Match to Definition**:
   - Compare the argument to the definitions of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

Let's analyze each defective argument type to see if the argument matches:

- **Generalization (G)**: This defective argument type claims a general truth based on a specific instance. The given argument does not rely on a single instance to make a broad generalization, so it does not fit the Generalization type.

- **False Enumeration (FE)**: This type incorrectly lists fewer or more options than actually exist. The given argument does not involve listing options, so it does not fit the False Enumeration type.

- **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**: This type provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition. The premises do provide a reason to support the conclusion, so it does not fit the Inappropriate Reason type.

- **Redundant Reason (RR)**: This type says the same thing as the proposition but in other words. The argument's conclusion is not a simple restatement of the premises, so it does not fit the Redundant Reason type.

- **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**: This type offers reasons that are not compelling enough to support the proposition. The reasons given (the premises) are logical and provide a strong basis for the conclusion within the moral framework presented, so it does not fit the Weak Causal Basis type.

- **False Universals (FU)**: This type asserts universally agreed points without proof. The argument does not rely on universal agreement but specific definitions and moral principles. Therefore, it does not fit the False Universals type.

- **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**: This type uses statements open to dual interpretations. The given argument's statements are clear and not open to dual interpretations, so it does not fit the Double-Edged Phrases type.

3. **Determine Type**:
   - Based on the analysis above, the argument does not appear to match any of the predefined defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

4. **Validate**:
   - As the argument does not fit the criteria for any of the defective argument types listed, it does not seem to be an example of a defective argument according to the given definitions.

Therefore, applying IDAA to the string "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses." leads to the conclusion that this argument does not fit into any of the specified defective argument types. This string represents a valid logical argument rather than a defective one according to the provided categories.
