### Analysis of the Argument: "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding."

Let's apply the IDAA process step by step to identify the type of defective argument:

**Step 1: Identify the Claim**
- **Main Claim**: "I'm sure I wasn't speeding."

**Step 2: Analyze the Evidence/Reasoning**
- **Evidence/Reasoning**: "I was only driving as fast as everyone around me."

**Step 3: Compare with Definitions**
- **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument does not seem to be making a general truth based on a specific instance. No.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: This argument does not list options; it is trying to justify an action. No.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: While it does offer a justification, it doesn't directly fall under providing a reason that doesn't logically connect to the proposition outright. No.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: The statement does not repeat the same idea as its reasoning. No.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reasoning isn't weakly causal here but tries to establish behavior based on others. No.
- **False Universals (<FU>)**: It seems to use a universal fact or something shared by many (everyone was going that speed), trying to justify that driving speed was acceptable. Yes.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Not using a dual interpretation here. No.

**Step 4: Categorize Argument**
The argument fits most closely with the concept of False Universals, as it uses the behavior of "everyone else" to justify one's actions.

**Step 5: Validate**
- The reasoning provided in the argument attempts to justify not speeding by referencing common behavior, an appeal to what others are doing, which fits False Universals.

### Result:
The argument: "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding." falls under the category of **False Universals (<FU>)**.

In conclusion, by systematically breaking down and analyzing the argument using the defined steps, we have identified it as a case of False Universals.
