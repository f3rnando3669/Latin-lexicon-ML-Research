For 
Sure, let's apply the defined steps of \( <IDAA> \) to identify the defective argument type in the given string \( s = "Everyone else is doing it, so should you." \).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Step 1: Identify Key Elements in \( s \)
- Key elements: "Everyone else", "is doing it", "so should you".

#### Step 2: Pattern Matching
- The statement suggests that because a majority (or everyone) is doing something, the individual should too.
- This resembles an argument based on popularity or universal acceptance.

#### Step 3: Contextual Analysis
- The argument is trying to persuade by saying that since the collective is participating in an action, it is valid or recommended to do the same.
- There is no evidence or logical reason presented for why the individual should follow suit other than the fact that others are doing it.

#### Step 4: Assign Defective Argument Type
- This looks like a typical case of appealing to popularity.
- According to our definitions, this matches the characteristics of \( <FU> \) (False Universals), as it asserts that something should be done because everyone else is doing it without proper proof or reasoning.

#### Step 5: Verify and Validate
- Double-check the statement against other types:
  - \( <G> \): Not a Generalization based on a specific instance.
  - \( <FE> \): Not a False Enumeration; there's no listing of limited options.
  - \( <IR> \): The reason provided is contextually inappropriate, but not in the sense described for \( <IR> \); it fits better under false popularity.
  - \( <RR> \), \( <WCB> \), \( <DEP> \): None of these match as well as \( <FU> \).

### Conclusion
The defective argument type for the given string \( s = "Everyone else is doing it, so should you." \) is \( <FU> \) (False Universals). This statement appeals to the popularity of an action as a form of validation without providing a logical reason.
