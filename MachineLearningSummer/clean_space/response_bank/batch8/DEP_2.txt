For 
To apply the process of <IDAA> (the application of decomposition to identifying defective arguments) to the given argument, let's follow the structured steps outlined:

**Given Argument (s):**
"Speaker 1: We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change.
Speaker: Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."

#### Steps for <IDAA>:

1. **Read the argument carefully**:
   - **Speaker 1** emphasizes the large-scale effort involving thousands of people to promote awareness of social injustice.
   - **Speaker** objects by equating the phrase "using people" with exploitation, thus refusing to participate.

2. **Compare with definitions**:
   - We need to match the argument against the list of defective argument types provided earlier (Generalization, False Enumeration, Inappropriate Reason, Redundant Reason, Weak Causal Basis, False Universals, Double-Edged Phrases).

3. **Identify characteristics**:
   - The objection posed by the speaker involves an interpretation of the phrase "using people."
   - There is a potential misunderstanding or misrepresentation of *"using"* intended here as leveraging effort versus exploitation.

4. **Assign the correct type**:
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: The phrase "using people" is open to dual interpretations (one as organizing volunteers for a cause, the other as exploiting individuals), which is causing the confusion and objection by the speaker.

**Result**: The argument "Speaker 1: We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change. Speaker: Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people." is identified as a **Double-Edged Phrase (<DEP>)** due to the dual interpretations of the phrase "using people" leading to miscommunication.
