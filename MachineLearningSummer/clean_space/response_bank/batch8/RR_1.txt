For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity," we need to follow the detailed decomposition steps and recognize the type of defective argument. Let's proceed step-by-step:

### Application (<IDAA>) of <D> to <IDA>:
Given the string `s = "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."`, we will apply the decomposition steps to identify the defective argument type.

1. **Input Processing**:
    - Receive the string `s = "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."`.

2. **Pattern Recognition**:
    - **Check for Generalizations (<G>)**:
      - The statement doesn't seem to generalize a specific instance to a larger group.

    - **Check for False Enumeration (<FE>)**:
      - The statement does not enumerate constrained options.

    - **Check for Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**:
      - The statement does not provide an obviously irrelevant reason but rather uses a personal experience as evidence.

    - **Check for Redundant Reason (<RR>)**:
      - The statement essentially restates the proposition. The claim "Paranormal activity is real" is supported by the identical phrase "I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity".

    - **Check for Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
      - The statement does suggest a weak causal link since it bases the claim of paranormal reality on personal experience alone, but this isn't the dominant pattern in this case.

    - **Check for False Universals (<FU>)**:
      - The statement doesn't make a universal assertion.

    - **Check for Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**:
      - There are no phrases with dual interpretations that can undermine the argument.

3. **Comparison and Matching**:
    - Based on the recognized patterns, the statement most closely matches the type of defective argument known as **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**.

4. **Decision Making**:
    - Conclude that the argument type is a Redundant Reason.

5. **Output Generation**:
    - Output: `<RR>`. The statement "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity." is an example of a Redundant Reason.

Thus, we have successfully applied the structured approach to identify that the given argument falls under the category of Redundant Reason (<RR>).
