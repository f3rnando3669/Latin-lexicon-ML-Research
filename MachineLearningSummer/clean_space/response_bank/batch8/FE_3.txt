### Application of IDAA to "People either like coffee or hate it."

Let's apply the decomposition steps (<D>) to the task of identifying the type of defective argument (<IDA>) for the given statement:

#### Example Argument:
"People either like coffee or hate it."

1. **Read and Understand the Argument:**
   - The argument presents a binary choice regarding people's feelings towards coffee, suggesting there are only two opposing options: liking or hating coffee.

2. **Identify the Structure:**
   - The argument suggests a dichotomy, implying that there are no other possible opinions about coffee besides extreme like or dislike.

3. **Compare with Definitions:**
   - The structure of suggesting only two options fits the definition of **False Enumeration (FE)**, as it lists fewer options than actually exist. There are many other nuanced feelings people can have about coffee, such as indifference, mild preference, or dislike without hatred.

4. **Determine the Type:**
   - The argument presents a False Enumeration (FE).

5. **Justify Your Choice:**
   - The argument forces a binary choice where more options exist. People can have various neutral or moderate opinions about coffee, not just extreme like or hate. Therefore, it fits the definition of False Enumeration because it overlooks the spectrum of opinions regarding coffee.

By following the decomposition steps, we identified and justified that the argument falls under the category of **False Enumeration (FE)**.
