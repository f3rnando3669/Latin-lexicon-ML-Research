For 
Let's apply the steps of <IDAA> to the provided string: "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess all the other classes will all fail it, too."

### Application of <D> to <IDA>:

1. **Identify the Argument**:
   - The statement observes that three kids in one class failed a quiz and then makes a general assumption about the performance of all other classes.

2. **Analyze the Logic**:
   - The statement generalizes the quiz results of a few students in one class to all other classes without sufficient evidence to support this conclusion.

3. **Match to Definitions**:
   - The reasoning used matches the criteria for a Generalization (<G>), which claims a general truth based on a specific instance.

4. **Classification**:
   - The defective argument for the statement "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess all the other classes will all fail it, too." is **<G>** (Generalization).

Therefore, by following the steps of <IDAA>, we classify the defective argument type as **<G>** for Generalization.
