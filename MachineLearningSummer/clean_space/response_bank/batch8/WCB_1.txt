For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far," let's break down and follow the steps defined in the decomposition (<D>) process:

1. **Parsing Step**: Break down the string <s> into its component parts to understand its structure.
   - Premise: "liberals took political correctness too far"
   - Conclusion: "The reason Donald Trump got elected"

2. **Comparative Analysis Step**: Compare the structure and content of <s> against known types of defective arguments.
   - This statement is suggesting a causation link between two events: liberals taking political correctness too far and Donald Trump getting elected.

3. **Criterion Matching Step**: Identify key characteristics in <s> that match those in definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.
   - Generalization (<G>): Not applicable as it’s not making a broad claim based on one instance.
   - False Enumeration (<FE>): Not applicable as it’s not listing limited options.
   - Inappropriate Reason (<IR>): It might be inappropriate if political correctness doesn’t logically lead to the election result.
   - Redundant Reason (<RR>): Not applicable as it’s not rephrasing the same idea redundantly.
   - Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>): Could fit if the reason provided is not compelling or sufficiently explanatory for the proposition.
   - False Universals (<FU>): Not applicable as it’s not appealing to universally agreed points without proof.
   - Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>): Not applicable as it’s not using dual-interpretation statements.

4. **Classification Step**: Based on this matching process, it appears that the argument fits the definition of <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis).
   - The reason given (liberals took political correctness too far) may not be sufficiently robust to explain why Donald Trump was elected, thereby making the causal link weak.

Final identification: The string <s> "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far." is a <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis) type defective argument.
