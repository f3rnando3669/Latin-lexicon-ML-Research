For 
Let's apply the decomposition and identification process (IDAA) to the given statement:

**Input:** "One of our clients doubled their conversions after changing all their landing page text to bright red. Therefore, changing all text to red is a proven way to double conversions."

### Step-by-Step Application:

**Step 1: Analyze the Argument**
- The statement claims that changing the landing page text to bright red led to doubled conversions for one client and therefore suggests that this change is a proven way to double conversions for all.

**Step 2: Feature Identification**
- The argument makes a general claim based on a specific instance.
- It might imply a causal relationship between changing the text color and the conversion rate increase.

**Step 3: Match with Known Types**
- Given features suggest potential matches with:
  - <G> (Generalization): Because it is making a general claim based on specific evidence (one client).
  - <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis): Because it suggests a causal relationship that may not be compelling or proven.

**Step 4: Determine the Defective Argument Type**
- To specify the type, consider the primary defect: 
  - The statement generalizes the effect observed in one instance (one client) to a broader context (all situations). 
  - It does not offer a compelling proof that changing text color universally leads to doubled conversions.

This indicates a primary characterization as:
- **<G> (Generalization)** for making a broad claim based on one specific example.

**Step 5: Justify the Identification**
- Rationale: The argument assumes that because one instance of changing text color to red led to higher conversions, the same will happen universally. This generalization is made without sufficient evidence or broader proof, fitting the definition of <G> (Generalization).

**Output:** <G>

<code>
Therefore, the statement "One of our clients doubled their conversions after changing all their landing page text to bright red. Therefore, changing all text to red is a proven way to double conversions." is identified as <G> (Generalization).
