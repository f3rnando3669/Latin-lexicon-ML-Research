To identify the type of defective argument present in the string "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today." using the structured approach defined as <IDAA>, let's decompose the task step by step:

**Step 1:** Read and understand the string:

- String is: "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today."

**Step 2:** Identify the key claim or proposition:

- The key claim is: "You were not in class today."
- The implicit proposition seems to be: "Good people attend class."

**Step 3:** Analyze the reasoning or evidence provided:

- The reasoning given is: "I thought you were a good person, but since you weren’t in class today, I question that."

**Step 4:** Match the identified reasoning or evidence with the types of defective arguments:

- The reasoning here does not directly pertain to the factors determining a person's goodness. The argument assumes that being absent from class negates being a good person, which is not logically compelling.
- This type of reasoning seems to not logically support the proposition. Therefore, it fits best with:
  - **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason):** A defective argument providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.

**Step 5:** Confirm the matching by checking the key characteristics of the defective argument types:

- <IR> provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition: "I thought you were a good person." This judgment is based solely on attendance, which is not a sound criterion for moral character.
- The connection between class attendance and personal goodness is weak and non-causal.

Thus, analyzing the string "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today." identifies it as an **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)** defective argument type.
