### Application of IDAA to the Given String

Given the string <s>: "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you."

We will apply the structured decomposition methodology (IDAA) to identify the type of defective argument in this string.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

**Step 1: Understand the Proposition**
- Main claim: "I’m not going to talk to you."
- Reason given: "My best friend says you’re a liar."

**Step 2: Identify the Reasoning**
- The reasoning is based on an appeal to the authority or belief of the speaker’s best friend.

**Step 3: Match with Definitions**
- **Generalization (<G>)**: Not a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not a case of listing fewer or more options.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Could be potentially relevant, as the reason provided doesn’t logically align with the action of not talking.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: The reason isn’t saying the same thing in other words.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Possibly relevant, as the reason (best friend's claim) isn't a compelling enough basis to stop talking to someone.
- **False Universals (<FU>)**: Not asserting a universal agreement point.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Not using a dual-interpretation statement.

**Step 4: Evaluate Fit**
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: The reason "because my best friend says you’re a liar" doesn’t logically support the decision not to talk to someone. It’s more about the action based on a personal opinion without substantial evidence.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The assertion that the friend's opinion is a weak cause of the decision to stop talking may also fit.

**Step 5: Conclusion**
- Based on the available definitions, the string <s> fits best with **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)** because the reason provided ("My best friend says you’re a liar") doesn’t logically support the resulting proposition ("I’m not going to talk to you").

Therefore, the defective argument type represented here is:

**<IR>**: Inappropriate Reason

The reasoning provided is not logically sufficient to support the conclusion drawn by the speaker.
