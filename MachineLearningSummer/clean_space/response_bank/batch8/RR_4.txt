For 
Let's apply the decomposition method (<D>) to identify the type of defective argument in the statement "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there."

**Step 1: Analyze the Argument**

- **Statement (<s>)**: "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there."
- **Main Proposition**: The restaurant is popular.
- **Supporting Reason**: Everyone in town goes there.

**Step 2: Categorize the Argument**

We need to compare the statement against the defined categories of defective arguments:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Says the same thing as the proposition but in other words.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Offers a reason that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
- **False Universals (<FU>)**: Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Uses statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.

**Step 3: Assess Feature Characteristics**

Let's assess the features of the argument in the statement.

- **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument is not stating a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not list fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided seems to support the proposition but might be questionable.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: The reason provided appears to be saying the same thing as the proposition.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal relationship seems undeniable but also weak as it might not sufficiently explain popularity.
- **False Universals (<FU>)**: There is a hint of universality by assuming everyone’s attendance as the reason for popularity.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: There doesn’t seem to be ambiguity or dual interpretation.

**Step 4: Make a Decision**

This statement suggests that the popularity of the restaurant is because "everyone in town goes there," which restates the concept of popularity itself (people going there = popularity). This falls under the category of **Redundant Reason (<RR>)** because it is essentially repeating the same idea in different words.

Thus, based on the assessment, it is concluded that the statement "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there" represents a **Redundant Reason** argument type (<RR>).
