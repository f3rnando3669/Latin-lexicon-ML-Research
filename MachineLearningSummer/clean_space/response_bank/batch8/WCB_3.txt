For 
Let's apply the structured approach defined as **<IDAA>** to the argument: **"I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick."**

### Step-by-Step Application of <D> to <IDA> (<IDAA>)

#### Step 1: Argument Identification
- **Read and Comprehend**
  - Argument string <s>: "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick."
  - Identify the premise: "I drank bottled water and now I am sick."
  - Identify the conclusion: "The water must have made me sick."

#### Step 2: Argument Type Recognition
- **Recognize the Characteristic Features**
  - The argument assumes a direct causal relationship between drinking bottled water and getting sick.
  - The argument does not consider any other possible causes for the sickness.

#### Step 3: Validation
- **Verify the Identified Argument and Cross-check**
  - <G>: Generalization doesn't fit because it's not claiming a general truth from a specific instance.
  - <FE>: False Enumeration doesn’t fit because it’s not listing too few or too many options.
  - <IR>: Inappropriate Reason doesn’t fit because the reason given (drank bottled water) is directly related to the conclusion (getting sick), even if it's flawed.
  - <RR>: Redundant Reason doesn’t fit because the statement is not restating the proposition in different words.
  - <WCB>: Weak Causal Basis fits because the argument offers a weak causal link without sufficient evidence to determine that drinking the bottled water is what caused the sickness.
  - <FU>: False Universals doesn’t fit because the argument isn't asserting a universally agreed-upon point.
  - <DEP>: Double-Edged Phrases doesn’t fit because the statement isn’t open to dual interpretations that work against the speaker.

Upon validation, we confirm that the fallacy used in the statement is **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**. The argument assumes the water caused the sickness without sufficient evidence to support this causal link, ignoring other possible reasons for getting sick.

### Conclusion
The type of defective argument in the provided string:
**"I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick."**
is identified as **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
