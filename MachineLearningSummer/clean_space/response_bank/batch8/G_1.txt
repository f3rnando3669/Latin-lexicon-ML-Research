For 
Let's apply the decomposition breakdown (IDAA) to identify the defective argument type in the given string:

String (s): "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!"

### Step 1: Understand the argument
- Proposition: The 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty.
- Supporting reason: The Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up.

### Step 2: Classify the argument type
Here's a recap of the possible defective argument types:
- **Generalization (<G>)**
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
- **False Universals (<FU>)**
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**

### Step 3: Match with specific examples
- **Generalization (<G>)**: This seems to be making a broad claim (guilt of an individual neighbor) based on an instance involving a larger group (the Catholic Church's involvement in a scandal).

### Step 4: Apply the definition
- **Generalization**: As defined, this defective argument type claims a general truth based on a specific instance. 
- In this case, the argument suggests that because the Catholic Church (a specific instance of misconduct) was involved in a cover-up, the individual (specific neighbor) is guilty as well. This applies the misconduct of the organization broadly to include the individual without specific proof against them.

### Step 5: Verify consistency
- The argument indeed fits the pattern of making a broad claim about an individual's guilt based on the actions of a larger group to which the individual belongs. It doesn't logically prove the individual's guilt, rather it incorrectly extends the guilt by association.

### Conclusion:
The defective argument type represented here is **Generalization (<G>)**.
