For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong," we will follow the detailed steps laid out for identifying defective argument types systematically.

### Applying <IDAA> to "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong":

1. **Initial Reading**: "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong."
   - Read and understand the statement.

2. **Identify Components**:
   - Proposition: The statement is urging to "Get Verizon."
   - Reason: "1 billion people can't be wrong."
   - The implicit argument is that because 1 billion people use Verizon, it must be a good choice.

3. **Comparison**: Compare these components with the characteristics of the defective argument types:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: This does not appear to generalize based on a specific instance.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: This is not about the number of options.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: The reason given ("1 billion people can't be wrong") does not logically support the inherent value of Verizon based on its merits alone.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: This is not saying the same thing in different words.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reason does not inadequately support the proposition.
   - **False Universals (<FU>)**: This appeals to popularity or widespread usage as a form of validation (the "bandwagon effect").
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: This is not characterized by dual interpretations.

4. **Match and Validate**: The statement aligns strongly with **False Universals (<FU>)**. It uses the fact that many people use Verizon as a reason to validate the notion that it must be a good choice, appealing to popularity.

5. **Label**: Assign the label **<FU>**.

Thus, the statement "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong." falls under the defective argument type False Universals **<FU>**.
