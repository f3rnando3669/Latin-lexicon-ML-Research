To identify the type of defective argument in the phrase, "Ninety percent of all people surveyed said that McDonald's is better than Burger King so it must be true," we follow the decomposition approach systematically:

### Step-by-Step Application of IDAA:

1. **Understand the Argument**:
   - The argument claims that McDonald's is better than Burger King based on a survey result.

2. **Initial Categorization**:
   - The claim is based on a statistical survey and draws a conclusion about truth based on the survey results.

3. **Mapping to Defective Argument Types**:

   - **Generalization (G)**:
     - This argument doesn't seem to be making a broad generalization based on a specific instance. Instead, it relies on survey data.
   
   - **False Enumeration (FE)**:
     - The argument is not limiting or exaggerating the number of options available; it talks about the quality comparison based on survey results.

   - **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**:
     - The reason given (survey result) aligns logically to an extent with the proposition (McDonald's is better), but it may not be a strong enough basis to determine truthfulness objectively.
   
   - **Redundant Reason (RR)**:
     - The argument does not simply restate the proposition; it gives a rationale based on survey data.
   
   - **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**:
     - The reason given (survey results) may not be compelling enough to prove the truth of the proposition definitively.
   
   - **False Universals (FU)**:
     - The argument does not assert a universally agreed point without proof; instead, it references survey results.
     
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**:
     - There is no use of statements open to dual interpretations here.
   
4. **Comparison and Matching**:
   - The argument implies that survey results (opinion) should be accepted as truth regarding the better quality of McDonald's, which seems to align best with the definition of Weak Causal Basis (WCB).

5. **Identify the Defective Argument**:
   - The defective argument type that most accurately matches the argument in `<s>` is **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**.

6. **Review and Confirmation**:
   - Cross-checking with examples of Weak Causal Basis, the argument fits because it assumes that the survey result is sufficient proof to declare an absolute truth, which is not compelling enough.

7. **Documentation**:
   - Document the finding: The phrase "Ninety percent of all people surveyed said that McDonald's is better than Burger King so it must be true." is identified as having a Weak Causal Basis (WCB) because it relies on survey data to establish an absolute truth, which is not sufficient as proof.

Therefore, applying the IDAA approach, the phrase represents the **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)** fallacy.
