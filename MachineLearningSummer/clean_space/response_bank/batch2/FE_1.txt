For 
To apply the IDAA methodology to the argument "We either ban hairspray or the world will end," we need to break down the task of identifying the defective argument type into specific steps. Let's go through these steps systematically:

### Step 1: Understand the Argument
- **Proposition**: The world will end unless we ban hairspray.
- **Supporting Reason**: The only way to avoid the end of the world is to ban hairspray.

### Step 2: Identify Key Features
- Notice the structure of the argument presents two extreme options: either ban hairspray or face the end of the world.
- The argument suggests there are no other possible solutions or middle grounds.

### Step 3: Compare Against Definitions
- **<G> (Generalization)**: This argument does not seem to be making a broad claim based on specific instances.
- **<FE> (False Enumeration)**: The argument does present a limited number of options (two in this case: ban hairspray or the world ends), which suggests it might be listing fewer options than actually exist.
- **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**: The reason provided is not immediately irrelevant to the proposition, but perhaps oversimplified.
- **<RR> (Redundant Reason)**: The argument is not restating the proposition in different words.
- **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**: There is no detailed weak cause presented but rather an assumed drastic consequence.
- **<FU> (False Universals)**: There is no universally agreed point asserted without proof.
- **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)**: The argument does not seem to use ambiguous statements with dual interpretations.

### Step 4: Determine the Most Likely Type
- The argument structure best matches **<FE> (False Enumeration)**, since it presents a limited choice of actions without considering other possible solutions, i.e., it assumes only two options exist: banning hairspray or facing the end of the world.

### Step 5: Verification
- Re-checking the argument, the crux is indeed the oversimplification into a binary choice without justifying why no other solutions might prevent the end of the world. This limited enumeration fits the definition of **False Enumeration**.

### Conclusion
By applying <IDAA>, the argument "We either ban hairspray or the world will end" is identified as an example of **<FE> (False Enumeration)**. This defective argument type fits the pattern of presenting fewer options than actually exist, suggesting a false dichotomy.
