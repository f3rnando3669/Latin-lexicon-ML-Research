For 
To apply the **IDAA (Application of Decomposition to Identifying Defective Argument)** approach to the given string, "Annie must like Starbucks because all white girls like Starbucks," let's break down the task step by step:

### Step 1: Read and understand the string.
The string is: "Annie must like Starbucks because all white girls like Starbucks."

### Step 2: Identify the claim or assertion.
The main claim or assertion here is: "Annie must like Starbucks."

### Step 3: Determine the type of reasoning or evidence used.
The evidence or reasoning provided for the claim is: "all white girls like Starbucks."

### Step 4: Match the identified reasoning to known defective argument types.
Let's consider the characteristics of each defective argument type:
- **Generalization (G)**: Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (FE)**: Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**: Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- **Redundant Reason (RR)**: Saying the same thing as the proposition but in other words.
- **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**: Offering a reason that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
- **False Universals (FU)**: Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**: Using statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.

Based on the reasoning, "all white girls like Starbucks" is making a broad general statement to support the claim about Annie.

### Step 5: Confirm the match by evaluating specific characteristics.
The argument is making a generalization about "all white girls" to make a claim about an individual (Annie). There is no specific evidence provided about Annie herself; instead, a broad stereotype is being leveraged.

This matches the characteristics of a **Generalization (G)**: Claiming a general truth (all white girls like Starbucks) based on a specific instance or a stereotype.

### Step 6: Report the identified type.
The identified defective argument type is **Generalization (G)**.

### Conclusion:
By applying the IDAA process to the string "Annie must like Starbucks because all white girls like Starbucks," we have identified that it is an example of **Generalization (G)**.
