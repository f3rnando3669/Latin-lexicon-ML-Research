For 
To identify the type of defective argument in the string "It is warmer this year in Las Vegas as compared to last year; therefore, global warming is rapidly accelerating" using the process of <IDAA>, we will break down the task into specific steps as defined. 

### Steps to Perform <IDAA> on the Given String:

1. **Initial Assessment of <s>**:
    - **Goal**: Understand the context and content of the statement.
    - **Action**: Carefully read and analyze the given string.

    Statement: "It is warmer this year in Las Vegas as compared to last year; therefore, global warming is rapidly accelerating."

2. **Categorization by Keywords or Phrases**:
    - **Goal**: Determine which category the argument might fall into based on specific words or phrases.
    - **Action**: Identify any keywords or recurring phrases that may indicate a particular type of defective argument.

    Keywords: "warmer this year in Las Vegas," "global warming is rapidly accelerating."

3. **Comparison Against Definitions**:
    - **Goal**: Match the argument in <s> against the definitions of defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).
    - **Action**: Go through each type's definition and see which one fits best based on specific details in <s>.

    - **<G>** (Generalization): This type involves making a broad claim based on a single instance. The argument makes a broad statement about global warming based on the weather in a single location over a short period, which is indicative of generalization.
    
    - **<WCB>** (Weak Causal Basis): This type involves offering an insufficient reason for supporting a broad proposition. The argument uses the temperature change in one place over one year as a basis for a conclusion about global warming.

   Both <G> and <WCB> could potentially fit, but we need the next step to ensure the best match.

4. **Contextual Verification**:
    - **Goal**: Verify the categorization by considering the broader context of the argument.
    - **Action**: Ensure that the identified type truly reflects the argument's reasoning flaws within its context.
    
    The broader context suggests that using a single-year temperature comparison in one specific city (Las Vegas) to draw conclusions about global warming (a long-term global phenomenon) indeed feels like an overgeneralization from a limited data set.

5. **Final Identification**:
    - **Goal**: Conclusively identify the defective argument type.
    - **Action**: Make a final determination and label <s> accordingly with one of the defective argument types (e.g., <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

    Considering the details and context, the argument "It is warmer this year in Las Vegas as compared to last year; therefore, global warming is rapidly accelerating" is best categorized as <G> (Generalization).

6. **Explanation/Justification (Optional)**:
    - **Goal**: Justify why <s> was categorized as a particular defective argument.
    - **Action**: Provide a brief explanation of why the identified category fits <s>.

    **Explanation**: The statement "It is warmer this year in Las Vegas as compared to last year" is used to conclude that "global warming is rapidly accelerating." This is an overgeneralized conclusion drawn from a very limited data set (one city over one year), which fails to accurately reflect the broader and more complex phenomenon of global warming. Thus, it fits the <G> (Generalization) category.

### Conclusion:
The given string "It is warmer this year in Las Vegas as compared to last year; therefore, global warming is rapidly accelerating" has been identified as a <G> (Generalization) using the process of <IDAA>.
