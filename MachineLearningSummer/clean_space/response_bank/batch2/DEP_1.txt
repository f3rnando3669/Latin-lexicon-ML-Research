Sure! Let's apply the IDAA process to the statement: "If I tell my teacher I have done my homework, but I have only done part of it, I am using."

### Step-by-step Application of IDAA

1. **Read and Understand the Argument:**
   - The statement seems incomplete but suggests some form of misleading communication.
   - The main focus appears to be on a partial truth being given to the teacher.

2. **Identify Key Elements:**
   - Main claim: "If I tell my teacher I have done my homework."
   - Implicit claim: "I have only done part of it."
   - The proposition revolves around the idea of using a partial completion as evidence of full completion.

3. **Compare with Definitions:**
   - **Generalization (G):** Not applicable here as it's not a general truth from a specific instance.
   - **False Enumeration (FE):** This isn't about limited or excessive options.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (IR):** We're not looking at illogical reasoning supporting a claim here.
   - **Redundant Reason (RR):** This isn't a repetitive justification.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (WCB):** No weak causal relationship is being illustrated.
   - **False Universals (FU):** No universally accepted points without proof are presented.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP):** The statement does suggest a partial truth which can be misleading, and it potentially holds two interpretations — one that implies complete work and another that reveals incomplete work.

4. **Match with Defective Type:**
   - The argument's nature of implying something that isn’t wholly true but can be perceived multiple ways suggests it aligns with the concept of Double-Edged Phrases (DEP). A double-edged phrase entails the risk of interpretation in different ways, fitting the example's scenario of claiming partial truth.

5. **Conclude the Type:**
   - The defective argument type in this case is Double-Edged Phrases (DEP).

### Conclusion
By following the decomposition process, the defective argument for the provided statement is best categorized as Double-Edged Phrases (DEP) because the statement implies a partial truth that can be interpreted in two different ways.
