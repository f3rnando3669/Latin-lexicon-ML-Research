For 
Let's apply the IDAA methodology to identify the defective argument type of the string: "We cannot listen to John’s opinion on global warming because he is a tree hugger."

### Step-by-Step Application of IDAA:

1. **Step 1: Understand the Argument Types**
   - **<G>**: Generalization
   - **<FE>**: False Enumeration
   - **<IR>**: Inappropriate Reason
   - **<RR>**: Redundant Reason
   - **<WCB>**: Weak Causal Basis
   - **<FU>**: False Universals
   - **<DEP>**: Double-Edged Phrases

2. **Step 2: Analyze the Content of String <s>**
   - The content of the string is: "We cannot listen to John’s opinion on global warming because he is a tree hugger."

3. **Step 3: Identify Defining Features in <s>**
   - The phrase "because he is a tree hugger" is used as the reason for dismissing John’s opinion on global warming.

4. **Step 4: Match to Argument Type**
   - This statement is dismissing someone's opinion based on a derogatory label rather than addressing the merits of the opinion itself. The reason given ("he is a tree hugger") does not logically connect to the validity of his opinion on global warming.

5. **Step 5: Assign the Argument Type**
   - The type that best fits is **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**, because the reason provided does not logically support the proposition of not listening to John’s opinion.

**Result:** The string "We cannot listen to John’s opinion on global warming because he is a tree hugger." is an example of the defective argument type **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**.
