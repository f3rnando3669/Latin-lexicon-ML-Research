For 
Sure, let's apply the \( \langle \text{IDAA} \rangle \) process to the following argument:

"Don't listen to Mr. Fingers when he says walk in the hallways. How can you trust someone who wears bow ties?"

### Step 1: Understand the Proposition
   - **Main Proposition**: Do not listen to Mr. Fingers when he says to walk in the hallways.
   - **Supporting Statement**: Mr. Fingers wears bow ties, and this is presented as a reason not to trust him.

### Step 2: Identify Characteristics
   - The argument dismisses Mr. Fingers's advice based on his choice of clothing (wearing bow ties).
   - It does not provide a logical reason that connects the wearing of bow ties to the credibility of his advice about hallway walking.

### Step 3: Match with Definitions
   - This resembles an argument that provides an irrelevant reason for dismissing Mr. Fingers's advice. The choice of clothing does not logically relate to the trustworthiness or validity of his advice.
   - This matches the definition of \( \langle \text{IR} \rangle \) (Inappropriate Reason).

### Step 4: Identify the Type
   - The defective argument type is \( \langle IR \rangle \) (Inappropriate Reason).

### Step 5: Justify the Identification
   - The argument relies on Mr. Fingers's choice of wearing bow ties as a reason to question his advice on hallway behavior. However, the clothing choice is irrelevant to the credibility or relevance of his advice regarding walking in the hallways.

### Conclusion
By following these steps, we have identified that the string \( \langle s \rangle \) ("Don't listen to Mr. Fingers when he says walk in the hallways. How can you trust someone who wears bow ties?") is an instance of the defective argument type \( \langle IR \rangle \) (Inappropriate Reason). This shows how \( \langle IDAA \rangle \) can be systematically applied to identify defective arguments.
