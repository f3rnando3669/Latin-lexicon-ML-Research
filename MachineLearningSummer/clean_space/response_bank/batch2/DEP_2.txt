For 
To apply the process of Identification of Defective Arguments (IDAA) to the given string "The writer or speaker intentionally misleads the audience by using a word with a double or ambiguous meaning," we will follow the decomposition steps as defined.

### Given String

- **String <s>**: "The writer or speaker intentionally misleads the audience by using a word with a double or ambiguous meaning."

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

**Step 1: Identify the Assertion**

- **Assertion**: The writer or speaker intentionally misleads the audience.

**Step 2: Examine Reason Support**

- The reason provided: The writer or speaker uses a word with a double or ambiguous meaning.
- This reason denotes that the misleading is due to the dual interpretations of the word used.

**Step 3: Categorize the Defect**

- **Generalization (G)**: The argument does not suggest a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (FE)**: This isn't about listing options or choices.
- **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**: The reason provided does logically support the assertionâ€”using ambiguous words can indeed mislead.
- **Redundant Reason (RR)**: The reason is not simply a rephrasing of the assertion; it is an explanation.
- **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**: The reason provides a basis that can be compelling; ambiguous words can be misleading.
- **False Universals (FU)**: This argument does not assert a universally agreed point without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**: The given statement clearly states that the word used has a double or ambiguous meaning, leading to misleading the audience, fitting the definition of using statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.

Based on the definitions and the analysis:

- The defective argument type for the string <s> "The writer or speaker intentionally misleads the audience by using a word with a double or ambiguous meaning." fits **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**.

### Conclusion

Following the IDAA process, we determined that the argument type is **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases**. The statement describes the act of misleading through the use of ambiguous language that lends itself to dual interpretations.
