For 
To apply the methodology of Decomposition to Identifying Defective Argument (<IDAA>) to the statement "Every time I go to sleep the sun goes down. Therefore, my sleeping causes the sun to set.", we will follow the structured steps outlined for \( <D> \):

### Applying \( <IDAA> \) Step-by-Step:

1. **Data Input:** 
   - We receive the argument string:
     ```
     "Every time I go to sleep the sun goes down. Therefore, my sleeping causes the sun to set."
     ```

2. **Pre-Processing:**
   - **Parsing the statement:** 
     - Clause 1: "Every time I go to sleep the sun goes down."
     - Clause 2: "Therefore, my sleeping causes the sun to set."
   - **Identifying key phrases:** 
     - Key events: "I go to sleep" and "the sun goes down."
     - Causal claim: "my sleeping causes the sun to set."

3. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - **Analyzing Clauses:**
     - The first clause establishes a correlation between sleeping and the sun setting ("Every time I go to sleep the sun goes down").
     - The second clause makes a causal claim based on this correlation ("Therefore, my sleeping causes the sun to set").
   - **Matching Patterns with Known Defective Arguments:**
     - This seems to assert causation based on correlation.

4. **Classification:**
   - Based on the pattern of asserting causation from mere correlation, the argument fits the description of a Weak Causal Basis \( <WCB> \):
     - **Definition of \( <WCB> \):** A reason that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
     - **Application to the statement:** The statement provides a weak basis for the causal claim (correlation does not imply causation).

5. **Validation:**
   - **Cross-referencing the classification with definitions and examples:**
     - **Example of \( <WCB> \):** "I had a real bad headache, then saw my doctor. Just by talking with him, my headache started to subside, and I was all better the next day. It was well worth the $200 visit fee."
     - **Comparison:** Both argue a causal relationship based on mere temporal correlation.
   - **Confirming the statement fits \( <WCB> \):**
     - The classification of "Every time I go to sleep the sun goes down. Therefore, my sleeping causes the sun to set." as \( <WCB> \) is correct since it is based on a weak causal basis.

### Conclusion:
The statement "Every time I go to sleep the sun goes down. Therefore, my sleeping causes the sun to set." is classified as having a Weak Causal Basis (\( <WCB> \)). The argument suffers from making a causal claim based on mere correlation, a common defective argumentative technique.
