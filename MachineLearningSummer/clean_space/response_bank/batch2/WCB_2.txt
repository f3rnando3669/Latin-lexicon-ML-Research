For 
To apply the <IDAA> (Application of Decomposition to Identifying Defective Arguments) to the given statement "Since Anna Camacho became vice president of the parent-teacher association, student performance has declined and teacher morale is down. We on the school board believe that Camacho bears sole responsibility for the downtrend." we will follow the defined steps.

### Steps for Decomposing the Task of Identifying Defective Arguments (<IDAA>)

1. **Parse the Statement (<s>):**
   - **Subject:** "Anna Camacho"
   - **Predicate:** "became vice president of the parent-teacher association," "student performance has declined and teacher morale is down."
   - **Qualifiers:** "Since," "We on the school board believe that Camacho bears sole responsibility for the downtrend."

2. **Identify the Argument Type:**
   - Look for patterns or evidence that fit known defective argument types.

3. **Evaluation of Argument Structure:**
   - Assess the logical connection between Anna Camacho becoming vice president and the effects mentioned (decline in student performance and morale).

4. **Comparison with Argument Examples:**
   - Compare the logical pattern in the statement with the patterns of defective argument types.

5. **Classification:**
   - Assign the identified defective argument type based on the analysis.

### Application

**Given Statement (<s>):**
"Since Anna Camacho became vice president of the parent-teacher association, student performance has declined and teacher morale is down. We on the school board believe that Camacho bears sole responsibility for the downtrend."

**Execution of Steps:**

1. **Parse the Statement:**
   - Subject: "Anna Camacho"
   - Predicate: "became vice president of the parent-teacher association," "student performance has declined and teacher morale is down."
   - Qualifiers: "Since," "We on the school board believe that Camacho bears sole responsibility for the downtrend."

2. **Identify the Argument Type:**
   - The statement suggests a causal relationship between Anna Camacho becoming vice president and negative outcomes (decline in student performance and teacher morale) without concrete evidence of causality.

3. **Evaluation of Argument Structure:**
   - The statement lacks substantial evidence directly linking Camacho's new position to the negative outcomes. It makes a weak causal claim without strong support.

4. **Comparison with Argument Examples:**
   - The structure aligns with a **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**, as it implies causation without compelling evidence.

5. **Classification:**
   - The statement is classified as a **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)** defective argument.

### Conclusion

By following the <IDAA> process, the given statement "Since Anna Camacho became vice president of the parent-teacher association, student performance has declined and teacher morale is down. We on the school board believe that Camacho bears sole responsibility for the downtrend." is identified as a Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>) argument.
