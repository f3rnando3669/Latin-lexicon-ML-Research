For 
Sure, let's apply <IDAA> to the statement: "Everyone should like coffee: 95% of teachers do!"

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

**Step 1: Read the Statement:**
- "Everyone should like coffee: 95% of teachers do!"

**Step 2: Identify the Proposition:**
- The main claim is that "Everyone should like coffee."

**Step 3: Analyze the Reasoning:**
- The reasoning provided is that 95% of teachers like coffee.

**Step 4: Match the Reasoning to Defective Argument Types:**
- **Generalization (<G>):** Does the claim make a general truth based on a specific instance?
  - Yes, the statement is generalized by using a specific instance (teachers) to make a broader claim (everyone).

- **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Does it list fewer or more options than exist?
  - No, this concept does not apply here.

- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Is the reason logically supportive of the proposition?
  - The reasoning (95% of teachers like coffee) does not provide a pertinent logical basis for why everyone should like coffee. Therefore, it could fit as <IR>.

- **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Is the reasoning just a rephrasing of the claim?
  - No, the reasoning presents statistical data rather than rephrasing the claim.

- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Is the offering reason not compelling enough to support the claim?
  - The reasoning might not be compelling, but it logically supports the claim in a weak manner. Therefore, it does not fit perfectly here.

- **False Universals (<FU>):** Does it assert universally agreed points without proof?
  - The statement does not assert a universally agreed point; rather, it uses minor evidence to generalize universally. This doesnâ€™t fit perfectly here.

- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Is the statement open to dual interpretations?
  - No, this concept does not apply here.

**Step 5: Identify the Type:**
- The statement best fits <G> (Generalization) because it attempts to claim a universal truth based on a specific subset (teachers).

**Step 6: Validate the Identification:**
- By reviewing the identified type, we see that the claim generalizes from the specific example of teachers to everyone, fitting the definition of <G>.

### Conclusion

The identified defective argument type for the statement "Everyone should like coffee: 95% of teachers do!" is **Generalization (<G>)**.
