For 
To apply <IDAA> to the argument "You need to go to the party with me, otherwise you’ll just be bored at home," we will follow the decomposed steps previously defined for identifying the defective argument type. 

### Step 1: Understand the Argument
Read and comprehend the argument provided in the string:

- **Proposition:** "You need to go to the party with me."
- **Supporting Reason:** "Otherwise, you’ll just be bored at home."

### Step 2: Identify Key Components
Identify the core proposition and supporting reason:

- **Core Claim:** The necessity of going to the party.
- **Supporting Reason:** The alternative to going to the party is being bored at home, implying a lack of other options.

### Step 3: Compare with Argument Types
Compare the identified components with each defective argument type (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>):

1. **<G> (Generalization):** Not making a broad claim based on a specific instance.
2. **<FE> (False Enumeration):** Typically lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
3. **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason):** Doesn't seem to provide a reason not logically supporting the proposition.
4. **<RR> (Redundant Reason):** Not saying the same thing as the proposition in other words.
5. **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis):** The reason is not compelling enough, but the issue seems more about presenting fewer options.
6. **<FU> (False Universals):** Not asserting universally agreed points without proof.
7. **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases):** Not using statements open to dual interpretations.

### Step 4: Match and Classify
**Match with <FE> (False Enumeration):** 

- The argument presents a false dichotomy, implying that there are only two available options: going to the party or being bored at home. It overlooks other possible options, such as staying at home and finding another activity to do, going somewhere else, or inviting friends over.

Thus, the argument most closely resembles an example of **False Enumeration (<FE>)** due to its limited enumeration of the available options.

### Classification:
- **Defective Argument Type:** <FE> (False Enumeration)

### Conclusion
The argument "You need to go to the party with me, otherwise you’ll just be bored at home," when decomposed using <IDAA>, is identified as an example of False Enumeration (<FE>).
