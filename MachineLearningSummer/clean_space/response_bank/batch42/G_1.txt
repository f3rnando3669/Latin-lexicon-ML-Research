For 
To apply the definition of IDAA to the string "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!", we will follow a step-by-step decomposition of the task (D).

### Step 1: Identify the proposition (P) and reason (R)
- **Proposition (P):** "My 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well."
- **Reason (R):** "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up."

### Step 2: Determine if the argument is defective
Applying each defective argument type (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP) to see which one fits:

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - Generalization is about applying characteristics of a subset to the entire group. The string insinuates all Catholics, represented by the neighbor, are guilty because of a scandal involving the Church.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - This involves missing out on other possibilities. The string isn't suggesting a limited number of possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - Inconclusive Reason means the reason doesn't conclusively back the proposition. The reason here is based on a specific instance and doesn't conclusively show the neighbor's guilt, but this isn't the primary fallacy type.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - Insufficient Causal Basis involves weak causal connections. Here, the causal basis is indeed weak, but the defect seems more about overgeneralization.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - This involves repeating the proposition in the reason without adding anything new. This doesn’t apply here as the proposition and reason are not the same.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - This applies to assuming the truth because it’s universally agreed. This doesn’t fit our case.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - This involves language that can be interpreted differently than intended. The language here is not ambiguous.

### Step 3: Classification of the defect
- The proposition states an absolute guilt based on a generalization from specific events (the scandal).
- This fits the pattern of **Generalization (G)**, where the guilt of the Catholic neighbor is deduced solely based on the larger group's (the Church's) actions.

### Conclusion
The classification of the string "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!" is:
- **<G>: Generalization** 

Thus, following the IDAA approach, we have determined that the argument type is a Generalization, represented as <G>.
