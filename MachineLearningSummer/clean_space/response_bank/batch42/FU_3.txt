For 
To apply the task <IDAA> to the string "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding." we need to decompose the advanced task <IDA> into specific steps (<D>), then carry out these steps to classify the string.

### Decomposition of <IDA> into Steps (<D>):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) in the string.**
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>) presented in the string.**
3. **Evaluate if the Reason is conclusively supporting the Proposition.**
4. **Check for any resemblance to the defective argument types:**
   - Generalization (<G>)
   - Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
   - Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
   - Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
   - Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
   - Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)

### Applying the Steps to the Given String:
#### 1. Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- **String:** "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding."
- **Proposition (<P>)**: "I wasn't speeding."

#### 2. Identify the Reason (<R>) presented in the string.
- **Reason (<R>)**: "I was only driving as fast as everyone around me."

#### 3. Evaluate if the Reason is conclusively supporting the Proposition.
- To determine if the Reason conclusively supports the Proposition, we need to check if driving as fast as everyone around implies not speeding. Since the speed limit is independent of the speed of surrounding traffic, this Reason does not conclusively support the Proposition.

#### 4. Check for any resemblance to the defective argument types.
- **Generalization (<G>)**: Not applicable. There is no generalization based on a sample applied to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not applicable. The string does not enumerate incomplete possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Applicable. The Reason does not convincingly demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition. Just because others are driving at the same speed does not mean one is not speeding.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Not applicable. This is more about weak causality than inconclusive reasoning.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Not applicable. The Reason is not a repetition of the Proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Applicable. The Reason relies on the assumption that if everyone is doing it, it should be correct, which is an appeal to popularity.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Not applicable. The language is not ambiguous or subject to multiple interpretations.

### Conclusion
The string "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding." exhibits elements of both <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus). The Reason provided does not logically conclude that the speaker was not speeding, and it leans on the notion that following others' actions justifies the correctness of one's own action.

### Classification
The string is of type **<IR>** and **<FU>**.
