For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "People either like coffee or hate it," we must decompose the advanced task <IDA> into specific steps, and then carry out these steps to classify the string. Here is a step-by-step decomposition for <D>, followed by the application of these steps to the string "People either like coffee or hate it."

**Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D> of <t>):**

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Determine the main assertion or claim made in the string.
2. **Analyze the Reason (<R>):** Look for any causal basis or reasoning provided to support the proposition.
3. **Check for Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Verify if there are any additional arguments or evidence given to corroborate the reason.
4. **Compare the Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** Check if the proposition is a generalization based on a part or majority but applied to all.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Check if the proposition claims to cover all possibilities but misses some.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Check if the reason provided is inconclusive in demonstrating the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Check if the causal basis for the reason is weak or uncompelling.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Check if the reason merely repeats what the proposition states.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Check if the proof of reason assumes universal agreement on a matter still in dispute.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Check if the proof of reason can be taken in another sense than intended.

5. **Classify the String:** Based on the analyses from steps 1 through 4, classify the string as one of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>).

**Applying <IDAA> to "People either like coffee or hate it":**

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition: "People either like coffee or hate it."

2. **Analyze the Reason (<R>):**
   - The string does not contain a specific reason or causal basis for the proposition.

3. **Check for Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - There is no additional argument or evidence given to corroborate a reason.

4. **Compare the Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (G):** The proposition does not assert something about all based on a part; rather, it presents an either/or scenario.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The proposition presents only two possibilities, ignoring other possible stances (e.g., people who are indifferent to coffee or have mixed feelings).
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** No reasoning is provided, so this does not apply.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** No causal basis is provided, so this does not apply.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** No repetition is observed, so this does not apply.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** No appeal to universal agreement is made, so this does not apply.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Language use is straightforward with no ambiguity.

5. **Classify the String:**
   - The string "People either like coffee or hate it" is best classified as an **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** because it presents a limited and incomplete list of possibilities, ignoring other potential responses to coffee.

Thus, the string "People either like coffee or hate it." is classified as type <FE>.
