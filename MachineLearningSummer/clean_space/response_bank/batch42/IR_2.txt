For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument type into specific steps) to the statement "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you," follow these steps:

1. **Extract Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>)**:
   - Analyze the statement to identify what is the assertion or claim being made (<P>).
   - Identify the Reason (<R>) provided to support the assertion.

2. **Determine the Type of Defective Argument**:
   - Run through the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) and see which one fits the pattern of the argument given.

Here's the detailed breakdown:

### Step 1: Extract Proposition and Reason
- **Proposition (<P>)**: "I’m not going to talk to you."
- **Reason (<R>)**: "My best friend says you’re a liar."

### Step 2: Determine the Type of Defective Argument
- **<G> (Generalization)**: The statement does not generalize from a part to a whole.
- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: The statement does not present a false dichotomy or incomplete set of options.
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: Check if the Reason provided conclusively supports the Proposition.
  - Analysis: The Reason provided ("My best friend says you’re a liar") does not conclusively demonstrate that the Proposition ("I’m not going to talk to you") is correct, because the friend's opinion alone isn't sufficient proof of the person's character or actions.
  - Match: The Reason is inconclusive.
- **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: The Reason is not merely a repetition of the Proposition.
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: Check if the Reason provides a compelling causal basis for the Proposition.
  - Analysis: The Reason ("My best friend says you’re a liar") is an opinion and not a compelling causal explanation for why the person should not be spoken to; thus, it is insufficient.
  - Not a perfect match.
- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: Check if the Reason assumes a consensus on the basis of popularity without proof.
  - Analysis: No assumption of universal agreement; thus, not applicable.
- **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: The statement does not involve ambiguity.

### Conclusion:
The statement fits best with **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** because the Reason provided ("My best friend says you’re a liar") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition ("I’m not going to talk to you").

Therefore, the classification of the argument "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you." is **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**.
