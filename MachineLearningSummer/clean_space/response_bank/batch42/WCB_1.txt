For 
To classify the string "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far." according to the defective argument types defined, we will perform the task IDAA, which is the application of decomposition to the task of identifying the argument type. Let’s break it down step by step.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (Task IDAA)

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P) and Reason (R)**
- **Proposition (P):** Outcomes or events stated to be demonstrated or proved.
  - In this case, the Proposition (P) is implied: "Donald Trump got elected."
- **Reason (R):** The causal explanation given to support the proposition (P).
  - The stated Reason (R) here is: "because liberals took political correctness too far."

**Step 2: Determine if the Reason (R) is conclusive**
- Examine whether the Reason (R) provided conclusively establishes the truth of the Proposition (P).

**Step 3: Compare with Defective Argument Types**
- **Generalization (G):** Not applicable here as the Proposition isn’t based on the behavior of individuals generalizing to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This is not about enumerating all possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The Reason here may not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition. Is it clear that the reason provided directly explains the outcome without ambiguity?
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Check if the causal basis is compelling enough. Could there be other factors not considered?
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The Proposition and Reason are distinct, so this is not applicable.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The Reason does not rely on assuming consensus.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language issue is not about ambiguity here but more about whether the reason is strong and directly related.

**Step 4: Make the Conclusion**

Let's apply this decomposition to the specific string.

### Analysis

1. **Proposition (P):** "Donald Trump got elected."
2. **Reason (R):** "because liberals took political correctness too far."

**Evaluating the Reason (R):**

- The Reason given is that "liberals took political correctness too far."
  
In terms of a compelling and sufficient causal basis:

- This Reason does not seem to provide a sufficiently compelling causal link. The election outcome can be attributed to a multitude of complex factors, including economic concerns, campaign strategies, voter demographics, etc. The given Reason (R) oversimplifies the matter and does not cover all the necessary grounds to conclusively prove the Proposition. 

### Conclusion

The provided Reason (R) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition (P). Therefore, the most appropriate classification for the argument type is:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**

So, based on the decomposition and analysis, the string "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far." represents the argument type **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**.
