For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string provided, we need to decompose the advanced task of classifying the string into logical fallacy types into specific analytical steps. 

Let's outline the steps for the decomposition <D>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine what the primary assertion or claim is.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Establish the causal basis provided for the Proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Analyze any additional arguments that support the Reason.
4. **Check for Defective Argument Types**: Determine if any of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) apply.

Now, let's break down and apply these steps to the given string:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**
    - **Speaker 1:** "We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change."
        - Proposition: "We are using thousands of people to help spread the word about social injustice and the need for change."
    - **Speaker 2:** "Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."
        - Proposition: "I can’t be a part of this because it’s wrong to use people."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**
    - **Speaker 2:** 
        - Reason: "I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."

3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**
    - There is no additional argument provided that specifically supports the Reason. The Reason alone is presented as the basis for the Proposition.

4. **Check for Defective Argument Types**
    - **Generalization (G)**: Not applicable in this context as there aren't assertions made about all individuals based on a part.
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable since no enumeration of possibilities is provided.
    - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This applies because the reason provided (that it’s wrong to use people) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition (that Speaker 2 cannot be a part of the movement). The definition of "using people" might differ in context, and the reason “I was always been taught that...” is subjective.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Somewhat related to IR, but here the focus is more on the relevance of the reason. In this case, the causal link is weak, but IR is more directly applicable.
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Not applicable because <R> is not mere repetition of <P>.
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Not applicable as the argument doesn’t rely on the presumption that everyone agrees.
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Not directly applicable, although there may be some ambiguity about the meaning of "using people." However, it's not the primary issue here.

Based on the analysis, the string "Speaker 1: We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change. Speaker: Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people." is best classified as an **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**.

## Final Classification:
- **Defective Argument Type:** <IR>
- **Logical Fallacy Represented:** Inconclusive Reason
