For 
To apply <IDAA>—the decomposition of the classification task of identifying logical fallacies—let's proceed step-by-step to determine the type of defective argument in the given string "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people."

### Decomposition of Task (D) (Step by Step Analysis):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
    - Proposition: "We need to fix our broken judicial system."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
    - Reason: "[We can fix it] by electing new people."

3. **Evaluate the Proposition and Reason:**
    - Does the Reason effectively and conclusively support the Proposition? The Reason here is very vague and does not offer any substantial or specific causal link to how electing new people will fix the judicial system.

4. **Check for Logical Fallacies:**
    - <G> Generalization: There is no explicit indication that a generalized assertion is being made about the entirety based on a small part.
    - <FE> Incomplete Enumeration: The sentence doesn't enumerate possibilities but rather suggests a specific action.
    - <IR> Inconclusive Reason: Yes, the Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition. It fails to show a concrete causal link.
    - <RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition: The Reason is not simply repeating the Proposition.
    - <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis: The Reason given is weak and doesn't provide a compelling causal basis.
    - <FU> Presumptuous Consensus: There is no appeal to popularity or consensus in the argument.
    - <DEP> Ambiguous Language Use: There's no ambiguous language that can be misinterpreted in the given context.

### Step-by-Step Execution of IDAA:

1. **Step 1: Break Down the Argument:**
    - Proposition: "We need to fix our broken judicial system."
    - Reason: "[We do so] by electing new people."

2. **Step 2: Consider defects in the Reasoning:**
    - The Reason does not demonstrably support the Proposition with a solid causal link.
    - The Reason is vague and lacks compelling evidence that electing new people will definitively fix the judicial system.

3. **Step 3: Compare with Fallacy Types:**
    - The sentence fits the pattern of an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the reasoning offered for the Proposition does not conclusively demonstrate its correctness.
    - The Reason also has elements of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, given the weak and non-compelling nature of the Basis provided.

4. **Step 4: Final Classification:**
    - The most accurate classification of the fallacy in this argument is **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** due to the weak connection between the Reason and the Proposition.

### Conclusion:

The logical fallacy represented here is:
**Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

The Reason provided is not convincing enough to substantiate the Proposition that electing new people will fix the judicial system.
