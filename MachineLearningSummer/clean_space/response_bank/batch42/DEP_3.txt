For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "I see nobody on the road," said Alice. "I only wish I had such eyes," the king remarked..."To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why it's as much as I can do to see real people, by this light.", we need to classify the string as one of the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>. We will decompose the task step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>) for <IDA>:


1. **Identify the Key Proposition (P)**:
   - The central proposition is that Alice sees "nobody" on the road.

2. **Interpret the Reason (R)**:
   - The King's reasoning is based on the literal interpretation of "nobody" as a person named "Nobody."

3. **Evaluate if the Reason (R) Supports Proposition (P)**:
   - Determine whether the reasoning (seeing Nobody at a distance) correctly supports the assertion that Alice sees nobody in a figurative sense (meaning no person).

4. **Identify the Type of Defective Argument**:
   - Classify the argument using <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP> based on the previous steps.

### Application of <D>:

1. **Identify the Key Proposition (P)**:
   - "I see nobody on the road," said Alice.

2. **Interpret the Reason (R)**:
   - The King's comment: "To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why it's as much as I can do to see real people, by this light."

3. **Evaluate if the Reason (R) Supports Proposition (P)**:
   - By "nobody," Alice means that no one is present on the road. The King humorously misinterprets "nobody" as a person named "Nobody" and marvels at the ability to see someone non-existent at a distance.

4. **Identify the Type of Defective Argument**:
   - The King's interpretation involves ambiguous language use where the term "nobody" can be taken in more than one sense - the intended sense (no person present) and the unintended (a person named Nobody).

   Therefore, the argument is an example of <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use).

### Final Classification:

The string "I see nobody on the road," said Alice. "I only wish I had such eyes," the king remarked..."To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why it's as much as I can do to see real people, by this light." is classified as <DEP> due to the ambiguity in the use of the word "nobody."
