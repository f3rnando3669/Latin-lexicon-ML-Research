For 
Let's apply the task of classifying the given string "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" into one of the defective argument types step by step. This will involve breaking down the string and analyzing it according to the definitions provided.

1. **Initial Classification:** Starting with an initial observation of the structure of the argument.
   - The string presents an **either/or** scenario, implying that there are only two possible options.

2. **Identify Propositions and Reasoning:**
   - **Proposition (P):** "You either support Hillary Clinton for President"
   - **Reason (R):** "or you don't believe in women's rights"

3. **Evaluate the Reason (R):**
   - The reason given here provides a dichotomous choice, suggesting a complete enumeration of possibilities.

4. **Check for Defects Based on Definitions:**
   - **Generalization (G):** This does not appear to be a generalization as it does not apply an attribute of a few to all.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** It is stating that there are only two options without considering other possibilities, which fits here. 
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Not directly, as it is not attacking the person but setting limited choices.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Not applicable here as it does not present a weak causal basis.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason does not repeat the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Not directly suggesting universal agreement but forcing a binary choice.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** No clear ambiguity detected.

5. **Selection of Most Suitable Defective Argument:**
   - The string presents an ***incomplete enumeration of possibilities*** since it restrictively suggests that there are only two choices regarding support for Hillary Clinton and belief in women's rights, without considering other nuanced positions.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The defective argument type for the given string is <FE>.

Thus, applying IDAA, we classify "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" as a defective argument of type **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**.
