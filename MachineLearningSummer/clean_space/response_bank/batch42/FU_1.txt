For 
To apply \( \langle \text{IDAA} \rangle \) (the task of decomposing the classification of a string into steps) to classify the statement "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong," we should follow a structured approach:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (\( \langle \text{D} \rangle \)):

1. **Identify the Proposition:** Determine what is being asserted or recommended in the statement.

2. **Identify the Reason:** Identify the reasoning given to support the proposition.

3. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types:** Compare the given reasoning against the defective argument types (\( \langle \text{G}, \text{FE}, \text{IR}, \text{RR}, \text{WCB}, \text{FU}, \text{DEP} \)) to classify the argument.

### Application of Decomposition (\( \langle \text{IDAA} \rangle \)):

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( \langle P \rangle \)):**
   - **Proposition:** "Get Verizon."

2. **Identify the Reason (\( \langle R \rangle \)):**
   - **Reason:** "1 billion people can't be wrong."

3. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types:**

   - **Generalization (\( \langle G \rangle \)):**
     - The statement is not a generalization of behaviors or qualities of a group to the whole group. It does not infer that all members of a group perform some action based on the actions of a subset.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (\( \langle FE \rangle \)):**
     - The statement does not enumerate all possible reasons for making a decision. It's stating a single reason, not claiming to provide an exhaustive list.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (\( \langle IR \rangle \)):**
     - The reasoning does not seem inconclusive on its face, but it appeals to the number of people as an argument.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( \langle WCB \rangle \)):**
     - The statement does not strive to establish a causal relationship between using Verizon and the high number of users.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( \langle RR \rangle \)):**
     - The reasoning provided is not simply repeating the proposition in different terms.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (\( \langle FU \rangle \)):**
     - **Match:** The statement assumes that because many people use Verizon, this is a definitive reason for everyone to choose Verizon. It appeals to popularity or the fact that many people are doing something to validate the claim.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (\( \langle DEP \rangle \)):**
     - The language in the statement is not ambiguous, so this type would not apply.

### Conclusion:
The statement "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong" fits the defective argument type called Presumptuous Consensus (\( \langle \text{FU} \rangle \)). It assumes that because many people believe or do something, it must be correct or valid. 

Thus, the classification \( \langle \text{IDA} \rangle \) of the statement "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong" is \( \langle \text{FU} \rangle \).
