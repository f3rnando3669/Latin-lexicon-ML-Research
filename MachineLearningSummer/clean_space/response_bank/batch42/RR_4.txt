For 
Sure, let's break down the advanced task of classifying the given string step by step (i.e., apply <IDAA>):

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>) 
Identify the main assertion or the proposition in the sentence.

**Proposition:**
"That restaurant is popular."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>) 
Identify the reason provided to support the proposition.

**Reason:**
"because everyone in town goes there."

### Step 3: Analyze the Reason against the Definition of Each Defective Argument
We will now test if the identified Reason fits any of the categories of defective arguments.

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - Not applicable. The proposition doesn't extend characteristics from a subset to the whole set.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Not applicable. No enumeration of options or possibilities is present.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Not primarily applicable. "Everyone in town goes there" doesn't directly undermine 'listening to Johnâ€™s opinion' type of example.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Not directly applicable. The causal link isn't weaker or anecdotal in this context.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - Not directly applicable. The Reason isn't just a repetition of the Proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - **Potential Example**. This suggests consensus ("everyone in town goes there") as validation.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - Not applicable. No ambiguous wording that can be taken in another sense.

### Step 4: Determine the Appropriate Defective Argument
From the above analysis, the Reason "because everyone in town goes there" suggests that the popularity of the restaurant is validated by an assumed consensus.

### Conclusion:
The correct classification (<IDA>) of the string "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there." is:

**<FU> - Presumptuous Consensus.**
