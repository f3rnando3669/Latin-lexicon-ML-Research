Sure, let's apply the defined process of <IDAA> to the string "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity." 

Firstly, let's break down the task (IDA) into steps (D):

1. **Identify** the Proposition (<P>):
   - Determine the primary assertion or claim being made.

2. **Identify** the Reason (<R>):
   - Determine the causal basis meant to support the Proposition.

3. **Classify** the argument type:
   - Determine which defective argument type (if any) is represented based on the definitions provided: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

Now, let's apply these steps to the given string:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition
**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**
- Look for the primary assertion in the given string.
- In this case, the primary assertion is: "Paranormal activity is real."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**
- Look for the causal basis intended to support the Proposition.
- In this case, the reason given is: "I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."

**Step 3: Classify the Argument Type**
- Compare the identified Reason and Proposition with the defective argument types provided.

### Comparison with Defective Argument Types
1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument does not generalize a majority experience to all instances, so it doesn't fit here.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not present a limited set of possibilities, so it doesn’t qualify here.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The provided reason may not conclusively prove the proposition, but we need to check other types to see if there’s a closer match.
4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Here, the Reason seems to repeat the Proposition using different words. "I have experienced paranormal activity" is a reiteration of "Paranormal activity is real" — it doesn't establish a different or new causal basis, just restates the claim.
5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis here doesn't directly connect logically to prove the proposition in a scientific way, but it isn't about insufficient causality as the core issue here.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: There isn't an appeal to universal agreement here.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The language used is quite direct and doesn't present ambiguity in different interpretations of terms.

### Conclusion
The closest match for the defective argument type is **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)** because the Reason essentially restates the Proposition without providing a new, independent causal basis.

Therefore, the string "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity" is classified as type <RR>.
