Sure, let's apply the task of classifying the string according to the types of defective arguments by decomposing the task into specific steps. 

**Step 1: Identify each component of the argument and determine if it falls into the categories of Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), or Proof of Reason (<PR>).**

The argument given is:
- "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being."
- "Fetuses are innocent human beings."
- "Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."

**Step 2: Identify the Proposition (<P>).**
- Here, the <P> is the conclusion: "Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."

**Step 3: Identify the Reason (<R>) supporting the Proposition.**
- The <R> provided for the proposition is: "Fetuses are innocent human beings."

**Step 4: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>) that corroborates the Reason.**
- The <PR> here is: "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being."

**Step 5: Evaluate each component to determine if they fall under any of the defective argument types defined.**

1. **Generalization (<G>):** Assess if the Proposition is a broad assertion.
   - No, the Proposition seems specific enough to fetuses and does not broadly generalize to other unrelated subjects.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Assess if the argument misses out pertinent possibilities.
   - No, the argument does not deal with enumeration of possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Assess if the Reason does not conclusively support the Proposition.
   - This step is crucial. The Reason "Fetuses are innocent human beings" may not conclusively support "Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses" because it assumes moral equivalence without further justification, raising the potential inclusion of a philosophical or ethical premise that is debatable.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Assess the causal link between Reason and Proposition.
   - Again, the Reason provided might be considered weak because it relies on implied assumptions rather than explicitly demonstrated causal relationships.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Assess if the Reason merely restates the Proposition.
   - No, the Reason and Proposition are not direct repetitions of each other.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Assess if the Proof of Reason assumes consensus on something still disputable.
   - Yes, the statement “It is immoral to kill an innocent human being” assumes a moral consensus which might not be universally agreed upon in the context of fetuses.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Assess if any part can be understood differently than intended.
   - No, the language seems quite direct without significant ambiguity.

**Step 6: Conclude the fallacy type.**

Combining the insights from Steps 5, the argument primarily falls under the following defective argument types:
- **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason) because the Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition without further philosophical or ethical backing.
- **<FU>** (Presumptuous Consensus) since the Proof of Reason assumes consensus on a moral stance that might be under dispute considering the context.

So, the classification of the argument would be:
- The string "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses." represents the defective argument types <IR> and <FU>.
