Sure, let's apply the process of classifying the argument type step by step using IDAA:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
The proposition in the given statement appears to be the implicit claim that eating cereal for breakfast somehow prevents earthquakes. 

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
The reason given supports the proposition that eating cereal prevents earthquakes by providing an anecdote: "One time, I had a muffin instead, and there was a major earthquake in my city."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason <PR>
There doesn't appear to be an additional argument or proof provided. The statement relies solely on the anecdote as the reason.

### Step 4: Determine if it's a Defective Argument
By recognizing the types of defective arguments defined:
1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Does the argument make a broad claim based on insufficient evidence? No.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Does the argument claim an exhaustive list but miss alternatives? No.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition? Yes, because the anecdotal connection between eating a muffin and an earthquake is not logically conclusive.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reason provided is weak in establishing a compelling causal basis. Eating a muffin and an earthquake happening does not show causal influence.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Does the reason repeat the proposition? No.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Does the claim rely on supposed universal agreement? No.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Does the statement suggest misinterpretation due to ambiguous language? No.

### Step 5: Classify the Defective Argument
Based on the identification, the two most prominent defects are <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis). However, <WCB> is more fitting since it specifically addresses the issue of weak causal basis directly.

### Conclusion:
The argument type for the given statement "Every day, I eat cereal for breakfast. One time, I had a muffin instead, and there was a major earthquake in my city. I've eaten cereal ever since." is classified as <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
