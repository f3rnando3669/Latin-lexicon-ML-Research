For 
Applying the process of \(IDAA\) to the string "Don't you want the best for your baby?" involves the following steps:

1. **Identify the Argument within \(s\)**:
   - Evaluate the string "Don't you want the best for your baby?" for its argumentative content. This sentence appears to be making an appeal rather than a straightforward argument with clear \(P\), \(R\), and \(PR\).

2. **Classify the Argument Type**:
   - Consider the argument to determine possible defective argument categories (\(G\), \(FE\), \(IR\), \(RR\), \(WCB\), \(FU\), \(DEP\)).

3. **Determine Defective Category**:
   - Check if the sentence is attempting to claim something based on flawed reasoning that fits the categories provided:

     - **Generalization (\(G\))**: Does not apply here as the statement does not generalize from a part to the whole.
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (\(FE\))**: This does not seem to enumerate limited choices.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (\(IR\))**: The sentence does not provide any reasons that might be inconclusive.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(WCB\))**: No causal reasoning is presented.
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(RR\))**: The sentence isn't repetitive of any proposition.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (\(FU\))**: The statement presumes shared value ("best for your baby") but does not argue based on consensus.
     - **Ambiguous Language Use (\(DEP\))**: There is no ambiguity in the term usage in this sentence.

   The sentence "Don't you want the best for your baby?" seems to suggest a form of implicit persuasion or emotional appeal rather than a logical argument. However, within the set of defective argument types given:

4. **Final Classification**:
   - The best fit would likely be **\(\text{FU}\)** (Presumptuous Consensus) because the statement assumes that wanting the best for one's baby is universally accepted and builds upon this assumption as if it is beyond dispute, although it does not explicitly state the argument under dispute.

By following this process, we classified the string "Don't you want the best for your baby?" as an instance of **\(FU\)** (Presumptuous Consensus).
