For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying the string as a specific fallacy) to the given passage step by step, let's proceed with the following steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) in the String:** Find the main assertion or claim made in the string.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>) Provided:** Determine any reasoning or supportive justification that is associated with the main proposition.
3. **Analyze the Nature of the Reason (<R>):** Check if the reason is generalizing, incomplete, inconclusive, assumes consensus, is ambiguous, repeats the proposition, or has insufficient causal basis.
4. **Match the Pattern to Defective Argument Types:** Compare the nature of the reason to the known defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>).
5. **Classify the String:** Conclude which type of defective argument the string belongs to based on the analysis.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>) in the String**

The main proposition in the string is implicit but can be inferred as:
- The argument for the existence of God often involves replacing old arguments with new ones as science progresses.

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>) Provided**

The string provides several reasons as to why this is considered to be moving the goalposts:
- Historical shifts from creationism to intelligent design as scientific understanding increased.
- Mention of the origin of life as a current argument which might fade as scientific answers emerge.

**Step 3: Analyze the Nature of the Reason (<R>)**

The reasoning here implies that proponents of the existence of God keep updating their arguments based on areas where science hasn't yet provided definitive answers, thus indefinitely deferring the burden of proof:
- This suggests that the argument is shifted each time science addresses the current claim.

**Step 4: Match the Pattern to Defective Argument Types**

Given this analysis, we need to check if the reasoning matches any of the defined defective argument types:
- **Generalization (<G>):** The string does not make an overgeneralization.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The string does not list out all possibilities and miss some.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reasons provided do not conclusively support the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal link between shifting arguments and proving Godâ€™s existence is weak.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason does not merely repeat the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The reasoning relies on supposed universal agreement about the nature of the arguments being constantly updated as science progresses.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The language is not ambiguous.

**Step 5: Classify the String**

Based on the analysis, the string seems to most closely fit the definition of **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**. By implying that it's a widespread and typical behavior to change the argument for God's existence as scientific advancements clarify previous unknowns, it appeals to the concept that replacing old arguments with new ones is universally agreed upon behavior.

**Classification**: The string exemplifies the **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** fallacy.
