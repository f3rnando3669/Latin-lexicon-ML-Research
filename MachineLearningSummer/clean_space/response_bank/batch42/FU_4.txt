For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "“Everyone else is doing it, so should you”.", we need to follow the structured steps of decomposing the task <IDA> (classifying the string as one of the defective argument types) using the approach defined in <D> (decomposing into specific steps). Here are the steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) within the string**:
    - The Proposition (<P>) seems to be the implied suggestion that "you should do it."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>) provided for the Proposition**:
    - The Reason (<R>) provided is "Everyone else is doing it."

3. **Check the type of defective reasoning provided by categorizing within <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>**:
    - <G> (Generalization): This involves applying a specific instance to all cases. The string does not fit this description, as it speaks about following a trend rather than generalizing a class of people or things.
    - <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration): This type involves presenting limited options. The string does not list alternatives, so it doesn't fit <FE>.
    - <IR> (Inconclusive Reason): This involves a reason that does not conclusively support the proposition. While the Reason given here doesn't logically support the Proposition in a strong way, it is more about the acceptability due to consensus than directly unrelated arguments.
    - <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition): This involves restating the Proposition as the Reason. The Reason here is different from the Proposition, so <RR> does not fit.
    - <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis): This involves providing a weak causal connection. Again, the issue at hand is more about consensus rather than causation.
    - <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus): This suggests validity based on general acceptance or popularity, which closely matches the reasoning here ("Everyone else is doing it").
    - <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use): This involves ambiguity in the argument’s terminology or language. The provided string is straightforward without ambiguity.

4. **Determine the defective argument type based on the categorization**:
    - The string “Everyone else is doing it, so should you” is suggesting an action based not on inherent merit but on the fact that it is being commonly performed by others.

Thus, based on the steps above, the best categorization for the given string is:

**<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):** 

This fits perfectly as it relies on the argument that something should be done (or agreed to) because everyone else is doing it or thinks this way.
