For 
Let's apply the defined method \(<IDAA>\) to the string provided:

**Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDA (Identifying Defective Argument Type):**

1. **Identify the propositional structure (Proposition and Reason)**:
   - **Proposition** (\(P\)): "The defendant shouldn't have to pay the parking fines."
   - **Reason** (\(R\)): "The sign said 'Fine for parking here', and the defendant presumed it would be fine to park there."

2. **Determine whether any defect applies to the argument by analyzing the Reason in relation to the Proposition**:
   - **Generalization (\(G\))**: This does not appear to be a generalization as the issue pertains to one specific instance.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (\(FE\))**: The argument does not claim a complete enumeration or present exclusive possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (\(IR\))**: The reason does not relate to personal bias or an individual characteristic.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(WCB\))**: This is not about the causation not being compelling.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(RR\))**: The reason provided is not simply a repetition of the proposition in different words.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (\(FU\))**: The statement does not appeal to popular opinion or consensus as justification.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (\(DEP\))**: The issue here clearly revolves around ambiguity in the phrase "Fine for parking here."

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The example involves misinterpretation of the word "Fine," where "Fine" means a penalty rather than permission. This suggests that the error is due to **Ambiguous Language Use (\(DEP\))**.

**Outcome**:
Applying \(<IDAA>\) to the given string classifies it as:
- **\(DEP\)**: Ambiguous Language Use.

The logical fallacy represented in the argument "When the judge asked the defendant why he hadn't paid his parking fines, he said that he shouldn't have to pay them because the sign said 'Fine for parking here' and so he naturally presumed that it would be fine to park there." is **Ambiguous Language Use (\(DEP\))**.
