For 
To apply ◄IDAA► to the string "The museum's new gemstones and precious minerals exhibit needs more security guards. If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal a piece of the exhibit.":

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- **Proposition (<P>):** The museum's new gemstones and precious minerals exhibit needs more security guards.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- **Reason (<R>):** If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal a piece of the exhibit.

### Step 3: Evaluate the Logical Soundness

1. **Is <P> established by <R>?**
   - The <R> does not provide a valid causal basis for <P>. Instead, it presents a false dilemma where only two extreme options are considered (i.e., you either agree with the need for more security guards, or you are planning to steal).
   
2. **Does <R> suffer from any of the identified defects?**
   - The reasoning is essentially an ad hominem attack where it questions the integrity of those who disagree rather than providing concrete reasons why more security guards are needed.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument (<IDA>)

- **Defective Argument Category (<IDA>):** Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)

### Step 5: Explanation
- This argument is categorized as an Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>) because it states that there are only two options: either agree with the proposition or be accused of planning theft. This excludes other pertinent possibilities, such as valid reasons for disagreeing based on an assessment of the current security measures or budget constraints.

### Conclusion
By applying ◄IDAA► systematically, we classified the argument as **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
- The museum's new gemstones and precious minerals exhibit needs more security guards. If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal a piece of the exhibit.
