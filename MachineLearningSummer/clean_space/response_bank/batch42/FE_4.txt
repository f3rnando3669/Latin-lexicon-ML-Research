For 
Sure, let's apply the IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as a defective argument type) to the given statement: 

"I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today." 

Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the components of the statement.
* **Proposition (<P>):** The implicit proposition here seems to be "You are not a good person."
* **Reason (<R>):** "You weren’t in class today."
* **Linkage:** The statement suggests that not being in class today serves as the reason for concluding that the person is not good.

### Step 2: Examine the type of defect in the argument.
We need to determine if the argument is exhibiting one of the recognized defective forms: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

#### Here’s an analysis:
1. **Generalization (<G>):** The statement doesn't generalize from a part to a whole group. It is specifically addressing one individual's action and character, so this doesn't apply.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The statement isn't enumerating possibilities, so this doesn't apply.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The link between "not being in class today" and "being a good person" is weak. Not coming to class one day does not conclusively mean the person is not good. The reason given (not attending class) does not satisfactorily demonstrate the truth of the proposition (not being a good person).
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The reason provided (not being in class) is weak as a causal basis for the conclusion (not being a good person). The connection is not compelling and lacks sufficient grounds.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason does not merely repeat the proposition in different words.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** There is no consensus assumed in this argument.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Language ambiguity does not seem to be the issue here.

### Step 3: Classify the argument.
Based on the above analysis:

The argument can be classified as **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.

The reason given ("you weren’t in class today") does not conclusively demonstrate that the person is not good (<IR>), and the causal link is weak and insufficient to reasonably support the proposition (<WCB>).

Thus, staying consistent with the definitions:

### Conclusion
The string "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today." exhibits the defective argument types:

- <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)
- <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)

We have successfully applied the IDAA to classify the given string as falling into these defective argument types.
