To apply the process of <IDAA> to the given string, we need to decompose the task of identifying the defective argument into specific steps:

**Step 1: Identify the type of defective argument.**
We first need to understand the structure of the argument provided in order to classify it correctly.

**Step 2: Break down and analyze each part of the argument.**
Look at each statement and its related reasoning to identify the logical flow or lack thereof.

**Step 3: Match the identified flaws with the predefined defective argument types.**
Compare the structure of the argument with the definitions provided for each defective argument type.

Let's apply these steps one by one to the given string.

### Step 1: Identify the type of defective argument.
Evaluate the argument speaker is making:

**Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified.**
- **Proposition (<P>):** Jesus was not really crucified.

**Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?**

**Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so.**
- **Reason (<R>):** The Quran says so.

**Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct?**

**Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.**
- **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** The Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.

**Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?**

**Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran.**

### Step 2: Break down and analyze each part of the argument.
1. **Proposition (<P>):** Jesus was not really crucified.
2. **Reason (<R>):** The Quran says so.
3. **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** The Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.
4. **Further support for PR:** God tells us so, here in the Koran.

### Step 3: Match the identified flaws with the predefined defective argument types.

After breaking down the argument, it's evident that Speaker 1 is using the Quran to justify its own truth without providing independent evidence. This reasoning goes in a circular manner:

- **P** asserts a fact based on the Quran.
- **R** supports P by asserting that the Quran says so.
- **PR** supports R by claiming the Quran is the Word of God.
- Further support does not introduce new evidence and circles back to the Quran itself.

This matches with the defective argument type **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**, where the Reason appears to support the Proposition but essentially repeats it without providing new evidence.

### Conclusion

Applying <IDAA> to "Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified.
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so.
Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct?
Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran."

We conclude that this string represents the defective argument type <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
