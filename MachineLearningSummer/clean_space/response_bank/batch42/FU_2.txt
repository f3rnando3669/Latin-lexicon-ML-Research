For 
To apply **IDAA** (the application of the decomposition of the advanced task of classification into specific steps) to the string *"Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way."*, let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the main proposition or claim**: The proposition here is that the audience should take an action (joining a group or acting in a certain way) because other people are doing the same.

2. **Examine if the argument provides a reason (<R>)**: The reason given for the audience to act is that other people are already doing it.

3. **Analyze the reason for the claim**: The reason is based on the behavior or beliefs of the majority ("because other people are acting in the same way").

4. **Determine if this reason is a defective argument type**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: This is not a generalization since it doesn't make assumptions about a whole group based on a part.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This isn't about presenting limited choices.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This could be relevant if the reason given does not directly support the conclusion effectively.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This would be relevant if the causal link is weak, though it's more about popularity in this case.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This is not the same as repeating the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Yes, this argument type draws its strength from the assertion that the majority is already doing something, suggesting it must be valid or necessary for others to do the same.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: This does not apply as there is no ambiguous language.

5. **Classify the argument**: Based on the analysis, the argument type that matches is:
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument encourages the audience to follow the majority because it claims the action is valid solely based on the popularity.

Therefore, the classification of the string *"Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way."* is **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**.
