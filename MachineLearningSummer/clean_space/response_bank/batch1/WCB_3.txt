For 
To apply \( <IDAA> \) to the given string "Every time I go to sleep the sun goes down. Therefore, my sleeping causes the sun to set." we will follow the steps of decomposing \( <IDA> \) as outlined:

### Step-by-Step Process for \( <IDAA> \):

1. **Text Parsing and Preprocessing**:
   - Extract the core argument from string \( s \):
     - Core Argument: "Every time I go to sleep the sun goes down. Therefore, my sleeping causes the sun to set."
   - Remove any unnecessary words or clauses that do not contribute significantly to the argument structure:
     - Core Argument after simplification: "Sleeping causes the sun to set because it goes down every time I sleep."

2. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - Define key indicators or phrases for each type of defective argument:
       - \( <G> \): Not applicable as it is not a sweeping generalization based on a single instance.
       - \( <FE> \): Not applicable as it is not listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
       - \( <IR> \): Evaluate if it provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
       - \( <RR> \): Not applicable as it is not merely restating the proposition in different words.
       - \( <WCB> \): Not applicable as the reason provided is not inherently weak, but it does fail logically.
       - \( <FU> \): Not applicable as no universal truths or commonly accepted beliefs are unconditionally asserted.
       - \( <DEP> \): Not applicable as the statement does not have dual interpretations that could be potentially negative or against the speaker.

3. **Classification**:
   - Identify potential matches:
     - The argument "Sleeping causes the sun to set because it goes down every time I sleep" is an example of \( <IR> \), as the reason (correlation of events) does not logically support the proposition (causation between sleeping and the sun setting).

4. **Validation**:
   - Double-check the classification to ensure accuracy:
     - Confirm the absence of a logical connection between the events (correlation is mistaken for causation).
     - No additional context needed for this classification; itâ€™s clearly a faulty causal inference.

5. **Output Generation**:
   - Produce a report or a result listing the identified type of defective argument along with a brief rationale:
     - Result: The string \( s \) "Every time I go to sleep the sun goes down. Therefore, my sleeping causes the sun to set." is identified as an \( <IR> \) type defective argument. The reason provided (correlation between sleeping and the sun setting) does not logically support the proposition (that sleeping causes the sun to set).

### Final Output:
The string \( s \) "Every time I go to sleep the sun goes down. Therefore, my sleeping causes the sun to set." is categorized as an \( <IR> \) type defective argument. This classification is based on identifying that the premise (correlation) does not logically support the conclusion (causation).
