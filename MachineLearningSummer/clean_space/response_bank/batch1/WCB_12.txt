For 
Sure, let's apply <IDAA> to identify the type of defective argument in the statement: "Since Anna Camacho became vice president of the parent-teacher association, student performance has declined and teacher morale is down. We on the school board believe that Camacho bears sole responsibility for the downtrend."

### Step-by-Step Implementation of <IDAA>:

**Step 1: Comprehend Statement**
   - Understand that the statement is making a claim about Anna Camacho's responsibility for negative changes in student performance and teacher morale.

**Step 2: Identify Claim and Support**
   - Claim: Anna Camacho bears sole responsibility for the decline in student performance and teacher morale.
   - Support: The decline has occurred since she became vice president of the parent-teacher association.

**Step 3: Evaluate Consistency**
   - The decline in student performance and teacher morale occurring after Camacho's appointment does not necessarily mean she is the cause. Correlation does not imply causation.

**Step 4: Compare Definitions**
   - <G>: Generalizing from a specific instance
   - <FE>: Fewer or more options than exist
   - <IR>: Irrelevant reason
   - <RR>: Restating in other words
   - <WCB>: Not compelling reason
   - <FU>: Universally agreed point without proof
   - <DEP>: Dual interpretation

   The argument seems to imply causation strictly from a timeline correlation, which is a common fallacy known as post hoc ergo propter hoc (after this, therefore because of this). It's assuming that Camacho's appointment is the cause without considering other potential factors.
   
**Step 5: Categorize Argument**
   - The argument best fits <IR>: providing a reason that does not logically support the proposition. The mere fact that student performance and teacher morale declined after Camacho's appointment does not logically mean she is the sole cause of these issues.

**Step 6: Justify Categorization**
   - Explanation: The argument assumes causality based solely on the sequence of events without considering other evidence or potential causes. This is a flawed reasoning pattern (post hoc fallacy), making it an irrelevant reason for the negative changes in the school environment.

Hence, the defective argument type in this example is identified as <IR>.
