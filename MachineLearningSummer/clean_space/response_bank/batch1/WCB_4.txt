For 
Sure, let's apply the step-by-step breakdown to identify the defective argument type in the given string:

**Argument <s>**: "Since Anna Camacho became vice president of the parent-teacher association, student performance has declined and teacher morale is down. We on the school board believe that Camacho bears sole responsibility for the downtrend."

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Step 1: Understand the Argument
- The argument claims that the decline in student performance and teacher morale is solely attributable to Anna Camacho becoming vice president of the parent-teacher association.

#### Step 2: Categorize the Argument Type

- **<G>**: This doesn't generalize about a group based on a specific instance.
  
- **<FE>**: Consider if it lists fewer options than exist.
  - Checks if it ignores other potential factors that could contribute to the decline.
  - It suggests that only Anna Camacho is responsible, ignoring other possible factors, which could imply <FE>.

- **<IR>**: The reasoning about Camacho and the decline.
  - This doesn't necessarily provide an irrelevant reason but rather an incomplete reasoning.

- **<RR>**: The argument doesn’t just rephrase itself.
  
- **<WCB>**: Assess if the reason is not compelling enough.
  - While the argument does not explicitly state weak reasons, it implicitly does since it overlooks other contributing factors.
  
- **<FU>**: It doesn’t claim universally agreed points without proof.
  
- **<DEP>**: No ambiguous dual interpretations detected in this argument.

#### Step 3: Analyze the Argument
- Evaluate <s> within the context of each category:
  - Narrow it down: <FE> and <WCB> are the primary contenders.

#### Step 4: Identify the Defective Argument
- **<FE>**: This seems to suggest fewer options than actually exist for the decline in performance and morale.
- **<WCB>**: Overlaps in noting that the assertion lacks depth in compelling evidence.

### Conclusion:
The primary defective argument type for the provided statement <s> is:

**<FE>**: It lists fewer potential reasons for the downtrend than actually exist, attributing the responsibility solely to Anna Camacho.

Therefore, the defective argument type for the example <s> is: **<FE>**.
