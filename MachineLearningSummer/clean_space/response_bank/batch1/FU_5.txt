For 
Let's apply the \( <IDAA> \) process to the sentence: "Everyone should like coffee: 95% of teachers do!"

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition
- **Proposition**: "Everyone should like coffee."

### Step 2: Examine the Supporting Statement
- **Supporting Statement**: "95% of teachers do."

### Step 3: Determine the Nature of the Defect
- The supporting statement "95% of teachers do" provides a statistic about a specific subset of people (teachers) as evidence that everyone should like coffee.

### Step 4: Match Defect to Categories
- Let's evaluate which category this matches:
  - **<G> Generalization**: Is a general truth being claimed based on a specific instance? Partially, as it's using a specific statistic.
  - **<FE> False Economy**: Not applicable; itâ€™s not listing too few or too many options.
  - **<IR> Irrelevant Reason**: Potentially relevant because the preference of teachers may not be logically sufficient to support the claim that everyone should like coffee.
  - **<RR> Restating Reason**: Not applicable; the proposition is not just restated.
  - **<WCB> Weak or Circular Basis**: This argument is weak because the preference of teachers does not compellingly support the notion that everyone should share that preference.
  - **<FU> Unsupported Universal Claim**: Could also be seen as asserting a universal point without sufficient proof.
  - **<DEP> Double-Edged Propagation**: Not applicable; there is no dual interpretation involved.

### Step 5: Diagnosis
Based on the analysis, the sentence "Everyone should like coffee: 95% of teachers do!" appears to exhibit a combination of weaknesses, but most prominently:

- **<WCB> Weak or Circular Basis**: The reason that "95% of teachers do" is not compelling enough to support the universal claim that "everyone should like coffee."
- It also has attributes of an **<FU> Unsupported Universal Claim**: Suggesting that everyone should like coffee based on an unquestioned statistic concerning a specific group.

Conclusively, the defective argument type for \( <s> \) is most suitably **<WCB> Weak or Circular Basis** with elements of **<FU> Unsupported Universal Claim**.
