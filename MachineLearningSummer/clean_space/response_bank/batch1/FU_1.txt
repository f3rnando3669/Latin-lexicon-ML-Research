### Steps for <IDAA>:

1. **Analyze the Argument:**
    - Understand the claim: "Everyone should like coffee."
    - Understand the supporting example: "95% of teachers do."

2. **Identify Key Characteristics:**
    - The argument makes a broad claim ("Everyone should like coffee") and uses a statistical example (95% of teachers like coffee) to support it.

3. **Classify the Argument:**
    - The given statement appears to be making a general claim about everyone based on the preferences of a specific group (teachers).

4. **Verify the Identification:**
    - Confirm that the identified characteristics (broad claim from specific groupâ€™s behavior) align with a particular type of defective argument.

### Conclusion:
The defective argument type in the string "Everyone should like coffee: 95% of teachers do!" is identified as <G> (Generalization).

This is because the argument is extrapolating a broad statement ("Everyone should like coffee") from the behavior of a specific subset of people (teachers), which is a characteristic of generalization.
