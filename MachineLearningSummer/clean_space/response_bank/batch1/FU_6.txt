For 
Applying <IDAA> to the phrase "Ninety percent of all people surveyed said that McDonalds is better than Burger King so it must be true." to identify the type of defective argument:

### Step-by-Step Application

1. **Extract the statement**: "Ninety percent of all people surveyed said that McDonalds is better than Burger King so it must be true."
2. **Analyze the Claim**: The claim is that because a high percentage of surveyed people preferred McDonald's, this preference must be indicative of an absolute truth.
  
3. **Check for Generalization (<G>)**:
    - This does involve generalizing the opinion of a sample survey to represent an absolute truth, but the key focus here is on the appeal to the survey result rather than specific instances.
    
4. **Check for Oversimplification (<FE>)**:
    - Not applicable; the statement doesn't present fewer or more options than exist.

5. **Check for Irrelevance (<IR>)**:
    - Not directly; the survey's outcome is relevant to preference but not to the claim of absolute truth.

6. **Check for Redundancy (<RR>)**:
    - Not applicable; the argument isn't simply restating the proposition.

7. **Check for Weak Compelling Basis (<WCB>)**:
    - The argument is not necessarily weak because of the basis provided, but rather due to the reliance on popular opinion without further proof.

8. **Check for Universal Assertion (<FU>)**:
    - Yes, the statement asserts a universally agreed point based on the belief that popular opinion equates to an absolute truth.

9. **Check for Dual Interpretation (<DEP>)**:
    - Not applicable; the statement isn't open to dual interpretations.

10. **Classify**: The statement assumes that because the majority believes something, it must be inherently true. This is an **<FU>** type of defective argument, as it relies on the fallacy of appealing to popularity (ad populum).

### Conclusion:
The phrase "Ninety percent of all people surveyed said that McDonalds is better than Burger King so it must be true." represents a **<FU>** type of defective argument.
