For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "Everyone should like coffee: 95% of teachers do!", we will follow the structured decomposition steps (<D>) to identify which defective argument type it falls under.

### Steps for <IDAA>:

**Given String (s):** "Everyone should like coffee: 95% of teachers do!"

1. **Understand the Definitions**:
   - **<G>**: Generalized claim based on a specific instance.
   - **<FE>**: Presents fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - **<IR>**: Reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition.
   - **<RR>**: Repetition of the proposition in different words.
   - **<WCB>**: Reason that isn’t compelling enough to support the proposition.
   - **<FU>**: Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
   - **<DEP>**: Statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.

2. **Analyze the Argument**:
   - Comprehend the statement: "Everyone should like coffee: 95% of teachers do!".
   - The key elements are: "Everyone should like coffee" and "95% of teachers do".

3. **Identify Key Elements**:
   - The main proposition is "Everyone should like coffee".
   - The supporting evidence given is "95% of teachers do".

4. **Compare with Definitions**:
   - **<G>**: This doesn’t fit because it’s not a generalized truth based on a specific instance.
   - **<FE>**: This doesn’t fit because it’s not presenting limited options.
   - **<IR>**: This might fit because the reason provided (95% of teachers like coffee) doesn’t logically support the proposition that "Everyone should like coffee".
   - **<RR>**: This doesn’t fit because the proposition is not repeated in different words.
   - **<WCB>**: This might also fit because the reason (95% of teachers like coffee) isn’t compelling enough to make a universal recommendation that "Everyone should like coffee".
   - **<FU>**: This might be argued to fit if 95% of teachers liking coffee is presented as a universally agreed point, although it leans more towards being presented as statistical evidence.
   - **<DEP>**: This doesn’t fit because there is no dual interpretation.

5. **Determine the Type**:
   - The argument "Everyone should like coffee: 95% of teachers do!" could logically be classified primarily as **<IR>** (a reason provided that doesn’t logically support the proposition), since liking coffee is subjective and the preferences of a subset (teachers) do not necessarily apply universally.
   - It might also be considered **<WCB>** (a reason that isn’t compelling enough to support the proposition), as the cited statistic does not justify the broad claim that "Everyone should like coffee".

By following these steps, the defective argument type of this string <s> is primarily identified as **<IR>** and secondarily as **<WCB>**.
