For 
To classify the argument "Four out of five dentists recommend Happy Glossy Smiley toothpaste brand. Therefore, it must be great," we'll apply the IDAA process step-by-step.

**Step-by-Step Decomposition**:
1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine what is being asserted summarily.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Determine the causal basis that supports the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**: Identify any additional arguments that exactly corroborate the Reason.
4. **Classify the Argument Type**: Using the above information, classify the argument as one of the defective types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU or DEP).

Let's proceed with the steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The Proposition (P) in this case is:
- "Happy Glossy Smiley toothpaste brand must be great."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The Reason (R) given for this Proposition is:
- "Four out of five dentists recommend Happy Glossy Smiley toothpaste brand."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
There is no additional argument provided to specifically corroborate the reason. 

### Step 4: Classify the Argument Type

Now that we have \( P \), \( R \) and identified that there is no separate \( PR \), we can classify the argument:

The argument type that is most relevant here is:
- **Generalization (G)**: This is because the Proposition is an assertion that Happy Glossy Smiley toothpaste brand is great, based on the fact that a majority of dentists (four out of five) recommend it. However, recommending a toothpaste may not necessarily make it "great" universally as the term "great" itself is subjective and could have different meanings to different individuals.

Thus, the classification of the argument is:
- **<G> Generalization**

The completed analysis with IDAA applied to "Four out of five dentists recommend Happy Glossy Smiley toothpaste brand. Therefore, it must be great." classifies it as type <G>.
