For 
Let's proceed with the task of decomposing the classification (IDA) of the given string into specific steps (IDAA) for the argument: "The United States is the wealthiest nation in the world. So every American is wealthy."

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
In the argument, the Proposition is: 
"The United States is the wealthiest nation in the world."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The Reason is implied rather than explicitly stated:
"Because the United States is the wealthiest nation in the world."

### Step 3: Identify the Conclusion
The conclusion drawn from the Proposition and Reason is:
"So every American is wealthy."

### Step 4: Clearly Lay Out the Structure
Let's conceptualize the argument structure:
- **Proposition (P)**: The United States is the wealthiest nation in the world.
- **Reason (R)**: (Implied: because the US is wealthy as a nation)
- **Conclusion**: Every American is wealthy.

### Step 5: Check for the Types of Defective Argument
Now, apply the definitions for defective argument types one by one to classify the argument:

1. **Generalization (G)**
   - Assertion based on some part or majority applied to all.
   - Examining: "The United States is the wealthiest nation in the world. So every American is wealthy."
   - This clearly over-generalizes from the wealth of the nation to every individual.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
   - Claim of complete enumeration but misses some pertinent possibilities.
   - This argument does not enumerate possibilities, so it is not applicable.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
   - Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the Proposition.
   - While the reason is implied, the issue lies more in assuming all are wealthy from national wealth, not in inconclusiveness.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
   - Causal basis for Proposition is weak or not compelling.
   - This is more about the fallacy in causation; however, the central issue is a broad generalization.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
   - Reason presented repeats the Proposition.
   - The structure here does not repeat the Proposition in the Reason.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
   - Assumed certainty based on universal agreement still in dispute.
   - This argument does not rely on presumed consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**
   - Can be taken in another sense than intended.
   - The language is not ambiguous here.

### Step 6: Classify the Argument as a Specific Defective Type
Based on the above analysis, the most fitting classification is **Generalization (G)**, because the argument over-generalizes from the national wealth to individual wealth.

### Conclusion for IDAA
The argument "The United States is the wealthiest nation in the world. So every American is wealthy." is classified as **Generalization (G)** under defective arguments.
