For 
To apply the defined method of **<IDAA>** to the statement "My first day of basketball practice was easy, so it will always be easy," we will decompose the task **<IDA>** into specific steps per **<D>** and then classify the string step by step. 

### Step-by-step Decomposition and Analysis:
1. **Identify the type of argument presented:**
   - The statement is making a generalization based on a single instance (the first day of practice).

2. **Determine the nature of the Proposition (<P>):**
   - **<P>:** "My first day of basketball practice was easy."

3. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - **<R>:** The assertion that because the first day was easy, all subsequent practices will be easy.

4. **Classify the defectiveness of the argument:**
   - The assertion is based on a single event and generalized to all future practices.

Given the definitions provided:
- **<G> (Generalization):** Applies when an assertion based on some one part or on a majority of individuals, but not necessarily applicable to all, is referred to all.

### Classification:
The statement "My first day of basketball practice was easy, so it will always be easy" falls under:
- **<G> (Generalization)**: It assumes that because one part (the first day) was easy, this characteristic can be applied to all future practices, which is not necessarily applicable in most cases.

### Conclusion:
The argument in the provided statement is classified as **<G> (Generalization)** according to the decomposition and application method **<IDAA>**.
