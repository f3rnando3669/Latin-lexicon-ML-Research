For 
To apply the defined <IDAA> (Application of Decomposition to the task of classifying arguments) to "The Bible is the Word of God because God tells us it is... in the Bible. X is true because of Y. Y is true because of X.", we need to break down the task into specific steps and walk through them systematically. Here's the process:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of the Task
1. **Identify the proposition (P) and reason (R):**
   - Proposition (P): "The Bible is the Word of God."
   - Reason (R): "because God tells us it is... in the Bible."

2. **Identify and classify the type of defective argument:**
   - To classify the defective argument, we need to evaluate the nature of the reasoning provided in the argument.

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition and Reason
- **Proposition (P):** "The Bible is the Word of God."
- **Reason (R):** "because God tells us it is... in the Bible."

#### Step 2: Evaluate the Reason and Proof of Reason
- **Reason Evaluation:** The reason provided is that "God tells us it is the Word of God in the Bible." Essentially, the argument is claiming that the Bible's authority comes from itself.

- **Proof Reason Evaluation:** The proof reason involves a circular reference, as it uses the Bible to prove the Bible's claim.

#### Step 3: Classify the Type of Defective Argument
- **Analysis of Reason:** The reason ("God tells us it is... in the Bible") is essentially repeating the proposition by referring to itself without providing an external or independent basis. This forms a circular argument.
- **Identification:** The argument structure "X is true because of Y. Y is true because of X." suggests that the reason (R) repeats the proposition (P) without providing substantive proof beyond the enclosed reference.

### Classification of the Argument Type

Based on the provided reasoning and analysis:

- The defective argument type can be classified as **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**. This is because the reason provided for the proposition does not extend the proof but merely reiterates the proposition in a circular manner.

### Concluding Step-by-Step Application

- **Step 1:** Identify <P> and <R>.
  - Proposition (P): "The Bible is the Word of God."
  - Reason (R): "because God tells us it is... in the Bible."

- **Step 2:** Evaluate the reason for defects.
  - Identification of circular reasoning where R merely repeats and supports P in an enclosed loop.

- **Step 3:** Classify based on type.
  - The type is <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).

The full decomposition and classification lead us to conclude that the string is correctly classified as type **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**.
