Alright, let's apply the decomposition of classifying the argument to determine its type using the provided definitions.

**Step-by-Step Process for IDAA (Decomposition Applied to IDA)**:

1. **Identify the Assertion (Proposition)**:
   - The proposition in "Eat lamb--could thousands of coyotes be wrong?" is implicitly suggesting that eating lamb is a good or correct action.

2. **Identify Reason given for Proposition**:
   - The reason given here is that "thousands of coyotes (seem to) eat lamb."

3. **Classify the Type of Defective Argument**:
   - We look at the definitions of defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP).

Let's analyze the argument against the definitions:

- **Generalization (G)**: This occurs when an assertion based on some one part or on a majority of individuals is referred to all.
  - The argument suggests that because "thousands of coyotes" eat lamb, therefore, eating lamb must generally be good. 

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This deals with missing pertinent possibilities while claiming a complete enumeration.
  - The argument does not cover this aspect since it's not enumerating possibilities but rather reasoning based on a chosen example.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This happens when the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
  - There could be some overlap here since coyotes' eating habits do not conclusively determine the admissibility of eating lamb for humans.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Reason is weak if the causal basis it submits is not compelling.
  - This fits since eating lamb because coyotes eat lamb is not a compelling basis for humans; the dietary habits of coyotes do not rationally justify humans' dietary choices.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: When a reason appears to restate the proposition.
  - This doesn't apply here, as the reason given doesn't simply restate the proposition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assumption of certainty based on an undemonstrated universal agreement.
  - This doesnâ€™t quite fit; the argument does not claim universal agreement but rather cites an example.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: When a proof can be taken in another sense than intended.
  - There is no significantly ambiguous language in the argument.

**Conclusion**:
Based on the definitions and analysis, the argument "Eat lamb--could thousands of coyotes be wrong?" fits best as a combination of **Generalization (G)**, because it inaccurately applies the behavior of thousands of coyotes to a broader assertion about the correctness of eating lamb, and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, because the dietary habits of coyotes are not a compelling causal basis for advising humans to eat lamb.

Hence, the primary classification would be **Generalization (G)**, with a secondary aspect of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
