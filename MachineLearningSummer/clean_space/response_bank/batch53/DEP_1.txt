For 
To apply IDAA to the string "I didn’t steal your pen—I borrowed it," we will first decompose the task of classifying the string as one of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>) into specific steps. Here are the steps for decomposition (D):

1. **Identify** the elements of the argument:
   - Proposition (<P>)
   - Reason (<R>)
   - Proof of Reason (<PR>)

2. **Analyze** the argument structure:
   - Check if the <P> is explicitly present.
   - Determine if the <R> and <PR> are provided and if they are logically connected to the <P>.

3. **Match** the argument against the definitions of defective argument types:
   - See if the argument fits the criteria of any of the defective types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>).

Let's apply this step-by-step analysis (IDAA) to the string "I didn’t steal your pen—I borrowed it".


### Step 1: Identify the Elements of the Argument

- **Proposition (<P>)**: "I didn’t steal your pen"
  - **Claim**: The speaker asserts that they did not steal the pen.
- **Reason (<R>)**: "borrowed it"
  - **Claim**: The speaker provides a rationale that they borrowed it instead of stealing.

### Step 2: Analyze the Argument Structure

- **<P> is explicitly present**: Yes, the claim "I didn’t steal your pen" is clear.
- **<R> is provided and logically connected to <P>**: The rationale "I borrowed it" is provided as a reason for why the pen was not stolen.

### Step 3: Match the Argument Against Defective Types

Let’s check each defective argument type:

- **<G> (Generalization)**: The argument is not asserting something about a group based on a subset; it pertains to a specific action—borrowing a pen.
- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: The argument does not involve listing possibilities.
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: The reason "I borrowed it" could be considered insufficient or circular—it attempts to justify the proposition by rephrasing it.
- **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: The reason "I borrowed it" closely repeats the proposition’s intent—attempts to differentiate stealing from borrowing without providing additional substantial proof.
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The causal basis given is "borrowed it," which is intended to distinguish from "stealing," but it may not be compelling without further context.
- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: The argument does not assume a universal agreement.
- **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: "Borrowed" could have different interpretations but primarily appears to clarify the speaker’s intention versus "stealing."

### Conclusion: Classification

The identified faulty argument type:

- **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: The reason provided "borrowed it" essentially repeats the proposition “I didn’t steal your pen” but fails to add a substantial different rationale, making it a faulty repetition rather than providing a conclusive reason.

Thus, the classification of the given string is **<RR>**.
