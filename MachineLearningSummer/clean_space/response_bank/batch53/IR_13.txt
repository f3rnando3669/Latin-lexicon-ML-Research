For 
Certainly! Let's apply the IDAA method to classify the statement "Is your stupidity inborn?" into one of the defective argument types.

First, let's decompose the advanced task (D) of classifying the statement into specific steps:
1. **Identify Proposition**: Determine if there is a Proposition (P) in the string.
2. **Identify Reason**: Determine if there is a Reason (R) that sets forth the causal basis for the Proposition.
3. **Identify Proof of Reason**: Determine if there is a Proof of Reason (PR) corroborating the Reason with additional arguments.
4. **Classify Fault**: Examine the statement for possible defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP).

Now, apply these steps to the statement "Is your stupidity inborn?"

### Step-by-Step Application of IDAA:

**Step 1: Identify Proposition (P)**
The Proposition in this statement seems to be implied rather than explicitly stated. The implied Proposition (P) is: "The stupidity of the person being addressed is inborn."

**Step 2: Identify Reason (R)**
The statement "Is your stupidity inborn?" does not provide an explicit Reason (R) or causality. It merely implies a question about the nature of the person's stupidity.

**Step 3: Identify Proof of Reason (PR)**
There is no Proof of Reason (PR) provided in the statement. Since it is a question form, it does not offer any proof or argument.

**Step 4: Classify Fault**
Given the above analysis, let’s now classify the type of defective argument:

- **Generalization (G)**: The statement does not make a broad generalization applying characteristics of one to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement does not enumerate possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: There is no explicit Reason provided to validate or invalidated.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is no causal basis offered.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: There is no repetition of the same reason.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There is no assumption of universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: “Is your stupidity inborn?” can be interpreted in multiple ways. It can be seen as a rhetorical question suggesting inherent stupidity or a genuine inquiry about the origins. This ambiguity could lead to misinterpretation.

### Conclusion
The statement "Is your stupidity inborn?" fits best under DEP (Ambiguous Language Use), as it can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended, allowing for multiple interpretations.

So, the classification (IDA) of the string "Is your stupidity inborn?" is of type **DEP**.
