For 
To classify the given string "President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up. Jones is responsible for the rise in crime" using the task <IDA>, we follow the decomposed steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<IDAA> applied to <IDA>):

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)

**Proposition:** "Jones is responsible for the rise in crime."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)

**Reason:** "President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up."

#### Step 3: Analyze the causal relationship in the Reason (<R>)

- The Reason suggests a temporal relationship (taxes were raised first, then crime went up) and implies causality, but it doesnâ€™t provide conclusive evidence that raising taxes necessarily causes an increase in the rate of violent crime.

#### Step 4: Map the Reason to defective argument types

#### Analysis:

- **Generalization (<G>):** This argument is not making a broad claim based on a part or majority of individuals.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This argument is not about missing out possible alternatives in a list.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition. The temporal sequence does not establish causality. Just because one event followed another does not mean the first event caused the second.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal basis for the Proposition is weak. The Reason provided ("raised taxes, then violent crime went up") is not compelling because it does not necessarily establish that the increase in taxes caused the increase in crime. Other factors might have contributed to the rise in crime.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The Reason is not repeating the Proposition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The argument does not claim universal agreement.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The Reason does not particularly contain ambiguous language that can be interpreted in different ways.

#### Conclusion:

The string "President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up. Jones is responsible for the rise in crime" is an example of **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** and **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.

There is an inconclusive causal link made in the Reason provided, and the causal basis is not compelling to demonstrate that raising taxes directly caused the increase in violent crime. Other factors might be involved that are not accounted for, making the argument defective under these types.
