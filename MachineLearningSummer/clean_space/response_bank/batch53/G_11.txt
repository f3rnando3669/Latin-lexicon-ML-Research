For 
To apply the decomposition of the task of classifying the argument statement "Some students who attend tutoring over the summer are not very intelligent. Since Beth attended summer tutoring, she is not a very good student." as one of the specified defective argument types, we'll break down the advanced task into specific steps and classify the given string. Let's follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify and Understand the Proposition (P)
- **Proposition (P)**: This is the statement that sets forth summarily what we aim to prove.
- For our statement: "Beth is not a very good student."

### Step 2: Identify and Understand the Reason (R)
- **Reason (R)**: This is the causal basis which establishes the truth of the Proposition.
- For our statement: "Since Beth attended summer tutoring."

### Step 3: Identify and Understand the Proof of Reason (PR)
- **Proof of Reason (PR)**: Additional arguments corroborating the Reason.
- For our statement: "Some students who attend tutoring over the summer are not very intelligent."

### Step 4: Examine the Defective Argument Types
- **Generalization (G)**: Proposition is based on a part or majority but not applicable to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Proposition with incomplete possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the Proposition.
- **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**: Insufficient causal basis in Reason.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Reason repeats the Proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Proof assumed as universally agreed upon but still in dispute.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Proof can be misinterpreted.

### Step 5: Apply Steps to Given Argument
- **Given Argument to Evaluate**: "Some students who attend tutoring over the summer are not very intelligent. Since Beth attended summer tutoring, she is not a very good student."

**Evaluating Type:**

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - The argument asserts that because Beth attended summer tutoring, she is not very intelligent, based on the observation that "some" students who attend summer tutoring are not intelligent. This suggests that the observation of some cases is being applied to all, particularly to Beth.

2. **Other Types**:
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable since this isn't about listing possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The Reason doesn’t conclusively demonstrate the Proposition, but this overlaps with G in terms of logical scope.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**: Could apply, as the causal link is weak.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: No obvious repetition of Proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument isn’t relying on universal agreement; it's isolated to observational.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Not applicable, as there’s no ambiguous language in context.

**Classification**:
- The argument most appropriately fits the type **Generalization (G)** because it takes a specific case (some students who attend tutoring over the summer being not very intelligent) and inappropriately generalizes this to all such students, concluding that Beth must therefore not be very intelligent as she attended summer tutoring.

### Conclusion:
Applying decomposition (IDAA) to the task (IDA), we classify the given argument as exhibiting the defective argument type **Generalization (G)**.
