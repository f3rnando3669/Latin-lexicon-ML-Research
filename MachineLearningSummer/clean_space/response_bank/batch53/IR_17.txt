For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "You moved the goalposts or made up an exception when your claim was shown to be false," we need to decompose the task of classifying this string as one of the defective argument types. Here is a step-by-step decomposition and application:

### Step 1: Understand the String
The sentence "You moved the goalposts or made up an exception when your claim was shown to be false" implies a behavior where the original argument boundaries were altered or an exception was invented to protect the original claim from refutation.

### Step 2: Identify Key Elements
- **Moved the goalposts**: Changing the criteria or basis of the claim to avoid conceding defeat.
- **Made up an exception**: Creating an ad-hoc exception to the argument when it is shown to be invalid.

### Step 3: List Defective Argument Types
- <G>: Generalization
- <FE>: Incomplete Enumeration
- <IR>: Inconclusive Reason
- <RR>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition
- <WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis
- <FU>: Presumptuous Consensus
- <DEP>: Ambiguous Language Use

### Step 4: Match Elements to Definitions
- **Moved the goalposts**: This involves changing the terms or conditions of the original argument, which aligns with the idea of creating additional, often undisclosed conditions.
- **Made up an exception**: This involves adding an ad-hoc, often irrelevant condition or exception to the argument, suggesting a lack of complete enumeration of possibilities in the original claim or argument.

### Step 5: Classification Process
- **Generalization (<G>)**: Not applicable here since there is no assertion being overly applied to all cases.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Potentially relevant since the behavior described might involve ignoring certain pertinent possibilities and only introducing them when convenient.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Not applicable here since the identified problem is not about the reason being non-conclusive but about shifting criteria.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Not applicable here since the issue is not one of repeating the proposition as the reason.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Not exactly relevant since itâ€™s more about changing the goalposts rather than presenting a weak causal basis.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Not applicable as this involves assuming a consensus that doesn't exist.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Not the focus here, since the problem pointed out deals with changing the argument boundaries, not ambiguity in language.

### Step 6: Determine Best Fit
The process of:

- Changing the criteria (moved the goalposts)
- Making up an exception (inventing a previously unmentioned possibility)

Aligns most closely with <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration), where the argument originally failed to include all pertinent possibilities and only adds them ad-hoc.

### Conclusion
**Apply <IDAA> to "You moved the goalposts or made up an exception when your claim was shown to be false".**

Classification: The string is of type <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration).
