For 
To classify the string "Did John ever give up his bad habits?" according to the task definitions provided, we need to apply the advanced task <D> to the more specific task <IDA> step by step. Hereâ€™s the detailed decomposition and application:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine what proposition or assertion is being made or questioned.
2. **Analyze the Reason (R)**: Determine if there is a causal basis presented for the proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Proof of the Reason (PR)**: Check if additional arguments or evidence have been provided to support the reason.
4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**: Determine which defective argument type best fits the analyzed components.

### Application to "Did John ever give up his bad habits?" (<IDAA>):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - In this case, the sentence is a question, but it implies a proposition about John's behavior changes. 
   - Proposition: "John might have had bad habits and possibly given them up."

2. **Analyze the Reason (R)**:
   - The question does not explicitly provide a reason or causal basis. 
   - No clear Reason is presented.

3. **Evaluate the Proof of the Reason (PR)**:
   - There is no argument or evidence provided in the question to support any reason.
   - Hence, no Proof of Reason is given either.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**:
   - Since the question itself does not provide a full-fledged argument but rather implies a proposition without supporting reason or proof, we need to consider implied defects.
   - The question assumes the existence of "bad habits" but does not establish or provide evidence for either the bad habits or their cessation.
   - This closely aligns with:
     - <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus): By asking if John gave up his bad habits, there is an implicit presumption that universally acknowledges John's bad habits without explicit support.
     - **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: The phrase "bad habits" is vague and can be interpreted differently, leading to ambiguity in what specific habits are referred to and what "giving up" means.

Based on the analysis:

- The argument implied by the question "Did John ever give up his bad habits?" can be classified as primarily **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)** because it relies on ambiguous reference to "bad habits" without specifying or clarifying what those are. 

Thus, the classification of the string "Did John ever give up his bad habits?" is of type:

**<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**
