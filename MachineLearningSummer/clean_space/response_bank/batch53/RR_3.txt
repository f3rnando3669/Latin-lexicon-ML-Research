To apply the IDAA (the application of decompositional steps to the task of classifying the string), we will break down the classification task into specific steps and follow each step methodically.

### Steps for IDAA:
1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine the main assertion or statement being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Determine the causal basis for the Proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**: Look for any additional arguments that corroborate the Reason.
4. **Analyze the Defects**: Determine which type of defect the argument might have by comparing it with the defined defective argument types.

### Step-by-Step Application:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - **Proposition (P)**: "Ghosts exist."
   - This is the main statement that the argument is trying to prove.

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - **Reason (R)**: "because I saw a ghost in my closet."
   - This statement provides the causal basis for the Proposition, claiming a personal observation as evidence.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   - There are no additional arguments presented here beyond the initial Reason. The Reason itself serves as the implied Proof of Reason due to the personal testimony.

4. **Analyze the Defects**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: This defective argument type involves making a general claim based on limited evidence.
     - **Assessment**: The argument claims that ghosts exist universally ("Ghosts exist") based solely on a single personal experience ("I saw a ghost in my closet"). This is an example of overgeneralizing from a single instance to a universal claim.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This defective argument type involves missing out on some pertinent possibilities.
     - **Assessment**: This type doesn’t apply here because enumeration of possibilities isn’t being claimed.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This type evaluates whether the Reason conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the Proposition.
     - **Assessment**: The personal observation (Reason) doesn't conclusively establish the universal claim of ghost existence.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This evaluates if the causal basis is weak.
     - **Assessment**: The Reason provided is weak, as a personal anecdote is not a robust causal basis for proving the existence of ghosts.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This type checks if the Reason merely repeats what was said in the Proposition.
     - **Assessment**: The Reason is not merely a repetition, so this doesn’t apply.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This type assesses if an assumption is presented as a consensus.
     - **Assessment**: Consensus isn’t claimed here, so this doesn’t apply.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: This assesses if language makes the statement interpretable in multiple ways.
     - **Assessment**: The language isn't ambiguous; therefore, this doesn’t apply either.

### Conclusion:
The defective argument type that best fits "Ghosts exist.... because I saw a ghost in my closet" is **Generalization (<G>)**, as it generalizes the existence of ghosts based on a single anecdotal observation.

So, the logical fallacy identified in the given example is **<G>**.
