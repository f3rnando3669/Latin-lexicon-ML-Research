Alright, let's apply **IDAA** to analyze and classify the string "The more things change, the more they remain the same."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (**D**) and Application:

#### Step 1: Identify the Part of Argument
- We first need to determine if the argument given falls under any recognizable part of a complete argument or defective argument.

#### Step 2: Match Against Known Types
- Now, compare the argument against the defined types: **G**, **FE**, **IR**, **RR**, **WCB**, **FU**, **DEP**.

### Application:

#### Step 1: Identify the Part of Argument

Let's break down the statement "The more things change, the more they remain the same."

- This statement is making a generalized proposition about change and consistency. It is essentially philosophical and proverbial in nature.
- Analyzing the structure, it seems to provide an observation rather than a detailed argument with explicit propositions, reasons, and proofs.

#### Step 2: Match Against Known Types

1. **Generalization (**G**)**:

   **Definition**: An assertion based on some one part or on a majority of individuals, but not necessarily applicable to all.

   - The statement appears to make a broad generalization about change and constancy in the world. It asserts that despite changes, there is a fundamental constancy.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (**FE**)**:
   
   **Definition**: The proposition is defective when we claim to have made a complete enumeration of the possibilities but actually miss out on some pertinent ones.

   - This does not seem to apply here. The statement isn't listing possibilities but making a generalized assertion.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (**IR**)**:

   **Definition**: The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.

   - This can be associated here since there is a lack of concrete reason or evidence to support the assertion, but rather it relies on a rhetorical observation.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (**WCB**)**:

   **Definition**: The reason is weak if the causal basis which it submits for the proposition is not a compelling one.

   - The statement is not providing any causal basis or reason at all, just an assertion.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (**RR**)**:
   
   **Definition**: The reason is weak when it appears to be presented as the reason but says precisely the same as was said in the proposition.

   - The statement is repetitive but it doesn't provide a reason or proposition format. Therefore, it doesn't fit this category.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (**FU**)**:
   
   **Definition**: The proof is assumed as certain, on the ground that "it is universally agreed upon," a thing which is still in dispute.

   - The statement does not appeal to universal agreement explicitly, so this doesn't apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (**DEP**)**:
   
   **Definition**: The argument can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended.

   - It could be seen as ambiguous because different interpretations could be possible about what "change" and "remain the same" mean. But this doesnâ€™t specifically fit the scope of ambiguous language usage that affects the proof of the argument.

#### Conclusion:

Given the definitions and types of defective arguments, the statement "The more things change, the more they remain the same" best fits **G (Generalization)** because it is making a broad assertion not necessarily applicable to all circumstances, and is more of a philosophical observation rather than an argument backed by specific examples or evidence.

Therefore, the string "The more things change, the more they remain the same." can be classified as a **G (Generalization)** type of defective argument.
