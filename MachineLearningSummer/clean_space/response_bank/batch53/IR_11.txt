Sure, let's apply the task <IDAA> to the given text step by step.

---

### Step 1: Break Down the Statement and Identify Key Components

The statement is: 

> "The Supreme Court right now is deciding whether it is right to execute insane people who have committed murder. I think it is all right to execute insane people. If we ban executions of insane people, then everybody on death row will suddenly decide they are insane and purposely fail sanity tests. It would result in chaos."

Key components:
- **Proposition (P):** "I think it is all right to execute insane people."
- **Reason (R):** "If we ban executions of insane people, then everybody on death row will suddenly decide they are insane and purposely fail sanity tests."
- **Proof of Reason (PR):** "It would result in chaos."

### Step 2: Identify Defective Argument Types

We need to check if any of the definitions for defective argument types apply:
- **G:** Generalization, where P is an assertion based on a majority but not applicable to all.
- **FE:** Incomplete Enumeration, where P is defective because some possibilities are missed.
- **IR:** Inconclusive Reason, where R does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the P.
- **WCB:** Insufficient Causal Basis, where R's causal basis for the P is not compelling.
- **RR:** Faulty Repetition of Proposition, where R is weak and merely repeats P.
- **FU:** Presumptuous Consensus, where PR is assumed as certain despite being in dispute.
- **DEP:** Ambiguous Language Use, where PR can be taken in another sense than intended.

Considering the argument sentences:
- "I think it is all right to execute insane people." (Proposition)
- "If we ban executions of insane people, then everybody on death row will suddenly decide they are insane and purposely fail sanity tests." (Reason for Proposition)
- "It would result in chaos." (Proof of Reason)

### Step 3: Check Each Defective Argument Type

- **G**: This doesn't seem to apply, as there isn't a generalization applied to all members of a group unjustly.
  
- **FE**: This might apply if other pertinent possibilities of what could happen if executions of insane people were banned are not considered.
  
- **IR**: The Reason provided ("everybody on death row will suddenly decide they are insane") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition. This assertion is speculative and lacks concrete evidence.
  
- **WCB**: The causal basis for the Reason ("everybody on death row will suddenly decide they are insane and purposely fail sanity tests") is quite weak and speculative.
  
- **RR**: The Reason does not repeat the Proposition.
  
- **FU**: "It would result in chaos" assumes the outcome without solid ground; hence this seems to be presumptuous.
  
- **DEP**: The phrase "result in chaos" could be interpreted differently (by chaos, does the speaker mean legal chaos, prison chaos, societal chaos, etc.).

### Step 4: Apply the Most Suitable Codes

From the analysis:

- **<IR>**: "If we ban executions of insane people, then everybody on death row will suddenly decide they are insane and purposely fail sanity tests." does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of executing insane people.
- **<WCB>**: The reason's basis is weak and speculative.
- **<FU>**: "It would result in chaos" assumes the outcome without proper evidence.
- **<DEP>**: "Chaos" is ambiguous and not well-defined.

### Step 5: Conclusion

Considering all the steps, the statement can be classified as having multiple defective argument types:

- **<IR>**: Inconclusive Reason
- **<WCB>**: Insufficient Causal Basis
- **<FU>**: Presumptuous Consensus
- **<DEP>**: Ambiguous Language Use

So, the detailed classification of the argument is:

"The Supreme Court right now is deciding whether it is right to execute insane people who have committed murder. I think it is all right to execute insane people. If we ban executions of insane people, then everybody on death row will suddenly decide they are insane and purposely fail sanity tests. It would result in chaos."

- **<IR>**: Inconclusive Reason
- **<WCB>**: Insufficient Causal Basis
- **<FU>**: Presumptuous Consensus
- **<DEP>**: Ambiguous Language Use

### Final Classification:
<s> = "The Supreme Court right now is deciding whether it is right to execute insane people who have committed murder. I think it is all right to execute insane people. If we ban executions of insane people, then everybody on death row will suddenly decide they are insane and purposely fail sanity tests. It would result in chaos."
Result: <IR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>
