For 
To apply the IDAA (decomposition of the task of classifying the argument) to "Everyone seems to support the changes in the vacation policy, and if everyone likes them, they must be good," we will break down the classification process step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition `<P>`
In the given argument, identify the main claim that is being asserted or intended to prove.
- Proposition `<P>`: "The changes in the vacation policy are good."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason `<R>`
Next, identify the causal basis or the reason given to support the proposition.
- Reason `<R>`: "Everyone likes the changes in the vacation policy."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason `<PR>`
Finally, identify any additional arguments or proofs that are used to corroborate the reason.
- Proof of Reason `<PR>`: "Everyone seems to support the changes in the vacation policy."

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument
Now, compare the given argument with the types of defective arguments defined:

1. **Generalization `<G>`**: The proposition is based on an assertion that applies to all based on some part or majority.
   - Does not fit `<G>` as it is not asserting something generally applicable to all individuals or groups.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration `<FE>`**: The proposition claims to have enumerated all possibilities but misses some.
   - Does not fit `<FE>` since it does not involve listing possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason `<IR>`**: The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
   - Could be taken as inconclusive, but it is not the main flaw in this instance.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis `<WCB>`**: The causal basis for the reason is not compelling enough.
   - Could be seen as a weak basis, but it is not the primary issue here.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition `<RR>`**: The reason appears to repeat the proposition.
   - This does not repeat but tries to add proof.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus `<FU>`**: Assumes a point as universally agreed upon.
   - **Yes**. This fits the defect of Presumptuous Consensus (`<FU>`) because it assumes that universal consent (everyone likes the policy) is a sufficient proof of its goodness without substantial evidence.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use `<DEP>`**: Uses ambiguous language that could be interpreted differently than intended.
   - The language is clear, so `<DEP>` does not apply.

### Conclusion
The given argument "Everyone seems to support the changes in the vacation policy, and if everyone likes them, they must be good." is best classified under:

- **Defective Argument Type `<FU>`** (Presumptuous Consensus): It presumes that universal agreement necessarily equates to the quality of the changes without addressing potential reasons for dissent or considering quality per se.
