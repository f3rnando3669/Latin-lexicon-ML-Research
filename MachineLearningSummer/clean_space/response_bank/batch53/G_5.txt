Sure! Let's break down the task of classifying the given statement "You can tell that guy's Mexican - he's wearing a sombrero." into specific steps:

### Task Decomposition for Classification (D)

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - What assumption or assertion is being made?
   - In this case: "That guy is Mexican."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - What is the causal basis given for the Proposition?
   - In this case: "He is wearing a sombrero."

3. **Determine the Type of Defective Argument:**
   - Based on the definitions provided, determine which type(s) of defective argument applies to the given Proposition and Reason.

### Application of Decomposition (IDAA)

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Assertion: "That guy is Mexican."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Causal Basis: "He is wearing a sombrero."

3. **Determine the Type of Defective Argument:**

   Hereâ€™s a step-by-step analysis to classify the argument type:

   - **Generalization (G):** 
     - Assertion based on one or a majority of individuals, referred to all. The Reason here is: "Because he is wearing a sombrero, he must be Mexican." This fits under Generalization (G), assuming that wearing a sombrero generally implies a specific nationality without accounting for exceptions or other possibilities.
   
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
     - This does not seem to apply as there's no enumeration of possibilities given in the statement.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
     - While the Reason that one is Mexican because they wear a sombrero is weak, it seems more specifically to be a case of generalization rather than an inconclusive reason for correctness.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
     - The causal basis (wearing a sombrero) is not compelling enough to conclude the Proposition (he is Mexican). However, it overlaps with generalization, which is a broader and more fitting category here.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
     - This does not seem to apply as there's no repetition wherein the Reason is restating the Proposition.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
     - This does not seem to apply as the statement does not claim a universal agreement.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
     - This does not seem ambiguous; rather, it's a stereotype-based faulty generalization.

The statement "You can tell that guy's Mexican - he's wearing a sombrero." primarily fits into the category of **Generalization (G)**. 

Hence, the classification (<IDA>) of the given statement is **<G>**.
