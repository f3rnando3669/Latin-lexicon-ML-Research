For 
To classify the statement "Grace and Helen were both romantically interested in Brad. One day, with Brad sitting within earshot, Grace asked in an inquisitive tone whether Helen was still having problems with her drug habit." using the task <IDA>, we can follow a systematic decomposition of the classification process <D>:

1. **Identify the Main Components of the Argument**:
   - Proposition (P) can be identified as what the speaker is trying to imply or prove.
   - Reason (R) supporting the Proposition.
   - Proof of Reason (PR) providing additional support.

2. **Analyze the Given Statement**:
   - Determine the underlying Proposition (P).
   - Determine if any Reasons (R) or Proofs of Reason (PR) are presented or implied.

3. **Identify Defective Argument Types**:
   - Check for Generalization (G).
   - Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE).
   - Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR).
   - Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).
   - Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR).
   - Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU).
   - Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

Now let's apply these steps:

### Step-by-Step Application of <IDAA> to the Statement

1. **Identify the Main Components of the Argument**:
   - Proposition (P): Grace is implying that Helen has or had a drug habit which is problematic.
   - Reason (R) and Proof of Reason (PR) are not explicitly stated in detail here but implied in how the statement is crafted.

2. **Analyze the Given Statement**:
   - The statement seems to be less about forming an argument and more about how a suggestion is framed to cause damage or elicit a reaction. We need to infer if the suggestion contains defective reasoning.

3. **Identify Defective Argument Types**:

Let's check if any defective argument types are applied here:

- **Generalization (G)**:
  - No clear evidence that Grace's statement about Helen is based on generalizing from one instance to all cases of drug habits.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
  - Not applicable here because we don't have a list of possibilities.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
  -Grace's question does not include a reason justifying the proposition—it is insinuative rather than declarative or reasoned.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
  - The statement is not providing a weak reason for a proposition; it’s phrased as a question. 

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
  - No clear example of repeating Proposition as Reason here.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
  - There is no explicit presumption of universal agreement in the statement directly. It does imply Helen has a drug problem but doesn't state it's universally agreed upon.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
  - The statement is indeed ambiguous and can be taken differently based on context. For instance, while it asks a question about Helen’s past or current drug habit, it can also imply without evidence to Brad that Helen has a drug habit problem.

### Conclusion:
The defective argument type that best fits the given statement is <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use). The statement by Grace is ambiguous and can be interpreted in multiple ways, potentially leading to misleading conclusions about Helen's character or behavior without providing concrete evidence or explicit reasoning.

Thus, we apply <IDAA> and classify the statement as of type **<DEP>**.
