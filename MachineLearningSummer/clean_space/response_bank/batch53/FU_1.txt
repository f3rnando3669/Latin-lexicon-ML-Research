For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "I guess I should buy my 12-year-old daughter an iPhone.  Everyone at her new school has one and I want her to fit in with the other kids," we first need to decompose the task of classifying it. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The proposition is: "I should buy my 12-year-old daughter an iPhone."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason provided is: "Everyone at her new school has one."

3. **Classify the type of defective argument using <D>:**
   - The given reason is making an assumption based on the behavior of the majority of individuals (everyone at her new school).
   - Let's compare this with the definitions of each type of defective argument:

     - **<G> (Generalization):** This occurs when an assertion based on some one part or on a majority is referred to all.
     - **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):** This involves claiming to have made a complete enumeration of possibilities but missing some pertinent ones.
     - **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** This appears when the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
     - **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** This happens when the causal basis provided for the reason is not compelling enough.
     - **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** This is when the reason repeats the proposition.
     - **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):** This is when a proof of reason is assumed as certain based on presumed universal agreement over something still in dispute.
     - **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):** This happens when the language used can be interpreted in a different sense than intended.

4. **Match the string to the appropriate defective argument type:**
   - The reasoning given is mainly a general observation about the behavior of the majority (everyone at her new school). 
   - The argument assumes that what is true for a majority should dictate the action (buying the iPhone).

Therefore, the argument fits best under **<G> (Generalization).**

In conclusion, after applying <D> step by step, the given string "I guess I should buy my 12-year-old daughter an iPhone.  Everyone at her new school has one and I want her to fit in with the other kids." is classified as a **<G> (Generalization)**.
