To classify the argument "Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist and perhaps the foremost expert in the field, says that evolution is true. Therefore, it's true," as a defective argument by applying the decomposition of steps, we can follow a structured approach:

## Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDA Task (D applied to IDA):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - The Proposition here is "Evolution is true."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - The Reason provided for the truth of the Proposition is "Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist and perhaps the foremost expert in the field, says so."

3. **Classify the Argument as Defective (IDA):**
   - We analyze the Reason and Proof of Reason to identify if it matches any of the defective argument types defined.

### Applying Detailed Steps to IDA:

1. **Step 1: Determine if the argument is a Generalization (G):**
   - Generalization involves an assertion based on the actions or observations of one part or the majority, but not of all.
   - This argument does not fit G because it does not attempt to generalize from a subset to a complete set.

2. **Step 2: Determine if the argument is an Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - Incomplete Enumeration involves missing pertinent possibilities when claiming a complete list.
   - The argument does not attempt to enumerate possibilities or omit any.

3. **Step 3: Determine if the argument has an Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - Inconclusive Reason means the Reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.
   - This argument falls under IR because stating that a noted expert says something is true does not conclusively demonstrate its truth; it is an appeal to authority rather than direct evidence for the claim itself.

4. **Step 4: Determine if the argument has an Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - Insufficient Causal Basis means the causal link provided is not compelling or adequate.
   - This discussion overlaps with IR and indeed fits. The reasoning (Dawkins says it) is not sufficient to establish evolution's truth conclusively.

5. **Step 5: Determine if the argument is a Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - Faulty Repetition happens when a Reason is identical to the Proposition in different words.
   - This is not RR, as the Reason here is different from the Proposition; it does not repeat the claim in other words.

6. **Step 6: Determine if the argument has a Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - Presumptuous Consensus assumes universal agreement on something still in dispute.
   - This argument does not claim universal agreement; rather, it appeals to the authority of an individual expert.

7. **Step 7: Determine if the argument has Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - Ambiguous Language Use means the Proof can be taken differently than intended.
   - The language here is straightforward, with no apparent ambiguity.

### Conclusion:

The argument "Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist and perhaps the foremost expert in the field, says that evolution is true. Therefore, it's true" most closely matches the defective argument types of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The Reason given (Dawkins says so) doesnâ€™t conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition and lacks a sufficiently compelling causal basis to support the claim.

Therefore, this argument should be classified under **IR and WCB**.
