For 
To apply the procedure <IDAA> (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a string as a type of defective argument) to the given statement, I will first decompose <IDA> into specific steps, and then classify the argument accordingly:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**
Identify what the statement intends to prove.

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)**
Identify the causal basis or the reason given for the proposition.

**Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**
Identify any additional arguments provided to further corroborate the reason.

**Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP)**
Based on the identified Proposition, Reason, and Proof of Reason, classify the given argument into one of the predefined defective argument types.

Applying these steps to the given statement:

**Statement:** "Andrea Starkk has written several books arguing that the media harms women when it comes to body image. But Starkk is an ugly, bitter person, so you shouldn't listen to her."

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**
- **P**: You shouldn't listen to Andrea Starkk's arguments that the media harms women regarding body image.

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)**
- **R**: Starkk is an ugly, bitter person.

**Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**
- There isn't any additional argument to corroborate the reason other than the stated opinion about Starkk's character.

**Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type**

Evaluating the identified Proposition, Reason, and lack of additional Proof of Reason:

- **Generalization (G)**: The argument doesn't involve a generalization of individuals.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument doesn't claim a complete enumeration of possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided (Starkk being "ugly" and "bitter") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal link between Starkk's personal traits and the validity of her arguments is not compelling or appropriate.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason does not simply repeat the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: No universal consensus is assumed.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The argument does not specifically involve ambiguous language.

**Classification:**
- The statement most appropriately fits **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**, as the reason provided for not listening to Andrea Starkk (that she is "ugly" and "bitter") is not a compelling or appropriate basis to discredit her arguments.

### Conclusion:
The argument "Andrea Starkk has written several books arguing that the media harms women when it comes to body image. But Starkk is an ugly, bitter person, so you shouldn't listen to her" demonstrates the defective argument type **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
