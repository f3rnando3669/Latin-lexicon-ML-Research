To apply the advanced task of decomposing the classification of the defective argument (IDAA) to the given string "Men score better on math than women do. Jerry is a man. Therefore, Jerry is better at math than Sylvia, who is a woman.", we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
Determine the assertion that is being made or intended to be proved:
- "Men score better on math than women do."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
Set forth the causal basis for the Proposition:
- "Jerry is a man."

### Step 3: Identify the Conclusion
Analyze the conclusion derived from the Proposition and Reason:
- "Therefore, Jerry is better at math than Sylvia, who is a woman."

### Step 4: Check for Defective Argument Types
Compare the identified Proposition, Reason, and Conclusion against known defective argument types to classify it:

1. **Generalization (G)**: Assertion based on some individuals (e.g., majority) but applied as universally true.
   - Here, the statement "Men score better on math than women do" attempts to generalize about all men and all women based on the performance of some. It does not necessarily apply to each individual case, such as Jerry and Sylvia.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Claim of a complete list of possibilities but missing pertinent ones.
   - This does not seem to be a case of incomplete enumeration as it does not involve listing possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Reason that does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of Proposition.
   - The reason “Jerry is a man” does not conclusively demonstrate that Jerry is better at math than Sylvia.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Weak reason with non-compelling causal basis.
   - The assertion about gender differences in mathematics does not serve as a compelling causal basis for individual performance comparison between Jerry and Sylvia.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Reason appears to be but is only a repetition of Proposition.
   - The reason ("Jerry is a man") does not repeat the proposition ("Men score better on math than women do").

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assuming consensus/agreement on something still in dispute.
   - The notion “Men score better on math than women do” can be controversial and disputed.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Using language ambiguity which can be interpreted differently.
   - The language used is not particularly ambiguous in the central argument.

### Step 5: Classify the Defective Argument Type
Based on these analyses, the argument "Men score better on math than women do. Jerry is a man. Therefore, Jerry is better at math than Sylvia, who is a woman." can be classified as a **Generalization (G)** because the Proposition "Men score better on math than women do" is a sweeping statement applied universally, while it only concerns some individuals, thus making it a flawed generalization.

### Conclusion:

By following the IDAA approach:
- Argument Classification (IDA): The given string fits the Generalization (G) defective argument type.
