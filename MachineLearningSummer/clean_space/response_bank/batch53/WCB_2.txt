To apply the task of classifying the argument "Giving 10% of your income to the Church will free a child’s soul from Limbo into Heaven, so give your money!" as one of the defective argument types, let's follow a step-by-step decomposition of this advanced task.

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>) and the Reason (<R>).**
- **Proposition (<P>):** "Giving 10% of your income to the Church will free a child’s soul from Limbo into Heaven."
- **Reason (<R>):** Implied by the call to action, which entails giving money to achieve the stated outcome.

**Step 2: Examine the validity of the Proposition and the Reason.**

- **Check for Generalization (<G>):** This would mean that the assertion is based on one part or on a majority but not applicable to all. The proposition doesn’t generalize a characteristic to all entities; instead, it makes a specific claim.

- **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This would involve listing possibilities but missing pertinent options. The argument does not involve enumerating possibilities.

- **Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This involves the Reason not conclusively demonstrating the Proposition. The reason provided (giving 10% of income) doesn't have a demonstrated causal link with freeing a soul from Limbo, making it inconclusive.

- **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Here, the causal basis for the Proposition isn’t compelling. The causal link between a financial donation and the spiritual outcome is not compelling, as it rests on an unverifiable claim.

- **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This happens when the Reason repeats the Proposition in different words. That is not the case here as the Reason does not just repeat the Proposition.

- **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This assumes universal agreement on a disputed point. The argument does somewhat imply that everyone agrees that donating money directly impacts the spiritual outcome, which is a disputed point.

- **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** This applies if the Reason can be taken in another sense than intended. The Reason seems clear in its context.

**Step 3: Classify the argument.**

Based on the detailed examination:

- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The argument’s Reason (giving 10%) is weak because the causal basis for the Proposition (freeing a soul) is not compelling, as it relies on an unverifiable outcome.
  
- **FU (Presumptuous Consensus):** The argument presumes that everyone agrees with the theological premise that donations have a direct impact on spiritual outcomes like freeing a soul from Limbo.

Hence, the argument can be classified as **WCB** (Insufficient Causal Basis) and possibly **FU** (Presumptuous Consensus).

The decomposed steps (<D>) applied to identify the argument type resulted in this classification.
