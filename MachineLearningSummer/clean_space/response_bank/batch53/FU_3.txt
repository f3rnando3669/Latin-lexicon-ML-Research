For 
Let's apply the decomposition of the task <D> to the classification task <IDA> step by step, as defined by <IDAA>.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The Proposition is the main assertion that is to be proven, summarized as:
**Proposition (<P>):** "Trump is a strong leader."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The Reason provides the causal basis for the Proposition. Here, the Reason is:
**Reason (<R>):** "People think he’s a strong leader."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
The Proof of Reason includes arguments or evidence that corroborates the Reason. In this case, it is:
**Proof of Reason (<PR>):** "ABC News/Washington Post Poll showing 53% said Trump is a strong leader."

### Step 4: Determine the Defective Argument Type

Given the elements identified, now we need to classify the argument based on identified defective argument types.

- The poll results are cited as conclusive evidence that Trump is a strong leader. However, this relies on the assumption that the poll is representative and unbiased, which may be in dispute (as indicated by calling the poll results "biased").
- There is an implicit assumption that public perception equates to actual leadership quality without addressing the potential bias in the polling data or the previous election performance inaccuracies.

Let's analyze:
1. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The argument assumes that the poll results (representing a perceived consensus) are definitive proof of the claim in dispute.
2. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The term "strong leader" can be interpreted in various ways. The poll might reflect perceptions influenced by partisanship or other factors, which are not inherently indicative of actual leadership qualities.

Given the features of the argument and the definitions provided, the argument aligns most closely with **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**. The speaker presumes the consensus of poll respondents definitively establishes the Proposition, despite potential limitations in the poll's accuracy and neutrality and without addressing these points.

### Conclusion:

Applying the decomposition method (<IDAA>), the string
*Trump cites (biased) poll results showing that people think he’s a strong leader to prove a point that he is a strong leader. ABC News/Washington Post Poll (wrong big on election) said almost all stand by their vote on me & 53% said strong leader.*
is classified as **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**.
