To classify the argument "It is either you are for the US war on terror or against it" as one of the defective argument types, let's use the decomposition approach for task IDA, which we've defined as IDAA. Here's how we'll proceed step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the parts of the Proposition (P) and Reason (R)
1. **Proposition (P):** The statement implies an assertion that you must hold one of two positions regarding the US war on terror.
   - **P:** You are either for the US war on terror or against it.

2. **Reason (R):** This argument doesn't provide a specific reason but presents a binary choice.

### Step 2: Check the classification criteria for each defective argument type

- **Generalization (G):** This is when a proposition is based on some part or majority but not necessarily applicable to all. 
  - The statement does not generalize a trait of a group; it presents a binary choice.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This is when a proposition claims to have made a complete enumeration of possibilities but misses some pertinent ones. 
  - The statement suggests only two possibilities (either for or against) without acknowledging possible neutral or other nuanced stances.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
  - This statement does not provide reasoning; it imposes a binary choice.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis for the proposition is weak and not compelling.
  - No causal basis visible here; it’s purely a binary assertion.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason is presented but says precisely what is in the proposition.
  - There's no separate reason; it’s embedded in the binary proposition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Assumed as certain based on "it is universally agreed upon" for a disputed thing.
  - No assumptions of unanimous agreement are mentioned here.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The proof of reason can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended.
  - No ambiguity or deviation in language is evident.

### Step 3: Determine the most fitting defective argument type

Given the explanations and the types identified, **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** stands out. The statement creates a false dichotomy by implying there are only two possible stances on a complex issue, potentially missing other pertinent stances (e.g., neutrality, conditional support).

### Conclusion
**Classification (s):** The argument "It is either you are for the US war on terror or against it" is of type **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**.

Thus, applying IDAA, we have decomposed the argument evaluation task step by step and classified the statement accurately.
