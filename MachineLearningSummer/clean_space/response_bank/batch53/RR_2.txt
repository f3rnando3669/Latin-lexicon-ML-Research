To apply the defined process of IDAA (which involves decomposing the IDA task into specific steps) to classify the given string, we will follow a systematic approach. Here’s how we can break it down:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The given string presents an assertion that we need to identify and understand summarily.

**String:** "Only a mentally ill person would kill someone, so anyone who kills someone is automatically mentally ill."
**Proposition (P):** "Anyone who kills someone is automatically mentally ill."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
Next, we need to identify the Reason that sets forth the causal basis for the Proposition.

**Reason (R):** "Only a mentally ill person would kill someone."

### Step 3: Analyze the Relationship Between P and R
We need to examine the relationship between the Proposition and the Reason to determine if they support each other correctly.

### Step 4: Evaluate for Defective Argument Types
We need to match the given argument to the predefined defective argument types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

**Evaluation:**
The string states that "Only a mentally ill person would kill someone" (Reason) leads to the conclusion that "Anyone who kills someone is automatically mentally ill" (Proposition). This assertion is a generalization that assumes a characteristic true for a subset (some people who kill may indeed be mentally ill) applies to the entire group (all people who kill are mentally ill). This is clearly a **Generalization (G)**.

### Step 5: Apply the Classification
Classify the argument based on the analysis.

**Classification (IDA):** G

### Conclusion
The given string fits the type of defective argument called **Generalization (G)**. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of IDAA applied to the string:

1. **Identify Proposition (P):** "Anyone who kills someone is automatically mentally ill."
2. **Identify Reason (R):** "Only a mentally ill person would kill someone."
3. **Analyze the Relationship Between P and R:** The Reason supports the Proposition by generalizing a specific characteristic.
4. **Evaluate for Defective Argument Types:** This is a Generalization since it incorrectly applies a characteristic of a subset to the entire set.
5. **Classification:** The argument is of type **G** (Generalization).

Thus, the string "Only a mentally ill person would kill someone, so anyone who kills someone is automatically mentally ill" is classified as a Generalization (G).
