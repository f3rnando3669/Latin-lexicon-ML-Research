For 
To apply the process of IDAA (decomposing IDA into specific steps) to the example provided, we need to go through each step methodically. Our task is to classify the given statement into one of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>).

### Step 1: Understand the Example
First, let's parse and understand the provided statement:

> “My wife wants to talk about cleaning out the garage, so I asked her what she wants to do with our patio furniture. Now she’s shopping for new patio furniture and not asking me about the garage.”

### Step 2: Identify the Components
Next, we need to identify the components in the argument to see how they fit into the logical structure of Propositions, Reasons, and Proofs of Reasons, and whether they match the definitions of defective arguments.

- **Proposition (P)**: The main assertion or topic.
  - In this case, it seems to be about addressing the idea of cleaning the garage.

- **Reason (R)**: The causal basis for the proposition.
  - The reason here appears to be the question about what to do with the patio furniture as a way to distract or diverge from the original topic.

- **Proof of Reason (PR)**: Additional arguments corroborating the reason.
  - The result of the Reason here is that now focus is on shopping for new patio furniture instead of cleaning the garage.

### Step 3: Match Against Defective Arguments
We must now consider the defined defective arguments and see which one matches the provided example:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - Not applicable, as there is no assertion based on a part being applied to all.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - Not applicable, as there isn't an incomplete listing of possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - Partially applicable, because asking about patio furniture doesn't conclusively demonstrate the correctness or relevance of changing the subject from garage cleaning.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - Partially applicable because the causal basis—asking about patio furniture—is weak and not compelling enough to shift focus logically to patio shopping.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - Not applicable, since the reason doesn't just repeat the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - Not applicable, no universal agreement is assumed.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
   - Applicable, as the shift in focus (cleaning the garage to shopping for new patio furniture) suggests ambiguity and indirect intention.

### Step 4: Classify the Statement
Let’s classify the statement step by step using <IDAA>:

- The primary issue lies in the logical shift—the statement’s Reason doesn’t fit well with the Proposition regarding cleaning the garage (potentially <IR> and <WCB>).
- The ambiguity in language plays a significant role through the shift of focus (<DEP>).

### Step 5: Determine the Most Appropriate Classification
Given the provided categories, the most fitting classification for this statement is:

**<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: The shift from discussing cleaning the garage to focusing on patio furniture shopping indicates ambiguity and an indirect shift in intended discussion.

### Final Classification
Based on the analysis above, the statement:
> “My wife wants to talk about cleaning out the garage, so I asked her what she wants to do with our patio furniture. Now she’s shopping for new patio furniture and not asking me about the garage.”

**is of type <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**.
