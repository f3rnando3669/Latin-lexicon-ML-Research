For 
To classify the given string using the predefined classes of defective arguments, we will apply <IDAA> by decomposing the task into specific steps. 

Here is our string: 
"We can’t freeze the academic year because then students won’t graduate on time. Next thing you know most people will be unemployed and will resort to crime. The crime rate will skyrocket and society will collapse."

Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>).
- The Proposition (<P>) typically sets forth what the argument is trying to prove.
- In our string: "We can’t freeze the academic year."

Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>).
- The Reason (<R>) sets forth the causal basis for the Proposition (<P>).
- In our string: "because then students won’t graduate on time."

Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>).
- The Proof of Reason (<PR>) corroborates the Reason (<R>) by means of additional arguments.
- In our string: "Next thing you know most people will be unemployed and will resort to crime. The crime rate will skyrocket and society will collapse."

Step 4: Map the string to the classification schema (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).
- Review the classified defective arguments:
  - <G>: Generalization
  - <FE>: Incomplete Enumeration
  - <IR>: Inconclusive Reason
  - <WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis
  - <RR>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition
  - <FU>: Presumptuous Consensus
  - <DEP>: Ambiguous Language Use

Step 5: Identify the exact type of defective argument.
- Decompose and analyze the string:
  - The Reason presented for not freezing the academic year is that "students won’t graduate on time."
  - The Proof takes an exaggerated and slippery slope approach: "Next thing you know most people will be unemployed and will resort to crime. The crime rate will skyrocket and society will collapse."

**Classification: <WCB>**
The argument appears to suffer from **Insufficient Causal Basis** (<WCB>) because the Reason provided does not sufficiently justify the dire consequences mentioned in the Proof. The causal linkage between students not graduating on time and society collapsing is weak and highly speculative.

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the string, we have classified it as <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):

- <P>: "We can’t freeze the academic year."
- <R>: "because then students won’t graduate on time."
- <PR>: "Next thing you know most people will be unemployed and will resort to crime. The crime rate will skyrocket and society will collapse."
- **Defective Argument Type**: <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
