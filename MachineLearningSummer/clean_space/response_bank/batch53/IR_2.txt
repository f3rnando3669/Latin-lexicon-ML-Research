For 
To apply <IDAA> to the example sentence "After Sally presents an eloquent and compelling case for a more equitable taxation system, Sam asks the audience whether we should believe anything from a woman who isn't married, was once arrested, and smells a bit weird," we need to follow decomposed steps to classify the defective argument.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition
1. **Identify the core argument and its components**:
   - The **core argument** Sally presents is for a more equitable taxation system.
   - The **Proposition (P)**: Sally argues for a more equitable taxation system.
   - The **Reason**: Not explicitly provided in the sentence, but it's implied that Sally has provided compelling reasons in her eloquent case.
   - The **Proof of Reason (PR)**: Again, not explicitly stated, but presumed to be part of her compelling case.

2. **Identify the interlocutor's response**:
   - Sam’s response does not address Sally's argument directly.
   - Sam utilizes character attacks against Sally: questioning her credibility based on her marital status, past arrest, and personal hygiene.

3. **Match the response to defective argument types**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: Does Sam’s response rely on overgeneralizing something about Sally to discredit her entire argument?
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Does Sam’s response miss pertinent possibilities?
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Does Sam’s response present a reason that fails to conclusively support his point against Sally’s argument?
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Is Sam’s reasoning for discrediting Sally weak or insubstantial?
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Does Sam’s reasoning merely repeat something from the proposition?
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Does Sam assume a consensus on a disputed matter?
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Is Sam’s response ambiguous in a way that could be misinterpreted?

### Detailed Analysis of Sam’s Response
- **Character Attack (Ad Hominem)**: Sam is focusing on Sally's personal traits instead of addressing the substance of her argument.

4. **Classify the response**:
   - Sam’s response attacks Sally’s credibility by addressing factors unrelated to her argument on taxation (marital status, past arrest, and body odor).
   - This falls under **Generalization (G)** because it includes irrelevant personal information to discredit the entirety of Sally’s argument. Sam generalizes that because Sally has certain personal attributes or history, we should disregard everything she says.

### Conclusion
The appropriate classification for the defective argument used by Sam is **Generalization (G)**.
