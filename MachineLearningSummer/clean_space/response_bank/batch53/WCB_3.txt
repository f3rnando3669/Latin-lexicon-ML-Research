Sure, let's apply the decomposition process to classify the given string. We'll break it down step by step.

### Task Decomposition (D) for <IDA>
1. **Extract the Proposition (P)**:
   Identify the main assertion or claim that the argument intends to prove.

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   Determine the causal basis that supports the Proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   Look for additional arguments, evidence, or statements that corroborate the Reason.

4. **Classify the Argument Type**:
   Based on the extracted components, classify the argument into one of the defective types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Applying IDAA to the Given String
#### Step 1: Extract the Proposition (P)
"The report suggests that 'the rise in violent offending and the explosion in the sales of iPods and other portable media devices is more than coincidental,' and asks, rather provocatively, 'Is There an iCrime Wave?'"

**Proposition (P)**: The rise in violent offending and the explosion in the sales of iPods and other portable media devices is more than coincidental.

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
"The report notes that nationally, violent crime fell every year from 1993 to 2004, before rising in 2005 and 2006, just as 'America’s streets filled with millions of people visibly wearing, and being distracted by, expensive electronic gear.'"

**Reason (R)**: The rise in violent crime in 2005 and 2006 corresponds with the visible increase in people wearing and being distracted by expensive electronic gear.

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
- Comparison of crime statistics before 2005 and in 2005-2006.
- Observation of the simultaneous increase in the use of electronic devices.

**Proof of Reason (PR)**: The linkage provided by the temporal correlation between the rise in violent crime and the increased visibility and distraction caused by electronic gear.

#### Step 4: Classify the Argument Type
Evaluate if the argument falls into one of the defective types:

- **Generalization (G)**: There is no strong indication that the argument is applying a trait from one or a majority to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not appear to miss pertinent possible causes; it is focused on a specific correlation.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The Reason provided offers a temporal correlation, but correlation does not imply causation. This could make the reason inconclusive.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The Reason does not simply restate the Proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The Reason might not be compelling due to the lack of direct causation between wearing electronic devices and increased crime, fitting into WCB.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There’s no indication of assuming universal consensus on the point in dispute.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The Reason and Proof do not seem open to multiple interpretations differing from the intended one.

**Classification**: The argument seems to fit into both <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), as the correlation does not conclusively establish causation, and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) because the causal basis (seeing people with devices and increased crime) is weak.

### Final Classification: 
<IR> and <WCB> are the likely types for the given string.
