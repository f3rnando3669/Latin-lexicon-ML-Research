Sure, let's apply the decomposition method to classify the given argument according to the types listed (Generalization <G>, Incomplete Enumeration <FE>, Inconclusive Reason <IR>, Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>, Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>, Presumptuous Consensus <FU>, Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>).

Given text: "If you accept that the story of Adam and Eve was figurative, then you will do the same for most of the Old Testament stories of similar literary styles. Once you are there, the New Testament and the story of Jesus does not make sense, which will lead you to believe that the resurrection of Jesus was a “spiritual” one. Once you accept that, you won’t be a Christian anymore; you will be a dirty atheist, then you will have no morals and start having sex with animals of a barnyard nature. So you better take the story of Adam and Eve literally, before the phrase, “that chicken looks delicious”, takes on a whole new meaning."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D)

1. **Identify the Proposition (P) and Reason (R):**
   - **Proposition (P):** If you accept the story of Adam and Eve as figurative, it leads to losing Christian faith.
   - **Reason (R):** Accepting Old Testament stories figuratively makes the New Testament nonsensical, leading to atheism.

2. **Identify the Proof of the Reason (PR):**
   - The consequence of accepting Old Testament stories figuratively and the domino effect on Christian belief and moral decay.

3. **Analyze the argument for defects:**
   - Examine if the argument falls into one or more defective types.

### Classification Analysis (IDAA)

#### Step 1: Generalization (G)
- **Does it involve generalizing a part to the whole?** 
  - Yes. The argument takes the acceptance of one biblical story as figurative and generalizes it to the entire belief system and morality.

  **Classification: Generalization (G)**

#### Step 2: Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
- **Does it exclude some possibilities?**
  - The argument suggests only one outcome from accepting the Adam and Eve story figuratively, not considering other interpretations.

  **Classification: Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**

#### Step 3: Inconclusive Reason (IR)
- **Does the Reason fail to conclusively support the Proposition?**
  - The link between interpreting biblical stories figuratively and atheism is neither logically nor necessarily conclusively demonstrated.

  **Classification: Inconclusive Reason (IR)**

#### Step 4: Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
- **Is the causal basis weak or not compelling?**
  - The assertion that interpreting one story figuratively will lead to atheism and immoral behavior lacks a compelling causal basis.

  **Classification: Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

#### Step 5: Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
- **Does the Reason repeat the Proposition?**
  - The argument does not simply repeat itself but presents a consequential chain of reasoning.

  **Classification: Not Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**

#### Step 6: Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
- **Is something assumed to be universally agreed upon that is disputed?**
  - Implicitly, the argument assumes that interpreting the Bible figuratively is agreed upon to lead to atheism without evidence.

  **Classification: Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**

#### Step 7: Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)
- **Can the statement be interpreted differently than intended?**
  - The dramatic end about “having sex with animals” could be taken hyperbolically, but it is clear in humor or extreme prediction.

  **Classification: Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**

### Conclusion

The given argument can be classified as having the following defects:

1. **Generalization (G)**
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
5. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)*

By decomposing the task and analyzing each step, we identify that the argument suffers from primarily exaggerating individual instances to extremes and presuming consensus without solid evidence, combined with weak causal links and insufficient enumeration of possibilities.
