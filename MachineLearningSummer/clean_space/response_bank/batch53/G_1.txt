For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to the given argument, we need to decompose the task \( \text{IDA} \) (classifying the defective argument) into specific steps, and then apply those steps to the string.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (\( \text{D} \)):

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( \text{P} \))**: Determine the main assertion that the argument is trying to prove.
2. **Identify the Reason (\( \text{R} \))**: Pinpoint the causal basis or evidence provided to support the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\( \text{PR} \))**: Corroborate the reason using additional arguments or evidence.
4. **Classify the Defective Argument**:
   - Compare the defective argument to the types like **Generalization (G)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**, **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**, and **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**.

### Applying \( \text{IDAA} \) to the String:
String: "My friend swears the mechanic at that shop overcharged her last week and after looking at her invoice it seems she’s right. So don’t take your business there, as you’ll definitely get ripped off."

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\( \text{P} \))
Proposition (\( \text{P} \)): "Don’t take your business there, as you’ll definitely get ripped off."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\( \text{R} \))
Reason (\( \text{R} \)): "My friend swears the mechanic at that shop overcharged her last week and after looking at her invoice it seems she’s right."

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (\( \text{PR} \))
Proof of Reason (\( \text{PR} \)): The claim that examining the invoice supports the assertion that the friend was overcharged.

#### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument
- **Generalization (G)**: The proposition is making a broad generalization based on a single incident (one person's experience). The assertion that "you’ll definitely get ripped off" applies the experience of one individual to all potential customers of the shop, which may not be statistically valid.

Thus, the provided string fits the definition of **Generalization (G)**.

### Conclusion
The string "My friend swears the mechanic at that shop overcharged her last week and after looking at her invoice it seems she’s right. So don’t take your business there, as you’ll definitely get ripped off." is classified as type \( \text{G} \) (Generalization).
