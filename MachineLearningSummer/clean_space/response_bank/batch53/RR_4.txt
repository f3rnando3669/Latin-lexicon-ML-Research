### Decomposition of Task (<D>)
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) in <s>**: Extract the main statement or claim made in the argument.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>) in <s>**: Determine the causal basis provided to support the Proposition.
3. **Compare the Reason (<R>) with the Proposition (<P>)**: Check if the Reason reinforces the Proposition or merely repeats it.
4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**: Using the list of defective argument types, classify the defect in the argument based on steps 1-3.

### Application of <D> to <IDA> (<IDAA>)

**Step-by-Step Application to the Statement:**

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- **Proposition (<P>)**: "You must obey the law".
  
#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- **Reason (<R>)**: "because it's illegal to break the law".

#### Step 3: Compare the Reason (<R>) with the Proposition (<P>)
- Examine if the Reason adds any new information or causality to the Proposition or if it merely restates the Proposition in different words. In this case:
  - The Reason "because it's illegal to break the law" essentially restates the idea of the Proposition "You must obey the law" by simply reshaping the expression without offering a distinct reason or evidence.

#### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type
- The Reason does not provide a new causal basis but merely rephrases the Proposition. This matches the description of a faulty repetition of the Proposition.
  - **Defective Argument Type**: **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**

### Final Classification
The logical fallacy used in the statement "You must obey the law, because it's illegal to break the law" is **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**.
