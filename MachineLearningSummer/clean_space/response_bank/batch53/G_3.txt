For 
To apply the decomposition approach (<D>) to the task of classifying the argument string (<s>) as a type of defective argument (<IDA>), we need to break down <IDA> into systematic steps and then execute those steps on the given argument. Following each of these logical steps will help us precisely identify the type of defective argument.

### Steps for Decomposition (<D>):

1. **Extract Proposition (<P>):**
   - Identify the main claim that the argument intends to prove.

2. **Extract Reason (<R>):**
   - Identify the causal basis that aims to establish the truth of the Proposition.

3. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types:**
   - Compare the extracted Proposition and Reason against definitions of defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

4. **Classify Argument Type:**
   - Determine the specific type based on the characteristic defects found.

### Application of <D> to <IDA> on the Given String:

Let's take the example string: 
"An environmental group illegally blocked loggers and workers at a nuclear plant. Therefore, environmentalists are radicals who take the law into their own hands."

1. **Extract Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition (<P>): "Environmentalists are radicals who take the law into their own hands."

2. **Extract Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason (<R>): "An environmental group illegally blocked loggers and workers at a nuclear plant."

3. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types:**

   - **Generalization (<G>):**
     - Check if the Proposition is an assertion based on one part or a majority, but not necessarily applicable to all.
     - Yes, the Proposition generalizes about all environmentalists based on the actions of one group.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
     - Check if the Proposition suggests a complete enumeration of possibilities but misses some.
     - Not applicable here as no enumeration is involved.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
     - Check if the Reason does not conclusively establish the Proposition.
     - The Reason is not applicable here because it generalizes rather than fails to conclusively establish.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
     - Check if the Reason is a mere repetition or rephrasing of the Proposition.
     - Not applicable here as the Reason provides a specific incident.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
     - Check if the Reason provides an insufficient basis for the Proposition.
     - The causal basis is improperly generalized, which aligns more closely with <G>.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
     - Check if there's an assumed consensus on the Reason which is still in dispute.
     - Not applicable here.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
     - Check if the Reason can be taken in another sense.
     - Not applicable here.

4. **Classify Argument Type:**
   Based on the characteristic defect found (generalization from one group's actions to all environmentalists), the string fits the definition of **Generalization (<G>)**.

### Conclusion:

The argument string "An environmental group illegally blocked loggers and workers at a nuclear plant. Therefore, environmentalists are radicals who take the law into their own hands." is classified as **<G>**: Generalization.
