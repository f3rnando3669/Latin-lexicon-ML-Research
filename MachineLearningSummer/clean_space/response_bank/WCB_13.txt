Certainly! Let's apply the decomposition approach to identify the defective argument type in the given statement:

### Given Statement:
"Every time I go to sleep the sun goes down. Therefore, my sleeping causes the sun to set."

### Applying Decomposition <D> to <IDA>

Let's break down the task step-by-step.

#### Step 1: Understand the Argument in <s>
- **Claim**: My sleeping causes the sun to set.
- **Reasoning**: Every time I go to sleep, the sun goes down.

#### Step 2: Classify the Argument Type
Let's match this against the predefined defective argument types:
- **<G>** (Generalization): This doesn't seem to be generalizing a truth based on a specific instance.
- **<FE>** (False dichotomy): This argument isn't providing limited options.
- **<IR>** (Irrelevant reasoning): Check if the reasoning logically supports the proposition. The fact that the sun goes down when the person sleeps doesn't inherently prove causation, which makes this an example of irrelevant reasoning.
- **<RR>** (Redefinition): It isn't restating the proposition.
- **<WCB>** (Weak claim or belief): This doesn’t appear to be about a weak belief; rather, it’s asserting causation without proper evidence.
- **<FU>** (Unfounded universals): This isn’t making an unfounded universal claim.
- **<DEP>** (Dual interpretation): This doesn’t fit the dual interpretation category.

Based on this analysis, the argument appears to be a case of **irrelevant reasoning** because the temporal coincidence (sun setting when the person goes to sleep) is misinterpreted as causation without correct evidence linking the two.

#### Step 3: Confirm the Classification
- Double-check: The argument draws a conclusion about causality based on chronological order, which is a classic example of irrelevant reasoning. 

#### Step 4: Document the Findings
- Identified Defective Argument Type: **<IR>** (Irrelevant reasoning).
- Explanation: The argument incorrectly links sleeping to the setting of the sun based on coincidental timing, without logical causative evidence.

### Final Identification
The defective argument type for the given statement "Every time I go to sleep the sun goes down. Therefore, my sleeping causes the sun to set." is **<IR>** (Irrelevant reasoning).
