For 
To apply \<IDAA> to the given string "Every time I go to sleep the sun goes down. Therefore, my sleeping causes the sun to set," we will follow the step-by-step decomposition process.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (\<D>) for \<IDA>

1. **Reading and Understanding the Argument**:
   - **Step 1.1**: Carefully read the string \(<s>\) to understand the claim or argument being made.
     - Argument: Every time I go to sleep, the sun goes down.
     - Supporting reason: Therefore, my sleeping causes the sun to set.
   - **Step 1.2**: Identify the main proposition and the supporting reason(s) provided.
     - Proposition: My sleeping causes the sun to set.
     - Reason provided: Correlation between going to sleep and the sun setting.

2. **Identifying Key Characteristics**:
   - **Step 2.1**: Determine if the argument uses a specific instance to claim a general truth (\<G>).
     - Not applicable, as there is no broad generalization from a specific instance.
   - **Step 2.2**: Check if the argument lists fewer or more options than actually exist (\<FE>).
     - Not applicable, as the argument does not list options.
   - **Step 2.3**: Evaluate if the reason provided logically supports the proposition (\<IR>).
     - Applicable: The argument gives a reason (sleeping and the setting sun occurring simultaneously) that does not logically support the proposition (sleeping causes the sun to set).
   - **Step 2.4**: Assess if the argument is merely restating the proposition using different words (\<RR>).
     - Not applicable, as the argument is not restating the proposition.
   - **Step 2.5**: Analyze if the reason is compelling enough to support the proposition (\<WCB>).
     - Not applicable for this context; itâ€™s more about logical support.
   - **Step 2.6**: Determine if the argument asserts universally agreed points without proof (\<FU>).
     - Not applicable, common form.
   - **Step 2.7**: Check for dual interpretations of the statement that could work against the speaker (\<DEP>).
     - Not applicable, no dual interpretation here.

3. **Matching with Definitions**:
   - **Step 3.1**: Compare the identified characteristics of the argument with the definitions provided for \<G>, \<FE>, \<IR>, \<RR>, \<WCB>, \<FU>, and \<DEP>.
     - The identified characteristic is that the reason provided (sleeping and the sun setting at the same time) does not logically support the proposition (sleeping causes the sun to set).
   - **Step 3.2**: Match the argument to one of these types based on the closest resemblance.
     - Closest match: \<IR>.

4. **Validation and Conclusion**:
   - **Step 4.1**: Validate the matched type by ensuring it fits all aspects of the identified defective argument type.
     - The argument fits the definition of \<IR> because the reason given does not logically support the main proposition.
   - **Step 4.2**: Conclude and report the defective argument type.
     - The argument type is \<IR>.

By following these steps, we have identified that the defective argument type for the given string is \<IR>.
