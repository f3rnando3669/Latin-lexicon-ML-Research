### Applying <IDAA> to "We cannot listen to John’s opinion on global warming because he is a tree hugger."

To classify the argument type of the given string <s>, "We cannot listen to John’s opinion on global warming because he is a tree hugger," we will follow the steps of the decomposition process <D> for the task <IDA> (Identifying Defective Argument Type):

1. **Text Analysis**:
   - **Premise**: "John is a tree hugger."
   - **Conclusion**: "We cannot listen to John’s opinion on global warming."

2. **Pattern Matching**:
   - We need to compare the structure of <s> against the known templates and characteristics of defective argument types:
     - **<G>**: The argument doesn’t involve generalizing a specific instance to a general truth.
     - **<FE>**: The argument doesn’t list options.
     - **<IR>**: Potential candidate, as it provides a reason ("he is a tree hugger") that might not logically support the conclusion ("we cannot listen to his opinion on global warming").
     - **<RR>**: The argument doesn't simply restate the proposition in different words.
     - **<WCB>**: Could be another candidate if the reason provided is not compelling.
     - **<FU>**: It doesn’t assert universally agreed points without proof.
     - **<DEP>**: It isn’t open to dual interpretations.

3. **Classification**:
   - **<IR>**: "He is a tree hugger" doesn't logically support "we cannot listen to his opinion on global warming." Being categorized as a "tree hugger" is not a logically sound reason to dismiss someone's opinion on the scientific subject of global warming. 
   - **<WCB>**: The reason "he is a tree hugger" could be considered not compelling enough to support the conclusion.

4. **Validation**:
   - Double-checking the analysis:
     - The primary reason "he is a tree hugger" indeed does not logically support why John’s opinion on global warming is invalid, aligning with the type <IR>.
     - While the reason might also be seen as not compelling enough (<WCB>), it primarily fails due to the lack of logical connection to the conclusion.

Conclusion:
   - After thorough validation, the most fitting classification for the argument "We cannot listen to John’s opinion on global warming because he is a tree hugger." is **<IR>** (Defective Argument Type providing a reason that does not logically support the proposition).

Thus, through applying the process of decomposition <D> for the task <IDA>, we identify the defective argument type in the given <s> as **<IR>**.
