Alright, let's apply the decomposition process for identifying the defective argument type in the given string:

### Given String: 
"Every time I go to sleep the sun goes down. Therefore, my sleeping causes the sun to set."

### Applying <D> to <IDA>:
#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition and Reasoning:
- **Proposition**: "My sleeping causes the sun to set."
- **Reasoning**: "Every time I go to sleep the sun goes down."

#### Step 2: Categorize the Defective Arguments:
- **Generalization (<G>)**: Does this argument claim a general truth based on a specific instance? 
  - No, it does not claim a general truth based on a specific instance.

- **False Dilemma or Exhaustion (<FE>)**: Does this argument present limited or exaggerated options?
  - No, it does not present limited or exaggerated options.

- **Irrelevance (<IR>)**: Does the reason provided logically support the proposition? 
  - The reason "Every time I go to sleep the sun goes down" does not logically support the proposition "My sleeping causes the sun to set." This is a classic example of confusing correlation with causation. Just because two events occur together does not mean one causes the other.

- **Rephrasing or Redundancy (<RR>)**: Does the argument restate the proposition in different words?
  - No, it does not just restate the proposition in different words.

- **Weak or Compelling but Non-Conclusive Basis (<WCB>)**: Is the supporting reason weak or not compelling?
  - While the argument is weak, it fits more precisely under the category of irrelevance due to the logical fallacy.

- **Follow the Crowd or Unsupported Universality (<FU>)**: Does the argument rely on widely accepted but unproven points?
  - No, it does not rely on widely accepted but unproven points.

- **Dual Interpretation or Ambiguity (<DEP>)**: Is the statement open to dual interpretation?
  - No, the statement is not open to dual interpretation.

### Conclusion:
By analyzing the proposition and reasoning, and comparing them with the categories defined, we determine that the argument fits best under **<IR> (Irrelevance)** since the reasoning provided does not logically support the proposition.

So, applying <IDAA> to the string "Every time I go to sleep the sun goes down. Therefore, my sleeping causes the sun to set." results in identifying the argument type as **<IR> (Irrelevance)**.
