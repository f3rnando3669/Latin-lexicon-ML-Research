For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string, "Trump cites (biased) poll results showing that people think heâ€™s a strong leader to prove a point that he is a strong leader. ABC News/Washington Post Poll (wrong big on election) said almost all stand by their vote on me & 53% said strong leader," we will decompose the task into specific steps to systematically classify this argument for defects.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- **Proposition (P):** The point that Trump is trying to prove is that he is a strong leader.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- **Reason (R):** The causal basis presented is that a poll shows that a majority of people think he is a strong leader.

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- **Proof of Reason (PR):** Trump uses the results of the ABC News/Washington Post Poll where 53% said they consider him a strong leader.

### Step 4: Evaluation of Reasoning and Proof
- Assess whether the Reason (<R>) conclusively demonstrates the Proposition (<P>).
- Evaluate if the proof provided (<PR>) sufficiently supports the Reason (<R>).

### Step 5: Identification of Defects
Evaluate the argument in the context of the defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: The assertion in <P> might apply only to a subset rather than universally.
   - If the poll represents only a biased sample and not the entire population, this could be classified as a generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Check if all relevant possibilities are considered.
   - If other important polls or evidence contradict these findings but are ignored, it might be classified as incomplete enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Whether the Reason fails to conclusively demonstrate <P>.
   - If a poll alone is not a sufficient basis to determine the strength of leadership conclusively, it might be inconclusive reason.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Whether the Reason itself is not compelling.
   - If the poll results are not robust enough, it might indicate an insufficient causal basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The Reason is just a restatement of the Proposition.
   - If the poll is being used just to restate people's opinions without further evidence, it might be faulty repetition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assuming that the Proof of Reason is certain due to perceived universal agreement.
   - If the argument suggests the poll results are conclusive simply because they are widely agreed upon, without additional evidence, it can be presumptuous consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Ambiguity in the presented arguments.
   - If the term "strong leader" is vague or can be interpreted in multiple ways without clear definition, it could be ambiguous language use.

### Step 6: Application and Classification
Using the criteria above, we classify the given string:

- **Generalization (G)**: There seems to be an overgeneralization because it is based on a particular poll, which may not represent the entire population. Hence, it might fit <G>.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The Reason provided (the poll results) do not conclusively establish the Proposition (that he is a strong leader). Hence, it might fit <IR>.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The poll results alone may not provide a compelling causal basis to claim the status of being a strong leader. Hence, it might fit <WCB>.

Given the argument's flaws in reasoning and evidence, the defect classifications **<G>**, **<IR>**, and **<WCB>** seem most applicable.

### Conclusion
The provided argument has several defects: it overgeneralizes from a specific poll, the reason provided is inconclusive, and there is insufficient causal basis.
