For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "Everyone seems to support the changes in the vacation policy, and if everyone likes them, they must be good," we need to follow the steps to decompose the advanced task <IDA> (classifying the string as one of the defective argument types) into specific steps, then execute them. The following steps should facilitate this:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for Classifying the Argument

1. **Extract the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - The statement that is intended to be proven. Here, "<P>" can be identified as "the changes in the vacation policy are good."

2. **Extract the Reason (<R>)**:
   - The causal basis provided for the <P>. Here, "<R>" is "Everyone seems to support the changes in the vacation policy, and if everyone likes them."

3. **Determine if the <R> is Incomplete or Assumed**:
   - Check if the reason provided makes any assumptions or leaves out possible scenarios.

4. **Identify Any Implicit Arguments or Proofs of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - Examine if there are any additional arguments intended to support <R>, whether explicitly given or implied.

5. **Match the Defective Argument Type**:
   - Compare the identified types with Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

### Applying the Steps to the Given String

1. **Extract the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - The changes in the vacation policy are good.

2. **Extract the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Everyone seems to support the changes in the vacation policy, and if everyone likes them, they must be good.

3. **Determine if the <R> is Incomplete or Assumed**:
   - The reason involves an assumption that the majority's support implies the quality of the policy. This may not necessarily provide a strong causal basis.

4. **Identify Any Implicit Arguments or Proofs of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - There are no additional explicit arguments supporting the reason beyond the assumptions of majority approval.

5. **Match the Defective Argument Type**:
   - The most fitting type here is Presumptuous Consensus (FU). The reason given implies that since everyone supports it, it must be good, which is an assumption that universal agreement determines the correctness.

### Conclusion

By applying <IDAA>, the given string "Everyone seems to support the changes in the vacation policy, and if everyone likes them, they must be good." is classified under the defective argument type <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).
