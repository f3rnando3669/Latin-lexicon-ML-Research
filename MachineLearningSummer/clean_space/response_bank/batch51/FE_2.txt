For 
To apply IDAA (decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument) to the given string "It is either you are for the US war on terror or against it," we will decompose the task of classifying this string into specific steps. Let's proceed with the decomposition and classification:

### Step 1: Understand the Argument
First, analyze the given argument to understand its structure and the proposition presented.

**Argument:** "It is either you are for the US war on terror or against it."

#### Analysis:
- **Proposition (\<P\>):** The statement sets up a binary choice without room for neutral or alternative positions.
- **Reason (\<R\>):** Implicitly suggests that these are the only two possible positions one can take regarding the US war on terror.

### Step 2: Examine for Defective Argument Types
Next, examine if the structure of this argument corresponds to any of the defined defective argument types.

#### Check for Generalization (\<G\>):
- **Generalization (\<G\>):** Not applicable here as the proposition is not based on a generalized assertion from a sample to the whole.

#### Check for Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>):
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>):** This argument type is characterized by claiming to list all possible options but missing some pertinent ones.
  - **Assessment:** The argument creates a false dichotomy or limited choice, presenting only two mutually exclusive possibilities and ignoring other potential positions (e.g., neutral or varied opinions on specifics of the war on terror).

Based on this, it fits **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** because it fails to consider all pertinent possibilities.

#### Check for Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>):
- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>):** Not directly relevant here since there's no causal reason directly supporting the proposition.

#### Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>):
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>):** Not immediately applicable as the proposition does not provide a causal basis.

#### Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>):
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>):** No repetition is evident.

#### Check for Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>):
- **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>):** Not the issue in focus.

#### Check for Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>):
- **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>):** No apparent ambiguity in the language.

### Step 3: Conclude Classification
Based on the analysis above, the defective argument type fits the description of **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**.

### Conclusion
Applying IDAA to the argument "It is either you are for the US war on terror or against it," we classify the defective argument as **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**. This classification is based on the recognition that the proposition falsely limits the range of options to only two, neglecting other possible positions.
