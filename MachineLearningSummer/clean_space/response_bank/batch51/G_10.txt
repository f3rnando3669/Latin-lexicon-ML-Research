To apply "the application of decomposition into specific steps" (IDAA) to the task of classifying the given string, weâ€™ll break down the task (IDA) into explicit steps and then follow these steps to classify the string in question.

### Decomposition of IDA (Define <D>)

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine the primary assertion that is being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the causal basis provided to support the <P>.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Identify any additional arguments or evidence that corroborate the <R>.
4. **Evaluate for Defective Argument Types**:
   - Check if the argument is a **Generalization (<G>)**.
   - Check if the argument is an **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**.
   - Check if the argument has an **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**.
   - Check if the argument has an **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
   - Check if the argument involves a **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**.
   - Check if the argument demonstrates **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**.
   - Check if the argument utilizes **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**.

We proceed to apply these steps to the given string: "Four out of five dentists recommend Happy Glossy Smiley toothpaste brand. Therefore, it must be great."

### Step-by-Step IDAA Application

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: The primary assertion here is "Therefore, it must be great."
   - Proposition (<P>): "It must be great."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: The causal basis provided to support the proposition is "Four out of five dentists recommend Happy Glossy Smiley toothpaste brand."
   - Reason (<R>): "Four out of five dentists recommend Happy Glossy Smiley toothpaste brand."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Check if there are any additional arguments or evidence that support the provided reason.
   - Proof of Reason (<PR>): There is no additional argument provided beyond the recommendation by the dentists.

4. **Evaluate for Defective Argument Types**:

   - **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument could be a generalization if it makes a broad assertion based on a sample that may not represent the whole.
     - Analysis: The statement is asserting the greatness of the toothpaste based on the recommendation of 80% of dentists, implying this should hold universally.
     - Result: This is a strong candidate for <G> (Generalization).

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument could be an incomplete enumeration if it claims to have considered all possibilities but has not.
     - Analysis: The string does not claim to have considered all brands or all dentists.
     - Result: Not likely <FE>.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The argument may have an inconclusive reason if the reason does not sufficiently support the proposition.
     - Analysis: The recommendation by dentists is a type of reason but whether it compulsorily leads to the conclusion that the toothpaste is "great" is debatable.
     - Result: Potentially <IR>, but not the strongest candidate.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reason provided might be weak if it does not compellingly establish the <P>.
     - Analysis: The reason, based on a survey of dentists, may not be sufficient to prove the toothpaste's greatness.
     - Result: Potential <WCB>, but not the strongest.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: If the reason simply repeats the proposition without adding any valuable information.
     - Analysis: The reason does present new information (dentist recommendations), not merely a restatement.
     - Result: Not <RR>.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Assume consensus where there is none, claiming universal agreement.
     - Analysis: The reason is based on a statistic, not an assumed universal truth.
     - Result: Not <FU>.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: If ambiguous language creates confusion.
     - Analysis: The language in the statement is relatively straightforward.
     - Result: Not <DEP>.

### Conclusion

- The most fitting classification for this argument type is **<G>** (Generalization), as it makes a broad assertion about the product's quality based on a subset (dentists) that may not represent all factors that contribute to something being "great."

Thus, the string "Four out of five dentists recommend Happy Glossy Smiley toothpaste brand. Therefore, it must be great." is classified as a **Generalization (<G>)**.
