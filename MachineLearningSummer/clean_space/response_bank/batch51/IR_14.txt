For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "Did John ever give up his bad habits?", we'll follow the breakdown as laid out in the definitions.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D> applied to <IDA>):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - We need to identify what is being asserted or questioned in the string.
   - In this case, the string is posing a question about whether John gave up his bad habits. Although it's presented as a question, it implicitly suggests the proposition: "John has or had bad habits" and implies doubts about him giving them up.

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - Since this string itself is a question and not a complete argument, it doesn't provide a Reason (R) connected explicitly to the Proposition (P). Instead, it is merely raising a doubt or asking for information.

3. **Classify the Argument**:
   - Here, we need to classify if the string fits into any of the defective argument types defined: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.
   - We do this by comparing the nature of the question to the definitions of defective arguments:
     - **Generalization (G)**: This doesn't generalize anything.
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The question doesn't enumerate anything.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: No reason is given here.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There's no causal basis presented.
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: There's no repetition.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: No consensus is referred to.

4. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
   - Does the question "Did John ever give up his bad habits?" involve ambiguous language?
     - The question is straightforward and possesses no ambiguity in the language usedâ€”it clearly questions the status of John's bad habits.

Since none of the other defective argument types apply to the string and it doesn't involve ambiguous language, it seems not to fit into the categories <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP> as provided in the definitions.

### Conclusion:

- The string "Did John ever give up his bad habits?" does not present a complete argument and thus can't be classified as a defective argument of types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.
- Instead, it's simply a question without the components necessary (Proposition, Reason, Proof of Reason) to constitute an argument where such defects could be identified.

This completes the application of <IDAA> to the given string.
