For 
To execute <IDAA> on the given string "The Bible is the Word of God because God tells us it is... in the Bible. X is true because of Y. Y is true because of X.", we'll follow the predefined task <D> which decomposes the task into specific steps.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - The claim or assertion being made.
   - Here, the proposition is: "The Bible is the Word of God."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - The causal basis for the proposition.
   - Here, the reason given is: "because God tells us it is... in the Bible."

3. **Evaluate the Types of Defective Arguments:**
   - We need to classify the statement into one of the defective argument types.

4. **Match the Reason with Criteria:**
   - Compare the identified reason with the types of defective arguments <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>.

### Applying <IDAA>:

1. **Proposition (P):**
   - "The Bible is the Word of God."

2. **Reason (R):**
   - "because God tells us it is... in the Bible."
   - Rephrasing the reason in generalized terms is: "X is true because of Y. Y is true because of X."

3. **Classify the Reason (R):**
   - Let's examine the reason against each type of defective argument.

    - **<G> (Generalization):**
      - No indications here that it makes a sweeping generalization based on a part of the group rather than the whole.

    - **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):**
      - There is no mention of enumeration of possibilities; thus, this does not apply.

    - **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):**
      - The reason here is not about being inconclusive; rather, it forms a circular logic.

    - **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):**
      - The reason seems to be restating the proposition in different terms making no advancement in the argument itself.
      - "The Bible is the Word of God because God tells us it is in the Bible" makes reason (R) simply a repetition of the original claim in different words.

    - **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):**
      - The causal basis is certainly not compelling. It relies on the Bible to validate itself.

    - **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):**
      - There's no appeal to the consensus of universal agreement.

    - **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):**
      - The language itself is not necessarily ambiguous; the fallacy lies in the structure rather than the interpretation of terms.

4. **Final Classification:**
   - The reason given here falls best under <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition) because it reiterates what was already stated without providing a validating argument external to the Proposition itself.
   - Additionally, if we consider the overall argument more deeply, it also fits <WCB> as it does not give a compelling causal basis for the claim.

### Conclusion

The given string "The Bible is the Word of God because God tells us it is... in the Bible. X is true because of Y. Y is true because of X." is primarily of type <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), with a secondary classification potentially as <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
