To apply the process of decomposing the task of classifying the given argument (task <IDA>) into specific steps (task <D>) and then applying it (IDAA), we can proceed as follows:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Application:

#### Step 1: Identify Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), and Proof of Reason (<PR>) in the Argument

- Proposition (<P>): "That guy's Mexican."
- Reason (<R>): "He's wearing a sombrero."
- Proof of Reason (<PR>): Not explicitly provided in the argument.

#### Step 2: Evaluate the Argument Structure

- The argument clearly presents a Proposition (<P>) and a Reason (<R>). There is no explicit Proof of Reason (<PR>) given.

#### Step 3: Determine Which Defective Argument Type Applies

Given the components of the argument, now we classify it according to the defective argument types defined:

1. **Generalization (G)**: The proposition makes an assertion about an individual's nationality based on a characteristic (wearing a sombrero), which may not necessarily be representative of all individuals of that nationality.
   - Evaluation: Wearing a sombrero is not a definitive characteristic of all Mexicans; it's a stereotype.
   - Conclusion: This matches the definition of a Generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Does the argument imply a complete enumeration of cases?
   - Evaluation: No, it does not. It only offers one reasoning, not a purportedly complete list.
   - Conclusion: Incomplete Enumeration does not apply.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Does the reason conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
   - Evaluation: Wearing a sombrero does not conclusively demonstrate that someone is Mexican; people of other nationalities can also wear sombreros.
   - Conclusion: This matches the definition of an Inconclusive Reason.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Is the reason, by itself, compelling to establish the proposition?
   - Evaluation: The reason is not compelling; it is a weak basis for the claim.
   - Conclusion: This matches the definition of Insufficient Causal Basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Does the reason simply reiterate the proposition?
   - Evaluation: The reason ("he's wearing a sombrero") is not a repetition of the proposition ("he's Mexican").
   - Conclusion: Faulty Repetition of Proposition does not apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Is the proof of reason assumed as certain based on supposed universal agreement?
   - Evaluation: There is no proof of reason provided that claims universal agreement.
   - Conclusion: Presumptuous Consensus does not apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Could the reason or proof of reason be taken in another sense than intended?
   - Evaluation: The language is not ambiguous; it is just a stereotype.
   - Conclusion: Ambiguous Language Use does not apply.

#### Step 4: Determine the Primary Classification

Since multiple defective argument types apply, we'll need to identify the one that most accurately captures the defectiveness:

1. **Generalization (G)** seems to be the most fitting because the argument relies on a stereotypical assumption that wearing a sombrero indicates being Mexican, which is a form of overgeneralizing.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** are also relevant, but they could be seen as subtypes of the broader generalization problem.

### Final Classification:

The defective argument is best classified as **<G> (Generalization)** as it shows a salient form of overgeneralizing based on a single characteristic that does not necessarily apply to all individuals of a certain nationality.

Thus, applying IDAA to "You can tell that guy's Mexican - he's wearing a sombrero" results in the classification of the argument as **Generalization (G)**.
