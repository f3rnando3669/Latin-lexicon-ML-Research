For 
To apply the process of decomposing the advanced task of classifying the given string according to the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>), we will follow these specific steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Examine the given argument to find the main assertion or claim that is being made.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine what rationale or causal basis is provided to support the proposition.

3. **Identify Possible Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Look for any additional arguments that corroborate the reason.

4. **Evaluate the Argument:**
   - Analyze the completeness and soundness of each part of the argument. 
   - Check if the proposition is a generalization, if the enumeration of possibilities is incomplete, if the reason provided is inconclusive, if there is any repetition, if the causal basis is insufficient, if there is a presumptuous consensus, or if ambiguous language is used.

5. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:**
   - Based on the evaluation, determine the specific type of defective argument from the list provided.

Let's apply these steps to the provided argument:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
- The proposition is: "you shouldn't listen to her."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>):**
- The reason given is: "Starkk is an ugly, bitter person."

**Step 3: Identify Possible Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
- In this argument, there is no additional proof provided to corroborate the reason.

**Step 4: Evaluate the Argument:**
- The reason provided ("Starkk is an ugly, bitter person") is aimed at attacking Andrea Starkk's character rather than addressing the content of her argument about media harming women's body image.
- This type of attack is not concerned with the actual merits of the proposition, which makes the argument fallacious rather than being a structured logical proof.

**Step 5: Classify the Defective Argument Type:**
- Given the nature of the reason, it seems to fall under a logical fallacy known as an ad hominem attack, which is not directly listed among <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP> but can be considered related to the forms that constitute insufficient rational basis for the argument.

Since <IDA> pertains to classifying <s> specifically within the defective argument types listed, it appears to be most closely related to <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) because:
- The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. Instead, it relies on an irrelevant personal attack.

Thus, the task of applying <IDAA> to the given string classifies the argument as:
**<IR>** - Inconclusive Reason.
