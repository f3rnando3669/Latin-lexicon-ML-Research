To apply the classification task (IDA) step by step (IDAA) on the given argument "Jews are lice; They cause typhus (Painful/deadly disease)," we need to decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps. Here's the procedure for IDAA:

### Step 1: Identify and Define Parts of the Argument

**Proposition (P):** 
Identify the primary assertion being made.

- **P:** Jews are lice.

**Reason (R):** 
Identify the causal basis provided for the proposition.

- **R:** They (Jews) cause typhus (a painful/deadly disease).

### Step 2: Analyze for Defective Argument Types

Now we need to apply the definitions of defective argument types to assess if the argument contains any.

#### **Generalization (G):**
- Definition: <P> is an assertion based on some one part or a majority of individuals, but not necessarily applicable to all, is referred to all.
- Analysis: The proposition "Jews are lice" is a sweeping generalization about an entire group based on an unwarranted assertion. 

#### **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
- Definition: <P> claims to have made a complete enumeration of the possibilities but missed out on some pertinent ones.
- Analysis: Not applicable here as the argument does not explicitly enumerate possibilities.

#### **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
- Definition: <R> does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the <P>.
- Analysis: The reason given (they cause typhus) does not logically establish that "Jews are lice." The assertion is sensational and unfounded.

#### **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
- Definition: <R> is weak if the causal basis which it submits for the <P> is not a compelling one.
- Analysis: The causal basis "they cause typhus" is scientifically incorrect and racially prejudiced, thus it's insufficient.

#### **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
- Definition: <R> is weak when it appears to be a repetition of the <P>.
- Analysis: "Jews are lice" and "They cause typhus" are different assertions, so this defect does not apply.

#### **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
- Definition: <PR> is assumed as certain based on universal agreement on a disputed issue.
- Analysis: There is no presumption of consensus in the given argument.

#### **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
- Definition: <PR> can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended.
- Analysis: There is no evident ambiguity in wording, although the terms are grossly offensive and inappropriate.

### Step 3: Final Classification

We now determine which defective argument types fit the given argument:

- **G: Generalization:** The assertion "Jews are lice" is a clear example of generalization, attributing a negative characteristic to an entire group based on no evidence.
- **IR: Inconclusive Reason:** The stated reason does not logically support the proposition.
- **WCB: Insufficient Causal Basis:** The reason (they cause typhus) provided is blatantly incorrect and racially motivated. 

### Conclusion

Thus, the argument "Jews are lice; They cause typhus (Painful/deadly disease)" is classified as having defective argument types <G> (Generalization), <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
