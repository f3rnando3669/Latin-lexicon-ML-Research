To apply the IDAA (the decomposition of the task of IDA into specific steps) to the given statement "You moved the goalposts or made up an exception when your claim was shown to be false," we'll need to break down the task of classifying the argument into specific steps. We aim to identify which defective argument type it corresponds to.

Let's go through the steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Definitions of Defective Argument Types
First, let's quickly recap the definitions of the defective argument types:
1. **Generalization (G)**: An assertion based on some part or majority but applied to all.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Claiming complete enumeration of possibilities but missing some.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Reason does not conclusively prove the proposition.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis is not compelling.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Reason restates the proposition without adding new information.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assumes proof is certain because "it is universally agreed upon" while still in dispute.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Language can be interpreted in another sense than intended.

### Step 2: Analyze the Statement
The statement "You moved the goalposts or made up an exception when your claim was shown to be false" implies that there is a shift in the argument or criteria after an initial proposition was disproved.

### Step 3: Identify the Key Elements
- **Proposition (P)**: The original claim made by the speaker.
- **Reason (R)**: The basis or criteria given for proving the claim.
- **Proof of Reason (PR)**: Supporting arguments or evidence for the reason.

In this case:
- The initial claim was disproved (indicating there was a change).
- Moving the goalposts implies altering the criteria to maintain the claim.
- Making an exception suggests adding a new, unoriginal condition to maintain the truth of the claim.

### Step 4: Match the Defective Argument Types
- **Generalization** (G): Not applicable, as the issue here is not about applying a part to the whole.
- **Incomplete Enumeration** (FE): This involves missing out some possibilities, not changing criteria or making exceptions.
- **Inconclusive Reason** (IR): The reason might be valid; the issue is altering the criteria.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis** (WCB): The reason might not be questioned here for strength.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition** (RR): Not applicable, as there's no repetitive aspect identified.
- **Presumptuous Consensus** (FU): No reliance on universal agreement is present here.
- **Ambiguous Language Use** (DEP): The statement does not seem ambiguous in language.

### Step 5: Conclude the Classification
The best fit for this scenario is **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** and possibly parts of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. The action of "moving the goalposts" or "making up an exception" suggests that not all pertinent conditions were considered initially (hence, Incomplete Enumeration), or it indicates that the reasons tied to the original proposition were inconclusive, prompting the change.

### Final Conclusion
The given string "You moved the goalposts or made up an exception when your claim was shown to be false" can be classified primarily as an **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** because the individual is adjusting criteria post-argument to omit possibilities initially not considered, plus elements of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** due to the insufficient support that led them to change the state of their argument.

To summarize, through the detailed breakdown and analytical steps, we determine that the statement aligns closely with both these defective argument types.
