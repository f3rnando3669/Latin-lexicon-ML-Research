For 
To apply <IDAA> to the provided argument, we need to follow the steps of decomposition (<D>) for classifying the string <s> according to the types of defective arguments specified. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
The proposition (or claim) in the given argument is:
- "You better take the story of Adam and Eve literally, before the phrase, “that chicken looks delicious”, takes on a whole new meaning."

This is the central claim that the argument is trying to prove.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
The reason provided for the proposition is:
- If you don't take the story of Adam and Eve literally, you will end up becoming a dirty atheist with no morals.

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason <PR>
The proof of the reason is the sequence of steps that show how one may go from accepting the Adam and Eve story as figurative to having immoral behavior:
- Accepting the story of Adam and Eve as figurative leads to viewing Old Testament stories as figurative.
- Viewing Old Testament stories as figurative leads to confusion about the New Testament and Jesus.
- Confusion about Jesus leads to doubting his resurrection.
- Doubting the resurrection leads to not being a Christian, which then leads to becoming an atheist.
- Becoming an atheist leads to having no morals and engaging in morally reprehensible behavior.

### Step 4: Decompose <t> into specific steps (<D>):
We need to break down the process of identifying which defective argument type(s) the given string <s> falls into:
1. Check if the argument contains a generalization (G).
2. Check if the argument claims incomplete enumeration (FE).
3. Check if the reasoning is inconclusive (IR).
4. Check if the reasoning is a faulty repetition of the proposition (RR).
5. Check if the causal basis is insufficient (WCB).
6. Check if the proof of reason assumes a presumptuous consensus (FU).
7. Check if the argument uses ambiguous language (DEP).

### Step 5: Apply <D> to <IDA> (Classify the String):
Let’s apply each check to see which defective argument type(s) the provided string falls under:

1. **Generalization (G)**: 
   - The argument makes a broad generalization about what will happen if one accepts the story of Adam and Eve as figurative. It implies that this will lead to a series of steps inevitably resulting in immoral behavior for everyone, without considering individual differences.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - The argument does not enumerate all possible outcomes of accepting the story as figurative. It misses out on possibilities such as remaining a moral person or interpreting the Bible in a way that still supports Christian values.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The steps from taking the story figuratively to becoming amoral are highly tenuous and not conclusively demonstrated.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - The reasoning presented reiterates the claim ("if you don't take it literally, you will have no morals") without providing new logical support.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - The causal basis (accepting a figurative interpretation leads to immorality) is weak and not compelling. There is no evidence provided to show a definite cause-and-effect relationship.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - This argument does not explicitly use universal agreement to assume a point, so this does not apply here.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
   - The argument involves clear exaggerated rhetoric rather than ambiguous language.

### Conclusion:
The argument can be classified primarily under:
- **Generalization (G)**: It generalizes the consequences of interpreting the Adam and Eve story figuratively.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: It fails to account for all possible outcomes of interpreting the story figuratively.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning provided does not conclusively support the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis for the proposition is insufficiently compelling.

Thus, the final classification of the argument based on <IDAA> would be:
**G, FE, IR, WCB**.
