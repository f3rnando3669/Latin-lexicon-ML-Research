To apply IDAA (the decomposition of identifying a defective argument type into specific steps) to the given string, we'll follow a structured approach. Here are the detailed steps:

### Step 1: Understand and Breakdown the Argument

1. **Identify the proposition (P)**:
   - The proposition is the main claim being made. 
   - In the argument: "I think it is all right to execute insane people."

2. **Identify the reason (R)**:
   - The reason sets forth the causal basis for the proposition.
   - In the argument: "If we ban executions of insane people, then everybody on death row will suddenly decide they are insane and purposely fail sanity tests."

3. **Examine the proof of reason (PR)**:
   - Proof of reason corroborates the reason through additional arguments or evidence.
   - In the argument: "It would result in chaos."

### Step 2: Determine If the Argument is Defective

Based on the definition of defective argument types, we will classify the argument as one of the seven types described (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

### Step 3: Classify the Argument Defect

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - This does not fit as a generalization because the claim about executing insane people is not based on the majority but rather a specific concern.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - This is not about listing possibilities and missing some.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - This could fit if the reason fails to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - This does not fit since the reason is not simply a restatement of the proposition.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - This could fit if the causal basis provided is weak or not compelling enough.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - This does not fit as there is no assumption of universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
   - This does not fit since the argument does not rely on ambiguous language.

### Step 4: Analyze the Reasonâ€™s Effectiveness

We will focus on IR and WCB and see if either applies more appropriately.

- **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**: Does the reason "If we ban executions of insane people, then everybody on death row will suddenly decide they are insane and purposely fail sanity tests" conclusively prove that executing insane people is all right? The chain of reasoning here is not strong because it relies on a speculative scenario that is not guaranteed to occur or be widespread enough to justify the proposition.

- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: Examining the causal basis, the reason assumes a causal relationship that may not be compelling. The argument bases on the assumption that insanity would be feigned widely. This assumption is weak and lacks evidence to support its plausibility, leading the causal relationship to seem insufficient.

### Step 5: Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the argument is classified as **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**. The reason provided does not present a compelling enough causal basis to justify the proposition that it is all right to execute insane people. The potential scenario of faking insanity and the resulting chaos is speculative and lacks substantiation, making the causal connection weak.

Thus, applying the steps of IDAA to the given argument string, we classify it as a defective argument of type WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis).
