For 
To apply <IDAA> to "The museum's new gemstones and precious minerals exhibit needs more security guards. If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal a piece of the exhibit," we will decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps and proceed step by step.

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The proposition in the given argument is: "The museum's new gemstones and precious minerals exhibit needs more security guards."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason given to support the proposition is: "If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal a piece of the exhibit."

3. **Classify the <R> based on its type:**
   - Analyze the reason to determine if it falls under any defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

   Let's analyze each type:

   - **<G> (Generalization):** The argument does not appear to be a generalization made from a part to the whole.
   - **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):** There is no indication that this is an incomplete enumeration of possibilities.
   - **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** Although the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition, we should consider other classifications first.
   - **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The given reason does not provide a genuine causal basis for the proposition.
   - **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** The reason presented does not simply repeat the proposition.
   - **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):** The argument does not appeal to consensus as a basis for the proof of reason.
   - **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):** The argument does not appear to use language ambiguously.

4. **Determine the closest matching defective argument type:**
   - The reason given ("If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal a piece of the exhibit") is an ad hominem attack, implying that anyone who disagrees has a malicious intent rather than addressing the actual reason for needing more security guards. This kind of argument can be classified as an **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** because it does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition and improperly assumes malicious intent for disagreement.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The given argument should be classified as <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) because the reason provided does not directly support the proposition and instead diverts attention by maligning potential dissenters.

Thus, by following the steps outlined in <IDAA>, we classify the argument as <IR>.
