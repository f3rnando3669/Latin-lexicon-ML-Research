For 
To apply <IDAA> (decomposition of the task into specific steps) to the argument "It’s getting late, and we still have to decide on the school budget. What do you say we just leave it as is and we can call it a night?", we need to follow a step-by-step breakdown to identify the argument's type among the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>):

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
First, define what the proposition is:

- **Proposition (<P>)**: "We should leave the school budget as it is."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Next, define the reason given to support the proposition:

- **Reason (<R>)**: "It’s getting late, and we still have to decide on the school budget."

### Step 3: Check for Proof of Reason (<PR>)
Determine if there is any proof provided to support the reason:

- **Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: There is no additional argument providing proof or support for the reason in the given statement.

### Step 4: Evaluate the completeness and validity of the argument
Now, evaluate the completeness and validity of each part (proposition, reason, and proof).

### Step 5: Compare with Defective Argument Types
Compare the identified components with each of the defective argument types to classify the argument.

- **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement does not generalize from a single instance or majority to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement does not involve an enumeration of possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason given is that it's late, which does not conclusively demonstrate why the school budget should be left as is.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis ("It’s getting late") is weak and not compelling to establish the proposition about the school budget.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The reason provided does not simply restate the proposition in different words.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: There is no claim that the proposition is universally agreed upon.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: There does not appear to be ambiguous language use in the statement.

Among the defective argument types, the most fitting classification is:
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reason ("It’s getting late") is not compelling enough to justify the proposition ("We should leave the school budget as it is").

### Conclusion
The given argument "It’s getting late, and we still have to decide on the school budget. What do you say we just leave it as is and we can call it a night?" fits best as an **argument of type <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**, where the causal basis provided is weak and not compelling.
