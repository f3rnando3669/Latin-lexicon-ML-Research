For 
To apply \( IDAA \) to the given string, "Only a mentally ill person would kill someone, so anyone who kills someone is automatically mentally ill," let's decompose the task \( IDA \) into specific steps.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition \( D \) for \( IDA \):
1. **Identify the Proposition \((P)\)**: Determine what is being asserted or claimed in the argument.
2. **Determine the Reason \((R)\)**: Identify the causal basis or reason supporting the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason \((PR)\)**: Look for any additional arguments or evidence supporting the reason.
4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**: Based on the definitions provided, classify the argument into one of the defective types (\(G\), \(FE\), \(IR\), \(RR\), \(WCB\), \(FU\), \(DEP\)).

Applying these steps to "Only a mentally ill person would kill someone, so anyone who kills someone is automatically mentally ill":

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition \((P)\)
- **Proposition \((P)\)**: "Anyone who kills someone is automatically mentally ill."
  - This is the main claim or assertion the argument makes.

### Step 2: Determine the Reason \((R)\)
- **Reason \((R)\)**: "Only a mentally ill person would kill someone."
  - This is the causal basis provided for the proposition.

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason \((PR)\)**
- **Proof of Reason \((PR)\)**: This particular argument does not explicitly include additional supporting evidence beyond the reason. However, it is a single unit of argumentation where the reason itself is supposed to support the proposition directly.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type
- To classify the defective argument, we consider the relationships and implications of the \(P\) and \(R\):

  **Evaluation**:
- **Generalization \((G)\)**: The argument does not base the assertion on a majority or part applied to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration \((FE)\)**: The argument does not involve an incomplete list of possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason \((IR)\)**: Yes, the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. The assertion that "only a mentally ill person would kill someone" is not conclusively substantiated and is a sweeping claim without supporting evidence.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis \((WCB)\)**: The reason provided is weak because the causal basis (mentally ill always leads to killing) is unsubstantiated and generalized without compelling evidence.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition \((RR)\)**: The reason is different from the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus \((FU)\)**: The argument does not appeal to a universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use \((DEP)\)**: The terms used are not particularly ambiguous but rather misrepresent complex causality.

Considering the above evaluation, the defective argument type is identified as:

- **\(IR\) Inconclusive Reason**: The reason "only a mentally ill person would kill someone" does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition, "anyone who kills someone is automatically mentally ill".

Thus, after performing the decomposition steps for \(IDAA\), we classify the argument as \(IR\) because the reason provided does not conclusively prove the proposition.
