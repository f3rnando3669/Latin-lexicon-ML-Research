For 
To apply IDAA (decomposition of the task of classifying the argument into defective argument types) to the given statement, "President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up. Jones is responsible for the rise in crime," we need to:

1. Identify the Proposition (P)
2. Identify the Reason (R)
3. Assess the Proposition (P) and Reason (R) for any defective argument types
4. Classify the argument according to the identified defective argument types

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**

   The Proposition (P) is the central claim the argument intends to prove.
   - In this case, the Proposition (P) is: "Jones is responsible for the rise in crime."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**

   The Reason (R) is the basis provided to support the Proposition.
   - The Reason (R) given here is: "President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up."

3. **Assess the Proposition (P) and Reason (R) for any defective argument types:**

   - **Generalization (G):** This argument doesn't seem to be a generalization, as it addresses a specific instance rather than a generalization from one or a few to many.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument doesn’t attempt to enumerate possibilities, so FE doesn’t apply.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The Reason (R) given doesn't sufficiently or conclusively demonstrate that the rise in violent crime is caused by the tax increase. The sequence of events alone is not enough to establish a causal link definitively; therefore the Reason (R) is inconclusive.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The Reason (R) gives a sequence ("President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up") but does not provide a compelling causal basis to establish that the tax increase caused the rise in violent crime. More evidence would be needed to demonstrate this link.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The Reason (R) is not just a repetition of the Proposition (P), so this defect doesn’t apply.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument does not rely on presumed consensus; it is specific to the sequence of events provided.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language here is not particularly ambiguous; it’s clear in its intent.

4. **Classify the argument according to the identified defective argument types:**

   Given the above analysis, the defective argument types that apply here are:
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The Reason is insufficient to conclusively demonstrate the Proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The Reason lacks a compelling causal basis to link the tax increase directly to the rise in crime.

So, the classification of the argument type for the string "President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up. Jones is responsible for the rise in crime" results in it having defects of type **IR** (Inconclusive Reason) and **WCB** (Insufficient Causal Basis).
