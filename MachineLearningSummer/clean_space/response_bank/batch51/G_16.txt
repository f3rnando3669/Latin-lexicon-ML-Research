For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to the statement "My first day of basketball practice was easy, so it will always be easy," we need to decompose the task of classifying the string into specific steps and then apply those steps to the string. Let's break down this process carefully.

### Decomposition of \(\text{IDA}\) (\( \text{D} \))

1. **Identify the Proposition (\(\text{P}\)):**
   - Determine the main claim or assertion in the string.

2. **Determine the Reason (\(\text{R}\)):**
   - Identify what causal basis or reason is given to support the proposition.

3. **Analyze the Type of Argument:**
   - Compare the identified \(\text{P}\) and \(\text{R}\) against the definitions of defective argument types (\(\text{G}\), \(\text{FE}\), \(\text{IR}\), \(\text{RR}\), \(\text{WCB}\), \(\text{FU}\), \(\text{DEP}\)).

### Application to the Given String (Step-by-Step Process)

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\(\text{P}\))

The string "My first day of basketball practice was easy, so it will always be easy" contains the proposition:
   - "It will always be easy."

#### Step 2: Determine the Reason (\(\text{R}\))

The reason given in the string to support the proposition is:
   - "My first day of basketball practice was easy."

#### Step 3: Analyze the Type of Argument

Now, we compare the identified elements against the defective argument types:

- **Generalization (\(\text{G}\)):** 
  This defective argument involves making a broad assertion based on a limited or non-representative sample. Here, the assertion that basketball practice will "always" be easy is based on the experience of a single day (the first day).
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\(\text{FE}\)):** 
  This defective argument involves claiming completeness when not all possibilities are considered. This is not directly applicable here since no enumeration is presented.
  
- **Inconclusive Reason (\(\text{IR}\)):** 
  While the reasoning could be seen as weak, it does not directly imply that the reason itself is not possible to prove but rather is insufficient due to its generalization.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(\text{WCB}\)):** 
  The reason might be seen as insufficiently compelling, but again this primarily overlaps with generalization.
  
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(\text{RR}\)):** 
  The reason here is not a mere repetition of the proposition.
  
- **Presumptuous Consensus (\(\text{FU}\)):** 
  No consensus is assumed in this argument.
  
- **Ambiguous Language Use (\(\text{DEP}\)):** 
  There is no ambiguous language use in the string.

Comparing the analysis, the argument type that fits best is **Generalization (\(\text{G}\))** because the assertion that basketball practice will "always be easy" is made based on the experience of only one day, which is not sufficient to make a broad and definitive conclusion about all future practices.

### Conclusion

Based on the step-by-step application of \( \text{IDAA} \) to the given string, we classify the string "My first day of basketball practice was easy, so it will always be easy" as a defective argument of type \( \text{G} \) (Generalization).
