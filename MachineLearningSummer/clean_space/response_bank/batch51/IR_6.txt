For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of IDA into specific steps) to the task of classifying the given argument, "Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist and perhaps the foremost expert in the field, says that evolution is true. Therefore, it's true," let's break down the process step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
The proposition <P> is the statement or assertion that we aim to prove.
- **Proposition <P>**: "Evolution is true."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
The reason <R> provides the causal basis or justification for the proposition.
- **Reason <R>**: "Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist and perhaps the foremost expert in the field, says that evolution is true."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason <PR>
The proof of reason <PR> corroborates the reason using additional arguments or evidence. In this case, there seems to be no additional argument provided besides the authority of Richard Dawkins.

### Step 4: Evaluate for Defective Argument Types
We need to examine if the argument fits into any of the defective argument categories <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

- **Generalization <G>**: This type of defect occurs when a proposition based on one part or the majority is wrongly applied to all. This does not seem to be happening here.
- **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>**: This occurs when possibilities are left out in claiming to enumerate them all. This is not applicable here.
- **Inconclusive Reason <IR>**: This occurs when the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. This might be considered since the authority of one expert does not conclusively prove the statement.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>**: This occurs when the causal basis for the proposition is not compelling. Depending on how much weight is given to expert opinions without further evidence, this could apply.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>**: This occurs when the reason repeats the proposition without adding substance. This does not apply here, as the reason is distinct from the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>**: This occurs when something is claimed as certain because it is universally agreed upon while it is still in dispute. This situation doesn't fit this criterion since the argument is based on a specific expertâ€™s opinion.
- **Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>**: This occurs when the proof of reason can be taken in another sense than intended. This does not seem to apply.

### Step 5: Match the Argument to the Defective Argument Types
Given the breakdown:

- The reason <R> provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. Thus, it fits as an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
- Additionally, the authority of a single expert, even a foremost one, is not a compelling causal basis in the strictest logical terms. Therefore, it can also fit as an **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

### Conclusion:
After applying the IDAA process to the given argument, we classify the argument as having defects of type **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
