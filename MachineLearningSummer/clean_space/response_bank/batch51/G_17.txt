For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of <t> into specific steps) to the task of classifying the string <s> according to the given defective argument types, we'll break down the process step by step. The string in question is:

"We can’t freeze the academic year because then students won’t graduate on time. Next thing you know most people will be unemployed and will resort to crime. The crime rate will skyrocket and society will collapse."

Here are the specific steps to decompose and analyze this argument:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>

Locate the main assertion in the argument:
- Proposition <P>: "We can’t freeze the academic year."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R> 

Determine the reason provided to support the proposition:
- Reason <R>: "because then students won’t graduate on time."

### Step 3: Identify if there's a Proof of Reason <PR>

Look for any additional arguments or evidence provided to support the reason:
- Proof of Reason <PR>: 
  - "Next thing you know most people will be unemployed and will resort to crime."
  - "The crime rate will skyrocket and society will collapse."

### Step 4: Evaluate the Argument 

Now, we need to assess the argument for any defects using the provided defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: Does the argument make an unfounded broad claim based on a limited sample?
   - No, the argument seems to escalate rather than generalize from a sample.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Does the argument omit some possibilities while asserting completeness?
   - This does not directly apply. The argument is more about causation and consequences than enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Is the reason provided insufficient to conclusively establish the proposition?
   - While potentially relevant, this classification seems less fitting since the reason provided is fairly direct, even though the subsequent consequences are highly debated.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Is the causal link between the reason and the proposition weak?
   - Yes. The assertion that not graduating on time will lead to skyrocketing crime rates and societal collapse seems extreme and not compelling without strong evidence. The causal relationship is highly speculative.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Is the reason essentially a repetition of the proposition?
   - No, the reason provided is a distinct assertion (students won’t graduate on time).

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Is something assumed as true because it is "universally agreed upon"?
   - No, the argument does not rely on a supposed universal consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Is there language that can be interpreted in a different way than intended by the speaker?
   - No, the language use here does not seem ambiguous.

### Step 5: Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the most fitting defective argument type is:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument fails primarily because the causal link between freezing the academic year and the catastrophic outcomes presented (i.e., unemployment, crime increase, societal collapse) is highly tenuous and not compelling.

Hence, we classify the string <s> as being of type <WCB>.
