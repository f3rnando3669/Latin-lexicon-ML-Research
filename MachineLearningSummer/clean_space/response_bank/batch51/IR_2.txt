To apply the process of IDAA to the given example using the definitions provided, I'll decompose the task into specific steps and then proceed to classify the string. Here are the steps for IDAA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Specify what the argument is intending to prove.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Specify the causal basis for the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Specify any corroboration for the reason provided.
4. **Determine the Presence of Defective Arguments**:
    - Check for Generalization (<G>)
    - Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
    - Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
    - Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
    - Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
    - Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
    - Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)

Given this example, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Sally's proposition is an argument for a more equitable taxation system.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Sally presumably provides various reasons to support her proposition for a more equitable taxation system, but these are not specified in the provided string.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - The string does not provide specific proofs that Sally might have used to back her case. Instead, it focuses on Sam's response.

4. **Determine the Presence of Defective Arguments**:

   - The main action described in the string is Sam's response, which contains a series of attacks on Sally's character rather than addressing the substance of her argument.

   - To categorize the defective arguments present in Sam's response:
     - **Generalization (<G>)**: Sam does not use generalization.
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Sam does not make an incomplete enumeration.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Sam does not provide any reason that is inconclusive for proving the correctness of Sally’s proposition. 
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Sam does not provide a weak causal basis for the proposition either.
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Sam does not repeat Sally’s proposition as his reason.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Sam does not assume consensus in his argument.
     - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Sam does not use ambiguous language for a proof.

Sam's response mostly falls under a different common logical fallacy known as **ad hominem**, where the attack is on Sally's character rather than her argument. Given our defined defective arguments, Sam’s argument does not strictly match any defined types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

However, if we stretch definitions and assumptions:
- One might argue that Sam's attack could weakly relate to <WCB> because the reason he offers (attacks on Sally's personal character) is insufficient or irrelevant to the causal basis of proving Sally’s proposition. But strictly from the definitions provided, the argument does not fit perfectly into any of the defective categories defined directly.

### Conclusion:
The closest defective argument type to classify Sam’s response under IDAA could be loosely considered as **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** only in the sense that his attack does not provide a compelling causal basis related to the argument at hand.
