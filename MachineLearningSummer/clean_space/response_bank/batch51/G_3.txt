For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string, we will decompose the task of classifying the string as of type <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP> into specific steps. We will then execute each step to identify the correct classification.

### Steps for Decomposition of <t> into Specific Steps (<D>):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine what the statement is intending to prove or assert.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Identify the causal basis or justification given for the Proposition.
3. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**: Examine whether the argument fits any of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step-by-Step Application of <IDAA> to the String:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- **String**: "An environmental group illegally blocked loggers and workers at a nuclear plant. Therefore, environmentalists are radicals who take the law into their own hands."
- **Proposition (<P>)**: "Environmentalists are radicals who take the law into their own hands."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- **Reason (<R>)**: "An environmental group illegally blocked loggers and workers at a nuclear plant."

#### Step 3: Classify the Defective Argument Type
Now, let's examine the provided types to determine which one applies to the argument given:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This occurs when an assertion based on some part or a majority of individuals is incorrectly applied to all individuals.
   - The argument assumes that because one environmental group engaged in illegal activities, all environmentalists are radicals who take the law into their own hands. This is a classic example of overgeneralizing from specific cases to encompass an entire group.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This occurs when we claim to have made a complete enumeration of possibilities but miss some out.
   - This does not appear to be about enumeration of possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This is when the reason given does not conclusively establish the correctness of the proposition.
   - While the reason given might be considered inconclusive in a broader sense, the primary issue here is the overgeneralization.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This is when the reason is presented as the argument but repeats the same idea.
   - This is not the case here; the reason and proposition are different.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: When the reason given is insufficient or weak.
   - The reason might be considered weak, but this argument's primary issue is the overgeneralization.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This occurs when a proof is assumed certain because it is "universally agreed upon".
   - This does not apply here.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: This is when the proof can be taken in another sense than was intended.
   - This does not apply here.

### Conclusion
The argument "An environmental group illegally blocked loggers and workers at a nuclear plant. Therefore, environmentalists are radicals who take the law into their own hands." is most accurately classified as a Generalization <G>. This is because it incorrectly attributes the actions of a specific environmental group to all environmentalists.
