To apply the decomposition of the advanced task \( t \) (which, in this context, is \( IDA \)) into its specific steps (\( D \)), let's break down the process of classifying the string \( s \) into steps and subsequently apply them to the given example.

### Decomposing \( IDA \) (\( D \)):
1. **Identify the Proposition (\( P \)):**
   - Determine what is being claimed or what is intended to be proven.
2. **Identify the Reason (\( R \)):**
   - Find the causal basis or the reason given for the proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (\( PR \)):**
   - Examine any additional arguments or evidence that support the reason.
4. **Classify the Defective Argument (\( IDA \)):**
   - Based on the identified proposition, reason, and proof of reason, classify the argument as one of the defective types: \( G \), \( FE \), \( IR \), \( WCB \), \( RR \), \( FU \), or \( DEP \).

### Applying \( IDAA \):

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\( P \))
The proposition in the given string is:
- "It takes up to seven years for the human body to digest a piece of gum."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\( R \))
The reason provided (implicitly) is:
- "Studies show..."

#### Step 3: Evaluate the Proof of Reason (\( PR \))
Given:
- The statement does not provide any additional supporting details or studies. The phrase "studies show" is intended to serve as a proof but lacks specific citations or evidence.

#### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument (\( IDA \))
Now, let's check the criteria for the defective argument types against our example:

1. **Generalization (\( G \))**:
   - The \( P \) is not necessarily a generalization problem in this case.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\( FE \))**:
   - The argument does not claim to enumerate all possibilities, so it doesn't fit \( FE \) either.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \))**:
   - The reason ("studies show") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of \( P \) because there are no specific studies mentioned or explained.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \))**:
   - The causal basis is weak here, as simply stating "studies show" is not compelling without additional details or credibility.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( RR \))**:
   - The reason does not repeat the proposition directly.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\( FU \))**:
   - Implying that the proposition is true because "studies show" can be seen as assuming a consensus without proper evidence, which might fit under \( FU \).

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\( DEP \))**:
   - There is no apparent ambiguous language use.

Given this analysis, the defective argument type in the string "Studies show that it takes up to seven years for the human body to digest a piece of gum" can be reasonably classified as:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \))**: because the reason ("studies show") lacks specificity and does not provide compelling support.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (\( FU \))**: because it assumes that the claim is universally agreed upon without proper evidence.

So, the argument can be classified under both \( WCB \) and \( FU \).
