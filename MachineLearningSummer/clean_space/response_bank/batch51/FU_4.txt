For 
To apply the decomposition of the advanced task of classifying a string as a defective argument (<IDAA>) to the specific task of classifying the given string "Eat lamb--could thousands of coyotes be wrong?" (<IDA>), we will break it down into specific steps. Here's the structured approach:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- **Proposition (P):** "Eat lamb."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- **Reason (R):** "Could thousands of coyotes be wrong?"

### Step 3: Attempt to Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- There is no explicit Proof of Reason presented, meaning no additional argument corroborates the Reason.

### Step 4: Evaluate Defective Argument Types
Now we evaluate the argument in terms of the defined defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - The proposition "Eat lamb" is based on the actions of "thousands of coyotes".
   - It takes the behavior of a particular group (coyotes) and implies it should apply universally.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - This would require an attempt to list all possibilities. However, the argument does not attempt an enumeration of possibilities.
   - Therefore, this defective argument type doesn't apply.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - The reason “Could thousands of coyotes be wrong?” doesn't logically or causally explain why humans should eat lamb.
   - This suggests that the reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - The reason relies on an insufficient causal link. The habits of coyotes (predators) are not compelling enough to suggest humans should eat lamb. 
   - This implies a weak causal basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - The reason and proposition do not repeat the same content.
   - Therefore, this defective argument type doesn't apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - The statement suggests a consensus by appealing to the large number ("thousands of coyotes"), assuming it as grounds without addressing the underlying issue that it is still in dispute.
   - This could apply since it assumes "thousands of coyotes" create a consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - The language does not seem ambiguous. It is straightforward, if not entirely logical.
   - Therefore, this defective argument type doesn’t apply.

### Step 5: Conclusion 
Evaluate which defective argument forms apply and select the most relevant one(s). Based on the analysis:

- **Primary Defective Argument:** **<G> (Generalization)**
  - The argument generalizes the behavior of coyotes to suggest humans should emulate them.
  
- **Other Relevant Defective Arguments:**
  - **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: The reason provided does not logically justify the proposition.
  - **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The causal basis (coyotes eating lamb) is weak for recommending the same action to humans.
  - **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: Assumes correctness based on an appeal to a large number.

### Final Classification
The primary classification of the argument "Eat lamb--could thousands of coyotes be wrong?" is:

**<G> (Generalization)**

This is because the argument makes a generalization from the behavior of a specific group (coyotes) to the entire population (implying humans). Other defective argument types such as <IR>, <WCB>, and <FU> may also coincide but are secondary.
