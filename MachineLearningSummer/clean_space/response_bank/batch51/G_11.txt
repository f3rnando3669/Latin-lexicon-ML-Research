For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given task of classifying the argument string "Some students who attend tutoring over the summer are not very intelligent. Since Beth attended summer tutoring, she is not a very good student," we need to follow the decomposition method <D> step by step. Here's how we can approach it:

### Step 1: Break Down the Argument
First, let's identify the different parts of the argument:
- **Proposition (<P>)**: "Beth is not a very good student."
- **Reason (<R>)**: "Beth attended summer tutoring."
  
Next, identify the implicit connection:
- The proposition is based on the assumption that attending summer tutoring is an indicator of not being very intelligent.

### Step 2: Identify the Defective Argument Type
Now let's classify the argument type using <IDA>:

1. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**:
   - The reason (attending summer tutoring) does not conclusively demonstrate that the proposition (Beth is not a very good student) is true. This could be an example of IR if the reason does not properly support the proposition.

2. **<G> Generalization**:
   - The argument asserts that "some students who attend tutoring over the summer are not very intelligent" and then applies this to Beth. This is an over-generalization because it generalizes the characteristics of some individuals to Beth without sufficient justification.

3. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**:
   - The causal basis (attending summer tutoring implying not being intelligent) is weak and not compelling. It does not provide a strong cause-and-effect relationship to support the proposition.

### Step 3: Compare Defective Types
We need to determine which defective argument type best describes the given argument. 

- **Generalization (<G>)** seems to fit well because the argument makes a broad generalization about students who attend summer tutoring and applies it to Beth.
  
- **Incomplete Reasoning (<IR>)** could also fit as the reasoning does not conclusively support the proposition.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** might also apply since the stated reason (tutoring attendance) is a weak basis for claiming someone is not intelligent.

### Conclusion
Based on the breaking down of the argument and comparing it with the defective types, we can classify the string primarily as a **Generalization (<G>)** since it makes a sweeping generalization about a group based on the characteristics of a subset of that group.

Therefore, applying <IDAA> to the given string, we classify it as **<G> Generalization**.
