For 
To apply **IDAA** (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types) to the given string:

"I guess I should buy my 12-year-old daughter an iPhone. Everyone at her new school has one and I want her to fit in with the other kids."

we break it down into specific steps.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Here, the proposition seems to be:
     - I should buy my 12-year-old daughter an iPhone.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason given for this proposition is:
     - Everyone at her new school has one and I want her to fit in with the other kids.

3. **Analyze if the Reason (<R>) is defective:**
   - The given reasons are:
     - "Everyone at her new school has one."
     - "I want her to fit in with the other kids."

4. **Classify the defect in the Reason (<R>):**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** 
     - Does this apply? It doesn’t seem to, as we aren’t generalizing from a small sample to a whole. 
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
     - Does this apply? No. It doesn't attempt an enumeration.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
     - Does this apply? No. The reasoning doesn’t rely solely on the stated Reason without proof of it being strong/weak.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
     - Does this apply? No. This Reason does have a direct, though not necessarily strong, causal link to the Proposition.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
     - Does this apply? No. The Reason is not just a restatement of the Proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
     - Does this apply? Yes. It is assuming the Reason (that “Everyone at her new school has one”) 
       - As universally agreed upon without evidence.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
     - Does this apply? No. The language used is not ambiguous or open to multiple interpretations.

By this step-by-step analysis, we can derive that the given argument exemplifies **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**, as it presumes that because "everyone has one," it is universally agreed upon, and hence, it justifies the purchase to fit in without any further evidence.

Thus, the argument in the given string is best classified as a **<FU>** type of defective argument.
