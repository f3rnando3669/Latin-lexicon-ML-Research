To apply the process of IDAA (which involves the decomposition of the task of identifying a defective argument type into specific steps), we will break down the classification task into a step-by-step approach.

Step 1: **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**
Examine the given string to determine what the main assertion or proposition is.

- In the string: "My wife wants to talk about cleaning out the garage, so I asked her what she wants to do with our patio furniture. Now she’s shopping for new patio furniture and not asking me about the garage."
- The implied proposition (<P>) seems to be that the speaker has managed to divert his wife's attention from cleaning the garage to shopping for new patio furniture.

Step 2: **Identify the Reason (<R>)**
Determine what reason or causal basis is being given to support the proposition.

- The reason (<R>) presented here is that by asking his wife about the patio furniture, the speaker was able to shift her focus away from cleaning the garage.

Step 3: **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**
Look for any proof or additional argument that is meant to support the reason.

- The proof of reason (<PR>) in this case is the outcome mentioned: "Now she’s shopping for new patio furniture and not asking me about the garage."

Step 4: **Classify the Defective Argument**
Assess the given string to classify it under one of the defective argument types.

Given the classifications of defective arguments available:

1. **Generalization (<G>)** 
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**

Let's proceed to analyze if any of these apply:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** is about claiming a complete list but missing out on possibilities – this does not fit.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)** assumes a universal agreement which is in dispute – this does not fit.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)** allows for multiple interpretations - this does not really seem ambiguous.

The closest fits to the given string:
 - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason given might not conclusively prove the correctness of the proposition. While the outcome does show that the wife now focuses on patio furniture, it does not definitively prove that this outcome was the direct result of asking about the patio furniture. There could be numerous other factors at play.
 - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis (i.e., asking about patio furniture as leading to shopping) is not necessarily a compelling one and may appear weak. The connection between cause and effect here seems circumstantial rather than strong.

**Conclusion:**

After analyzing the string closely, it appears that the most accurate classification would be:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reason provided (asking about the patio furniture) does not serve as a sufficiently compelling causal basis for the proposition (wife's change in focus).

So, the defective argument type of the given string is:

**<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**
