For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of <IDA> into specific steps) to classify the string "Religion may have been wrong about a few things, but science has been wrong about many more things!" let's break the task down step by step:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - In this string, the proposition seems to be: "Religion may have been wrong about a few things, but science has been wrong about many more things." This statement sets forth a comparison between the errors of religion and science.

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - The Reason (R) provided to support the Proposition (P) is implicit: the statement suggests that because science has been wrong about more things, religion's errors are less significant or perhaps that religion is less discredited in comparison.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   - There is no explicit Proof of Reason (PR) provided in this argument. The statement alone stands without further evidence or argumentation to corroborate it.

4. **Classify the Argument Type**:
   - Given the definitions of defective argument types, we should classify the argument based on its identified components.

   - **Generalization (G)**: The statement does not seem to generalize from a part to a whole but rather compares two domains.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This argument implicitly makes a broad comparative claim without enumerating all the possibilities. It assumes that the examples of science being wrong are enough to conclude that science is worse than religion in terms of errors. This fits <FE> because it’s implying a comparison based on an incomplete set of data (not a full enumeration of instances of error in both domains).

   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The Reason provided (science being wrong more often) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness that religion is therefore more reliable or less wrong, making this mostly an <IR> due to the weak causal link.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The Reason does not seem to merely repeat the Proposition.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is a claim of causality because it implies that the frequency of being wrong measures reliability or correctness, which is weak.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The claim does not reference any universal agreement.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language does not appear ambiguous in a way that would misconstrue the speaker's intention.

##### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the argument can be best classified as <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) because the Reason (science being wrong more) does not conclusively support the Proposition (that science being wrong more makes religion less wrong or more credible). Furthermore, there’s also an element of <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration) because it doesn’t fully enumerate instances or provide a robust comparison; instead, it uses an incomplete dataset to draw a conclusion. Therefore, "IR" is the primary classification with a secondary element of "FE".
