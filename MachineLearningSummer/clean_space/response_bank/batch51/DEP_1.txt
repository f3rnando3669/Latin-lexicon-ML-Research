For 
To apply the process of IDAA to the given string "I didn’t steal your pen—I borrowed it," we need to first decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps (D), and then go through those steps to identify which category (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, or DEP) the argument falls into. Let's begin.

### Decomposition of Task (D):
1. **Identify the Proposition (P):** Determine what the main claim or proposition in the string is.
2. **Identify the Reason (R):** Determine the reason that supports the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):** Check if there is a proof of reason provided.
4. **Evaluate for Defective Types:**
    - **G:** Check if the Proposition is a faulty generalization.
    - **FE:** Check if there is an incomplete enumeration in the claim.
    - **IR:** Evaluate if the Reason inconclusively demonstrates the Proposition.
    - **WCB:** Evaluate if the causal basis is insufficient or weak.
    - **RR:** Check if the Reason just restates the Proposition.
    - **FU:** Check for presumptuous consensus.
    - **DEP:** Determine if there is ambiguous language use.

### Application of Decomposition to IDA (IDAA):

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The main claim here is: "I didn’t steal your pen."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason provided is: "I borrowed it."

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
In this string, there is no additional proof presented to support the reason. The interaction is binary (P and R only).

#### Step 4: Evaluate for Defective Types

- **G (Generalization):** The proposition does not generalize; it refers to a specific instance.
  
- **FE (Incomplete Enumeration):** There is no claim of a complete enumeration of possibilities.
  
- **IR (Inconclusive Reason):** Evaluate if "I borrowed it" conclusively demonstrates "I didn’t steal your pen." The reason seems to differentiate between "stealing" and "borrowing," but it may not be conclusively so because "borrowing" without permission can still be considered "stealing."

- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The causal basis (borrowed vs stole) submitted might still be considered insufficient if the distinction isn't clear or accepted (e.g., if borrowing without permission is effectively stealing).

- **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** Determine if the reason repeats the proposition. Here, "I borrowed it" doesn't exactly repeat "I didn’t steal your pen" but attempts to redefine or reframe the situation.

- **FU (Presumptuous Consensus):** No claim is made that it is universally agreed upon.

- **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use):** Assess if "borrowed" can be taken in another sense. Yes, "borrowed" without permission can ambiguously mean "stolen" from a legal standpoint.

### Conclusion:

The argument primarily seems to suffer from **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)** because the term "borrowed" can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended (i.e., "stealing" versus "borrowing"). The argument hinges on the distinction between borrowing and stealing, and without proper context or permission, borrowing may still be construed as stealing, thus making the language ambiguous.

In summary, the defective argument type for "I didn’t steal your pen—I borrowed it" is **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use)**.
