For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given task, which involves classifying the argument "Ghosts exist.... because I saw a ghost in my closet" into a type of defective argument, we'll follow the step-by-step decomposition process:

1. **Understand the argument structure:** Break down the argument into the parts <P>, <R>, and <PR>. 
   
   - <P> (Proposition): "Ghosts exist."
   - <R> (Reason): "I saw a ghost in my closet."
   - This argument doesn’t explicitly present <PR> (Proof of Reason), so we will focus on the <P> and <R>.

2. **Analyze the Reason in relation to the Proposition:** Determine if the reason provided sufficiently supports the proposition.

3. **Compare with known defective argument types:**
   - **Generalization (G):** The proposition "Ghosts exist" is an assertion based on a single instance (seeing a ghost in the closet). This applies <R> to a general statement about the existence of ghosts universally, which fits into the concept of <G>.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable here because there is no enumeration of possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason given does not conclusively prove the proposition. Just because an individual claims to have seen a ghost does not mean ghosts exist.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** It’s similar to Inconclusive Reason; the claimed sighting of a ghost does not provide a compelling causal basis for the proposition.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason does not repeat the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There is no appeal to a universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** There is no ambiguous use of language detected in the proposition or reason.

4. **Determine the most fitting category:** Based on the analysis, the argument "Ghosts exist.... because I saw a ghost in my closet" is best classified under:

   - **<G> (Generalization):** The Proposition is an assertion about all ghosts based on a single instance of supposed evidence.
   - **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** The Reason does not conclusively prove the Proposition.
   - **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The causal basis provided does not compellingly support the Proposition.

5. **Classify the argument:** Considering the types, this statement most appropriately fits under <G> as it generalizes the existence of ghosts based on one instance.

**Conclusion:** The argument "Ghosts exist.... because I saw a ghost in my closet" is an example of a <G> (Generalization) logical fallacy.
