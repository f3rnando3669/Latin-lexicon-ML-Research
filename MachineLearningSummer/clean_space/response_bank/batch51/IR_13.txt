For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument into specific steps) to the question "Is your stupidity inborn?", we need to break down the process of classifying the string as one of the identified defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>). Here’s how we can approach this task step by step:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:
**Step 1: Identify the proposition (P), reason (R), and proof of reason (PR) in the string, if any:**

In the string "Is your stupidity inborn?", the following parts ostensibly exist:

- **P (Proposition)**: "Your stupidity is inborn."
- **R (Reason)**: No explicit reason is presented in the question.
- **PR (Proof of Reason)**: No explicit proof or additional reasoning is presented.

**Step 2: Analyze the Argument for Defects:**

We examine whether the given parts (P, R, PR) match any defective argument types. Since the string doesn't explicitly provide a reason or proof, we focus more on the nature of the proposition itself.

**Step 3: Apply Each Defective Argument Definition:**

- **G (Generalization)**:
  - Applied if the proposition is based on an insufficient sample size but generalized to everyone. Here, the proposition doesn’t generalize across individuals; it targets a specific person.
- **FE (Incomplete Enumeration)**:
  - Applied if the proposition claims completeness but misses certain possibilities. The proposition does not claim completeness.
- **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**:
  - Applied if the reason does not support the proposition sufficiently. No explicit reason is provided.
- **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**:
  - Applied if the reason merely repeats the proposition. No reason is provided.
- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**:
  - Applied if the causal basis given for the proposition is weak. Again, no causal basis provided.
- **FU (Presumptuous Consensus)**:
  - Applied if the proof of reason is assumed certain due to presumed universal agreement. No proof of reason is presented.
- **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use)**:
  - Applied if the proof of reason can be interpreted in different ways. No proof of reason is presented.

**Step 4: Determine the Most Applicable Defective Argument Type:**

Given that the question "Is your stupidity inborn?" lacks an explicit reason or proof (R, PR), it could be seen as deploying an **ironic or sarcastic tone** potentially making it a **loaded question** rather than a clearly structured argument falling into the defined types. However, it’s closer to being **incomplete** and **presumptive**.

**Step 5: Final Classification:**

Considering the nature of the string:
- The proposition is stated without sufficient causal basis or any supporting detail.
- The proposition implies a position without evidence, and could be seen as a part of a defective argument type, but not enough details align it concretely with any single defined type.

**Conclusion:**

Although it does not perfectly fit into any predefined category due to the absence of a formal structure, the **most aligned type** for this defective proposition, given its presumptive nature without a supporting causal basis, could be classified nominally as:
- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: since it assumes without providing an argumentative structure for why the proposition is true.

Thus, the classification for the string "Is your stupidity inborn?" under the given definitions is **potentially WCB** due to the presumptive assertion lacking a provided causal basis.
