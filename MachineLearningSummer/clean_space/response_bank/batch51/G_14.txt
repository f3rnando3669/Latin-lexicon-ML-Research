Sure, let's break down the advanced task of classifying the given argument into specific steps (decomposition) and then apply those steps to identify which type of defective argument it represents.

**Decomposition of Task (D):**

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Determine what the argument is intending to prove.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Determine the causal basis or reasoning provided to support the Proposition.
3. **Determine if the Argument is Defective:** Evaluate the validity and strength of the Reason and any supporting Proof of Reason.
4. **Classify the Defective Argument (<IDA>):** Based on the identified potential defects, classify the argument under one of the defective argument types.

**Application of <D> to <IDA>:**

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**

    - The Proposition here is: "Every American is wealthy."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**

    - The Reason presented is: "The United States is the wealthiest nation in the world."

3. **Determine if the Argument is Defective:**

    - Evaluate whether the Reason conclusively supports the Proposition.
    - Check if the Reason or any supporting Proof of Reason falls under any category of defective arguments.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument (<IDA>):**
    
    - The Reason provided does not conclusively support the Proposition. Just because the United States is the wealthiest nation does not mean that every individual American is wealthy. The wealth of the nation does not automatically distribute to all its citizens evenly.

**Identification of Defective Argument Type:**

- The defect in this argument is that the assertion about every individual American's wealth is improperly generalized from the wealth of the nation as a whole. This is a classic example of overgeneralization.

Hence, the argument can be classified under the defective argument type **Generalization (<G>)**.

**Summary:**
- <P>: "Every American is wealthy."
- <R>: "The United States is the wealthiest nation in the world."
- Based on the analysis, this is a defective argument of type **Generalization (<G>)**.
