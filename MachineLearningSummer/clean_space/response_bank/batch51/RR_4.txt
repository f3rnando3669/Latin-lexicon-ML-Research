For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the statement "You must obey the law, because it's illegal to break the law," we will decompose the task into specific steps and identify the type of defective argument.

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   The proposition is the statement or claim that is being made.
   - In this case, the proposition (<P>) is: "You must obey the law."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   The reason is the causal basis given to support the proposition.
   - In this case, the reason (<R>) provided is: "because it's illegal to break the law."

3. **Analyze the Reasoning:**
   We need to determine if the reason provided is valid and different from the proposition, or if it simply restates the proposition in another form.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument:**
   Based on the definitions provided, we can classify the type of defective argument used.

   - Generalization (<G>)
   - Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
   - Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
   - Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
   - Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
   - Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)

Now, let's apply these steps:

1. **Proposition (<P>):**
   - "You must obey the law."

2. **Reason (<R>):**
   - "because it's illegal to break the law."

3. **Analyze the Reasoning:**
   - The reason provided, "it's illegal to break the law," essentially restates the proposition "You must obey the law." There is no additional information or causal basis provided that supports the proposition independently. It merely repeats the same idea in different words.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument:**
   - The argument commits the fallacy of Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), because the reason provided is essentially a restatement of the proposition without providing any new or independent causal basis.

Therefore, the statement "You must obey the law, because it's illegal to break the law" uses the logical fallacy of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**.
