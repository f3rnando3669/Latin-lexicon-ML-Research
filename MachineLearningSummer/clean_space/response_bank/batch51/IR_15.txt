For 
Alright, let's apply the process of IDAA to classify the argument given:

**Step 1: Break down the argument into its components**

- **Proposition (\<P\>):** "Be happy with the 1972 Chevy Nova you drive."
- **Reason (\<R\>):** "There are many people in this country who don’t even have a car."

**Step 2: Identify the type of defective argument**

We need to determine which type of defective argument (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, or DEP) the given argument fits into.

**Evaluation of Components:**

- **Proposition (\<P\>):** "Be happy with the 1972 Chevy Nova you drive."
  - This is suggesting a state of contentment or satisfaction with the car.
- **Reason (\<R\>):** "There are many people in this country who don’t even have a car."
  - The reason provided is based on a comparative situation - essentially implying that because others are worse off, one should be happy in their current situation.

**Type Matching:**

1. **Generalization (\<G\>):** Not applicable, as this argument isn't generalizing from one case to all cases.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>):** Not applicable, as there’s no enumeration of possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>):** This seems relevant because the reason given does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. Just because others may not have a car does not necessarily mean one should be happy with their current car.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>):** Also relevant because the causal basis (other people not having cars) is weak and does not compellingly justify why one should be happy with their car.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>):** Not applicable, the Reason is not repeating the Proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>):** Not applicable, as there is no claim about universal agreement.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>):** Not clear in this context. The language does not appear ambiguous.

Given the above analysis, the argument fits **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** most closely, as the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. Additionally, it also has elements of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, since the reasoning provided lacks compelling cause and effect justification.

**Conclusion:**

The defective argument type for the given string "Be happy with the 1972 Chevy Nova you drive. There are many people in this country who don’t even have a car." is best classified as **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, with a consideration of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
