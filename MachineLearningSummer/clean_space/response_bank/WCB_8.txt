To apply the process <IDAA> to the string "Since Anna Camacho became vice president of the parent-teacher association, student performance has declined and teacher morale is down. We on the school board believe that Camacho bears sole responsibility for the downtrend," let's go through the steps:

### Step 1: Understanding the Argument
- **Proposition:** Anna Camacho is solely responsible for the decline in student performance and teacher morale.
- **Evidence Presented:** The decline in student performance and teacher morale coincides with Camacho becoming vice president.

### Step 2: Identifying Argument Defects
Recall the defective argument types:
- **<G>: Generalization from a specific instance**
- **<FE>: Fewer or more options than exist**
- **<IR>: Irrelevant reason**
- **<RR>: Restatement or redundancy**
- **<WCB>: Weak or compelling reason**
- **<FU>: Unsupported or universally agreed point**
- **<DEP>: Dual interpretation**

### Step 3: Matching the Argument to the Defective Types
- The argument connects the timing of Camacho's vice presidency with the decline without strong supportive evidence that she is the cause, ignoring other possible reasons.
- This suggests that the argument may have fewer options than exist or an irrelevant reason.

### Step 4: Final Identification
- The proposition attributes the cause of the decline solely to Camacho without considering other potential factors. This is an example of listing fewer options than actually exist.

**The identified defective argument type for the string is <FE> (Fewer or more options than exist).**

Thus, the application of <IDAA> to the given string results in the identification of the defective argument type as <FE>.
