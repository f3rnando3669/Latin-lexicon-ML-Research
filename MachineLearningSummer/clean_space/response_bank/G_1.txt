For 
Let's apply the decomposed steps (IDAA) to the given string: "Annie must like Starbucks because all white girls like Starbucks."

### 1. **Read and Comprehend the Argument (Text Analysis)**
   - **Main proposition:**
     - "Annie must like Starbucks."
   - **Reasoning provided:**
     - "All white girls like Starbucks."

### 2. **Determine the Defective Argument Type (Classification)**
   - **Check if the argument makes a claim of a general truth based on specific instances.**
     - The argument states a general truth: "All white girls like Starbucks."
     - The claim specifically applies this "general truth" to Annie, making the deduction that she must like Starbucks since she is presumed to be a white girl.
     - This indicates a generalization, potentially matching the definition of <G>.

### 3. **Validate the Classification**
   - Reviewing the reasoning and claim:
     - The argument generalizes about all white girls liking Starbucks based on some specific belief or stereotype.
     - This general claim is then specifically applied to Annie without substantial evidence, ensuring it fits the definition of a defective argument type claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - Therefore, this reasoning aligns with <G>.

### 4. **Explanation and Justification**
   - The argument: "Annie must like Starbucks because all white girls like Starbucks" is classified as <G> because:
     - It generalizes a particular trait (liking Starbucks) to an entire group (all white girls) based on a stereotype.
     - It then applies this generalization to an individual (Annie) without any specific evidence about Annie herself.

Thus, using the detailed decomposition (IDAA), we successfully identify the defective argument type in the given string as <G>.
