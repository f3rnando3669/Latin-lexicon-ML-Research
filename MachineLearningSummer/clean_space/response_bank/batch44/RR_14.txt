To apply the process of **IDAA**, we will take the task of classifying the string "Has your psychology department stopped teaching that ineffective approach to therapy yet?" and decompose it into specific steps for a thorough classification. Here is the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Identify Key Components of the Argument
1. **Examine the question itself**: "Has your psychology department stopped teaching that ineffective approach to therapy yet?"
2. **Understand the implication**: The question presupposes that the psychology department has been teaching an ineffective approach to therapy.

### Step 2: Consider Potential Classifications
Based on the types defined (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>), let's evaluate which one fits:

1. **<G> (Generalization)**: Does the argument make a sweeping generalization based on limited evidence?
2. **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: Does the argument assume two possibilities when there could be more?
3. **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: Does the reasoning fail to conclusively establish the proposition?
4. **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: Does the reasoning repeat the proposition without adding new information?
5. **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: Does the argument propose a weak causal relationship?
6. **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: Does the argument assume something is true because "everyone agrees"?
7. **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: Does the argument use ambiguous language leading to multiple interpretations?

### Step 3: Analyze Language and Structure
- **Has your psychology department stopped teaching that ineffective approach to therapy yet?**
  - The question makes the assumption that the psychology department:
    - Was teaching an ineffective therapy approach.
    - Has either stopped or continued teaching it.

### Step 4: Determine Presumption and Fallacy
- The structure of the question is such that it presupposes the negativity of the teaching practice.
- This type of question is known as a **loaded question** or **complex question fallacy**, where it assumes something not proven in the context.

### Step 5: Match with Definitions
- The question fits well with the definition of **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)** because it does not consider other possibilities such as:
  - The psychology department never taught the ineffective therapy.
  - The teaching method was effective.
  - There are more options beyond stopping or not stopping the teaching.

### Conclusion:
The statement "Has your psychology department stopped teaching that ineffective approach to therapy yet?" is classified under:
- **<FE>**: Incomplete Enumeration

### Explanation:
The statement assumes that there are only two possibilities (either the department has stopped teaching an ineffective therapy or continues to teach it) while ignoring other viable options, thus representing an incomplete enumeration.

**Final Classification: <FE>**
