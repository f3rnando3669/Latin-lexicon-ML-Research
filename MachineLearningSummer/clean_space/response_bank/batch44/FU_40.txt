For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the advanced task <IDA> into specific steps) to the string "Argues that because something is popular, it must be right," we'll break down <IDA> step by step.

**Step 1: Understand the Argument Type**
- This step involves understanding the defect, structure, and nature of the argument at hand.

**Step 2: Identify Potential Argument Types**
- Here, we consider which defective argument types might be relevant: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

**Step 3: Define the Argument Types for Reference**
- We need to clearly define each argument type:
  - **<G>: Generalization** - Making broad assertions from limited observations.
  - **<FE>: Incomplete Enumeration** - Claiming a complete list of possibilities while missing some.
  - **<IR>: Inconclusive Reason** - Providing reasons that don't conclusively support the conclusion.
  - **<RR>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition** - Repeating the proposition in the guise of reasoning.
  - **<WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis** - Claiming a causal relationship without sufficient evidence.
  - **<FU>: Presumptuous Consensus** - Assuming a proposition is true because it's universally or widely agreed upon.
  - **<DEP>: Ambiguous Language Use** - Using language that can be interpreted in multiple ways.

**Step 4: Analyze the Given Argument**
- The argument "Argues that because something is popular, it must be right" suggests a relationship between popularity and correctness. 

**Step 5: Match the Argument with the Definitions**
- We assess whether the argument fits any of the predefined types:
  - **Generalization?** No, it doesn't generalize from specific instances.
  - **Incomplete Enumeration?** No, it doesnâ€™t claim a complete list of possibilities.
  - **Inconclusive Reason?** No, the reason isn't inherently inconclusive but rather relies on popularity.
  - **Faulty Repetition?** No, it's not simply repeating the proposition.
  - **Insufficient Causal Basis?** No, it's not making a causal claim but a logical assertion from popularity.
  - **Presumptuous Consensus?** Yes, it fits here. It assumes the correctness of something based solely on its popularity, aligning with the definition of <FU>.

**Step 6: Final Classification**
- Considering this precise match with the definition of <FU>:

### Conclusion:
The argument "Argues that because something is popular, it must be right." is an example of <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).
