For 
To apply **IDAA** to the string "Because Martin Sheen played the president on television, he'd probably make a great president in real life," we will break this down into specific steps and classify the string accordingly.

### Step 1: Identify the core argument and structure
The proposition (P) in the argument is "Martin Sheen would probably make a great president in real life."

### Step 2: Identify the reason provided (R)
The reason given for this proposition is "Because Martin Sheen played the president on television."

### Step 3: Assess the argument type based on predefined categories
1. **Generalization (G)**: Does this argument make a sweeping generalization based on limited evidence?
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Does this argument claim to consider all possibilities but clearly misses out on others?
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Does the reason provided fail to conclusively demonstrate the truth of the proposition?
4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Does the reason merely repeat the proposition in different words?
5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Is the reason provided a weak causal argument that does not compellingly support the proposition?
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Is the argument based on the assumption that it must be true because many people agree with it?
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Is the argument reliant on ambiguous language which may have multiple interpretations?

### Step 4: Classify the argument
1. **Determine if the argument generalizes**: This doesn't seem to make a broad generalization based on limited cases.
2. **Check for incomplete enumeration**: It doesn't claim to consider all possibilities, so it isn't an incomplete enumeration.
3. **Verify if the reason is inconclusive**: The reason given ("Because Martin Sheen played the president on television") indeed does not logically lead to the conclusion ("he'd probably make a great president in real life"). This hints the argument might be of type **IR**.
4. **See if the argument repeats its proposition**: The reason given doesn’t merely restate the proposition differently.
5. **Inspect for insufficient causal basis**: The link between acting as a president on television and being a great real-life president is weak and not compelling, which strongly suggests **WCB**.
6. **Evaluate for presumptuous consensus**: It doesn’t rely on what everyone else thinks.
7. **Look for ambiguous language use**: The language does not seem particularly ambiguous.

### Conclusion
Given the identified steps and the analysis, the argument "Because Martin Sheen played the president on television, he'd probably make a great president in real life" is best classified as <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).

### Output
<WCB>
