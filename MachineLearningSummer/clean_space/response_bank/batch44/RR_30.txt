For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "This has to work so it will work.", we need to identify the type of defective argument used in the string, step-by-step. The decomposed steps (<D>) for classifying the argument will be:

1. **Identify the main proposition (<P>)** in the string.
2. **Determine the reason (<R>)** presented to support the proposition.
3. **Evaluate the proof of reason** to see if it's a valid argument or falls into one of the defective argument types.

Let's apply these steps to the string "This has to work so it will work."

### Step 1: Identify the main proposition (<P>)
- **Proposition:** "This has to work."
- **Supporting Statement:** "so it will work."

### Step 2: Determine the reason (<R>)
- The reason given: "so it will work."
- This means that the argument is trying to support the proposition "This has to work" by asserting "it will work."

### Step 3: Evaluate the proof of reason
- The reason and the proposition are essentially the same: The proposition "This has to work" is being justified by the assertion "it will work." 
- There is no independent rationale provided; instead, the argument uses a restatement to justify itself.

### Conclusion
- The argument presented is using a form of **circular reasoning** where the reason simply repeats the proposition in different words without providing any substantive basis for the claim.

### Classification
- This matches the defective argument type **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**, which involves weak reasoning that merely restates the proposition as if it is the reason.

Therefore, the classification of the string "This has to work so it will work." is:

**<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**
