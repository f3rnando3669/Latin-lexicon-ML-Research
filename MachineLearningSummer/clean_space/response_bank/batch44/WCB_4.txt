For 
To apply the decomposition of the task <IDA> to the given string "The administration of echinocandins in this patient has been a very successful choice. Fever has subsided, along with the rest of the septic manifestations, in less than 48 hours. The chronological correlation suffices for me. I am convinced it was a fungal infection.", we'll break it down step by step, as defined in <IDAA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - The main proposition in the string is: "The administration of echinocandins in this patient has been a very successful choice."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - The reason is provided as: "Fever has subsided, along with the rest of the septic manifestations, in less than 48 hours."

3. **Check for Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - The proof given is: "The chronological correlation suffices for me. I am convinced it was a fungal infection."

4. **Evaluate the Validity of the Elements**:
   1. **Proposition (<P>)** evaluates a treatment choice: "successful choice of echinocandin administration."
   2. **Reason (<R>)** provides observational outcomes: "subside of fever and septic manifestations."
   3. **Proof of Reason (<PR>)** justifies the treatment outcome based on the timeline: "the correlation in timings convinces of fungal infection."

5. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**:
   - The argument suffers from correlating the outcome (fever and septic manifestations subsiding) to the treatment merely based on temporal association without exploring other potential reasons or controls.

Therefore, the classification would be <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis). The argument makes a causal connection between the treatment and the outcome solely based on their temporal correlation, without sufficient evidence that the treatment was the direct and exclusive cause.

### Final Answer:
The argument type of "The administration of echinocandins in this patient has been a very successful choice. Fever has subsided, along with the rest of the septic manifestations, in less than 48 hours. The chronological correlation suffices for me. I am convinced it was a fungal infection." is classified as <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
