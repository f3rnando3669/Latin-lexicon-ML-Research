For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "It is said that we have a good understanding of our universe.  Therefore, we know exactly how it began and exactly when.", we need to decompose the task of classifying the string (i.e., <IDA>) into specific steps and then execute those steps sequentially. Let's break it down:

### Step 1: Identify the Components of the Argument
Break down the argument into its proposition, reason, and proof of reason if applicable.

- **Proposition (<P>)**: "We know exactly how it began and exactly when."
- **Reason (<R>)**: "It is said that we have a good understanding of our universe."

### Step 2: Analyze the Logical Structure
- **Check the Relation**: Examine how the reason supports the proposition. Does the provided reason conclusively establish the truth of the proposition?

### Step 3: Identify Defective Argument Types
Check the argument against the defective argument types to see if it matches any of their characteristics:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument doesn't broadly apply a specific case to all cases.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument isn’t presenting a false dichotomy or a limited set of options.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Check if the reason provided doesn't adequately support the conclusion.
4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The reason and proposition are not repeating the same idea using different words.
5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal link between understanding the universe and knowing exactly when/how it began is questionable.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Argument doesn’t claim universal agreement to bolster its point.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Check for ambiguous terms or phrases that might lead to confusion or misinterpretation.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
Based on the analysis, classify the argument as one of the defective argument types.

#### Analysis of the Argument:
- The reason provided ("It is said that we have a good understanding of our universe") does not directly and conclusively lead to the proposition ("Therefore, we know exactly how it began and exactly when").
- The argument might rely on an ambiguous interpretation of what "a good understanding" entails and whether it indeed implies knowing exact details ("how it began and when"), which is a much stronger claim.

### Step 5: Determine the Type
Given the ambiguity in interpreting "a good understanding," the argument is leveraging the term in different ways, suggesting it might be <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use).

### Conclusion:
The argument "It is said that we have a good understanding of our universe. Therefore, we know exactly how it began and exactly when." is classified as type <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use). The term "understanding" is used ambiguously, assuming it means knowing exact origins and timelines, which is not necessarily implied.
