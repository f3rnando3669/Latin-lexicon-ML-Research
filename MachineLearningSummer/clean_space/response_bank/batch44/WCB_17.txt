For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the classification task into specific steps) to the provided string, "It was observed that persons who went out at night often developed the malady. So night air was assumed to be the cause of malaria, and elaborate precautions were taken to shut it out of sleeping quarters," we'll use the following steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - "Persons who went out at night often developed the malady."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - "Night air was assumed to be the cause of malaria."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - "Elaborate precautions were taken to shut it out of sleeping quarters."

4. **Determine if the reasoning is defective:**
   - Evaluate the reason given (R) for its causal basis.

**Step-by-step application:**

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - **Proposition (P):** "Persons who went out at night often developed the malady."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - **Reason (R):** "Night air was assumed to be the cause of malaria."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - **Proof of Reason (PR):** "Elaborate precautions were taken to shut it out of sleeping quarters."

4. **Determine if the reasoning is defective:**
   - Review the logical relation between P and R to see if it makes a sound argument. Evaluate if the Reason (R) sufficiently supports the Proposition (P).

Given that the Reason (R) assumes that night air causes malaria based solely on an observed correlation without sufficient scientific evidence to establish a causal relationship, this represents a reasoning defect.

Finally:

**Classify the Defective Argument:**

- The argument assumes a causal relationship based on a correlation without compelling evidence to support the causation. This fits the definition of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

**Conclusion:**

- The provided string is classified as <WCB>.
