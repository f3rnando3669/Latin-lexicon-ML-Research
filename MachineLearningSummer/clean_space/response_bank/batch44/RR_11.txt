For 
Sure, let's apply <IDAA> to classify the given string "Only a mentally ill person would kill someone, so anyone who kills someone is automatically mentally ill."

Step 1: Identify the proposition (P).

In this case, the proposition (P) is:
"Anyone who kills someone is automatically mentally ill."

Step 2: Identify the reason (R) given to support the proposition.

The reason (R) is:
"Only a mentally ill person would kill someone."

Step 3: Classify the argument type.

We now need to classify this argument type by checking if it matches any of the defective argument types defined.

- **Generalization (G)**: The argument does not generalize some observed individual cases to all similar cases without sufficient justification.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not seem to erroneously reduce possible choices to just two when more options are available.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument relies on a specific claim rather than multiple propositions or moving goalposts.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The argument does not simply repeat the proposition as its reason.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument does not seem to assign causality without sufficient basis directly but rather presupposes a condition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument does not appeal to popularity or consensus.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The argument does not use language ambiguously but makes a categorical assertion.

Reviewing the definitions again, it appears that this argument matches the conditions for an "Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)" because it assumes that the act of killing can only be performed by a mentally ill person without sufficient causal basis. It presupposes that mental illness is a necessary condition for such behavior without providing evidence for this link, thereby committing a causal fallacy.

Therefore, the classification task (IDA) determines that the argument "Only a mentally ill person would kill someone, so anyone who kills someone is automatically mentally ill." is of type <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
