To apply the process of breaking down the task of classifying the argument within the string "According to my brain, my brain is reliable" as one of the defective argument types, we need to carefully extract the exact steps involved. Here is the step-by-step decomposition:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)

The **Proposition (<P>)** here is: "My brain is reliable."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)

The **Reason (<R>)** provided is: "According to my brain."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Structure of the Argument

Assess how the Reason (<R>) supports the Proposition (<P>). In this case, the argument is structured as:

- **Proposition (<P>)**: My brain is reliable.
- **Reason (<R>)**: Because my brain says it is.

### Step 4: Compare with Definitions of Defective Argument Types

#### <G> Generalization:
This argument does not involve applying a property of a specific instance or group to all instances of a group.

#### <FE> Incomplete Enumeration:
This argument does not present a false dichotomy or limited choices.

#### <IR> Inconclusive Reason:
We need to see if the reason provided fails to conclusively support the proposition.

#### <RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:
Check if Reason and Proposition are circular or repetitious of each other without introducing a new compelling reason.

#### <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:
Evaluate if the causal connection between Reason and Proposition is weak or non-compelling.

#### <FU> Presumptuous Consensus:
This argument is not assuming correctness based on popular or presumed consensus.

#### <DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:
Check if the language used introduces ambiguity or different meanings.

### Step 5: Identify the Defective Argument Type

Evaluating the argument:

- **Proposition (<P>)**: My brain is reliable.
- **Reason (<R>)**: According to my brain.

There is a circular reasoning here. The reason for believing that the brain is reliable is because the brain itself says so, which does not provide any external or independent validation of the reliability. It essentially repeats the claim within the justifying reason.

Therefore, this argument is best classified under:

**<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**

### Conclusion

The string "According to my brain, my brain is reliable." falls under the defective argument type **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**.
