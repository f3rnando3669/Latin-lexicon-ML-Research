For 
Let's take the task step-by-step and decompose it to identify the type of defective argument in the provided string.

### Step 1: Formulate the Task
We need to classify the given string:
"He's the best teacher I've ever had because he's the best teacher I've known."

### Step 2: Break Down the String
Let's break the statement into its proposition and reason components:
- **Proposition (P):** "He's the best teacher I've ever had."
- **Reason (R):** "because he's the best teacher I've known."

### Step 3: Identify the Defective Argument Type

#### Step 3.1: Check for Generalization (<G>)
- **Generalization:** It asserts about all individuals based on a limited observation. 
  - This doesn't seem to assert any universal claim beyond the individual's experience.

#### Step 3.2: Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- **Incomplete Enumeration:** It claims to have considered all possibilities but misses out on relevant possibilities.
  - This argument doesn’t present an either/or situation claiming to cover all options.

#### Step 3.3: Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- **Inconclusive Reason:** The reason given does not conclusively support the proposition.
  - The reason given here seems to attempt a complete explanation albeit flawed, instead of being inconclusive.

#### Step 3.4: Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** The reason simply repeats the proposition in different words.
  - The reason "because he's the best teacher I've known" restates the proposition by rephrasing it with similar meaning, without providing new evidence or an actual reason.

#### Step 3.5: Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- **Insufficient Causal Basis:** The causal link between reason and proposition is weak.
  - The provided reason is weak but primarily because it’s circular, not because it's insufficiently causal.

#### Step 3.6: Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
- **Presumptuous Consensus:** Asserts a proposition as true because it is commonly accepted.
  - This doesn’t appeal to popularity or consensus.

#### Step 3.7: Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)
- **Ambiguous Language Use:** Utilizes a term in multiple senses or misleading ways.
  - There doesn’t appear to be ambiguous usage of words.

### Conclusion
Since step 3.4 seems most fitting — the reason is essentially a repetition of the proposition — we classify the defective argument string type as:

**Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**

So, in this case, applying decomposition to identify the defective argument:
- **Type:** Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)

### Final Classification
"He’s the best teacher I’ve ever had because he’s the best teacher I’ve known." is of type **<RR>**.
