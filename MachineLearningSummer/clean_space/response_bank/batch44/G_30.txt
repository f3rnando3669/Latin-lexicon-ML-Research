For 
To apply <IDAA> to "If I make an exception for you then I'll have to make an exception for everyone", we will break down the task of classifying defective arguments into specific steps and then execute those steps systematically. 

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>) for <IDA>:

1. **Identify the Core Argument**: Understand the main proposition and reasoning parts of the statement.
2. **Compare with Definitions**: Match the argument against each defined defective argument type.
3. **Check for Characteristics**: Look for specific characteristics unique to each defective argument type.
4. **Determine the Best Fit**: Select the argument type that most closely matches the statement.

Let's apply this step-by-step process to classify "If I make an exception for you then I'll have to make an exception for everyone":

### Step 1: Identify the Core Argument

- **Proposition (<P>)**: Making an exception for you.
- **Reason (<R>)**: This would necessitate making exceptions for everyone.

### Step 2: Compare with Definitions

- **<G> (Generalization)**: This doesn't assert a generalization about a group based on insufficient evidence.
- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: This isn't about providing a false dichotomy with missed possibilities.
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: This could fit if the reasoning doesn't conclusively establish the proposition, but let's explore other classifications.
- **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: This isn't repeating the same proposition as reason.
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: This is about providing a weak causal relationship between events.
- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: This is about assuming something is true because many people believe it.
- **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: This involves using a word ambiguously to mislead.

### Step 3: Check for Characteristics

- The statement appears to suggest that making any exceptions will invariably lead to an unsustainable situation.
- This suggests a slippery slope, implying that if one exception is made, it inevitably leads to universal exceptions, which is likely an exaggeration without solid proof.

### Step 4: Determine the Best Fit

The argument suggests a sequence of events where making one exception will lead to making many, without sufficient evidence for this escalation:

**This aligns with <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)** because the statement falsely assumes only two extremes: make no exceptions or make exceptions for everyone, ignoring other possibilities such as making a limited number of exceptions under specific criteria.

### Final Classification:

**"If I make an exception for you then I'll have to make an exception for everyone"** is best classified as **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**.

This detailed approach ensures we systematically analyze the statement against each possible defective argument type, determine the best classification, and understand why it fits.
