To apply a decomposition approach to classifying the argument type of the given string, let's break down the task into specific steps. We'll analyze the proposition, reasons, and whether these elements align with any of the defective argument types defined earlier. 

Here is the step-by-step decomposition to classify the argument:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition and Reasons
1. **Proposition (\<P\>)**:
   - **C. Therefore, violent crime in the inner city can be solved by curing the lead problem.**
   
2. **Reasons (\<R\>)**:
   - **P1. Lead poisoning can contribute to violent behavior.**
   - **P2. Many inner city children have dangerous levels of lead in their blood.**

### Step 2: Evaluate the Reasoning Steps
- **Reason** \(R_1\): Lead poisoning can contribute to violent behavior.
- **Reason** \(R_2\): Many inner city children have dangerous levels of lead in their blood.

### Step 3: Assess the Connection Between Proposition and Reasons
1. Does the proposition logically follow from the reasons provided?
  
### Step 4: Identify Potential Defective Argument Types
Evaluate if the argument might fall into any of the defective argument types:
1. **Generalization (\<G\>):** Unsupported extrapolation to the entire inner city.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>):** Misses other causes.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>):** The reasons do not conclusively lead to the conclusion.
4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>):** Circular reasoning.
5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>):** Weak causation.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>):** Assumes universal consensus.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>):** Terms used ambiguously.

### Step 5: Classify the Argument Based on Detected Fallacy
Given the details presented, letâ€™s classify the argument:

1. **Evaluation of Causal Basis**:
   - The argument states that solving the lead problem will solve violent crime in inner cities. This suggests a direct causal relationship between lead levels and violent crime.
   - However, many other factors could contribute to violent crime in inner cities, such as socioeconomic status, education, policing, community programs, etc.

Based on this step-by-step decomposition, the argument seems to predominantly fall under the category of:
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)** because the causal connection provided (between reducing lead in children's blood to solving violent crime) is not particularly robust given the complex nature of violent crime and its many contributing factors.

Thus, the classification of the argument "P1. Lead poisoning can contribute to violent behavior. P2. Many inner city children have dangerous levels of lead in their blood. C. Therefore, violent crime in the inner city can be solved by curing the lead problem." is:
- **\<WCB\>**: Insufficient Causal Basis.
