For 
To apply the process of decomposing and executing the task of classifying the provided argument "You've got to teach the boys logic! If you don't teach them logic, they won't learn how to think, and they'll become hobos and die in prison! Don't you care about your sons? (Mother to Father)" into its specific steps, we can proceed as follows:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of the Task <IDAA>:

**Step 1: Identify the components of the argument**
- Proposition (<P>)
- Reason (<R>)
- Proof of Reason (<PR>)

**Step 2: Determine if the argument is defective and identify the type of defect**
- Generalization (<G>)
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
- Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)

### Step-by-Step Execution for the Given Argument:

#### Step 1: Identify the components of the argument

1. **Proposition (<P>):** "You've got to teach the boys logic!"
   - This is what is being urged or intended to be proved by the argument.

2. **Reason (<R>):** "If you don't teach them logic, they won't learn how to think, and they'll become hobos and die in prison!"
   - This is the rationale provided that connects teaching logic to preventing the boys from becoming hobos and dying in prison.

3. **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** "Don't you care about your sons?"
   - This emotional appeal is meant to bolster the reason by suggesting that caring parents must teach their sons logic to avoid dire outcomes.

#### Step 2: Determine if the argument is defective and identify the type of defect

1. **Check for Generalization(<G>):**
   - Does the argument apply a generalized statement to all instances? 
   - No, it does not make broad claims about a group.

2. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Does the argument imply that there are only two possibilities when more might exist?
   - No, it does not present an either/or dichotomy explicitly.

3. **Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Is the reason provided insufficient or non-conclusive to fully support the proposition?
   - The reasoning provided does seem exaggerated and fear-based rather than logically supporting the necessity of teaching logic.

4. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - Is the reason essentially a restatement of the proposition?
   - No, the reason provides additional consequences rather than just repeating the proposition.

5. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Is the causal connection between teaching logic and preventing dire outcomes weak or unsupported by evidence?
   - Yes, the causal connection that not teaching logic will lead to them becoming hobos and dying in prison is highly speculative and not sufficiently substantiated.

6. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - Does the argument assume something is true because it is universally believed or stated?
   - No, it doesn’t rely on the idea of universal belief.

7. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - Does the argument use ambiguous language that can be taken in another sense than intended?
   - No, the language isn’t particularly ambiguous.

### Conclusion
The argument most closely fits the category of **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**. It makes a highly speculative causal claim that lacks substantial evidence connecting the cause (not teaching logic) directly to the effect (becoming hobos and dying in prison).

### Final Classification
The argument "You've got to teach the boys logic! If you don't teach them logic, they won't learn how to think, and they'll become hobos and die in prison! Don't you care about your sons? (Mother to Father)" is of type **<WCB>**.
