For 
To classify the string "The best example of this fallacy is presented by the person who coined this term, Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his 2007 book, The Black Swan. There are two people", we will decompose the task into specific steps.

### Decomposition of Task (<D>):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine the core assertion or claim made in the string.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine the causal basis presented that supports the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Check for additional evidence or arguments that corroborate the reason.

4. **Classify the Argument Type:**
   - Determine if the argument follows any known logical fallacy types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Application of Decomposition (<IDAA>) to the given string:

#### 1. Identify the Proposition (<P>):
   - The core assertion in the string seems to be that the best example of a fallacy is presented by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his 2007 book, "The Black Swan."

#### 2. Identify the Reason (<R>):
   - The causal basis is not clearly stated within this excerpt. However, from the context, the reason might be implied as Taleb being the person who coined a term and providing the best example for it.

#### 3. Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):
   - Additional arguments or evidence supporting the reason are missing in this excerpt. It merely states Taleb's authority and his book.

#### 4. Classify the Argument Type:

Let's go through the types to identify which matches this structure:

- **Generalization (<G>):** No broad assertion is made based on individual instances.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Doesn't present an enumeration of limited possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason seems to rely solely on authority (Taleb's expertise); this can be weak but isn't expanded enough to diverge.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** If the argument is simply repeating that Taleb's example is the best because he coined the term without additional reasons, it might fit here.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal link between Talebâ€™s authorship and it being the best example is not strongly established.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Doesn't rely on popularity or consensus.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Equivocation or double meaning isn't apparent here.

Since the string is mainly asserting that Taleb provides the best example of the fallacy simply based on his authority without additional reasons, it best fits **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**. It implies that the truthfulness of the claim is because Taleb authored the term, essentially restating the proposition instead of providing solid supporting arguments.

### Final Classification:
The most fitting classification for the string is **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**.
