For 
To apply **<IDAA>**, we need to break down the task of classifying the provided argument step by step. Below is the decomposition of the advanced task **<t>** ("decomposition of **<IDA>** into specific steps"), which is encoded as **<D>**:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition**: Determine what **<P>** (Proposition) is being asserted or implied.
2. **Identify the Reason**: Determine what **<R>** (Reason) supports the **<P>**.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason**: Determine if any **<PR>** (Proof of Reason) is supplied as evidence for **<R>**.
4. **Classify the Argument Type**: Based on the structure of **<P>**, **<R>**, and **<PR>**, classify the argument as one of the defective argument types: **<G>**, **<FE>**, **<IR>**, **<RR>**, **<WCB>**, **<FU>**, or **<DEP>**.

### Application of **<D>** to **<IDA>**:

Let's apply these steps to classify the given string:

**String**: "Once you leave the house, you cannot go back. You will not receive any financial support so you need to stop going to school. Your credit card will be cut so you need to work. You will live on your own."

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (**<P>**)
**<P>**: The person leaving the house will face several consequences (no financial support, need to stop going to school, cut credit card, need to work, live on their own).

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (**<R>**)
**<R>**: Once you leave the house, these consequences will follow.

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (**<PR>**)
There is no substantial or independent proof provided for these reasons beyond the assertion itself that leaving the house results in these consequences.

#### Step 4: Classify the Argument Type
In reviewing the steps, we observe no meaningful logical grounding or evidence is given to substantiate why leaving the house necessitates the stated consequences. The assertion itself (that these consequences will automatically follow) appears to lack a sufficient causal basis. 

### Classification:
This argument can most accurately be classified under **<WCB>** (Insufficient Causal Basis) because the reasons provided for needing to stop going to school, needing to work, and living on their own are not portrayed as compelling or supported by concrete evidence.

Hence, the given string: 
"Once you leave the house, you cannot go back. You will not receive any financial support so you need to stop going to school. Your credit card will be cut so you need to work. You will live on your own." 

is classified as:
**<WCB>** (Insufficient Causal Basis).
