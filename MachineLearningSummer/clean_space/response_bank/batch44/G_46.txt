Sure, let's apply **IDAA** to the given task step by step.

### Step 1: Identify and Extract Propositions <P> and Reasons <R>
First, identify the main propositions and reasons presented in the argument string, as well as the conclusion.

- **Proposition (P):** "People should let their cats go outside."
- **Reason (R):** "Going outside gives cats more exercise."
- **Counter-Proposition:** "But if you let cats go outside, then they'll hunt all the birds in the neighborhood."
- **Counter-Reason:** "If you let them hunt all the birds, then robins will go extinct."

### Step 2: Classify the Argument
Determine which defective argument type or logical fallacy each part of the debate falls under.

#### Analyzing the Counter-Reason
- The essence of the counter-reasoning runs as follows:
  - **If cats go outside, then they will hunt birds.**
  - **If they hunt birds, robins will go extinct.**

This follows a **chain of events** logic which, while possible, does not conclusively prove the initial claim "robins will go extinct" based on a simple cause-and-effect assumption. 

### Step 3: Decomposition of the Argument
Assess the logical fallacies involved in the provided counter-argument.

1. **Counter-Reason Analysis:**
   The chain presented heavily relies on "if-then" statements which assume a dramatic escalation without providing substantial evidence directly linking letting cats outside to the extinction of robins.

### Step 4: Determine the Fallacy Type
Given the analysis, the counter-argument is a classic example of a **slippery slope fallacy**. Here's why:

- A slippery slope argument suggests that a relatively small first step leads to a chain of related events culminating in some significant effect (in this case, the extinction of robins), without sufficient direct evidence to support such a chain reaction.

Thus, for the given string:

**Type:** <G> (Generalization)
**Subtype in this context:** "Slippery Slope"

### Final Classification
Based on the identified fallacy type:

- **Argument Type:** <G> (Generalization leading to a Slippery Slope)

### Conclusion
**IDAA Task Applied**
Applying the steps of **IDAA**, the string follows a faulty generalization type identified as a slippery slope generalization. The counter-argument unnecessarily extends potential consequences without a strong causal basis, which is a persistent trait in **slippery slope** reasoning.
