For 
To classify the argument type in "Sebastian saw that several of his friends had bought a new fidget spinner. He realized it must be a very cool gadget if they had one, and everyone else probably did, too," we will decompose the task into specific steps:

### Decomposition of <IDA>:
1. **Identify the Proposition** (<P>): Extract the main claim or assertion.
2. **Identify the Reason** (<R>): Determine the underlying causal basis for the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason** (<PR>): Establish if there is additional argumentation supporting the reason.
4. **Classify the Argument Type**: Using the definitions provided, classify the argument as one of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Applying <IDAA> to the Argument:

1. **Identify the Proposition**:
   - **Proposition (P)**: The fidget spinner must be a very cool gadget.
2. **Identify the Reason**:
   - **Reason (R)**: Many of his friends bought the fidget spinner, suggesting it's popular or desirable.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason**:
   - **Proof of Reason (PR)**: Everyone else would probably have one too if it were not true.

4. **Classify the Argument Type**:
   - This argument relies on the popularity of the fidget spinner among Sebastianâ€™s friends to conclude that it is a very cool gadget.
   - This is a classic example of **Presumptuous Consensus** (<FU>), where the truth of the proposition is assumed based on the belief that popular opinion supports it.

### Conclusion:

The fallacy that Sebastian fell into is **Presumptuous Consensus** (<FU>), where he assumes the gadget is cool because his friends have it, indicating a reliance on a popularity-based validation.

Therefore, the classification of the fallacy in the given argument:
"Sebastian saw that several of his friends had bought a new fidget spinner. He realized it must be a very cool gadget if they had one, and everyone else probably did, too.
What fallacy did Sebastian fall into?" 
is **<FU>** (Presumptuous Consensus).
