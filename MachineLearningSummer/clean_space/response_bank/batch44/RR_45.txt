For 
To apply the task of classifying the given string "She is good at writing because she writes words effectively." using the decomposition method, we need to break down the process into specific steps.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for Classifying the Argument

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - The proposition is the assertion or claim being made.
   - In this case: "She is good at writing."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - The reason is the basis provided to support the proposition.
   - In this case: "because she writes words effectively."

3. **Evaluate the Relationship Between Proposition and Reason:**
   - Check if the reason appropriately supports the proposition.
   - Often, logical fallacies might repeat the proposition in a seemingly different way without adding new support.

4. **Classify the Argument Type:**
   - Based on the evaluation, determine the type of defective argument if it applies.

5. **Determine the Specific Defective Argument Type:**

Let's apply these steps:

### 1. Identify the Proposition (P):
"She is good at writing."

### 2. Identify the Reason (R):
"because she writes words effectively."

### 3. Evaluate the Relationship Between Proposition and Reason:
- The reason ("she writes words effectively") is essentially repeating the proposition ("She is good at writing") in different words without adding any new information or support.

### 4. Classify the Argument Type:
- This kind of reasoning where the conclusion is restated as the reason is known as circular reasoning or tautology.

### 5. Determine the Specific Defective Argument Type:
- According to the defined defective argument types:
  - **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: where the reason says precisely the same as was said in the proposition.

### Conclusion:

The string "She is good at writing because she writes words effectively." can be classified under the defective argument type **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**.

Thus, following the decomposition approach, we have classified the given string as an **<RR>** type argument.
