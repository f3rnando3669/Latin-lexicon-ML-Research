For 
To apply the decomposition of the task (D) of classifying a string (s) as of type <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP> (IDA), let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the key component of the argument in <s>
First, extract the main elements of the argument:
- Attaching an argument
- To a person of false or appeared authority
- To give credence to their argument

### Step 2: Determine which definitions match these elements
We need to match these elements with the definitions provided:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Does not fit our context.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Focuses on missing pertinent possibilities. Does not fit our context.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: When the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. Does not fit our context.
4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: When a reason merely repeats the proposition in a different form. Does not fit our context.
5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: When the causal basis submitted for the proposition is weak. Does not fit our context.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Assuming a proposition is true because it is universally agreed upon. Does not fit our context.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: When the proof of reason can be taken in another sense than intended. Does not quite fit our context.
8. **Appeal to False Authority (<IR>)**: Applying an argument based on the presumed position or authority of someone who does not have the requisite expertise.

### Step 3: Isolate and Match Definitions
Based on the detailed description, the argument described in <s> most closely aligns with **"appeal to false authority"**:

**"Attaching an argument to a person of false or appeared authority in order to give credence to their argument"** explicitly deals with using a false authority to lend weight to an argument.

### Step 4: Cross-Verify with Given Definitions
Among the definitions, the most relevant is:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Particularly if it involves presenting an unqualified person or institution as a source of credible information.

### Conclusion
The string (s) **"attaching an argument to a person of false or appeared authority in order to give credence to their argument"** should be classified as **<IR>** due to its reliance on the authority of an unqualified individual to substantiate an argument. 

Thus, the application of <IDAA> to the given string results in the classification:
- "attaching an argument to a person of false or appeared authority in order to give credence to their argument" is of type **<IR>**.
