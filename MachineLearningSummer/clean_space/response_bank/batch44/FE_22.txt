For 
To apply <IDAA> to "You are either a leader or a follower," we'll proceed with the decomposed steps of the task <D> for classifying the argument <s> as one of the defective argument types defined. Here are the steps broken down:

1. **Understanding the Argument**: Comprehend the given argument and identify its components.
   - **Argument**: "You are either a leader or a follower."
   - **Proposition (P)**: The assertion stating that you must either be a leader or a follower.

2. **Identify the Defective Argument Type**:
   - **<G> (Generalization)**: Check if the argument makes an over-generalization.
   - **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: Check if the argument falsely presents an incomplete list of options.
   - **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: Check if the reason given does not conclusively support the proposition.
   - **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: Check if the reason simply repeats the proposition.
   - **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: Check if the causal basis provided is unwarranted.
   - **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: Check if it assumes consensus without actual agreement.
   - **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: Check if ambiguous language has been employed.

3. **Apply Definitions to Argument**:
   - **<G>**: This argument does not generalize a characteristic to a group.
   - **<FE>**: The argument presents only two options ("leader" or "follower") without considering other possible roles such as an innovator, collaborator, etc. This looks like a forced dichotomy.
   - **<IR>**: The argument does not provide a conclusive reason but rather a dichotomous statement.
   - **<RR>**: There is no circular reasoning involved.
   - **<WCB>**: There is no cause-effect relationship stated here.
   - **<FU>**: There is no implicit consensus assumed in the statement.
   - **<DEP>**: There is no ambiguous language employed.

4. **Determine Most Suitable Defective Argument Type**:
   - Given the presentation of only two options when there might be more, the argument best fits the category of Incomplete Enumeration (**<FE>**), as it falsely presents an all-inclusive list of possibilities when other viable roles exist.

So, applying <IDAA> to "You are either a leader or a follower," the classification is:

**Type <FE>: Incomplete Enumeration**

The argument creates a false dichotomy by asserting that the only roles available are being a leader or a follower, excluding other potential roles without justification.
