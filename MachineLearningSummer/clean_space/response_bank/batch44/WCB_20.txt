For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "Since your parents named you ‘Harvest,’ they must be farmers," we take it step by step by breaking down the task of classifying the string into specific steps. Here’s the detailed decomposition and classification process:

### Step 1: Identify the Argument Structure
First, identify the different parts of the argument:
- **Proposition (<P>)**: Your parents must be farmers.
- **Reason (<R>)**: They named you 'Harvest.'

### Step 2: Determine the Validity of the Reason
Next, evaluate the reason provided for the proposition:
- Does naming someone 'Harvest' logically mean their parents are farmers? 

### Step 3: Identify Defective Argument Type
Compare the argument to the definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>:
- **<G> (Generalization)**: If the argument makes a broad claim based on limited evidence.
- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: If the argument misses out on pertinent possibilities.
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: If the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness.
- **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: If the reason merely repeats the proposition.
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: If the causal basis is not compelling or logically sound.
- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: If the reason assumes consensus without proper basis.
- **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: If there is ambiguity or double meaning of words.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
Upon analysis:
- The reason (naming someone 'Harvest') does not have a compelling logical basis to conclude that the parents are farmers. This falls under insufficient causal basis since there is no inherent causal relationship between naming someone 'Harvest' and the profession of the parents.

### Conclusion
Classify the argument as <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):
- The argument claims that because the parents named their child 'Harvest', this must mean they are farmers. However, this causal linkage is weak and unsubstantiated.

Thus, the string "Since your parents named you ‘Harvest,’ they must be farmers." is classified as of type <WCB>.
