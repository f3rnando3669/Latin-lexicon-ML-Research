For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of <IDA> into specific steps) to classify the argument "God did not create the world six thousand years ago because matter has always existed, and therefore the world has always existed," we need to decompose the classification task into specific steps. Here are those steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - What is the assertion being made?
   - Proposition (P): "God did not create the world six thousand years ago."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - What is the reasoning or cause provided to support P?
   - Reason (R): "Because matter has always existed, and therefore the world has always existed."

3. **Identify the Type of Defective Argument:**
   - Classify the argument based on the defined types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Application to the Given Argument:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Proposition (P): "God did not create the world six thousand years ago."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Reason (R): "Because matter has always existed, and therefore the world has always existed."

3. **Classify the Type of Defective Argument:**
   - Let's analyze the reasoning. The argument ties the non-creation by God to the eternal existence of matter:
     - **<G> (Generalization):** Not applicable, as it does not make a generalization about a specific set of entities or members.
     - **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):** Not applicable, the argument does not list alternatives or commit an exhaustive fallacy.
     - **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** Applicable. The argument’s reasoning is based on an assertion that matter has "always" existed, which might be considered an assumption lacking conclusive evidence regarding the proposition.
     - **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** Not applicable, as it does not merely restate the proposition.
     - **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** Also applicable. The statement’s causal link between the eternal existence of matter and the non-creation by God is insufficient and not compelling.
     - **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):** Not applicable, the argument does not appeal to popular belief.
     - **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):** Not particularly relevant here because the terms used do not have ambiguous meanings in this context.

The most fitting classification is <IR> (Inconclusive Reason). The argument's reasoning relies on an assertion without providing solid evidence or a direct causal link that "matter has always existed, therefore the world has always existed." This does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.

### Conclusion:
The argument "God did not create the world six thousand years ago because matter has always existed, and therefore the world has always existed." is best classified as an example of <IR> - Inconclusive Reason.
