For 
To classify the argument "one thing leads to another and another and another... creates a “snowball” effect" according to <IDA>, we will perform the task in a step-by-step manner as defined by <IDAA>:

### Step 1: Understand the Argument
- **Proposition (P)**: Something initiates a sequence of events in which one event leads to multiple subsequent events, creating a “snowball” effect.
- **Reason (R)**: The causal basis presented here is a chain reaction where one event causes the next, and so on.
- **Proof of Reason (PR)**: The concept that one event can trigger many others in an expanding and escalating manner, as implied by the phrase "snowball effect."

### Step 2: Identify the Argument Type
Let's classify the argument considering the defective argument types provided: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This doesn't fit here because the argument is not about making a broad assertion from a small sample.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This doesn't fit because the argument doesn’t claim complete enumeration or misrepresent options.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This might fit if the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition, but we should consider if it's a causal issue first.
   
4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This doesn’t fit because the argument isn’t about repeating the same statement in different terms.
   
5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: There’s a possibility it could fit because the "snowball effect" implies a causal relationship that might be weak or presumed without strong evidence.
   
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This doesn't fit because the argument does not appeal to popularity or assumed universal agreement.
   
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: This doesn’t fit as the argument doesn’t involve ambiguity in the interpretation of terms.

### Step 3: Evaluate the Suitability of <WCB>
Given the nature of "one thing leads to another and another and another... creates a 'snowball' effect," the argument presents a causal chain. To classify it as <WCB>:
- **The causal basis is not necessarily compelling or conclusive.**
- It can often be speculative to predict that one event will inevitably lead to a vast array of subsequent events without clear causal evidence.
  
Thus, it implies a causal relationship without providing concrete substantiation for how one event will unquestionably result in a multitude of subsequent effects, fitting the criteria for <WCB>.

### Conclusion
The argument "one thing leads to another and another and another... creates a 'snowball' effect" is most appropriately classified as an example of **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** based on the steps outlined.
