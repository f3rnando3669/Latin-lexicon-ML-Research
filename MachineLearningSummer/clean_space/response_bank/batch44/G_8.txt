For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "If you miss practice, it means you were probably goofing off. People who goof off drop out of school and end up penniless.", let's break down the advanced task <IDA> into specific steps. Here’s the detailed process:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA> (Decompose the Task):

1. **Identify the Argument Structure:**
   - Proposition (P): The statement being argued.
   - Reason (R): The causal basis provided for the Proposition.
   - Proof of Reason (PR): Additional arguments supporting the Reason.

2. **Determine the Nature of the Proposition (P):**
   - Identify the central claim of the argument.

3. **Identify the Reason (R) provided:**
   - Look at the causal basis provided to support the Proposition.

4. **Examine the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - Check if there are additional arguments provided to support the Reason.

5. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:**
   - Compare the identified structure and nature of R and PR with known fallacy types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Applying <D> to <IDA>: 

Let's use the steps outlined above to classify the statement:

1. **Identify the Argument Structure:**

   - **Proposition (P):** Missing practice leads to larger negative outcomes.
     - “If you miss practice, it means you were probably goofing off.”
   - **Reason (R):** Causal basis for the Proposition.
     - “People who goof off drop out of school and end up penniless.”
   - **Proof of Reason (PR):** Additional arguments supporting R.
     - Here, PR directly supports R by claiming that goofing off leads to dropping out and becoming penniless.

2. **Determine the Nature of the Proposition (P):**
   - The central claim is that missing practice has severe negative consequences (like dropping out and becoming penniless).

3. **Identify the Reason (R) provided:**
   - The causal statement connects missing practice to goofing off, which supposedly leads to severe outcomes.

4. **Examine the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - There’s an implied causal chain that assumes missing practice directly correlates with future failure and poverty.

5. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:**
   - **Look for Faulty Causal Relationships:**
     - The statement suggests a causal relationship without strong evidence: missing practice leads to goofing off, which leads to dropping out and becoming penniless.
   - **What Kind of Fallacy?**
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The relationship provided as the reason isn't sufficiently supported. The statement assumes that missing one practice is the starting point of a direct causal chain leading to dropping out and poverty, which is an overgeneralization and lacks strong evidence.

### Conclusion:
The statement "If you miss practice, it means you were probably goofing off. People who goof off drop out of school and end up penniless." is identified as an **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** fallacy.
