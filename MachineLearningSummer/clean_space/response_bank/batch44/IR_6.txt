For 
To apply <IDAA> to classify the argument in the string "Q: Did the President have an affair? A: "He's very busy at the moment with the Middle East Peace talks, and has no time for silly accusations."" we will decompose the task into specific steps and classify the type of defective argument presented.

### Decomposition Steps (<D>):
1. **Identify the main proposition (P)**: Determine what the key assertion or claim is.
2. **Identify the underpinning reason (R)**: Determine the main reasoning or evidence provided to support the proposition.
3. **Evaluate the reason's conclusiveness (IRA)**: Assess whether the reasoning provided conclusively supports the proposition.
4. **Identify the classification (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, or DEP)**: Classify the argument based on its logical structure and any defects present.

### Step-by-step Application (<IDAA>):

#### Step 1: Identify the main proposition (<P>)
The implied main proposition is whether the President had an affair or not.

#### Step 2: Identify the underpinning reason (<R>)
The answer given is: "He's very busy at the moment with the Middle East Peace talks, and has no time for silly accusations."

#### Step 3: Evaluate the reason's conclusiveness (<IRA>)
- **Conclusion:** The provided reason ("He's very busy...") does not directly address the question about the President having an affair.
- **Fitness of the Reason:** The reasoning shifts attention away from the topic of the affair to the President's busy schedule and dismisses the question as "silly."

#### Step 4: Identify the classification of the faulty argument
- The argument avoids answering the key proposition directly and instead introduces an irrelevant topic (the President's busy schedule and peace talks).
- This is a classic example of a **Red Herring** fallacy (a type of <IR> - Inconclusive Reason), which distracts from the real issue instead of addressing it.

### Final Classification
The string "Q: Did the President have an affair? A: "He's very busy at the moment with the Middle East Peace talks, and has no time for silly accusations."" is best classified as <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), specifically using the **Red Herring** technique to avoid addressing the actual question.

### Summary
- **Main Proposition:** Whether the President had an affair.
- **Reason Provided:** The President is very busy with Middle East Peace talks and considers the accusation silly.
- **Evaluation:** The reason does not address the proposition, instead it distracts from the topic.
- **Classification:** <IR> (Red Herring).
