To apply IDAA to the statement "Trump cites (biased) poll results showing that people think he’s a strong leader to prove a point that he is a strong leader.

ABC News/Washington Post Poll (wrong big on election) said almost all stand by their vote on me & 53% said strong leader.", we will decompose the task of classifying the logical fallacy into specific steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Content of the Statement
First, we need to comprehend the content of the statement given:
- It states that Trump uses poll results to prove that he is a strong leader.
- These polls are described as biased.
- The poll results show that almost all respondents stand by their vote for Trump and that 53% think he is a strong leader.

### Step 2: Identify the Central Claim and Reasoning
Next, we identify the central claim and reasoning within the statement:
- **Proposition (P)**: Trump is a strong leader.
- **Reason (R)**: Poll results indicating that almost all respondents stand by their vote and that 53% think he is a strong leader are presented as proof.

### Step 3: Recognize the Type of Logical Fallacy
We will analyze the statement to recognize which specific type of logical fallacy it aligns most closely with:
- The reasoning provided relies on the popularity of the opinion (poll results showing what people think) to validate the claim that Trump is a strong leader.
  
### Step 4: Classify the Logical Fallacy
Based on the reasoning and information provided, classify the logical fallacy:
- The fallacy relies on the assumption that because many people think Trump is a strong leader, this belief is true.
- This aligns with the fallacy of **Presumptuous Consensus** (type <FU>), which assumes that something is true because many people believe it to be true.

### Step 5: Validate the Classification
Ensure that the identified type matches the structure provided in the original definitions and examples.

Here is the step-by-step breakdown applied:

1. **Statement Analysis**:
   - **Statement**: "Trump cites (biased) poll results showing that people think he’s a strong leader to prove a point that he is a strong leader."
   - **Details from Poll**: "ABC News/Washington Post Poll (wrong big on election) said almost all stand by their vote on me & 53% said strong leader."
   
2. **Proposition**:
   - **P**: Trump is a strong leader.
   
3. **Reason**:
   - **R**: A poll result shows many people believe Trump is a strong leader.

4. **Identify Logical Fallacy**:
   - The reasoning is that the number of people who think Trump is a strong leader serves to prove that it is true, which is an example of assuming consensus as truth.
   - This matches the description and examples of **Presumptuous Consensus** (<FU>).

### Conclusion
The statement "Trump cites (biased) poll results showing that people think he’s a strong leader to prove a point that he is a strong leader" is most accurately classified as an example of **Presumptuous Consensus** (type <FU>). This conclusion is drawn from the fact that the argument uses the popularity of belief as evidence of its truth.
