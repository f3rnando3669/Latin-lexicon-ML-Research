For 
To apply <IDAA> to classify the argument type of the statement "Certainly this is the case at most colleges in America nowadays," we need to use a step-by-step approach to first break down the task and then classify the statement.

1. **Understanding the Task (IDA)**:
   We need to classify the argument type of the given string as one of the predefined types: <G> (Generalization), <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration), <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis), <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus), or <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use).

2. **Decomposition of the Task (D)**:
   The process can be broken down into the following specific steps:
   - **Identify the Statement**: Understand the content and context of the given string.
   - **Analyze the Claim**: Determine what is being claimed or asserted.
   - **Match Characteristics**: Match the characteristics of the claim to one of the defined defective argument types.
   - **Classify**: Decide on the most appropriate argument type based on the analysis.

3. **Application of Decomposition (IDAA)**:
   
   - **Identify the Statement**: "Certainly this is the case at most colleges in America nowadays."
   
   - **Analyze the Claim**: 
     This statement is making a generalized assertion about the situation at "most colleges in America nowadays" without providing specific evidence or data to back up the claim.
   
   - **Match Characteristics**: 
     - **Generalization**: The statement assumes that because it is true for some colleges, it must be true for most or all colleges. It does not specify whether the observation is based on a small sample or broad evidence.
     - **Incomplete Enumeration**: The statement does not consider other pertinent possibilities or exceptions.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus**: The statement implies that the situation is widely accepted or understood without providing a basis for this presumed consensus.
   
   - **Classify**:
     - The statement predominantly fits the characteristics of **<G> (Generalization)** because it makes a broad assertion about most colleges without specific evidence.

Thus, applying IDAA to "Certainly this is the case at most colleges in America nowadays" results in classifying it as type **<G> (Generalization)**.
