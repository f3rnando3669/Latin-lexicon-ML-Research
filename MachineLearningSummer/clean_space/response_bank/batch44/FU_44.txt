For 
Let's apply the defined processes step by step:

### Step 1: Decompose the Task <IDA> into Steps

1. **Identify the Argument**: Break down the given statement into its components to understand its structure.
2. **Evaluate the Argument**: Check the argument against the definitions of the different defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).
3. **Classify the Argument**: Assign the argument to one of the defined defective argument types based on the evaluation.

### Step 2: Apply the Steps to the Given Statement

**Given Statement**: "Everyone wants the iPhone 11 because it's the best phone on the market!"

#### Step 1: Identify the Argument

- **Proposition (P)**: "Everyone wants the iPhone 11."
- **Reason (R)**: "because it's the best phone on the market."
  
#### Step 2: Evaluate the Argument

Let's check the provided definitions of defective argument types to see which one fits:

1. **<G> (Generalization)**: The argument doesn't rely on a faulty generalization based on limited observations.
2. **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: The argument doesn't present a false choice or miss out on pertinent possibilities.
3. **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: This doesn't apply as it is claiming consensus rather than providing inconclusive evidence.
4. **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: The reason given is merely restating the proposition without providing new evidence. On close examination, this doesn't seem perfectly suitable.
5. **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The reason doesn't establish an insufficient causal link.
6. **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: The argument is assuming that the iPhone 11 is the best phone simply because everyone desires it. This is an appeal to popularity.
7. **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: The argument does not involve ambiguous or double meanings.

#### Step 3: Classify the Argument

By examining the definitions and matching the argument, 
**the argument "Everyone wants the iPhone 11 because it's the best phone on the market!"** can be classified under **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)** because it relies on the assumption that the popularity of the iPhone 11 justifies it being the best phone.

### Final Classification

The statement "Everyone wants the iPhone 11 because it's the best phone on the market!" is classified as a <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).
