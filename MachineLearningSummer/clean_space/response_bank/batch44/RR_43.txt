### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- **Proposition (P)**: The statement or claim we are analyzing.
- **Identification**: "Ella Watson is the best-liked CEO in our company's history."

### Step 4: Classify the Argument

### Step 5: Detailed Classification Explanation

#### Applying the Steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - "Ella Watson is the best-liked CEO in our company's history."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - "Thanks to her enduring popularity with employees."

3. **Analyze the Logical Structure**:
   - The claim (<P>) is that Ella Watson is the best-liked CEO.
   - The reason (<R>) provided is her enduring popularity with employees.

4. **Classify the Argument**:
   - The classification falls under <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition). The reason given for why Ella Watson is the best-liked CEO is essentially repeating the idea that she is liked (i.e., popular) by employees. The proposition and the reason are circular and do not provide additional substantiated evidence or new information beyond the central claim.

5. **Detailed Classification Explanation**:
   - This argument is of type <RR> because the reasoning provided ("Thanks to her enduring popularity with employees") restates the concept of being "best-liked" without providing a different basis or independent evidence for the claim. It falls into circular reasoning where the reason does not establish the truth of the proposition with any new information or different perspective but merely repeats the claim in different words.

**Conclusion**:
The sentence "Thanks to her enduring popularity with employees, Ella Watson is the best-liked CEO in our company's history." is an example of <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition) as the reason provided simply recycles the proposition without providing independent support.
