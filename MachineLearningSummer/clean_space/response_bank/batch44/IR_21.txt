Sure, let's decompose the task of classifying the argument string into specific steps.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Extract the Proposition (<P>)**: Identify the main assertion or statement that is being made in the argument.
2. **Extract the Reason (<R>)**: Identify the causal basis or what is being used to support the proposition.
3. **Analyze the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>)**: Understand the relationship between the proposition and reason to determine if it is logically sound.
4. **Identify the Argument Type**: Determine if the argument is valid or if it falls into any defective argument category (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>).

Let's apply these steps to the string: "To my knowledge, there are no studies supporting this approach. Therefore, I see no reason to change our routine."

### Step 1: Extract the Proposition (<P>)

The proposition is: 
"I see no reason to change our routine."

### Step 2: Extract the Reason (<R>)

The reason provided for this proposition is: 
"To my knowledge, there are no studies supporting this approach."

### Step 3: Analyze the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>)

- The reason indicates a lack of studies supporting the approach.
- The conclusion is based on the absence of supporting studies.

### Step 4: Identify the Argument Type

- We need to see if the reason logically supports the proposition or if it falls into any defective argument category.

An argument that infers from the lack of evidence to the disproof of something often exhibits a fallacy known as "Appeal to Ignorance" (a type of defective argument where the absence of evidence is taken as evidence of absence).

Based on the steps and the analysis:

1. **Proposition (<P>)**: "I see no reason to change our routine."
2. **Reason (<R>)**: "To my knowledge, there are no studies supporting this approach."
3. **Analysis**:
   - The conclusion (not changing the routine) is drawn from the lack of studies (reason), which implies that in the absence of evidence, it is assumed the approach is not needed.

The argument type can be classified under **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** because the reason provided (no studies supporting the approach) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (no reason to change the routine).

**Classification (<IDA>)**: <IR>
