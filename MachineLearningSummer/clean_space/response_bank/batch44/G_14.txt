To decompose the task of classifying the given string into specific steps, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Argument Structure:** Break down the given statement into its components, including the proposition, reason, and proof of reason, if applicable.
2. **Determine the Nature of the Reasoning:** Evaluate whether the reasoning is sound based on logic and truth.
3. **Classify the Fallacy:** Match the defective reasoning or fallacy in the argument to one of the predefined types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

Let's apply this step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Argument Structure
The given statement can be broken down as follows:
- **Proposition (P):** "Animal experimentation reduces our respect for life."
- **Reason (R):** "If we donâ€™t respect life, we are likely to be more and more tolerant of violent acts like war and murder."
- **Proof of Reason (PR):** "Soon our society will become a battlefield in which everyone constantly fears for their lives. It will be the end of civilization."
- **Conclusion:** "To prevent this terrible consequence, we should make animal experimentation illegal right now."

### Step 2: Determine the Nature of the Reasoning
Evaluate the logic behind the given argument. Here, the reasoning follows a chain of increasingly severe consequences that are claimed to stem from animal experimentation.

### Step 3: Classify the Fallacy
Consider if the argument is sound. The argument is making a slippery slope claim, where one action (animal experimentation) is predicted to lead to extreme and negative outcomes (end of civilization) without sufficient causal evidence.

**Match the Argument to the Defective Argument Types:**
- **<G> Generalization:** The argument does not fit this as it is not generalizing a specific observation to a larger group.
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:** There is no false dichotomy or missing intermediate options here.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** This fallacy involves irrelevant reasons, which is partly applicable, but not the main issue.
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** There is no circular reasoning here.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** The reasoning falls short here. The connection between animal experimentation and the end of civilization is not sufficiently evidenced.
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** The argument does not rely on majority belief.
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:** The argument does not hinge on ambiguous terms.

Based on these considerations, the most fitting classification is **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**, as the argument connects animal experimentation to severe societal breakdowns without sufficient causal evidence.

Thus, the classification of the string is: **<WCB>**.
