For 
To apply <IDAA>, which involves breaking down the task of classifying a given string into specific steps and then applying those steps, we need to identify the logical fallacy in the string "The Bible is the Word of God because God tells us it is... in the Bible.

X is true because of Y.
Y is true because of X."

Hereâ€™s the decomposition and step-by-step application:

### Decomposition of the Task (<D>)
D1. Identify the core proposition and reason within the string.
D2. Evaluate if the reason provided is conclusively establishing the proposition.
D3. Check for any circular reasoning or the repetition of the initial proposition within the reason.
D4. Match the observed fallacy with the appropriate type: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step-by-Step Application (<IDAA>)

#### D1. Identify the core proposition and reason within the string.
- Proposition: "The Bible is the Word of God."
- Reason: "God tells us it is... in the Bible."

#### D2. Evaluate if the reason provided is conclusively establishing the proposition.
- The reason provided ("God tells us it is... in the Bible") is based on the authority of the Bible itself.

#### D3. Check for any circular reasoning or the repetition of the initial proposition within the reason.
- The argument states X (The Bible is the Word of God) is true because of Y (God tells us it is), and Y (God tells us) is asserted to be true because of X (it is stated in the Bible).
- This is a clear case of circular reasoning, where the reason provided is essentially a restatement of the initial proposition, relying on itself for validation.

#### D4. Match the observed fallacy with the appropriate type.
- Given the breakdown, this is a classic example of **circular reasoning**: "X is true because of Y. Y is true because of X."

### Conclusion:
- The string "The Bible is the Word of God because God tells us it is... in the Bible." is classified under **<RR>** (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), which describes circular reasoning.

Therefore, the given string falls under the type <RR>.
