Sure! To apply <IDAA> to "If you don't pay taxes, you don't deserve the right to vote," let's break down the task into specific steps as follows:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for Classifying <s>:
1. **Understand the Argument in <s>**:
   - Identify the Proposition (What is being asserted or claimed).
   - Identify the Reason (What rationale is being provided to support the Proposition).

2. **Examine the Structure and Content of <s>**:
   - Analyze the connection made between the Proposition and the Reason.
   - Look for common patterns or keywords indicative of logical fallacies.

3. **Classify the Argument Type**:
   - Match the identified pattern or keywords to known defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU> or <DEP>.

### Application of Steps to "If you don't pay taxes, you don't deserve the right to vote.":

1. **Understand the Argument in <s>**:
   - **Proposition (P)**: People who do not pay taxes do not deserve the right to vote.
   - **Reason (R)**: Voting rights are somehow conditioned on tax payment status.

2. **Examine the Structure and Content of <s>**:
   - This statement makes a direct connection between the act of paying taxes and the entitlement to vote. 
   - It implicitly assumes a restrictive condition without providing a comprehensive reason why this condition should affect voting rights.

3. **Classify the Argument Type**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement does not generalize from specific examples; it makes an absolute claim.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement does not list out all possible reasons or exceptions, simply stating one condition.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The causal connection between paying taxes and deserving to vote is not conclusively demonstrated.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The statement does not repeat the proposition as its reason.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The statement lacks a compelling or sufficient causal basis for connecting tax payment to voting eligibility.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The statement does not appeal to the consensus of many people or popularity.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The statement's language is clear without ambiguous terms.

Based on examining the connection and the nature of the argument, we classify this argument primarily as:

### <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)
The reason provided ("not paying taxes") does not conclusively demonstrate why someone should not deserve the right to vote. There is an assumption of correlation without a compelling causal justification.

So, the classification of the argument "If you don't pay taxes, you don't deserve the right to vote." is that it falls under **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** because the claim made is based on a rationale that does not conclusively support the proposition.
