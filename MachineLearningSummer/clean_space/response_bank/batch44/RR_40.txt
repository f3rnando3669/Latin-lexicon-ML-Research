For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the given string according to its type, we'll decompose the task into specific steps and follow them accordingly.

**Step-by-Step Decomposition for Classifying the Argument String:**

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), and Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - **<P>:** "Companies that make huge profits must be exploiting their customers."
   - **<R>:** "The only way a company could make large profits is by taking advantage of their customers."
   - **<PR>:** Not directly presented, but implied reasoning within the statement.

2. **Determine the nature of the Reason (<R>):
   - Assess the logical structure of the reason.
   - Evaluate if the reason logically and conclusively supports the proposition. If there are logical flaws or assumptions, these will guide us to detect the specific defective argument type.

3. **Match the Reason’s flaws with known defective argument types:**
   - Look for signs of generalization, incomplete enumeration, inconclusive reasoning, faulty repetition, insufficient causal basis, presumptuous consensus, or ambiguous language use.

4. **Classify the defective argument type based on the identified flaws:**

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition, Reason, and Proof of Reason**

- **<P>:** "Companies that make huge profits must be exploiting their customers."
- **<R>:** "The only way a company could make large profits is by taking advantage of their customers."
- **<PR>:** The reason provided is more of an assertion and lacks external evidence or a corroborative argument.

**Step 2: Determine the nature of the Reason**

- The reason states an absolute condition for companies making large profits: it asserts that exploitation is the only possible way to achieve such profits.

**Step 3: Match the Reason’s flaws with known defective argument types**

- The reason presumes a singular, universally true cause (i.e., exploitation) for the large profits without considering any other possibilities, such as innovation, superior management, customer satisfaction, or beneficial market conditions.

**Reasoning Process:**
1. **Looks like a Generalization (G) because it applies an assumed trait (exploitation) to all companies making large profits without justification or evidence for such a sweeping statement.**
2. **Could also involve Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** since it fails to list other potential ways companies could earn large profits and prematurely locks into one cause.

**Conclusion: Classify the Argument Type**

- **Type <G> (Generalization):** The argument broadly generalizes that all companies making large profits do so through exploitation without providing evidence or considering diverse possibilities.

Thus, the argument "Companies that make huge profits must be exploiting their customers because the only way a company could make large profits is by taking advantage of their customers." falls under the category of a Generalization.
