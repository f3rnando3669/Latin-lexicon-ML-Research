For 
We can apply the task of classifying the given statement "I stay away from those gatherings because I don't want to be brainwashed." as follows:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDA Task

1. **Identify the main argument (Proposition <P>):**
   - The speaker chooses to stay away from gatherings.

2. **Identify the Reason (Reason <R>):**
   - The speaker avoids gatherings because they don't want to be brainwashed.

3. **Analyze the causal basis for <P> (Proof of Reason <PR>):**
   - The causal basis is that attending gatherings leads to brainwashing.

4. **Determine if the causal basis provided is compelling or sufficient for the stated Proposition:**
   - Analyze if there is sufficient evidence or logical basis provided that supports the claim that attending gatherings leads to brainwashing (which has not been provided in the statement).

### Application of IDA to Classification
Based on the steps, we now classify the statement:

- **Proposition <P>:** "I stay away from those gatherings."
- **Reason <R>:** "because I don't want to be brainwashed."
- **Proof of Reason <PR>:** The claim lacks evidence that gatherings necessarily cause brainwashing. 

Therefore, the argument can be classified as having an **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because it assumes a cause (brainwashing) without providing adequate evidence or a compelling argument that supports this causal relationship.

### Classification
The statement "I stay away from those gatherings because I don't want to be brainwashed." is classified under **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

### Conclusion
Using the step-by-step method (IDAA), we decomposed the task of identifying the type of defective argument and determined that the provided statement falls under the category of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
