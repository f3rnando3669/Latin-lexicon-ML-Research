For 
Let's apply the decomposition of the task of classifying an argument or statement, <s>, according to fallacies (<IDA>) step by step (<IDAA>).

**Step 1: Understand the structure of the argument in <s>.**
The argument presented in <s> is:
"You can't give me a D because I'm an A student!"

**Step 2: Identify components of the argument: Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), and Proof of Reason (<PR>).**
- **Proposition (<P>)**: "You can't give me a D."
- **Reason (<R>)**: "because I'm an A student!"
- **Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: There is no further proof provided apart from the reason itself.

**Step 3: Examine the Reason (<R>) closely to check if it supports the Proposition (<P>) correctly.**
- The reason "because I'm an A student!" seems to merely state a claim rather than providing substantial evidence or cause to support the proposition "You can't give me a D."

**Step 4: Consider if the argument suffers from any known logical fallacies.**
- The Reason (<R>) does not introduce any tangible evidence or external validation; it relies solely on circular reasoning. The claim of being an "A student" is restated as justification for not receiving a "D."

**Step 5: Use definitions of key fallacies to match the argument type.**

**Examining possible fallacies:**
- **Generalization (G)**: This argument is not generalizing from specific cases to a universal claim, so it doesn't fit G.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: It does not miss out on pertinent possibilities in a dichotomous choice.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason presented is not weak per se but repetitive without proof.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Looks promising as the argument essentially uses the proposition to justify itself.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There isnâ€™t a causal basis being claimed falsely here.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: It doesn't appeal to popularity for validation.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: There is no ambiguous language or double meaning.

**Step 6: Final decision:**
- The fallacy that best describes the statement "You can't give me a D because I'm an A student!" is **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**. The reason is essentially a repetition of the proposition without providing an additional rationale.

**Conclusion:**
The statement "You can't give me a D because I'm an A student!" is of type **<RR>**.
