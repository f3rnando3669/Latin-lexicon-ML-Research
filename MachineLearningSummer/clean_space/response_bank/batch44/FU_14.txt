For 
To apply \(\langle IDAA \rangle\) to the string "taps into people's desire to belong," we will follow the steps of decomposition to classify the string as one of the argument types \(\langle G \rangle\), \(\langle FE \rangle\), \(\langle IR \rangle\), \(\langle RR \rangle\), \(\langle WCB \rangle\), \(\langle FU \rangle\) or \(\langle DEP \rangle\). 

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

**Step 1: Comprehend the Meaning**
- Understand the string "taps into people's desire to belong" as it relates to the context of arguments and logical fallacies.

**Step 2: Identify Key Characteristics**
- Recognize that the phrase suggests an appeal to a common human desire to feel part of a group.

**Step 3: Match Characteristics with Argument Types**
- Compare the characteristics identified with definitions of the argument types provided:
  - \(\langle G \rangle\): Generalization based on insufficient evidence about all members of a category.
  - \(\langle FE \rangle\): Incomplete Enumeration, presenting a limited set of options as the only possibilities.
  - \(\langle IR \rangle\): Inconclusive Reason, where the reasons provided do not conclusively support the proposition.
  - \(\langle RR \rangle\): Faulty Repetition of Proposition, where the reason merely restates the proposition.
  - \(\langle WCB \rangle\): Insufficient Causal Basis, where the causal connection between the reason and proposition is weak or unsupported.
  - \(\langle FU \rangle\): Presumptuous Consensus, assuming a proposition is true based on its popularity or common acceptance.
  - \(\langle DEP \rangle\): Ambiguous Language Use, where a word or phrase is used with multiple meanings.

**Step 4: Determine the Closest Match**
- "Taps into people's desire to belong" directly addresses the appeal to popularity or the idea that people want to conform to a group. This is suggestive of:
  - \(\langle FU \rangle\): Presumptuous Consensus, as it typically involves arguments that rely on the belief that something is true or desirable because many people agree with it.

**Step 5: Make the Classification**
- Based on the evaluations through the steps:
  - The string "taps into people's desire to belong" aligns with \(\langle FU \rangle\) because it highlights a form of argumentation that appeals to the desire for social inclusion and consensus.

### Conclusion
- The argument type for the string "taps into people's desire to belong" is \(\langle FU \rangle\): Presumptuous Consensus.
