For 
To apply <IDAA> to "Either you text your friend or you don't have any fun at all." let's proceed step by step through the decomposition of the task:

### Step 1: Decompose the Advanced Task (<D>)
1. **Identify the types of defective arguments available**:
    - Generalization (<G>)
    - Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
    - Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
    - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
    - Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
    - Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
    - Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)

2. **Classify the string based on definitions**:
    - Analyze the given string.
    - Compare its structure and logic to the definitions of the defective arguments.

### Step 2: Apply the Steps to <IDA>

#### 2.1 Identify the types of defective arguments available
We have already listed the types of defective arguments.

#### 2.2 Analyze the given string
The string to analyze is: "Either you text your friend or you don't have any fun at all."

#### 2.3 Compare its structure and logic to the definitions of the defective arguments:
- **Generalization**: Doesn't apply as there is no extrapolation from a part to a whole.
- **Incomplete Enumeration**: This suggests a false dichotomy, limiting choices to two options when there could be many more.
- **Inconclusive Reason**: The statement itself proposes a direct cause-effect relationship that might not be conclusively reasoned.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: There is no redundant repetition of the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis**: The string does not provide a weak causal claim.
- **Presumptuous Consensus**: This is about assuming consensus or majority agreement. This doesn't fit here.
- **Ambiguous Language Use**: The language used isn't ambiguous or misleading due to word meanings.

#### 2.4 Identify the closest match
The string "Either you text your friend or you don't have any fun at all." falls under the definition of **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**, as it presents a false dichotomy, suggesting only two possible outcomes without considering other options.

### Step 3: Conclude the Classification
The defective argument type for the string "Either you text your friend or you don't have any fun at all." is:

- **Type <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**

This completes the application of <IDAA> to the given string.
