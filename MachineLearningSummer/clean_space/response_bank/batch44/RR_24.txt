For 
Certainly! To apply <IDAA> to "Richardson is the most successful mayor the town has ever had because he's the best mayor of our history," we need to decompose the task of classifying the string into specific steps and then follow those steps to identify which type it belongs to. Here are the steps for <D>:

1. **Identify Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine the primary claim made in the argument.
2. **Identify Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine the causal basis provided to support the proposition.
3. **Classify Type of Argumentation:**
   - Analyze the relationship between <P> and <R> to classify the type of argument (whether it's <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>).

### Step-by-Step Application:

#### Step 1: Identify Proposition (<P>)
- **Proposition (<P>):** "Richardson is the most successful mayor the town has ever had."

#### Step 2: Identify Reason (<R>)
- **Reason (<R>):** "because he's the best mayor of our history."

#### Step 3: Classify Type of Argumentation
- **Analysis:**
   - The argument claims that Richardson is the most successful (P) because he is the best mayor in history (R).
   - Notice that "most successful" and "best" are essentially the same in meaning within this context; the reason does not provide any new information or an independent basis for the proposition but merely repeats it in different terms.

- **Classification:**
   - This is an example of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**. It is presenting the premise in different words without providing a true causal basis or evidence.

Therefore, the string "Richardson is the most successful mayor the town has ever had because he's the best mayor of our history" is classified as <RR>.
