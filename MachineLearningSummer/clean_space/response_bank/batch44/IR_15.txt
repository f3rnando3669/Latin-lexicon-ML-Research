To classify the string "My roommate wants to talk about cleaning out the garage, so I asked her what she wants to do with our patio furniture. Now she's shopping for new patio furniture and not asking me about the garage." according to the types of defective arguments defined, we'll follow the steps for task decomposition:

### Step 1: Understand the Argument Structure
**Premise**: "My roommate wants to talk about cleaning out the garage."
**Response**: "I asked her what she wants to do with our patio furniture."
**Outcome**: "Now she's shopping for new patio furniture and not asking me about the garage."

### Step 2: Identify Logical Connections or Lack Thereof
- Analyze how the response relates to the premise.
- Analyze the outcome and how it relates to the original premise and response.

### Step 3: Compare with Defined Defective Argument Types
- Assess if the reasoning is of a certain defective logic type among <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step 4: Classify According to Defective Argument Type
- Evaluate if the argument uses ambiguous language, faulty reasoning, insufficient causal basis, etc.

### Decomposition and Classification

#### Analysis
1. **Premise**:
   - Roommate's interest: Cleaning out the garage.
   
2. **Response**:
   - Redirected conversation: Asked about the patio furniture instead of addressing the garage.
   
3. **Outcome**:
   - Roommate is now shopping for new patio furniture, avoiding the discussion about the garage.

#### Comparison with Categories and Classification
1. **FE (Incomplete Enumeration)**: Not applicable as it's not presenting a false dichotomy.
2. **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**: Not directly conclusive but lack of direct causality does not fit here.
3. **RR (Faulty Repetition)**: Does not repeat a proposition.
4. **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: Potentially misaligned causality here might be involved.
5. **FU (Presumptuous Consensus)**: No assumption of consensus in the argument.
6. **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use)**: No wordplay or ambiguity in terms used.
7. **G (Generalization)**: No broad generalization of a group of subjects directly from a specific instance.

#### Detailed Fit
- **Red Herring (relative of DEP**) or **WCB (redirecting the argument)**:
   The argument seems to diverge by introducing a new topic (patio furniture) instead of addressing the initial topic (garage cleaning). This classic diversion tactic fits within a Red Herring approach, causing a distraction from the main issue.

#### Conclusion
The sentence "My roommate wants to talk about cleaning out the garage, so I asked her what she wants to do with our patio furniture. Now she's shopping for new patio furniture and not asking me about the garage." best fits the pattern of **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use)**, specifically employing a Red Herring to distract from the original topic.

Therefore, the string is classified as **DEP**:
```markdown
<s> = "My roommate wants to talk about cleaning out the garage, so I asked her what she wants to do with our patio furniture. Now she's shopping for new patio furniture and not asking me about the garage."
type = <DEP>
```
