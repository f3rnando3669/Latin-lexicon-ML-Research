For 
To apply IDAA to the statement "It rained and then we lost the game. Every time it rains, we're going to lose.", let's decompose the task of identifying the fallacy into specific steps. We'll then apply those steps to the given statement.

### Decomposition of Task (D)

1. **Identify the components** of the statement that make up the argument.
2. **Determine the structure** of the argument: Proposition, Reason, Proof of Reason.
3. **Analyze each component** to see if it matches any known forms of defective arguments (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>).
4. **Compare the identified fallacies** to determine the most fitting one to classify the argument.

### Application to the Given Statement

1. **Identify the components** of the statement that make up the argument:
    - **Proposition (P):** "Every time it rains, we're going to lose."
    - **Reason (R):** "It rained and then we lost the game."

2. **Determine the structure** of the argument:
    - The **Proposition** is the general claim about the future outcome of games if it rains.
    - The **Reason** is an observation linking a single incident (it rained, and then the game was lost) to support this general claim.

3. **Analyze each component** to see if it matches any known forms of defective arguments:

    - **Generalization (G):** The statement doesn't necessarily generalize from a limited sample to all cases without proper evidence.
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The statement does not present a false dichotomy or claim that there are only two possible outcomes.
    - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** An argument where the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition might fit, but we need to delve deeper.
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The Reason doesn't simply restate the Proposition; it uses an example to claim support.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This is a perfect fit as it assumes a causal relationship between rain and losing the game based on insufficient evidence.
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The statement does not rely on the fallacy of popular opinion or consensus.
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The terms in the statement are not ambiguous or misleading.

4. **Compare the identified fallacies**:
    - Among the analyzed fallacies, the best fit appears to be **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, as the argument assumes a causal link between two events (rain and losing the game) without sufficient evidence to support such a causal relationship.

### Conclusion

Apply the classification <IDAA> to the statement "It rained and then we lost the game. Every time it rains, we're going to lose." results in the classification: **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
