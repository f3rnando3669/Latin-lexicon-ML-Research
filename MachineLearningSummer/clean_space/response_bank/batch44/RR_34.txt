For 
To apply <IDAA> (decomposing and classifying an argument step by step), we'll break down the task of identifying the type of argument in the provided statement into specific steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Key Components in the Argument
1. **Claim**: "You can't give me a C in this course..."
2. **Reason**: "... Because I am an A student."
3. **Warrant**: "An A student is someone who can't receive Cs."

### Step 2: Analyze the Components
1. **Claim Analysis**:
   - The claim is that the student should not receive a C grade in the course.
   
2. **Reason Analysis**:
   - The reason provided is that the student identifies as an A student.
   
3. **Warrant Analysis**:
   - The warrant implies that being an A student inherently means one cannot receive a C grade.

### Step 3: Identify Defective Argument Types
We have the following types to consider:
- **<G>**: Generalization
- **<FE>**: Incomplete Enumeration
- **<IR>**: Inconclusive Reason
- **<RR>**: Faulty Repetition of Proposition
- **<WCB>**: Insufficient Causal Basis
- **<FU>**: Presumptuous Consensus
- **<DEP>**: Ambiguous Language Use

### Step 4: Match the Argument Type
1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument type asserts something about all members of a group based on an observation of some members of that group. This argument does not fit <G> because it doesn’t make a statement about a larger group based on limited evidence.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This argument suggests a binary choice where there could be more options. This is not apparent in the given argument.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This argument type lacks a strong link between the reason given and the claim made. The reason in this argument (being an A student) does not conclusively connect to the claim (should not receive a C).

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This involves restating the same information as if it were proof. This is a potential type because the argument essentially states: 
     - "I am an A student" (claim).
     - "because A students don't get C’s" (warrant and restating the reason as if it’s new proof).

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This implies insufficient or incorrect causal relationship. This doesn’t seem to fit as there isn’t a causal link being asserted.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This assumes a point is valid because many believe so. Irrelevant to this argument.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Language that can be misinterpreted. This does not appear to fit the criteria as language is clear in its intent.

### Step 5: Conclusion
- The argument fits most closely with **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**. It essentially restates the premise (being an A student) as if it were a sufficient reason/evidence to support the claim, thus creating a circular argument.

**Therefore, the provided argument is an instance of <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**.
