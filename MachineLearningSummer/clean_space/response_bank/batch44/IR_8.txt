To apply the decomposition (<D>) approach to the task of classifying the argument in the provided statement, let's break down the steps and analyze the argument step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition \(<P>\)
Identify the main statement or claim that is being put forward as something to be proven.
- **Proposition (P)**: "Education costs are not a problem."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason \(<R>\)
Identify the reason that is given to support the proposition.
- **Reason (R)**: "Because 90% of college students polled had no debt."

### Step 3: Classify the Argument Type
Examine the reason and proposition to determine which defective argument type it fits into. Let's review the definitions:

- **Generalization (\<G\>)**: Making a broad claim based on limited observations.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)**: A false dichotomy or presenting limited choices.
- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**: Reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)**: Circular reasoning.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**: Causal relationship is weak or unfounded.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)**: Assuming something as true based on popular opinion.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)**: Wordplay or ambiguous language.

### Step 4: Determine the Most Fitting Type

Let's analyze the argument in detail:

- The claim "Education costs are not a problem" is supported by the reason "90% of college students polled had no debt."
- This suggests that because a majority of a specific group did not face a particular problem (debt), the problem does not exist.

This matches with the definition of **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)**, as it implies that there are only two possibilities (students with debt vs. education costs being a problem) and misses out on other pertinent factors such as variations in debt levels, financial aid, scholarships, and other costs students might face.

However, it also suggests that the problem is not significant simply because a majority didn't experience it, which aligns with the **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)**, expecting acceptance of the proposition due to a supposed consensus.

To further clarify the best fit:
- **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)** seems more fitting here because it emphasizes assuming the truth of the proposition on the basis of "universal agreement" or a statistically significant majority.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis and comparison with definitions, the statement "Because 90% of college students polled had no debt, education costs are not a problem." fits best with the defective argument type **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)**.

### Final Classification

The statement is classified as:
- **Type: Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)**
