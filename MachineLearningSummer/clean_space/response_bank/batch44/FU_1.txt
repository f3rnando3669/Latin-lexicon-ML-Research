Sure, let's apply the structured approach of <IDAA> to classify the statement "claiming that an idea or belief is true simply because it is what most people believe."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of the Task (<D>):

1. **Identify Keywords**: Look for key phrases or concepts in the string that indicate the type of defective argument.
2. **Analyze Logical Structure**: Determine the logical flow and structure of the argument to see how the claim is being supported.
3. **Match with Definitions**: Compare the keywords and logical structure with the definitions of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.
4. **Classify**: Assign the correct defective argument type based on the analysis.

### Applying the Steps:

1. **Identify Keywords**:
   - Keywords: "claiming," "idea or belief," "true," "most people believe"
   
2. **Analyze Logical Structure**:
   - This argument suggests that the validity of a belief is based on its popularity.
   - The argument relies on the fact that because "most people believe" something, it must be true.

3. **Match with Definitions**:
   - <G>: Generalization based on a part or majority of individuals.
   - <FE>: Incomplete Enumeration misses pertinent possibilities.
   - <IR>: Inconclusive Reason does not conclusively demonstrate correctness.
   - <RR>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition states the proposition and reason in the same way.
   - <WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis where the reason submitted is not compelling.
   - <FU>: Presumptuous Consensus assumes something is true because many people agree.
   - <DEP>: Ambiguous Language Use where a term can be taken differently.

   Upon comparison, the keywords and logical structure align best with <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus), which assumes an argument is correct because it is widely accepted.

4. **Classify**:
   - The statement "claiming that an idea or belief is true simply because it is what most people believe" is best classified under <FU>.

**Conclusion**:
The statement "claiming that an idea or belief is true simply because it is what most people believe" is of type <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).
