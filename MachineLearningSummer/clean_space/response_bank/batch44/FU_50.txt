For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task "An influencer posts on Instagram that the restaurant 'EP is poppin'! Everyone worth knowing is here tonight - come on down!' -- this is an example of:", we will decompose it (D) into specific steps for the classification task (IDA).

Step-by-step decomposition (<D>):

1. **Extract the statement:** Identify the main proposition that needs classification.
2. **Identify the elements of the argument:** Break down the statement to understand its structure.
3. **Analyze the basis of persuasion:** Determine on what basis the argument is trying to persuade.
4. **Match with known defective argument types:** Compare the argument elements with the definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.
5. **Classify the argument:** Assign the statement to the appropriate defective argument type.

### Step-by-Step Application (<IDAA>):

1. **Extract the statement:**
   - The statement is: "EP is poppin'! Everyone worth knowing is here tonight - come on down!"

2. **Identify the elements of the argument:**
   - **Proposition (P):** "EP is poppin'! Everyone worth knowing is here tonight."
   - **Call to action:** "come on down!"

3. **Analyze the basis of persuasion:**
   - The influencer is suggesting that because everyone worth knowing is at the restaurant, you should come down too.
   - This suggests that the presence of "everyone worth knowing" is a reason why the restaurant is a desirable place to be.

4. **Match with known defective argument types:**
   - **<G> Generalization:** Doesn’t seem to rely on a generalization about a group.
   - **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:** Doesn’t present a false dichotomy or incomplete options.
   - **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** No weak or inconclusive reasoning present.
   - **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** No circular reasoning or repetition.
   - **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** No faulty causal link is suggested.
   - **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** This involves validating the argument based on its popularity.
   - **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:** The language isn’t particularly ambiguous in this context.

5. **Classify the argument:**
   - The statement fits the description of <FU> Presumptuous Consensus as it appeals to the idea that because "everyone worth knowing is here tonight," it suggests that you should be there too. This relies on the assumption that popular behavior implies correctness or desirability.

### Classification:
- The statement is an example of <FU> Presumptuous Consensus.

Therefore, "An influencer posts on Instagram that the restaurant 'EP is poppin'! Everyone worth knowing is here tonight - come on down!' -- this is an example of:" <FU>.
