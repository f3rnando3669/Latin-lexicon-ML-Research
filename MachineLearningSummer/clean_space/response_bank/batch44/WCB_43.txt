For 
To apply <IDAA> to "1. All the schools in the area had to be kept closed for most part of the week. 2. Many parents have withdrawn their children from the local schools," we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Decompose the Task

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - Determine what is being claimed.

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - Assess the basis or reason provided for the claim.

3. **Evaluate the Causal Basis (PR)**:
   - Determine if the reason provided is a valid proof of the proposition.

4. **Classify the Argument**:
   - Based on the identified elements (P, R, PR), classify the argument as one of the defective types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step 2: Apply the Steps to the Given Strings

#### 1. Identify the Proposition (P)
- **String 1:** "All the schools in the area had to be kept closed for most part of the week."
    - **Proposition:** Schools were kept closed for the majority of the week.

- **String 2:** "Many parents have withdrawn their children from the local schools."
   - **Proposition:** Parents have withdrawn their children from local schools.

#### 2. Identify the Reason (R)
- **String 1:**
  - No explicit reason is given in this sentence alone. It is a factual statement.
  
- **String 2:**
  - The reason is implied rather than stated. It may suggest a reaction to the statement in String 1 (the closure of schools).

#### 3. Evaluate the Causal Basis (PR)
- **PR Evaluation:** Assuming the two statements are meant to be connected, the causation implied by combining these two sentences would be that parents withdrew their children because the schools were closed.

#### 4. Classify the Argument
Now let's classify each component and its argument type by evaluating the connection between the given reasons and the proposition:

1. **String 1** (P: schools were closed):
   - Proposition about the closure of schools.

2. **String 2** (P: parents withdrew children):
   - Implies causality that the closure of schools led to withdrawal of children.

Classification Examination:
- The argument assumes a connection/correlation between closing schools and parents withdrawing their children, without additional evidence for causation.
- This fits best into **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because the reason given (schools were closed) is not by itself compelling enough to prove the proposition (many parents withdrawing children).

Thus, these statements imply a weak causality rather than conclusive evidence of cause and effect. We classify this as <WCB>â€”Insufficient Causal Basis because the given reason does not strongly establish the conclusion.

### Conclusion
- The argument "All the schools in the area had to be kept closed for most part of the week. Many parents have withdrawn their children from the local schools." is of type **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
