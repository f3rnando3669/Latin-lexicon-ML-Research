For 
To classify the string "Senator Randall isn't lying when she says she cares about her constituents—she wouldn't lie to people she cares about." using the specific steps of decomposition for IDAA, let's follow this step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Identify Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>)

- **Proposition (<P>)**: Senator Randall isn't lying.
- **Reason (<R>)**: She wouldn't lie to people she cares about.

### Step 2: Evaluate the Structure of the Argument
Evaluate whether the argument presented has a clear and valid logical structure.

### Step 3: Look for Logical Fallacies and Defective Argument Types
Determine if there are any logical fallacies or defective arguments such as <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument Based on Identified Defects
Identify from the classifications provided which category best describes the identified defect in the structure or logic of the argument.

### Step 5: Verify Classification
Ensure the classification accurately represents the defect based on the given example and its explanation.

### Application:

**Step 1 and 2: Identifying the components and evaluating structure**
- The argument asserts that Senator Randall is not lying. The reason provided is that she wouldn't lie to people she cares about. 

**Step 3: Look for logical fallacies and defective argument types**
- The reasoning given is that "she wouldn't lie to people she cares about." This essentially restates the proposition "she isn't lying" because "she cares about her constituents." 

**Step 4: Classify the argument based on identified defect**
- The argument seems circular as it uses the proposition to substantiate itself.
- It repeats the notion that she wouldn't lie because she cares, implicitly assuming the very point that needs proving (her honesty).

**Step 5: Verify classification**
- This falls under Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>) as it repeats the proposition within the reason, without providing new or independent evidence. 

Therefore, the argument "Senator Randall isn't lying when she says she cares about her constituents—she wouldn't lie to people she cares about." can be classified as <RR> using the task decomposition IDAA.
