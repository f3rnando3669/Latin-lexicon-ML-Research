For 
To tackle the task of classifying the statement "In March, 5G was introduced and then we all got COVID" into one of the given defective argument types, we can decompose the task into the following specific steps:

1. **Understand the Statement**:
   - Break down the statement into its components to understand what's being asserted.
  
2. **Identify Key Components**:
   - Detect any potential cause-and-effect relationship implied by the statement.

3. **Match Components to Defective Argument Types**:
   - Compare the identified cause-and-effect relationship or any other logical structure to the definitions of the given defective argument types.

4. **Analyze for Relevant Fallacies**:
   - Determine which fallacy is most applicable based on the structure and implications of the statement.

### Step-by-Step Application:

1. **Understand the Statement**:
   - The statement "In March, 5G was introduced and then we all got COVID" implies a temporal relationship between the introduction of 5G technology and the outbreak of COVID-19.

2. **Identify Key Components**:
   - **5G introduction**: Cause
   - **COVID-19 outbreak**: Effect

3. **Match Components to Defective Argument Types**:
   - The statement suggests that the introduction of 5G technology caused the COVID-19 outbreak.

4. **Analyze for Relevant Fallacies**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument doesn't generalize a belief about a group or class.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement does not present an incomplete list of options leading to a conclusion.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The argument here hinges heavily on a causal relationship rather than being an inconclusive argument overall.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The statement doesn't simply repeat the same proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument asserts a causal relationship between 5G and COVID-19 without any scientific basis or logical evidence.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The statement does not rely on consensus to justify the argument.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The meaning of the terms used is not ambiguous or misleading in different contexts.

From the analysis, the statement "In March, 5G was introduced and then we all got COVID" exhibits characteristics of an **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** argument. It claims a direct cause-and-effect relationship between two events without providing any compelling evidence or logical basis to support such a causal link.

### Conclusion:
The statement "In March, 5G was introduced and then we all got COVID" is an example of **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
