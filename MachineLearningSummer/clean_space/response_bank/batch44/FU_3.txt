For 
To solve the task <IDAA> for the statement "Almost everyone at my school will be at the party Friday night. It must be the right thing to do," we need to identify its classification by decomposing the task <IDA> into specific steps. Here is the step-by-step decomposition <D> for the task <IDA>:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D):

1. **Understand the Statement**: Read the given statement carefully.
2. **Identify Key Components**:
    - **Proposition (<P>)**: Determine the main claim or assertion being presented.
    - **Reason (<R>)**: Identify the reason provided for the <P>.
3. **Classify the Type of Defective Argument**:
    - Compare the <P> and <R> to the definitions of the defective argument types:
        - **Generalization (<G>)**
        - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
        - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
        - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**
        - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
        - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
        - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**
4. **Make a Determination**: Based on the comparison, classify the argument type.

### Applying <IDAA> to the Given Statement:

1. **Understand the Statement**:
    - "Almost everyone at my school will be at the party Friday night. It must be the right thing to do."

2. **Identify Key Components**:
    - **Proposition (<P>)**: "Going to the party Friday night is the right thing to do."
    - **Reason (<R>)**: "Almost everyone at my school will be at the party."

3. **Classify the Type of Defective Argument**:
    - **Generalization (<G>)**: This would involve making a broad claim based on a specific instance.
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This would involve presenting an argument that purports to cover all possibilities while missing pertinent ones.
    - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This would present a reason that doesnâ€™t conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This would present a reason that merely repeats the proposition.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This would involve presenting a weak causal relationship as the reason.
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This would involve assuming something is true on the basis of it being universally agreed upon.
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: This would involve using ambiguous language that can be taken in another sense.

4. **Make a Determination**:
    - The argument "Almost everyone at my school will be at the party Friday night. It must be the right thing to do" is suggesting that because most people (a presumed consensus) are doing something, it implies correctness or appropriateness of the action, without further substantive reason.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the argument type is best classified as **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**.

### Final Output:
The statement "Almost everyone at my school will be at the party Friday night. It must be the right thing to do." is classified as **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**.
