To apply IDAA (the decomposition of IDA into specific steps) to the string "I'm raising funds to help cure XYZ disease. If you don't donate, then you're part of the problem," let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Comprehend the Argument
First, we need to understand the argument within the statement:
- **Proposition (P)**: Raising funds to help cure XYZ disease.
- **Reason (R)**: If you don't donate.
- **Proof of Reason (PR)**: Then you're part of the problem.

### Step 2: Identify the Key Elements of the Argument
Identify the logical components:
- The argument implicitly suggests that not donating equates to being part of the problem.
- Therefore, donating is positioned as the solution to not being part of the problem.

### Step 3: Analyze Logical Fallacies
Next, analyze potential logical fallacies based on common types described in the definitions:
- **Generalization (G)**: Making a broad statement based on limited evidence.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Presenting only two options when more exist.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Having a reason that doesn't conclusively support the proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Circular reasoning where the proof just rephrases the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Weak causal link between reason and proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assuming a proposition is true on the basis of widespread belief.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Using language that can be interpreted in multiple ways.

### Step 4: Match the Argument to a Fallacy Type
Evaluate the argument against the definitions:

- **FE (Incomplete Enumeration)** fits because the argument presents a false dichotomy: either you donate and support the cure, or you donâ€™t donate and are part of the problem. This ignores other possibilities, such as supporting the cause in different ways, being unable to donate for legitimate reasons, or having support strategies not involving monetary contribution.

### Step 5: Classify the Statement
Conclusively classify the statement as an instance of **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**.

### Final Classification
The string "I'm raising funds to help cure XYZ disease. If you don't donate, then you're part of the problem." falls under **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**. 

This completes the decomposition and classification process according to IDAA.
