For 
To classify the argument in the statement "If I raise you, I must raise everyone, and then the company goes bankrupt," we will follow the steps laid out in the decomposition of the advanced task:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The statement is suggesting that raising someone's position or salary will lead to raising everyone else's, which will ultimately cause the company to go bankrupt.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reasoning here is that raising one person's position or salary implies that everyone else's must also be raised.

3. **Evaluate the Causal Basis of the Reason (<PR>):**
   - The argument is implying a consequence (bankruptcy) that follows from a sequence of actions starting from raising one person's position or salary to raising everyone's, thereby leading to bankruptcy.

4. **Check for Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** This doesn't apply here as there is no over-generalizing.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This doesn't fit since it's not considering only a limited set of possibilities among various options.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason presented (raising one person implies raising everyone) does not conclusively establish that the company must face bankruptcy. Other intermediate steps or conditions are not substantively demonstrated.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The statement doesn't seem to repeat the same point in circular reasoning.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The connection between raising one person and necessarily having to raise everybody resulting in bankruptcy is weak and not compelling.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** It doesn't appeal to what everyone thinks or believes.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The statement does not contain ambiguous language with double meanings.

5. **Classify the Argument:**
   - The best fit for the argument appears to be **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** since the reason given for the proposition does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. The statement jumps from raising one person's position/salary to the company going bankrupt without sufficient evidence or logical steps to substantiate this claim.

**Conclusion:**
The statement "If I raise you, I must raise everyone, and then the company goes bankrupt." falls under the defective argument type **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**.
