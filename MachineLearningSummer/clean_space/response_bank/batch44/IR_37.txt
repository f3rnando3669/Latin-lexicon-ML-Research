For 
To classify the argument "Did John ever give up his bad habits?" using the method IDAA (which involves decomposing the task of classifying the argument into specific steps), we can follow these steps systematically:

### Step 1: Identify the Argument's Category
1. **Read the argument carefully:**
   - Argument: "Did John ever give up his bad habits?"

### Step 2: Recognize the Possible Defective Argument Types
2. **Consider each defective argument type:**
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: Does the argument assert that a general property applies to all based on a sample? 
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Does the argument falsely claim completeness by missing pertinent possibilities?
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Does the reasoning fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Is the reason merely a restatement of the proposition?
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Is the causal basis provided weak or unconvincing for the proposition?
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Does it assume something is true by claiming universal agreement without resolution?
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Does it involve ambiguity or double meanings?

### Step 3: Analyze the Argument
3. **Analyze the given argument in the context of these types:**
   - The phrase "Did John ever give up his bad habits?" suggests an implicit assumption rather than a direct statement.
   - This can be considered an example of a loaded question or a **complex question** fallacy, which often assumes a premise implicitly. Such questions are typically used to trick the respondent into confirming an unwanted premise.

### Step 4: Match with Defective Argument Types
4. **Determine which defective argument type matches best:**
   - While "loaded question" isn't explicitly listed in the predefined types, it fits well under the broader category of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
   - This is because it assumes a premise that is not conclusively proven and is insinuated within the question.

### Step 5: Conclude and Classify
5. **Classify the argument based on the analysis:**
   - Given the implicit assumption and lack of clear resolution in the reasoning, the argument fits best with **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**.

### Final Classification:
- **Type**: Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)

By following these steps, we decomposed the task (D) of classifying the argument (IDA) to determine that "Did John ever give up his bad habits?" fits the defective argument type of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
