For 
To apply <IDAA> (decomposition of <IDA>), we will break down the task of classifying the string "The Royals are promoting their team for the next season by telling people to come join the team because everyone else has." into specific steps:

### Step 1: Understanding the Argument
First, let's break down the argument within the string:
- The claim is that people should come join the Royals team for the next season.
- The reason given is that everyone else has already joined.

### Step 2: Identifying the Defective Argument Types
Next, we'll examine the definitions provided to identify which potentially defective argument types match this reasoning:

1. **<G> Generalization** - involves making broad conclusions based on limited examples.
2. **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration** - claims to have considered all possibilities but misses significant ones.
3. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason** - the reason provided does not conclusively establish the correctness of the proposition.
4. **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition** - restates the proposition without providing new evidence.
5. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis** - cites a causal relationship that is not compelling.
6. **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus** - assumes something is certain because it is claimed that "everyone agrees."
7. **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use** - uses language that can be interpreted in more than one way.

### Step 3: Analyzing the Argument
Now, analyze which of the defective argument types align most closely with the argument presented:
- This argument suggests that because "everyone else has" joined, you should too.
- It does not provide a substantial reason why joining the team is beneficial beyond the appeal to what others have done.

### Step 4: Matching with Definition
From the analyzed argument, identify that:
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus** matches closely because it appeals to the idea that since many or everyone is doing it, it must be the right action.

### Step 5: Conclusion
Finally, conclude the classification:

"The Royals are promoting their team for the next season by telling people to come join the team because everyone else has." is an example of <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).

### Verification
Verify by comparing with the definition:
- **<FU>** involves assuming something is true or right because it is universally agreed upon or popular.
- This matches perfectly with the argument that one should join the Royals team because everyone else has, relying on presumed consensus for validation.

**Conclusively**, the classification is <FU>.
