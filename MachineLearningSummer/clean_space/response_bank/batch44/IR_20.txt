For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "We haven’t proven aliens didn’t create life on earth, so aliens created life on earth," we need to decompose the task <IDA> (classifying the string) into specific steps. Here’s the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Identify the Claim (Proposition)
Examine the statement to identify the main claim or proposition being made.
- **Main Claim**: "Aliens created life on earth."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason
Determine what reason is given to support this claim.
- **Reason**: "We haven’t proven aliens didn’t create life on earth."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Type of Reasoning
Analyze the reasoning to identify any logical fallacies or defects.
- The reason given does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. Instead, it shifts the burden of proof, suggesting that the claim is true because it hasn't been disproven.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument
Match the identified reasoning flaw to one of the recognized types of defective arguments.
- The reasoning suggests that because something hasn’t been disproven, it must be true, which is a classic example of **Inconclusive Reason** (IR).

### Step 5: Provide Justification
Explain why the identified type of defective argument fits the given statement.
- In this case, the argument assumes that the lack of disproof is sufficient proof of the claim—an argument from ignorance. This does not provide a valid causal basis for the claim that aliens created life on earth.

### Conclusion
Classify the given string as the defective argument type identified.

### Final Classification
The statement "We haven’t proven aliens didn’t create life on earth, so aliens created life on earth" is an example of:

→ **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**
