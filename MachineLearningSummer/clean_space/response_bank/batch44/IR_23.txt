For 
To apply \(<IDAA>\) to classify the argument as of type \(<G>\), \(<FE>\), \(<IR>\), \(<RR>\), \(<WCB>\), \(<FU>\), or \(<DEP>\), we need to decompose the task into specific steps and then follow them in sequence. Here is the detailed decomposition and analysis:

### Decomposition (\(D\)) of \(<IDA>\):

1. **Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\(P\))**
   - **Determine the main assertion or topic in the string.**

2. **Step 2: Identify the Reason (\(R\))**
   - **Determine the supporting premise or causal basis for \(P\).**

3. **Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (\(PR\))**
   - **Determine if there is additional corroboration for \(R\).**

4. **Step 4: Analyze for Defective Argument Types**
   - **Examine if the argument fits the definition of \(<G>\), \(<FE>\), \(<IR>\), \(<RR>\), \(<WCB>\), \(<FU>\), or \(<DEP>\).**
     - **Generalization (\(G\))**: A proposition applied over a broad group without sufficient evidence.
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (\(FE\))**: Oversimplifies argument by presenting only two choices when there are more.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (\(IR\))**: Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(RR\))**: Reason is merely a restatement of the proposition without further proof.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(WCB\))**: Causal connection between \(P\) and \(R\) is not compelling.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (\(FU\))**: Assumes something is true due to universal agreement without proof.
     - **Ambiguous Language Use (\(DEP\))**: Uses ambiguous language that could be interpreted in different ways.

### Application to the Given String:

**Given string**: 
"Speaker 1: I think it’s terrible that a game hunter killed Cecil the lion.
Speaker 2: What about all the babies that are killed every day by abortion?"

1. **Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\(P\))**
   - **\(P_1\)**: "It’s terrible that a game hunter killed Cecil the lion."
   - **\(P_2\)**: "What about all the babies that are killed every day by abortion?"
   
2. **Step 2: Identify the Reason (\(R\))**
   - **For \(P_1\)**: No explicit reasoning provided – it’s an expression of opinion.
   - **For \(P_2\)**: Introduced to contrast or divert attention, not a direct response to \(P_1\).

3. **Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (\(PR\))**
   - Not applicable as there is no corroboration. The second statement does not provide a proof for either \(P_1\) or \(P_2\).

4. **Step 4: Analyze for Defective Argument Types**
   - **Generalization (\(G\))**: Not applicable here – no broad assertions made.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (\(FE\))**: Not typical of this case, as it’s not strictly reducing possibilities into two.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (\(IR\))**: Potential candidate since the second speaker diverts the topic rather than conclusively addressing the first proposition.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(RR\))**: Not applicable.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(WCB\))**: Potential candidate if argued that \(P_1\) and \(P_2\) are causally linked inappropriately.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (\(FU\))**: Not applicable since there’s no presumption of consensus.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (\(DEP\))**: Not applicable, as it doesn’t rely on ambiguous meanings.

Based on the analysis, the argument made in response to the initial statement seems to fall under the category of **Inconclusive Reason (\(IR\))**, because Speaker 2 diverts the conversation instead of addressing the merits of Speaker 1's concern about the killing of Cecil the lion. The argument doesn’t conclusively address the initial proposition but shifts focus to another issue, namely abortion, without providing a relevant or conclusive reason for the original topic discussed.
