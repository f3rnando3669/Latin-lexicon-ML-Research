For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to the given statement "“Honesty is defined as always being honest.”" let's break down the task \( \text{IDA} \) into its specific steps as per \( \text{D} \).

### Step-by-Step Decomposition \(\text{D}\):

1. **Identify the structure of the statement**: Parse the statement to understand its proposition and reasoning.
2. **Determine the type of logical form**: Analyze the logical form to check for common patterns relevant to defective arguments.
3. **Classify the statement**: Assign the statement to one of the predefined defective argument types (\(<G>\), \(<FE>\), \(<IR>\), \(<RR>\), \(<WCB>\), \(<FU>\), \(<DEP>\)).

### Application of the steps to the statement:

#### 1. Identify the structure of the statement:
   - **Proposition (\( P \))**: "Honesty is defined as"
   - **Reason (\( R \))**: "always being honest"

#### 2. Determine the type of logical form:
   - Examine if \( P \) and \( R \) merely repeat each other without providing any substantive argumentation or a new premise.

#### 3. Classify the statement:
   - "Honesty is defined as always being honest." does not introduce any new, independent reason to support the definition of honesty. Instead, it circularly defines honesty using the term itself.

Considering the predefined classes:
   - The statement fits the pattern of \( \text{RR} \) (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), where the reasoning essentially repeats the proposition without adding new informative content.

### Conclusion:
   - The statement "Honesty is defined as always being honest." is of type \( \text{RR} \).

So, the IDAA applied to the statement "“Honesty is defined as always being honest.”" provides the classification as type \( \text{RR} \) (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
