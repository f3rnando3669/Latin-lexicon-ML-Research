Sure, let's apply the decomposition (D) of the task of classifying the string \( <s> \) into \( <IDA> \) step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the string \( <s> \)

**String (s):**
"Marty: Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985.
Doc: I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!"

### Step 2: Identify the context and the nature of the interaction
- Marty claims to be from the future and needs help to get back to the year 1985.
- Doc dismisses Marty's claim by implying it is a practical joke.

### Step 3: Breakdown the components of the argument or interaction
- **Marty's Statements:**
  1. I'm from the future.
  2. I came here in a time machine that you invented.
  3. I need your help to get back to the year 1985.

- **Doc's Response:**
  1. I've had enough practical jokes for one evening.
  2. Good night, future boy!

### Step 4: Determine if any defective argument types are present
- To classify the interaction using our defined defective argument types:

### Step 5: Compare with definitions of defective argument types
- **Generalization \( <G> \)**: There are no broad assertions about groups or individuals.
- **Incomplete Enumeration \( <FE> \)**: This does not involve providing only two options or similar restrictive choices.
- **Inconclusive Reason \( <IR> \)**: Doc dismisses Marty's claim based on his perception of it being a practical joke, rather than engaging with the content of Marty's claims.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition \( <RR> \)**: Arguments are distinct, not repetitive.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis \( <WCB> \)**: There is no causality inferred improperly.
- **Presumptuous Consensus \( <FU> \)**: No reliance on group consensus.
- **Ambiguous Language Use \( <DEP> \)**: There is no evident linguistic ambiguity that changes the meaning.

### Step 6: Classify interaction
- The classification is mostly focused on **Doc's Rebuttal** since it is the part of the interaction disputing the claim.
- **Doc's dismissal (Inconclusive Reason \( <IR> \))** assumes Marty's assertions are not legitimate simply because he interprets it as a joke without providing any substantial rebuttal to Marty's statements.

**Classification \( <IR> \):** Doc's argument does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of dismissing Marty's statement as a future traveler simply by labeling it a joke.

Thus, applying \( <IDAA> \) to the given string:

**Doc's Response is of Type \( <IR> \), Inconclusive Reason.**
