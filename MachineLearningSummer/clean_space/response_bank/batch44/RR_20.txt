For 
To classify the string "The Cardinals are the best football team because they're better than all the other teams. They're better than all the other teams because they're the best." as one of the types of defective arguments (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>), we will decompose this task into specific steps and then apply it step by step.

### Decomposition Steps for <IDAA>:

1. **Identify the argument structure**: Break down the string into its propositions and reasons to clearly observe the argument being made.
2. **Determine the relationship between propositions and reasons**: Analyze how the propositions and reasons support each other and check for circular reasoning, insufficient evidence, generalizations, incomplete enumeration, inconclusive reasons, presumptive consensus, or ambiguous language.
3. **Cross-reference with defective argument types**: Compare the analyzed argument structure with the definitions of defective arguments to find a match.
4. **Classify the argument**: Assign one of the given defective argument types based on the strongest match from the cross-referencing step.

### Applying <IDAA> to the String:

1. **Identify the argument structure**:
   - Proposition (P): "The Cardinals are the best football team."
   - Reason (R1): "because they're better than all the other teams."
   - Reason (R2): "They're better than all the other teams because they're the best."

2. **Determine the relationship between propositions and reasons**:
   - The argument asserts that "The Cardinals are the best" because they are "better than all other teams."
   - The reason "They're better than all the other teams" is supported by the claim that "they're the best," which circles back to the initial proposition.

3. **Cross-reference with defective argument types**:
   - **<G> Generalization**: This argument does not attempt to generalize based on limited evidence.
   - **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: This argument does not claim to offer a complete list of possibilities.
   - **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: This argument doesn't provide a reason that fails to conclusively prove the proposition.
   - **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: The reason is essentially repeating the proposition in different words, confirming the initial assertion by reiterating it.
   - **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: This argument doesn't necessarily claim causation but is providing insufficient justification.
   - **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: This argument does not appeal to the opinion of a consensus for validation.
   - **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: This argument doesn't use ambiguous language.

4. **Classify the argument**:
   - The strongest match is **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**, as the reasons provided simply restate the proposition without offering additional supporting evidence.

### Conclusion:

The string "The Cardinals are the best football team because they're better than all the other teams. They're better than all the other teams because they're the best." is classified as a defective argument of type **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**.
