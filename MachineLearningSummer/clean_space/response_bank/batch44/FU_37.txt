For 
Let's apply the task of classifying the string "Everyone is wearing the new skinny jeans from American Eagle. Are you?" step by step. Here’s the decomposition and step-by-step approach:

1. **Step 1: Identify the Argument Structure**
   - The string consists of a statement followed by a rhetorical question.
   - The statement ("Everyone is wearing the new skinny jeans from American Eagle.") implies that the majority is doing something.
   - The rhetorical question ("Are you?") appeals to the reader’s desire to conform to the trend.

2. **Step 2: Determine the Appeal/Defective Argument Type**
   - This proposition appears to be appealing to the reader’s desire to conform based on what others are doing.
   - It suggests that the actions of "everyone" justify or validate the action for the reader.

3. **Step 3: Match with Defective Argument Definitions**
   - <G> (Generalization): This is about making a broad conclusion based on a subset of instances.
   - <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration): Ignores other possibilities and suggests a limited set of choices.
   - <IR> (Inconclusive Reason): Provides a reason that does not conclusively support the proposition.
   - <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition): Repeats the proposition without providing new evidence.
   - <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis): Suggests a weak causal reason for the proposition.
   - <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus): Assumes something should be done because everyone else is doing it.
   - <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use): Uses ambiguous language that can be misinterpreted.

4. **Step 4: Classify the String**
   - The string "Everyone is wearing the new skinny jeans from American Eagle. Are you?" implies that because everyone is doing it, you should too.
   - This aligns with <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus), which is based on the assumption that something must be correct or good because many people are doing it.

**Conclusion:**
- The string is of type <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus) as it relies on the idea that because "everyone" is wearing the new skinny jeans, so should the reader.
