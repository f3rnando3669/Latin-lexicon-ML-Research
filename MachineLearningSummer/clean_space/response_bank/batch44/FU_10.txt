For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given statement "If you are a true American, you will ask your congressman to vote against NAFTA," we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Task (IDA):** 
   - IDA is the task of classifying a given string(s) as of type <G> (Generalization), <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration), <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis), <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus), or <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use).

2. **Break Down the Task (D):**
   - Decomposition involves these specific steps:
     a. Identify the main proposition (P) in the string.
     b. Identify the reason (R) or the argument meant to support the proposition.
     c. Determine the category of defectiveness the argument falls under by matching it with the predefined types.

3. **Application to Given String (IDAA):**
   - Apply the decomposition (D) to the string (s) to realize IDA.

Let's apply these steps to the string "If you are a true American, you will ask your congressman to vote against NAFTA."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

#### Step 1: Identify the Main Proposition (P)
The main proposition in the statement can be articulated as: 
- "You will ask your congressman to vote against NAFTA."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason given to support the proposition is:
- "If you are a true American."

#### Step 3: Determine the Category (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>)

- **Generalization (G):** This does not apply as the statement is not about generalizing a trait to all individuals.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This does not apply as the statement does not claim an exhaustive list.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This suggests that the reasoning presented does not conclusively support the proposition. 
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This does not apply as there's no circular reasoning or mere repetition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This does not apply as we are not dealing with a causal relationship here.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This suggests that something is true because it is assumed to be believed by a majority or an appeal to a group sentiment.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** This would apply if the language is vague or ambiguous.

On analyzing the given statement, it uses a form of **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** because it assumes that if one is a "true American," then they inherently would oppose NAFTA, playing on national identity and assumed widespread agreement.

### Conclusion:
The string "If you are a true American, you will ask your congressman to vote against NAFTA" can be classified as **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**.
