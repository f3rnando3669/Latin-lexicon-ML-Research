For 
To apply <IDAA> to "If you give a mouse a cookie, he'll want a glass of milk to go with it" is a book built around THIS fallacy, let's break down the classification task step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Decomposition (Definition of <D>)
Decomposition into specific steps for identifying argument types involves:
1. **Identifying the Argument Structure**: Determine the core <P>, <R>, and <PR> components if present.
2. **Mapping to Defective Argument Type**: Check the argument against known definitions of defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step 2: Identify the Argument Structure
The statement “If you give a mouse a cookie, he'll want a glass of milk to go with it” implies a sequence of events stemming from an initial action:
- **Proposition (<P>)**: If you give a mouse a cookie,
- **Reason (<R>)**: he'll want a glass of milk to go with it,
- **Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: (Implied subsequent steps lead to further wants or actions).

### Step 3: Classify Based on Defective Arguments
Now, let's see if it fits any defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>).

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Applies a general rule from limited cases.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Misses out on possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Reason does not conclusively support proposition.
4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Restates proposition as reason.
5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Weak or irrelevant causal link.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Assumes consensus equates to truth.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Uses unclear or double-meaning language.

The statement closely resembles a **slippery slope argument** where one action leads to a domino effect of subsequent actions, usually presented without strong evidence linking these events directly.

### Conclusion
The most fitting type from our list for this scenario:
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** doesn't fit, as there are no claimed exhaustive possibilities missed.
- **Generalization (<G>) doesn't fully cover the chain of events notion.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>) isn't evident here.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>) seems the most plausible** as the reasoning that giving a cookie will inevitably lead to wanting a glass of milk isn't solidly proven by the initial proposition.

Hence, the appropriate classification for this book's fallacy should be **<IR>**:
**"Inconclusive Reason"**, where the sequence of events doesn't conclusively demonstrate that one event must lead to another.

Thus:
```markdown
<IDA>("If you give a mouse a cookie, he'll want a glass of milk to go with it" is a book built around THIS fallacy.") => <IR>
```
