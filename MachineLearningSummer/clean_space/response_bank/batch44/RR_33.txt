For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given task, "You must obey the law, because it's illegal to break the law. What logical fallacy is used in the statement above?", we need to decompose the task into specific steps to identify the type of logical fallacy. Let's follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Proposition (P)**:
   - Proposition: "You must obey the law."
   - Reason: "because it's illegal to break the law."

2. **Analyze the Reason (R)**:
   - The reason provided essentially restates the proposition. It does not provide additional justification or evidence beyond reiterating the necessity to obey the law.

3. **Check for Logical Fallacy Types**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: This fallacy involves making broad statements that are not necessarily supported by evidence. This does not seem to apply here.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This fallacy misses out on pertinent possibilities. This does not seem to apply here.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. It might apply, but there seems to be a more specific match.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason is weak when it appears to be presented as the reason but says precisely the same as the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The reason given does not provide a compelling causal basis. This does not seem to apply here.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The reason is assumed as certain based on presumed universal agreement, which does not apply here.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The proposition or reason can be taken in another sense than intended. This does not seem to apply here.

4. **Match Analysis with Fallacy Type**:
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** fits best because the reason given ("it's illegal to break the law") merely restates the proposition ("You must obey the law"). The argument goes around in a circle without providing new information.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The logical fallacy used in the statement "You must obey the law, because it's illegal to break the law." is **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**.

By following these steps, we have decomposed the advanced task and identified the logical fallacy used in the statement effectively.
