For 
To apply IDAA, we need to first decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps and then follow those steps to classify the given string as one of the defective argument types.

### Step-by-step Decomposition (D)
1. **Identify the structure of the argument:**
   - Determine the proposition (\<P\>).
   - Determine the reason (\<R\>).

2. **Evaluate the reasoning:**
   - Assess if the reason (\<R\>) provided effectively supports the proposition (\<P\>).

3. **Check for common fallacies:**
   - Compare the argument structure to known types of defective arguments:
     - Generalization (\<G\>)
     - Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)
     - Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)
     - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)
     - Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)
     - Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)
     - Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)

4. **Classify the argument:**
   - Based on the analysis, classify the argument into one of the defective argument types.

### Applying IDAA to the Given String

#### 1. Identify the structure of the argument:
- **Proposition (\<P\>):** Jones is responsible for the rise in crime.
- **Reason (\<R\>):** President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up.

#### 2. Evaluate the reasoning:
- The argument suggests a direct causal relationship between raising taxes and the increase in violent crime, implying that the action of raising taxes directly caused the rise in violent crime.

#### 3. Check for common fallacies:
- Compare the argument to the known defective arguments:
  
  - **Generalization (\<G\>):** The argument does not generalize a trait to all members of a group.
  - **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>):** The argument does not reduce possibilities to only two or a few.
  - **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>):** The reasoning provided does not conclusively establish the truth of the proposition.
  - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>):** The argument does not merely restate the proposition as the reason.
  - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>):** The reason provided (increase in taxes) lacks a compelling causal basis to the proposition (increase in violent crime). It suggests causation without substantial evidence connecting the two events.
  - **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>):** The argument does not claim truth based on universal agreement.
  - **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>):** The argument does not rely on ambiguous terms or double meanings.

#### 4. Classify the argument:
- Given that the reason (\<R\>) does not compellingly support the proposition (\<P\>), and it suggests a cause-effect relationship without substantial causal basis, the argument best fits the Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>) category.

### Conclusion
The argument "President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up. Jones is responsible for the rise in crime." is classified as an Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>) defective argument.
