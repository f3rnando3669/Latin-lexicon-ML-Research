For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as one of the specified types of defective arguments) to the statement "“You can’t give me a C. I’m an A student!”", we will break down the process into specific steps as follows:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Recognize the main assertion being made. In this case, the main assertion is "I’m an A student".
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the reason given to support the proposition. Here, the reason given is "You can’t give me a C".

3. **Analyze the relationship between <P> and <R>**:
    - Determine whether the reason (<R>) logically supports the proposition (<P>).
    - Check for any logical or structural flaws in the argument.

4. **Classify the argument based on recognized patterns** of defective arguments (Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Insufficient Causal Basis, Presumptuous Consensus, Ambiguous Language Use).

### Applying the Steps

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Proposition (<P>): "I’m an A student."
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Reason (<R>): "You can’t give me a C."
   
3. **Analyze the relationship between <P> and <R>**:
   - The reason given ("You can't give me a C") doesn't provide any substantive proof or evidence. It merely asserts the proposition ("I’m an A student").
   - The argument appears to be flawed because the reason offered is essentially a reiteration or an insistence on the proposition without providing any external evidence or logical support.

4. **Classify the argument**:
   - This appears to be a case of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**, as the reason given does not add any new information or external logic but simply restates the proposition in a different form or with insistence.

### Conclusion

The statement “You can’t give me a C. I’m an A student!” is an example of a **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**. This conclusion is reached because the argument's reason (you can't give me a C) does not provide substantive evidence beyond the initial assertion (I’m an A student), effectively restating the proposition as its own proof.
