For 
To apply **IDAA** to the string "Eat lamb--could thousands of coyotes be wrong?", we proceed through specific steps to classify the argument type according to the categories <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition <D>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - **Proposition**: "Eat lamb."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - **Reason**: "Could thousands of coyotes be wrong?"

3. **Analyze the Reason in Context of the Proposition**:
   - What is the reason implying? It implies that because many coyotes might eat lamb, it is a valid reason for humans to eat lamb.

4. **Classify the Argument Type**:
   - Evaluate if the reason provided is based on consensus or popularity rather than a logical or evidential basis.

### Classification:
The argument "Could thousands of coyotes be wrong?" suggests that because many coyotes might eat lamb, it must be suitable for humans to eat lamb too. This reasoning leans heavily on the assumption that if many are doing it, it must be correct, aligning with the concept of popularity or consensus.

This fits the definition of **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**, where the proposition is assumed valid because it is believed by many (in this case, thousands of coyotes).

### Conclusion:
The string "Eat lamb--could thousands of coyotes be wrong?" is classified as **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**.
