### Decomposition of Task (D)

**Step 1:** Understand the argument being presented in the string \( s \).

**Step 2:** Identify the components of the argument: Proposition (\( P \)), Reason (\( R \)), and Proof of Reason (\( PR \)).

**Step 3:** Determine if the argument is clearly defective. This includes checking if the argument fits into any of the predefined defective argument types.

**Step 4:** Classify the defective argument according to the types: Generalization (\( G \)), Incomplete Enumeration (\( FE \)), Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \)), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( RR \)), Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \)), Presumptuous Consensus (\( FU \)), or Ambiguous Language Use (\( DEP \)).

### Application of Steps (IDAA)

**Step 1:** Understand the argument being presented in the string \( s \).

- The argument is: "No one has ever been able to prove that extraterrestrials exist, so they must not be real."

**Step 2:** Identify the components of the argument: Proposition (\( P \)), Reason (\( R \)), and Proof of Reason (\( PR \)).

- **Proposition (\( P \)):** Extraterrestrials must not be real.
- **Reason (\( R \)):** No one has ever been able to prove that extraterrestrials exist.

**Step 3:** Determine if the argument is clearly defective.

- We need to see if the reasoning provided (\( R \)) genuinely substantiates the proposition (\( P \)). 

**Step 4:** Classify the defective argument according to the types.

- This argument relies on the assumption that lack of proof of existence equates to non-existence, without addressing the possibility of extraterrestrials existing but not yet having been proven to exist.

Upon examination, the reasoning provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. It suggests that because no one has proven extraterrestrials exist, they must not exist, which is jumping to a conclusion not supported by the reason itself.

This aligns with the definition of **Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \))**, where the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.

### Conclusion

- The argument "No one has ever been able to prove that extraterrestrials exist, so they must not be real." is classified as **Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \))**.
