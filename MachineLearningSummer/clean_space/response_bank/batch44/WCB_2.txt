For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "Bush was 'determined to knock down Saddam Hussein' because of his 'nuclear bomb potential,'":

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - The proposition is "Bush was determined to knock down Saddam Hussein."
   
2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - The reason provided is "because of his nuclear bomb potential."

3. **Evaluate the Reason (R):**
   - Assess whether the given reason (nuclear bomb potential) is sufficiently compelling to justify the proposition (Bush’s determination to remove Saddam Hussein).
   
4. **Classify the Argument:**
   - Determine if the argument falls into one of the specified defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

Let's evaluate the steps and apply the classifications:

- **Step 1 and 2 are straightforward:**
  - Proposition: "Bush was determined to knock down Saddam Hussein."
  - Reason: "because of his nuclear bomb potential."

- **Step 3 - Evaluate Reason (R):**
  - The causal basis submitted here ("nuclear bomb potential") needs to be checked if it is compelling. Is it factually supported and logically sufficient?

- **Step 4 - Classification:**
  - The provided reason seems to use a presumptive and inadequate causal link, i.e., stating that Saddam Hussein’s “nuclear bomb potential” was conclusively the reason for Bush’s determination.
  
  The string implies a cause-effect relationship that may not be factually or logically substantiated. Based on this evaluation:

**Classification:** The argument likely falls under <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis), as it presents a weak causal connection without compelling support.

Therefore, the advanced task classification shows that this argument type for the given string is:

- **Defective Argument Type:** <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)
