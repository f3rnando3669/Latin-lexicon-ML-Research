For 
To apply <IDAA> to the argument in question, we'll break down <IDA> into specific steps.

**Steps for Decomposing the Task of Classifying the String:**

1. **Identify the Argument Structure**: Break down the argument into its components: the propositions (claims) and reasonings involved.
   
2. **Compare the Components with Known Defective Argument Types**: Match each component of the argument with the definitions provided for <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

3. **Determine the Applicable Defective Argument Type**: Based on the comparison, decide which defective argument type applies.

Now let's apply these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Argument Structure
- **Proposition (P)**: A Scotsman would never put sugar on his porridge.
- **Reason (R)**: Being a true Scotsman implies not putting sugar on porridge.
- **Counter-Example**: Dougal, who is a Scotsman, does put sugar on his porridge.
- **Modified Proposition (P')**: No true Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge.
- **Reason for Modification (R')**: Redefining what a true Scotsman means to exclude counter-examples.

### Step 2: Compare the Components with Known Defective Argument Types
- **Generalization (G)**: This argument does have an element of generalizing all Scotsmen's behavior. However, the crucial part is the redefining rather than generalizing.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This does not apply since the argument doesn't claim all possibilities have been considered. It changes definitions instead of missing out possibilities.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided ('true Scotsman') is arbitrary and mostly a redefinition rather than an inconclusive reason.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The argument is not simply repeating itself but rather changing definitions or terms.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The focus is not on causation here.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This isn't about claiming consensus.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The key element here isn't about word ambiguity; it's more about redefining to exclude counter-examples.

### Step 3: Determine the Applicable Defective Argument Type
After comparing the components with the defective argument types:

The argument matches best with the "No True Scotsman Fallacy," which occurs when someone shifts the definition of a category (here, 'true Scotsman') to exclude counter-examples in order to maintain a specific proposition. This aligns most closely with **Defective Argument Type: <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** since the reason for excluding Dougal from being a true Scotsman is arbitrary and primarily a redefinition.

Therefore, the classification of the string:

### Result
<s> should be classified as **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**.
