For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "Each brick in that building weighs less than a pound.  Therefore, the building weighs less than a pound.Example #2: Hydrogen is not wet.  Oxygen is not wet.  Therefore, water (H2O) is not wet.", let's decompose <IDA> step-by-step according to the definition <IDAA>.

### Decomposition of <IDA> (<D>)
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Determine what the statement is claiming.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Find the causal basis that supposedly establishes the truth of the Proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Look for additional arguments or pieces of evidence that support the Reason.
4. **Classification of the Argument Type:** Classify the relationship between <P>, <R>, and <PR> to identify the type of argument (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Application of <D> to <IDA> (specifically to the string provided)

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
**Example 1:**
- **Proposition:** The building weighs less than a pound.
- **Example 2:**
- **Proposition:** Water (H2O) is not wet.

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
**Example 1:**
- **Reason:** Each brick in that building weighs less than a pound.
- **Example 2:**
- **Reason:** Hydrogen is not wet and Oxygen is not wet.

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
**Example 1:**
- **Proof of Reason:** There is no explicit additional argument given, but it is implied that the weight of each brick being less than a pound collectively makes up the weight of the building.
- **Example 2:**
- **Proof of Reason:** Same logic as example 1; the wetness of hydrogen and oxygen individually implies that the resulting compound (water) would also not be wet.

#### Step 4: Classification of the Argument Type
Based on the identified parts:
- Both examples exhibit the same logical flaw.
- **Example 1:** The error lies in assuming that the collective weight of bricks will be the same as the weight of the individual brick.
- **Example 2:** The error lies in assuming that properties of individual elements (hydrogen and oxygen are gases and not wet) will remain the same in their compound form (water being not wet).

Therefore, both examples provide an argument reasoning type where the properties of parts are assumed to be the same for the whole. This aligns with the concept of:
- **Defective Argument Type:** **Incomplete Enumeration or Composition Fallacy** where properties of parts do not necessarily apply to the whole.

### Classification
- **Argument Type:** Incomplete Enumeration (FE) or Composition Fallacy (not a direct classification listed but closely related to FE)

### Application of Classification
**For the string provided:**
The given argument string "Each brick in that building weighs less than a pound. Therefore, the building weighs less than a pound. Example #2: Hydrogen is not wet. Oxygen is not wet. Therefore, water (H2O) is not wet." is classified as:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: because it incorrectly assumes properties of individual parts apply directly to the whole.

The logic involves defective reasoning based on generalizing or incorrectly considering the enumeration of individual partsâ€™ attributes to define the attribute of the whole.

Thus, the given string can be identified as <FE> type under the task <IDA>.
