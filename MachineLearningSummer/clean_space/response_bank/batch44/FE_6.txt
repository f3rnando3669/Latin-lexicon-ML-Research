Sure, let's apply the decomposition of the task of classifying the type of argument to the provided string step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the main claim of the argument
**Main claim**: The speaker or writer makes a veiled threat by reducing a complex issue to two options: "either you see it my way or this bad thing will happen."

### Step 2: Determine if the provided string falls into any known categories of defective arguments
Review the provided categories:
- **<G> Generalization**
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**

### Step 3: Analyze the argument in the string against each category
1. **<G> Generalization**:
    - The argument does not stereotype or make broad statements based on insufficient evidence.

2. **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**:
    - The argument presents a situation as having only two outcomes when in reality there might be more. This seems relevant but we need to look further into the threat aspect.

3. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**:
    - The argument does not suffer from the problem of using reasons that do not fully prove the proposition.

4. **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**:
    - The argument does not involve repeating the same point without proving it.

5. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**:
    - The argument is not trying to link two events causally without sufficient basis.

6. **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**:
    - The argument does not rely on claiming that because many believe something, it must be true.

7. **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**:
    - The argument is not using words with ambiguous meanings or pivots.

### Step 4: Identify the best fitting category
The definition of the argument given in the string is about presenting only two choices as if they were the only possible options and threatening a bad consequence if one does not accept the given choice.
- **False Dilemma**: This concept aligns most closely with **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration** where an argument falsely presents a situation as having only two exclusive options, missing out on other pertinent possibilities.

### Step 5: Classify the string
By analyzing the provided types and fitting the argument into the best possible category based on its characteristics, we classify the provided string as:
   
**<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**

This fallacy (also known as "false dilemma") is a type of incomplete enumeration where the complex issue is reduced falsely to just two options.

Thus, the classification of the string **"This fallacy (also known as \"false dilemma\") occurs when a speaker or writer makes a veiled threat by reducing a complex issue to two options: either you see it my way or this bad thing will happen."** is of type **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**.
