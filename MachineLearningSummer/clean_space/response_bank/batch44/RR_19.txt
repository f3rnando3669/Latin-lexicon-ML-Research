For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of identifying <s> as a type of defective argument <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>) to the string "<s>: 'Once a year, a miracle causes this large rock to float about ten centimeters off the ground since supernatural powers want us to remember the martyrs who died in that spot'", we will break this down step by step:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - **Task**: We need to identify the main proposition or claim in the given string.
   - **Application**: The main proposition here is: "Once a year, a miracle causes this large rock to float about ten centimeters off the ground."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - **Task**: We need to identify the reason given for the proposition.
   - **Application**: The reason provided is: "supernatural powers want us to remember the martyrs who died in that spot."

3. **Classify the Reason in Terms of Argument Types**:
   - **Task**: We determine whether the reason is appropriate for the proposition and classify the type of defective argument if it is not.
   - **Application**: The reason given attributes a cause to supernatural powers without offering verifiable or logical support for this explanation.

4. **Match the Reason to a Defective Argument Type**:
   - **Task**: Match the reason to one of the predefined defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.
   - **Application**: The reason "supernatural powers want us to remember the martyrs who died in that spot" does not provide a compelling causal basis for the phenomenon of the rock floating. It suggests a cause that is speculative and not empirically supported.

5. **Determine the Best Fit Defective Argument Type**:
   - **Task**: Decide which type best fits the reason given.
   - **Application**: The claim attributes an unexplained phenomenon (rock floating) to supernatural causes without empirical evidence, fitting the characteristics of **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.

### Conclusion

By following the step-by-step decomposition, we've identified the string "<s>: 'Once a year, a miracle causes this large rock to float about ten centimeters off the ground since supernatural powers want us to remember the martyrs who died in that spot'" as an example of <WCB> because the reason provided (supernatural powers) does not offer a compelling causal basis for the phenomenon being claimed.
