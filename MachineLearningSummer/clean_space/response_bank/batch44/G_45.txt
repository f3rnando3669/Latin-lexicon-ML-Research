Alright, let's decompose and classify the statement "Don't let your cousin borrow $10.00. Next, he's going to be borrowing money from you every day." step by step.

1. **Identify the argument being made (Proposition <P>):**
   - The argument being made is "Don't let your cousin borrow $10.00."

2. **Identify the Reasoning <R> given for the argument:**
   - The reasoning provided is "Next, he's going to be borrowing money from you every day."

3. **Evaluate if the Reasoning <R> directly supports the argument (<P>):**
   - The reasoning implies that a single instance of lending money will lead to a continuous pattern of borrowing.

4. **Classify the type of argument based on identified patterns and definitions:**
   - This argument assumes that permitting one action (borrowing $10.00) will inevitably lead to a much more extreme outcome (borrowing money every day).
   
5. **Match with predefined defective argument types:**
   - This type of reasoning aligns with a slippery slope argument.

Given the definitions, a slippery slope argument often falls under defective argument type <G> (Generalization) or <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) if the causal link is not compelling or properly established.

6. **Determine the most appropriate classification based on definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>:**
   - In this case, it aligns most closely with Generalization (defective argument type <G>) since it takes a specific case (borrowing $10.00) and extrapolates it into a general and exaggerated future scenario (borrowing money every day).

So, the fallacy type for "Don't let your cousin borrow $10.00. Next, he's going to be borrowing money from you every day." is <G> for Generalization.
