For 
To apply **IDAA** (the application of the decomposition of **IDA** into specific steps) to the given string, "“Every society is, of course, repressive to some extent – as Sigmund Freud pointed out, repression is the price we pay for civilization," we'll follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Complete Argument
Identify the proposition (\<P\>), reason (\<R\>), and proof of reason (\<PR\>) in the statement to understand its structure.
- **\<P\>:** Every society is repressive to some extent.
- **\<R\>:** Sigmund Freud's theory that repression is the price we pay for civilization.
- **\<PR\>:** The general acceptance of Freud’s theories in psychology and their application to societal behavior.

### Step 2: Check for Defectiveness
Determine whether the reasons provided support the proposition, and check for any logical fallacies that categorize the argument as defective.

Given types of defective arguments:
- **Generalization (\<G\>)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)**
- **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)**

### Step 3: Evaluate the Reasoning
Evaluate if \<R\> and \<PR\> effectively justify \<P\> to find any of the listed defects.

### Application of Steps

1. **Identify the Argument Components:**
   - **\<P (Proposition):** Every society is repressive to some extent.
   - **\<R (Reason):** Sigmund Freud pointed out that repression is the price we pay for civilization.
   - **\<PR (Proof of Reason):** Freud is a well-known figure whose theories are widely respected in psychology.

2. **Assessment of Defectiveness:**
   - The statement by Freud ("repression is the price we pay for civilization") does not conclusively demonstrate why every society is necessarily repressive. This argument relies on Freud’s authority and does not provide direct evidence from specific societies or additional supporting arguments.

3. **Mapping to Defective Arguments:**
   - **Generalization (\<G\>):** It might superficially sound like a hasty generalization but doesn’t quite fit.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>):** Not applicable.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>):** This fits as Freud's statement is cited as the reason without additional evidence directly connecting all societies to repression acceptably.
   - **Faulty Repetition (\<RR\>):** Not applicable.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>):** This could also fit because simply citing Freud's assertion is not compelling causal evidence for the repression of every society.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>):** Not applicable.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>):** Not applicable.

### Conclusion
The primary defect seems to be **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**:
- The argument relies on an authoritative assertion (Freud's theory) without adequate evidence demonstrating that repression across all societies is inherently necessary for civilization.

Therefore, the given string is of type **\<IR\>** (Inconclusive Reason).
