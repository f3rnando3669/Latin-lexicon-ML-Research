To apply IDAA (Decomposition of IDA) to the statement "A car makes less pollution than a bus. Therefore, cars are less of a pollution problem than buses," we will decompose the classification task into specific steps.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
- Identify what is being set forth to prove: 
  - Proposition: "Cars are less of a pollution problem than buses."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
- Determine the causal basis submitted to support <P>:
  - Reason: "A car makes less pollution than a bus."

### Step 3: Classify the Argument
- Compare <P> and <R> to identify the type of argument being made and any fallacies present.
- Analyze whether the causal basis is sufficiently compelling to prove the proposition.
- Determine whether the argument suffers from common logical fallacies such as generalization, incomplete enumeration, inconclusive reason, faulty repetition of proposition, insufficient causal basis, presumptuous consensus or ambiguous language use.

### Step 4: Evaluate the Strength or Defectiveness of the Argument
- Assess whether the reason effectively demonstrates the correctness of the proposition.

### Applying the Steps:

#### Step 1: Proposition
The proposition <P> is: "Cars are less of a pollution problem than buses."

#### Step 2: Reason
The reason <R> is: "A car makes less pollution than a bus."

#### Step 3: Classify the Argument
Now, we'll classify the argument type:
- The argument implies a causal relationship between individual vehicle emissions and the overall pollution problem.
- A key point to consider is whether comparing a single car to a single bus accurately reflects the broader pollution problem involving numerous vehicles.

#### Step 4: Evaluate the Strength or Defectiveness
- Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>: The argument is assuming that because a single car produces less pollution than a single bus, all cars collectively are less of a pollution problem than all buses. However, this doesn't account for the fact that there are more cars on the road than buses, so in aggregate, cars might still contribute significantly to pollution despite being individually less polluting.

Based on the steps and the analysis, the classification of the argument can be determined:

**Classification: <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis.**
The reason provided does not compellingly support the proposition because it simplifies the pollution problem to a comparison between individual vehicles without considering the overall number of each type of vehicle and their cumulative impact on pollution.
