For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "Eric: For my lottery numbers, I chose 6, 14, 22, 35, 38, 40. What did you choose? 
Steve: I chose 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 
Eric: You idiot! Those numbers will never come up!", we need to decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps. These steps are:

1. **Identify the type of argument being made by each character.**
2. **Determine if the argument fits any of the defective argument types defined: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>.**
3. **Classify the argument accordingly.**

Let's go through these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the type of argument being made by each character
- **Eric:** For my lottery numbers, I chose 6, 14, 22, 35, 38, 40. What did you choose?
  - Here, Eric states his choice of lottery numbers.
- **Steve:** I chose 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
  - Steve responds with his choice of sequential numbers for the lottery.
- **Eric:** You idiot! Those numbers will never come up!
  - Eric criticizes Steve's choice and states that they "will never come up."

### Step 2: Determine if the argument fits any of the defective argument types
- Eric's statement implies that choosing a straightforward sequence (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) is less likely to win than a seemingly random set of numbers (6, 14, 22, 35, 38, 40). This assertion is based on the presumption that certain numbers or sequences are less likely to come up when, in reality, all combinations of numbers have an equal probability in a fair lottery draw.

### Step 3: Classify the argument accordingly
- **Type <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** Eric's rejection of Steve's numbers is based on an incorrect assumption of probability. In a fair lottery, all sets of numbers have the same chance of being drawn. Eric's claim that Steve's choice "will never come up" is not grounded in statistical reality.

Therefore, the argument "Eric: For my lottery numbers, I chose 6, 14, 22, 35, 38, 40. What did you choose? Steve: I chose 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Eric: You idiot! Those numbers will never come up!" is an example of an argument of type <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) because Eric's reasoning about the probability of Steve's chosen numbers lacks a compelling, logical basis.
