For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given text, "The report suggests that 'the rise in violent offending and the explosion in the sales of iPods and other portable media devices is more than coincidental,' and asks, rather provocatively, 'Is There an iCrime Wave?' The report notes that nationally, violent crime fell every year from 1993 to 2004, before rising in 2005 and 2006, just as 'America’s streets filled with millions of people visibly wearing, and being distracted by, expensive electronic gear.'", we need to break down the task of classifying the statement into specific steps. 

Here are the steps:

1. **Read and Understand the Statement**: Carefully read through the provided text to get a clear understanding of its content.
2. **Identify Argument Components**: Determine what the Proposition `<P>`, Reason `<R>`, and any Proof of Reason `<PR>` are within the statement.
3. **Identify Possible Defective Arguments**: Check whether the `<P>`, `<R>`, or `<PR>` falls into any of the predefined defective argument categories: Generalization `<G>`, Incomplete Enumeration `<FE>`, Inconclusive Reason `<IR>`, Faulty Repetition of Proposition `<RR>`, Insufficient Causal Basis `<WCB>`, Presumptuous Consensus `<FU>`, or Ambiguous Language Use `<DEP>`.
4. **Assign Classification**: Based on the identification of defective argument type, classify the statement appropriately.

Let's apply these steps:

1. **Read and Understand the Statement**:
   - "The report suggests that 'the rise in violent offending and the explosion in the sales of iPods and other portable media devices is more than coincidental,' and asks, rather provocatively, 'Is There an iCrime Wave?' The report notes that nationally, violent crime fell every year from 1993 to 2004, before rising in 2005 and 2006, just as 'America’s streets filled with millions of people visibly wearing, and being distracted by, expensive electronic gear.'"

2. **Identify Argument Components**:
   - **Proposition `<P>`**: The rise in violent offending is linked to the explosion in sales of iPods and other portable media devices.
   - **Reason `<R>`**: The report notes a temporal correlation between the rise in violent crime and the increased visibility and distraction caused by expensive electronic gear.
   - **Proof of Reason `<PR>`**: The report includes the statistic that violent crime fell consistently from 1993-2004 and then rose in 2005 and 2006, the same time period when the use of portable media devices increased.

3. **Identify Possible Defective Arguments**:
   - The statement implies a causal relationship between the explosion in the sales of iPods and the rise in violent offending without providing direct evidence of causation.
   - The argument is relying on a correlation without adequately establishing a direct causal link.

4. **Assign Classification**:
   - The defective argument type evident in this statement is **Insufficient Causal Basis** `<WCB>`. The leap from correlating the rise of violent crime with the increase in sales of iPods and other portable media devices does not provide a compelling causal basis proving that one causes the other.

---

**Conclusion**: The statement "The report suggests that 'the rise in violent offending and the explosion in the sales of iPods and other portable media devices is more than coincidental,' and asks, rather provocatively, 'Is There an iCrime Wave?' The report notes that nationally, violent crime fell every year from 1993 to 2004, before rising in 2005 and 2006, just as 'America’s streets filled with millions of people visibly wearing, and being distracted by, expensive electronic gear.'" is an example of **Insufficient Causal Basis** `<WCB>`.
