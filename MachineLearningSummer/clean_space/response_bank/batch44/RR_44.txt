For 
Certainly, let's break down the task <IDA> into specific steps and apply it to classify the given fallacy in the statement "Ghosts exist.... because I saw a ghost in my closet."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify Proposition (P)**: Extract the main proposition or claim being asserted.
2. **Identify Reason (R)**: Determine the reason or causal basis provided to establish the truth of the proposition.
3. **Classify the Type of Defective Argument**: Based on the identified proposition and reason, determine the type of logical fallacy.

### Applying Decomposition to IDA:

#### Step 1: Identify Proposition (P)
The main proposition (P) is the assertion that:
- "Ghosts exist."

#### Step 2: Identify Reason (R)
The reason (R) provided to establish the truth of this proposition is:
- "because I saw a ghost in my closet."

#### Step 3: Classify the Type of Defective Argument
We now need to determine the type of logical fallacy based on the relationship between the proposition and the reason.

1. **Generalization (G)**: This involves drawing a broad conclusion based on a small sample. The statement does not fit this because it isn't generalizing from a specific case to a broad conclusion.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This involves presenting a choice as limited when more options are available. The statement does not fit this because it isn't presenting any kind of incomplete enumeration.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This involves providing a reason that isn't adequately conclusive. The reason provided here (seeing a ghost) attempts to conclusively establish the existence of ghosts.
4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This involves repeating the proposition as if it were a reason. The statement does not simply repeat the claim but provides an instance as evidence.
5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This involves providing a weak causal basis for the proposition. The reason provides firsthand experience as evidence.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This involves assuming something is true because it is widely believed. The statement does not invoke consensus.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: This involves using ambiguous terms to mislead. The statement is straightforward in its language.

Given that the reason provided ("I saw a ghost in my closet") is a personal anecdote that's being used as conclusive evidence for the existence of ghosts, the fallacy fits best under **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.

### Conclusion:
The statement "Ghosts exist.... because I saw a ghost in my closet," is an example of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the personal experience presented does not conclusively prove the general existence of ghosts.

Decomposition (D) Applied Successfully - Task IDAA Completed:
- Step 1: Identify Proposition: "Ghosts exist."
- Step 2: Identify Reason: "because I saw a ghost in my closet."
- Step 3: Classify the Type of Defective Argument: Inconclusive Reason (IR).
