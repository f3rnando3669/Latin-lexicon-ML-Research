For 
To decompose the task <IDA> of classifying the given string into the appropriate type of defective argument, we will break it down into specific steps:

1. **Analyze the Argument:** Break down the statements made by Speaker 1 and Speaker 2.
2. **Identify Key Points:** Identify the key points and conclusions made by each speaker.
3. **Identify Fallacious Reasoning:** Look for any logical fallacies in the reasoning.
4. **Match with Definitions:** Compare the identified fallacy with the definitions provided for each type (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).
5. **Classify the Argument:** Based on the identification, classify the string into the appropriate type.

Now, let's apply these steps to the given string:

### Step 1: Analyze the Argument
- **Speaker 1:** "Dr. Singh says meat eating is bad for the environment."
- **Speaker 2:** "He’s a Sikh. They don’t eat meat. Of course he would say that. He can’t be telling the truth."

### Step 2: Identify Key Points
- **Speaker 1's Point:** Dr. Singh made a statement about meat eating being bad for the environment.
- **Speaker 2's Point:** Dismisses Dr. Singh's claim by pointing to his religious dietary restrictions, insinuating bias as the reason for his claim.

### Step 3: Identify Fallacious Reasoning
- **Speaker 2's Reasoning:** The argument dismisses the claim based on Dr. Singh's religion rather than the merits of his argument about the environmental impact of meat eating.

### Step 4: Match with Definitions
- **Definition Match:** The fallacy here is dismissing an argument by attacking the person’s background or characteristics rather than addressing the argument itself. This fits the definition of **Inconclusive Reason** (IR), particularly an ad hominem attack.

### Step 5: Classify the Argument
- **Classification:** The string falls under <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).

### Conclusion
The classification for the string "Speaker 1: Dr. Singh says meat eating is bad for the environment. Speaker 2: He’s a Sikh. They don’t eat meat. Of course he would say that. He can’t be telling the truth." is <IR>.
