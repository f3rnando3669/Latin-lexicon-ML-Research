For 
To apply the task of **<IDAA>** (which involves classifying a defective argument by decomposing the task into specific steps), we need to break down the process of classifying the string "Men score better on math than women do. Jerry is a man. Therefore, Jerry is better at math than Sylvia, who is a woman." Here are the detailed steps:

### Step-by-step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition**:
   - Proposition (<P>): "Jerry is better at math than Sylvia."
   
2. **Identify the Reason**:
   - Reason (<R>): "Men score better on math than women do."
   
3. **Evaluate whether the Reason is Well-Established**:
   - The reason given is a generalization that might not be true for every individual case. It's based on an average difference between groups rather than an absolute rule applicable to every man and every woman.
   
4. **Examine if there is an issue with the Reason**:
   - Look for any logical fallacy:
     - Whether the reasoning given is valid and does it properly support the proposition.
   
5. **Classify the Argument Type Based on Identified Issues**:
   - **Compare the reason and proposition** to known defective argument types to understand the fallacy being committed in this structure:
     - **Generalization Fallacy (<G>)**: This argues that what might be statistically observed for a population can be applied to individuals without proper proof.
   
### Application of Decomposition to the Task (IDA)

**Step 1**: Proposition
- **<P>**: "Jerry is better at math than Sylvia."

**Step 2**: Reason
- **<R>**: "Men score better on math than women do."

**Step 3**: Clarify the Supporting Evidences
- Identify if the reason provided directly and logically supports the proposition. Here, the reasoning is general and does not conclusively provide enough details about Jerry and Sylvia.

**Step 4**: Identify the Logical Fallacy
- **Reason** doesn't conclusively establish the proposition as true for the individuals named (Jerry and Sylvia). The argument improperly extends a broad generalization to individual cases without sufficient evidence. 

**Step 5**: Determine the Type of Defective Argument
- **Defective Argument Type**: Given the nature and structure:
  - This is a classic case of **Generalization Fallacy (<G>)** as it applies the statistical pattern observed on average for populations (men vs. women in math scores) to specific individuals (Jerry and Sylvia).

### Conclusion

The string "Men score better on math than women do. Jerry is a man. Therefore, Jerry is better at math than Sylvia, who is a woman" is classified as of type **<G> (Generalization Fallacy)**.
