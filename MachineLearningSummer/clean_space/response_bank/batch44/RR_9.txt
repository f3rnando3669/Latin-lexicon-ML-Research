For 
To apply <IDAA> to "It says in the Bible that God exists. Since the Bible is God's word, and God never speaks falsely, then everything in the Bible must be true. So, God must exist.", we need to decompose the task of identifying the argument into specific steps. Here's a detailed decomposition of the classification process:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
    - The main claim or proposition in the argument. 
    - **Proposition (<P>)**: "God must exist."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
    - The causal basis or reason given to support the proposition.
    - **Reason (<R>)**: "Everything in the Bible must be true because it is God's word, and God never speaks falsely."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
    - Any additional argument that corroborates the reason.
    - **Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: "The Bible states that God exists."

4. **Evaluate the Logical Structure**:
    - Determine if the argument contains any logical fallacies or defective argument types.

5. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**:
    - Using the definitions provided for different defective argument types, find the best match for the identified logical fallacy.

### Application:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)

The proposition is the statement that the argument aims to prove:
- **Proposition**: "God must exist."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)

The reason provided to support the proposition is:
- **Reason**: "Everything in the Bible must be true because it is God's word, and God never speaks falsely."

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)

The proof provided to validate the reason is:
- **Proof of Reason**: "The Bible states that God exists."

#### Step 4: Evaluate the Logical Structure

Analyze the structure of the argument:
- The argument claims that the Bible must be true because it is God's word.
- It asserts that if everything in the Bible is true, then God must exist because the Bible says so.
- This creates a circular reasoning structure where the proof and the proposition feed into each other.

#### Step 5: Classify the Defective Argument Type

Using the provided definitions:
- **Circular Reasoning (RR)**: The argumentâ€™s reason essentially restates the proposition in a way that assumes its truth, making it circular.

This matches the defective argument type **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** defined as when the reason says precisely the same as was said in the proposition (e.g., "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity.").

### Conclusion

Thus, the classification of the string "It says in the Bible that God exists. Since the Bible is God's word, and God never speaks falsely, then everything in the Bible must be true. So, God must exist." falls under the defective argument type **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**.
