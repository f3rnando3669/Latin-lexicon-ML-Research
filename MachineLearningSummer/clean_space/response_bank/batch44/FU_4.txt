For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given statement, we will decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps and then follow those steps to arrive at a conclusion.

**Step 1: Analyze the Proposition (P)**
- Identify the main assertion of the argument.

**Step 2: Analyze the Reason (R)**
- Identify the causal basis used to support the main assertion.

**Step 3: Analyze the Proof of Reason (PR)**
- Examine whether the reason is corroborated by additional arguments or evidence.

**Step 4: Identify the Type of Defective Argument**
- Determine which type of defective argument (Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Insufficient Causal Basis, Presumptuous Consensus, or Ambiguous Language Use) the argument falls under.

**Step 1: Analyze the Proposition (P)**
- The main assertion (Proposition) in the statement is: "Japanese DVD players are the best."

**Step 2: Analyze the Reason (R)**
- The causal basis (Reason) provided is: "After all, they outsell American players two-to-one."

**Step 3: Analyze the Proof of Reason (PR)**
- The provided reason is that Japanese DVD players outsell American players, and this is used as evidence to claim they are the best.

**Step 4: Identify the Type of Defective Argument**
- The argument suggests that because Japanese DVD players have higher sales, they must be superior, relying on the popularity or higher sales as a basis for quality. This appears to appeal to popularity to validate the proposition.

**Conclusion: Classification**

The statement "Everyone knows that Japanese DVD players are the best. After all, they outsell American players two-to-one." is best classified as an example of **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**.

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the statement, we conclude that it uses the fallacy of appealing to popularity to support its claim.
