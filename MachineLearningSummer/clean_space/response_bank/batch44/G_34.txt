To classify the given statement using the task of identifying the specific type of defective argument <IDA>, let's break down the process step by step as defined in <IDAA>:

### Step 1: Understanding the Statement
The statement is:
"Trump presents a dark image of America if Clinton is elected, with 'Syrian refugees flooding in, illegal immigrants convicted of crimes staying.'"

### Step 2: Identifying Potential Categories
The defective argument categories available are:
- <G> Generalization
- <FE> Incomplete Enumeration
- <IR> Inconclusive Reason
- <RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition
- <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis
- <FU> Presumptuous Consensus
- <DEP> Ambiguous Language Use

### Step 3: Analyzing Key Elements of the Statement
- **Factual Claim:** Trump claims that electing Clinton would result in Syrian refugees "flooding in" and illegal immigrants with criminal convictions "staying."
- **Implications:** The language used suggests negative outcomes without directly supporting the claims with substantial evidence.

### Step 4: Matching the Statement with Defective Argument Types
- **Generalization (<G>):** This doesn't seem to generalize based on a sample.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This doesn't present a false dichotomy or miss important options.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This might be a candidate because it suggests a cause-and-effect relationship (Clinton's election leading to Syrian refugees and illegal immigrants staying) without conclusive proof.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The argument doesn't simply repeat the proposition without proof.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This seems likely because it posits a causation (Clinton's election causing negative outcomes) that isn't substantiated with compelling evidence.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This doesnâ€™t rely on the assumption that because many people believe it, it must be true.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** There is no evident equivocal or ambiguous term in the context of this statement.

### Step 5: Classification
Given the analysis, the statement:
"Trump presents a dark image of America if Clinton is elected, with 'Syrian refugees flooding in, illegal immigrants convicted of crimes staying.'"
fits best into the category of:
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** It suggests a cause (Clinton's election) leading to specific negative outcomes (Syrian refugees and criminal immigrants staying) without providing a compelling basis for the causation.

### Final Classification
The statement is classified as:
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**
