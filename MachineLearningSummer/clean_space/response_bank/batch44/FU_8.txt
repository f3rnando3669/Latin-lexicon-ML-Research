For 
To apply <IDAA>, we need to decompose the task <IDA> into specific steps to classify the given string according to the types of defective arguments outlined. Here is how we can proceed:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>):

1. **Identify the Primary Arguments**: Break down the dialogue to identify the main arguments presented.
2. **Classify Each Argument**: Determine the type of argument according to the provided definitions for <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.
3. **Match Characteristics**: Compare the identified arguments with the characteristics of the defective argument types.
4. **Determine the Overall Classification**: Based on the matches, classify the overall dialogue.

### Step 1: Identify the Primary Arguments
- **Mark's Argument 1**: He poses a question about believing in virgin births.
- **Sue's Response 1**: She asks for clarification, mistaking the meaning.
- **Mark's Clarification**: He explains he means birth without fertilization.
- **Sue's Response 2**: She states she does not believe in virgin births.
- **Mark's Argument 2**: He challenges Sue's disbelief by pointing out that about two billion people believe in them, implying she should reconsider her position.

### Step 2: Classify Each Argument
- **Mark's Argument 1**: Setting the topic.
- **Sue's Response 1 & 2**: Seeking clarification and expressing disbelief.
- **Mark's Argument 2**: He suggests that because two billion people believe in virgin births, Sue should reconsider her disbelief.

### Step 3: Match Characteristics
- **Mark's Argument 2**: This argument suggests that the widespread belief among two billion people should influence Sue to reconsider her disbelief. 

This matches the characteristics of **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**:
- **Definition of <FU>**: A defective argument type where a Proof of Reason is assumed as certain because it is universally agreed upon, which does not necessarily prove its truth.

### Step 4: Determine the Overall Classification
- **Overall Classification**: The string's primary defective argument hinges on the assumption that widespread belief is a valid reason for holding a belief. Thus, it falls under **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**.

### Final Application of <IDAA>:
- **Task**: Classify the string.
- **Result**: The string "Mark: Do you believe in virgin births? Sue: You mean that babies are born virgins? Mark: I mean birth without fertilization. Sue: No. Mark: How could you not believe in virgin births? Roughly two billion people believe in them, donâ€™t you think you should reconsider your position?" is classified as **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**.
