For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the string "Every sunrise, the rooster makes a sound. So it is the rooster which makes the sun rise," we will take this step by step. Let's break down the advanced task of <IDA> and decompose it into specific steps.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition 
1. **Identify the Structure of the Argument**: Break the argument into its components: Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), and Proof of Reason (<PR>).
2. **Recognize Argument Type**: Determine if the argument is a complete one or if it falls under any of the defective argument categories: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.
3. **Analyze the Reasoning**: Examine the reasoning to see if it conclusively establishes the proposition, or if it has logical fallacies.
4. **Classify the Argument**: Assign the argument to the correct type based on the analysis.

### Steps for Applying <IDAA>
**Step 1: Identify the Structure of the Argument**
- **Proposition (<P>)**: "It is the rooster which makes the sun rise."
- **Reason (<R>)**: "Every sunrise, the rooster makes a sound."
- **Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: The reasoning inherently implies causation between the rooster's sound and the sun rising.

**Step 2: Recognize Argument Type**
We need to check if the argument uses faulty logic or reasoning:
- Generalization: Not applicable, doesn't make a broad assumption.
- Incomplete Enumeration: Not applicable; it doesn't falsely limit options.
- Inconclusive Reason: Not likely; reasoning isn't just inconclusive but flawed.
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition: Not applicable; avoids circular definition.
- Insufficient Causal Basis: Potential match, as it suggests a correlation implying causation.
- Presumptuous Consensus: Not applicable; no consensus appeal.
- Ambiguous Language Use: Not applicable; straightforward statements without wordplay ambiguity.

**Step 3: Analyze the Reasoning**
- The reason given ("Every sunrise, the rooster makes a sound.") is used to establish the proposition ("the rooster makes the sun rise").
- This reasoning presents a situation where correlation is mistaken for causation.

**Step 4: Classify the Argument**
Considering the analysis, the argument logically fits into the category of **Insufficient Causal Basis** (<WCB>), as it makes a flawed assumption that because two events occur together, one causes the other.

### Conclusion
The string "Every sunrise, the rooster makes a sound. So it is the rooster which makes the sun rise." is thus classified as **<WCB>**, demonstrating **Insufficient Causal Basis**.
