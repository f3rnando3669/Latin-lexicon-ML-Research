For 
Certainly, let's apply IDAA to classify the string "Everyone else believes it, so it must be true." We'll decompose the task and proceed step by step.

1. **Initial Analysis and Context Understanding:**
   - Assess the given string to understand its context and meaning.
   - Focus on identifying any keywords or phrases that indicate the type of reasoning.

2. **Identify Potential Argument Categories:**
   - Recall the definitions of each defective argument type:
     - **<G> (Generalization):** Making broad claims based on limited evidence.
     - **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):** Claiming complete knowledge based on limited choices.
     - **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** Providing insufficient or unrelated justification.
     - **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** Circular reasoning or restating the same idea.
     - **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** Drawing causal connections without sufficient evidence.
     - **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):** Asserting something is true based on popular belief.
     - **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):** Misleading through ambiguous language.

3. **Match Against Definitions:**
   - **Generalization (G):** The string does not emphasize taking a limited observation and applying it broadly.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The string does not present limited choices or miss out pertinent ones.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The string does not delve into reasons that are insufficient or inconclusive relative to a distinct proposition.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The string does not show circular reasoning where the claim re-affirms itself.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The string does not involve a causal link without significant evidence.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The string explicitly mirrors the pattern of assuming something to be true because it is believed by many people, fitting this category perfectly.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The string does not rely on the ambiguity of terms to mislead.

4. **Conclusion and Classification:**
   - After analyzing the string and matching it against the potential argument categories, it fits the definition of **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**.

Therefore, the string "Everyone else believes it, so it must be true." is classified as a **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)** argument.
