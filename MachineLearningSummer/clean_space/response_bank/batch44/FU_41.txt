For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the given string ", that it must be true" involves the following steps:

1. **Understand the Nature of the String**: Read the string carefully to determine its context and the type of argument or logical structure it might be part of.

2. **Identify Key Characteristics**: Determine the characteristics of the string to see if it aligns with one of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

3. **Classify Based on Defined Types**: Use the definitions and examples of each defective argument type to match the string to its correct type.

Let’s follow these steps for the given string ", that it must be true":

### Step 1: Understand the Nature of the String
The string ", that it must be true" suggests a conclusion or assertion that something is true based on some preceding context.

### Step 2: Identify Key Characteristics
The phrase implies a presumed truth likely grounded on the idea that the preceding context (not provided in full here) contributes to a wide agreement or acceptance.

### Step 3: Classify Based on Defined Types
Given the partial examination of the string, we should consider the possibility that it may be assuming truth based on widespread acceptance or popularity. This aligns with the definition of the <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus) argument type.

- **Presumptuous Consensus**: Assumes something is true or valid because "it is universally agreed upon" or a large number of people believe it.

Let’s refine this into a final determination.

---

Given the context that the phrase is likely asserting truth based on a large number of people, the classification that fits best is:

- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: Here, the string ", that it must be true" appears to assume that something must be true because it is widely believed.

### Conclusion
The string ", that it must be true" is classified as **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**.
