For 
**Task Application (IDAA) Step-by-step Decomposition:**

1. **Read and understand the string `s`:**
   - "Dana is trying to raise money for her university's library. In her address to the board of trustees, she says, 'We must raise tuition to cover the cost of new books. Otherwise the library will be forced to close.' Of what fallacy is this an example?"

2. **Identify the different components and claims within the string:**
   - Main claim: "We must raise tuition to cover the cost of new books."
   - Dire consequence: "Otherwise the library will be forced to close."

3. **Determine the reasoning behind the claim:**
   - Dana argues that failure to raise tuition will necessarily result in the library's closure, presenting only two extreme options.

4. **Classify the fallacy based on the reasoning provided:**
   - Analyze if there are more possibilities not considered, making it fall under the defective argument type.

5. **Match the components of the reasoning to known types of defective arguments:**
   - Identify if the reasoning is a false dichotomy or simplification of complex issues into only two outcomes/action paths.

**Decomposed Classification (D), Applied to the Example (IDAA):**

- The above string presents a situation where Dana proposes that not raising tuition will force the library to close, thereby framing the situation as having only two extreme outcomes:
  - Raise tuition for new books.
  - The library will close.
  
**Conclusion:**

- The string "Dana is trying to raise money for her university's library. In her address to the board of trustees, she says, 'We must raise tuition to cover the cost of new books. Otherwise the library will be forced to close.' Of what fallacy is this an example?" is an example of **Defective Argument Type <FE>, Incomplete Enumeration**. This fallacy falsely restricts the choices to two extremes without considering other viable options or possibilities.

Hence, the fallacy in this example is an **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**.
