For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task "argues that a proposition is true because it has not yet been proven false," we need to decompose the task of classifying the statement according to the types provided (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>). 

**Step 1: Identify the proposition and the reason provided.**
- **Proposition (P):** A proposition is true.
- **Reason (R):** It has not yet been proven false.

**Step 2: Analyze if the reason (R) provided causally supports the proposition (P).**
- Is the reason sufficient to establish the truth of the proposition? 
- Here, the fact that a proposition has not been proven false does not necessarily mean it is true.

**Step 3: Match the pattern of reasoning with the given argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).**
- **<G> (Generalization):** Involves making a broad statement based on a small sample. Doesn't fit.
- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):** Involves a false dichotomy or missing possibilities. Doesn't fit.
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** Includes reasons that donâ€™t conclusively demonstrate the proposition. Could be relevant but too general.
- **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** Repeats the proposition in the reason itself. Doesn't fit.
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** Causal connections that don't truly establish the proposition. Could be relevant but focusing on causal basis specifically.
- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):** Claims something is true because it is widely accepted. Doesn't fit.
- **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):** Ambiguous terms or meanings. Doesn't fit.

**Step 4: Identify the specific argument type.**
- The statement "argues that a proposition is true because it has not yet been proven false" fits the pattern of assuming something is true solely because it has not been disproven. This is known as an **argument from ignorance**.

**Step 5: Conclude the classification.**
- The type that most closely matches is **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** because it argues from a lack of proof against the proposition, which does not conclusively establish the truth of the proposition.

**Final Classification:** The argument "argues that a proposition is true because it has not yet been proven false" is of type **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**.
