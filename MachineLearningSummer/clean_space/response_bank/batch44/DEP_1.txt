To apply the decomposition of the task of classifying a statement into logical fallacies to a specific string step-by-step, we will break down the steps and apply them to the provided argument.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify Key Components:**
   - Recognize and separate the components of the argument. 
   - Find the Proposition (<P>) and the Reason (<R>).

2. **Determine Argument Type:**
   - Assess whether the components meet the criteria for a logical fallacy.
   - Compare components with the predefined types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

3. **Match Fallacy Definition:**
   - Validate the argument against definitions and examples of each fallacy type.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Classify the argument correctly based on the identified logical fallacy type.

### Apply Steps to Given Argument:

"I don't see how you can say you're an ethical person. It's so hard to get you to do anything; your work ethic is so bad."

#### Step 1: Identify Key Components

- **Proposition (<P>):** "I don't see how you can say you're an ethical person."
- **Reason (<R>):** "It's so hard to get you to do anything; your work ethic is so bad."

#### Step 2: Determine Argument Type

- **Argument Analysis:** The proposition (<P>) is making a statement about the person's ethical status. The reason (<R>) given is related to the person's work ethic.
- **Evaluate Logical Steps:** The reasoning suggests that poor work ethic should correlate directly to the ethical status of a person.

#### Step 3: Match Fallacy Definition

- **Comparison:**
  - **Generalization (<G>):** This does not fit as it isn't generalizing behavior across a group.
  - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This isn't restricting the argument to two options.
  - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This type fits because the argument doesn't conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition. There’s no direct correlation presented between work ethic and overall ethics.
  - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason isn't just repeating the proposition; hence, this does not fit.
  - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This does not apply here; the fallacy isn't about causation but reasoning alignment.
  - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This does not apply; the fallacy doesn’t argue based on consensus.
  - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** This does not seem to apply; the argument isn't based on ambiguous language.

#### Step 4: Conclusion

The argument "I don't see how you can say you're an ethical person. It's so hard to get you to do anything; your work ethic is so bad" is using an **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**. The reasoning about the individual's work ethic does not conclusively establish anything about the person's ethical nature broadly.

Therefore, the statement "I don't see how you can say you're an ethical person. It's so hard to get you to do anything; your work ethic is so bad" is classified as having an **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** fallacy.
