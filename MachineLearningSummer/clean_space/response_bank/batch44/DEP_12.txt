For 
To classify the given statement "I didn’t steal your pen—I borrowed it," let's apply the decomposition of the classification task step by step.

1. **Understand the statement:**
   - The speaker is defending their action regarding someone else’s pen. They claim they did not steal it, but rather borrowed it.

2. **Identify key terms or phrases:**
   - "Steal" vs. "borrowed"

3. **Analyze the meanings and implications:**
   - "Steal" implies taking something without permission with no intention of returning it.
   - "Borrowed" implies taking something with the intention of returning it and possibly with permission.

4. **Detect any ambiguous language use or fallacies:**
   - The terms "steal" and "borrow" are being contrasted. The speaker is using the word "borrow" to soften the perception of their action and avoid the negative connotation that comes with "steal."

5. **Determine the fallacy or defective argument type:**
   - The statement subtly shifts the meaning of actions based on the audience's perception by using ambiguous language.

Based on this analysis, the type of argument being presented here fits **Ambiguous Language Use** (<DEP>). The ambiguity arises from the different implications of "steal" versus "borrow," and the speaker is attempting to manipulate the perception by choosing a less harsh term ("borrowed") to describe their action.

Therefore, the classification of the statement "I didn’t steal your pen—I borrowed it" under the provided defective argument types is **<DEP>** (Ambiguous Language Use).
