For 
To apply \( IDAA \) to the statement "If the country is ever going to be safe from terrorists we have to close the borders," we need to decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps. Here's the decomposition \( D \) applied step-by-step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\( P \))
Analyze the statement to determine what is being claimed or proposed.

- \( P \): The country needs to close its borders to be safe from terrorists.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\( R \))
Determine the causal basis or reasoning supporting the proposition.

- \( R \): Closing the borders will prevent terrorists from entering the country, making it safe.

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (\( PR \))
Assess any additional arguments or proofs that support the reason.

- \( PR \): No additional proof is explicitly given; the statement assumes that closing the borders as a preventive measure is sufficient.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument Type
Using the defined defective argument types, evaluate the argument for its classification. Here are the defective argument types again to aid classification:

- \( G \): Generalization
- \( FE \): Incomplete Enumeration
- \( IR \): Inconclusive Reason
- \( RR \): Faulty Repetition of Proposition
- \( WCB \): Insufficient Causal Basis
- \( FU \): Presumptuous Consensus
- \( DEP \): Ambiguous Language Use

### Step 5: Apply the Classification
Review the definitions of the defective argument types to see which one best fits the identified \( P \), \( R \), and \( PR \).

The argument suggests that the only way to be safe from terrorists is to close the borders, implying a either/or scenario, without considering other possibilities or solutions that might also help achieve safety.

Given the argument components and definition review:

- The argument type most fitting is \( FE \): Incomplete Enumeration. It claims a complete enumeration of possibilities (i.e., closing borders is the only way to ensure safety) but actually misses out on other pertinent options (e.g., improving intelligence operations, international cooperation, internal security measures).

### Step 6: Confirm the Diagnosis

- **Is \( P \) correctly identified?** Yes, the proposition is clearly about the necessity of closing borders for safety.
- **Is \( R \) appropriately captured?** Yes, the reason provided is that closing borders would prevent terrorists from entering.
- **Does \( PR \) support \( R \)?** No substantial proof is given, which points to a presumption rather than evidence.
- **Does the classification correctly reflect the argument's flaw?** Yes, it exhibits characteristics of \( FE \) due to its assertion of a single solution without considering a broader context.

### Conclusion

\( s = "If the country is ever going to be safe from terrorists we have to close the borders." \)

- **Classified as**: \( FE \) (Incomplete Enumeration)

Thus, the statement "If the country is ever going to be safe from terrorists we have to close the borders" is correctly classified as \( FE \) due to its incomplete enumeration of possible solutions to terrorism.
