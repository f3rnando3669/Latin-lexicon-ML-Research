For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "My opponent is a card-carrying member of the K.K.K." by decomposing the task into specific steps, we can approach it methodically as follows:

**Step 1: Identify and extract the components of the argument in the string.**
- Statement: "My opponent is a card-carrying member of the K.K.K."

**Step 2: Analyze the purpose and strategy of the statement.**
- The statement does not provide evidence or a reason that directly addresses or refutes the opponent's argument.

**Step 3: Compare the statement against the definitions of defective argument types.**
- **Generalization (<G>):** The statement does not generalize a group based on a few instances.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The statement does not present a false dichotomy or incomplete set of options.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The statement does not present a faulty reason directly supporting a proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The statement is not circular or repetitively stating the same thing as evidence.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The statement does not attribute an effect to a cause without a compelling causal basis.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The statement does not assert an idea based on universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The statement does not use language that is ambiguous or intentionally misleading based on multiple meanings.

**Step 4: Identify the fallacy present in the statement.**
- The statement is an example of an **ad hominem attack**, specifically an ad hominem abusive where the argument attacks the character of the opponent rather than addressing the content of the opponent's argument.

**Step 5: Classify the identified fallacy according to the definitions given.**
- The statement attacks the opponent's character rather than the argument, which fits the definition of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** where the argument does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. 

**Conclusion:**
The string "My opponent is a card-carrying member of the K.K.K." can be classified as:
- **Type: <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**

The classification follows from the statement's nature of using an attack on the opponent's character to distract from discussing the argument's merit.
