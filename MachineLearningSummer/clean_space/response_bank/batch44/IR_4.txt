For 
To apply <IDAA> to "My dad went to school, so he knows everything about the education system," we will take it step by step to classify this string into one of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Step 1: Identify the parts of the argument.
- **Proposition (P)**: My dad knows everything about the education system.
- **Reason (R)**: My dad went to school.

### Step 2: Analyze the causal basis.
- **Analyze R**: The reason provided is that the dad went to school.
- **Analyze P**: The proposition is that, because of his schooling, the dad knows everything about the education system.

### Step 3: Classify the argument type.
1. **Check if it fits <G> (Generalization)**:
   - The P is not necessarily a general assertion that extends from one or a few instances to a whole class. Instead, it relates directly to the individual's experience.

2. **Check if it fits <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**:
   - There's no false dichotomy or exclusion of alternatives presented here.

3. **Check if it fits <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**:
   - The R does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the P. Attending school does not provide comprehensive knowledge about the entire education system. Significant foundational knowledge is missing.

4. **Check if it fits <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**:
   - The reason is not simply a restatement of the proposition.

5. **Check if it fits <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**:
   - The argument relies weakly on the assumption that attending school equates to comprehensive knowledge about the education system, which forms an insufficient causal link.

6. **Check if it fits <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**:
   - There is no reference to what everyone else is believed to think.

7. **Check if it fits <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**:
   - The argument does not rely on ambiguous meanings of words.

### Step 4: Determine the most appropriate classification.
- The argument is best classified as **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** because the causal link between attending school and knowing everything about the education system is weak and does not conclusively support the proposition.

### Conclusion
- The classification of the string "My dad went to school, so he knows everything about the education system." is **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason).
