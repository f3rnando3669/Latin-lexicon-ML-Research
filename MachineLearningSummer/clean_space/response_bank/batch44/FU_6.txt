Sure, let's decompose the task of classifying "Throughout history, most philosophers thought men were more rational than women, therefore this is true." by IDAA.

### Step 1: Identify Propositions and Reasons
Identify the key proposition and the reason that supports it:
- **Proposition (P)**: "Men are more rational than women."
- **Reason (R)**: "Most philosophers throughout history thought so."

### Step 2: Evaluate the Reason
Assess if the Reason provided is a valid and compelling basis for the Proposition:
- The Reason is based on the consensus or belief of past philosophers.

### Step 3: Identify Fallacy Category
Determine which category the fallacy fits into given the criteria:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - Not applicable, since it doesn’t overgeneralize based on a sample or an individual experience.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - Not applicable, since it doesn't claim there are only two possibilities or miss out on potential alternatives.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - Could apply, but investigating more apt categories first.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - Not applicable, as it doesn't merely repeat the proposition as the reason.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - Not applicable here because it’s not a matter of insufficient causation between events; it’s more about appeal to consensus.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - Highly likely, the argument relies on what most philosophers believed in the past to claim it as the truth now.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
   - Not applicable, as there is no ambiguity or equivocation in the language.

### Step 4: Classify String
Based on the evaluation, classify the string:
- **Classification**: **<FU>** - Presumptuous Consensus.

### Conclusion
The string "Throughout history, most philosophers thought men were more rational than women, therefore this is true." fits the category of Presumptuous Consensus (FU), where the truth of the proposition is assumed based on its popularity or belief among a group.

So, the classification of the given string is **<FU>**.
