For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string, we will decompose the task of identifying the defective argument type into specific steps. Let's begin:

### Step 1: Breakdown of the Argument
We'll first break down the argument presented in the string into its core components or premises and the concluding assertion:

1. Premise: A person who is apparently hopelessly ill may be allowed to take his own life.
2. Premise: Then he may be permitted to deputize others to do it for him should he no longer be able to act.
3. Premise: The judgment of others then becomes the ruling factor.
4. Premise: At this point, euthanasia is not personal and voluntary because others are acting on behalf of the patient.
5. Premise: This may well incline them to act on behalf of other patients who have not authorized them to exercise their judgment.
6. Conclusion: It is only a short step, then, from voluntary euthanasia (self-inflicted or authorized), to directed euthanasia administered to a patient who has given no authorization, to involuntary euthanasia conducted as a part of a social policy.

### Step 2: Identifying the Nature of the Argument
We'll identify the logical flow and any potential logical fallacies present. This involves carefully analyzing the steps in the argument and checking for any common patterns of defective reasoning.

### Step 3: Matching to Known Defects
We consider the defective argument types defined earlier:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**
5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**

### Step 4: Evaluate Each Premise and Conclusion
Let’s evaluate each part of the argument:

- The initial premise allows the idea of voluntary euthanasia.
- The argument then suggests a slippery slope from voluntary euthanasia involving others’ judgment to directed and involuntary euthanasia (i.e., "It is only a short step...").

### Step 5: Classify the Defective Argument
The overall argument suggests a progression from one action (voluntary euthanasia) to a much more extreme and less consensual action (involuntary euthanasia) without strong causal evidence—this is a classic hallmark of a **Slippery Slope Fallacy**.

### Step 6: Determine the Defective Argument Type
Given the progression described without sufficient causal basis or evidence for each of the incremental steps leading to involuntary euthanasia:

- The argument is suggesting that if euthanasia is accepted in one form, it will unavoidably lead to another, more extreme form, without strong evidence for this inevitability. This fits under **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.

### Step 7: Confirmation
To ensure this classification, note that the fallacy assumes a chain reaction leading from one action to a dire consequence without adequate justification of each step's inevitability:

- This argument is primarily characterized by the insufficient causal basis for the claim that voluntary euthanasia will unavoidably lead to involuntary euthanasia as social policy.

### Conclusion
The identified defective argument type for the string is **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**. Thus, applying <IDAA> confirms that the given string is a type <WCB> defective argument.
