For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string, we will decompose the task of classifying the string into specific steps and apply them systematically.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

**Step 1: Identify the propositions and reasons in the argument.**
- **Proposition (<P>):** Donald Trump is a known adulterer.
- **Reason (<R>):** It reflects badly on his character and suggests he might not be trustworthy.
- **Response by Speaker 2 (<R>):** What about Bill Clinton? You didn’t seem to care when he cheated.

**Step 2: Determine if the response addresses the proposition or reason directly.**
- Speaker 2's response does not address whether Donald Trump is an adulterer or if that reflects on his character. Instead, it deflects by bringing up Bill Clinton's past actions.

**Step 3: Check if the response uses any faulty reasoning or defective argument types.**
- The response seems to criticize the person for being inconsistent or hypocritical rather than addressing the original proposition directly. 

**Step 4: Match with the definitions of defective argument types.**
- **Generalization (<G>):** Not applicable.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Not applicable.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Not applicable.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Not applicable.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Not applicable.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Not applicable.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Not applicable.

**Step 5: Classify the argument based on the closest matching fallacy.**
- The argument by Speaker 2 is a classic example of the "Tu Quoque" fallacy (also known as "Whataboutism"). It criticizes the other party for being hypocritical instead of addressing the argument directly.

### Classification:
The argument is best classified as a type <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) but more precisely, it’s an instance of the "Tu Quoque" fallacy. 

### Final Answer:
**Type:** <IR>

Explanation: The response "What about Bill Clinton? You didn’t seem to care when he cheated." deflects Speaker 1's argument about Donald Trump’s character by accusing Speaker 1 of being hypocritical about a similar issue with Bill Clinton. This does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition about Trump's trustworthiness. Thus, it falls under the category of <IR>, indicating an Inconclusive Reason.
