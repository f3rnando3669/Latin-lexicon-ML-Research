For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "Television Advertisement: Rush to shop at Super-Mart this weekend, everyone is doing it!", we need to decompose the task of classifying the string as one of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>) and then carry out that classification step by step.

### Decomposition of Task <IDA>:
1. **Identify** the main proposition or claim in the string.
2. **Analyze** the reasoning provided for the proposition or claim.
3. **Determine** the presence of any defective argument based on the definitions provided.
4. **Classify** the given string according to the defective argument types.

### Step-by-Step Classification of the String:

1. **Identify the main proposition or claim in the string**:
   - The main proposition of the television advertisement is: "Rush to shop at Super-Mart this weekend."

2. **Analyze the reasoning provided for the proposition or claim**:
   - The reasoning provided is: "everyone is doing it!" This is presented as the reason why one should rush to shop at Super-Mart.

3. **Determine the presence of any defective argument based on the definitions provided**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: This type involves making a broad claim based on limited or non-representative examples.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This type involves claiming only two possibilities or outcomes with no consideration for other options.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This type involves reasoning that does not conclusively support the proposition.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This type involves restating the proposition without additional support.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This type involves a weak causal relationship claimed without strong support.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This type involves assuming something is correct or beneficial because "everyone" believes or does it.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: This type involves using language that is open to multiple interpretations, leading to potential misunderstandings.

4. **Classify the given string according to the defective argument types**:
   - The reasoning "everyone is doing it!" relies on the idea that an action is justified or should be followed because it is popular. This matches the definition of **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**, where an argument is based on the belief that a widespread action or belief validates the proposition.

Therefore, the given string "Television Advertisement: Rush to shop at Super-Mart this weekend, everyone is doing it!" should be classified as **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**.
