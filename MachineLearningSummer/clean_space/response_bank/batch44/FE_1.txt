Sure, let's break down the task of classifying the argument "Either we go to war or we appear weak," step by step.

### Step-by-step Decomposition for IDAA

1. **Understand the argument (Identify the Proposition <P>):**
   - Argument: "Either we go to war or we appear weak."
   - Proposition: The statement presents two choices - going to war or appearing weak.

2. **Identify types of defective arguments (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>):**
   - <G> (Generalization): General statements or stereotypes applied broadly.
   - <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration): Essentially a false dilemma, presenting only two options when more exist.
   - <IR> (Inconclusive Reason): Reasoning provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
   - <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition): Circular reasoning or repetition without adding substance.
   - <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis): Weak causal relationship between reason and proposition.
   - <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus): Assumes something is true because many people believe it.
   - <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use): Misleading through ambiguous or double-meaning language.

3. **Analyze the logical structure and look for key characteristics of the defective types:**
   - The argument "Either we go to war or we appear weak" presents only two possibilities and suggests that not going to war will inevitably lead to appearing weak.
   - Assess if alternatives are ignored or if it falsely simplifies the situation by presenting limited outcomes or choices.

4. **Match the argumentâ€™s characteristics to the types:**
   - Does it generalize from specific instances? No.
   - Does it exclude other possibilities, presenting a false choice? Yes.
   - Is the reasoning offered insufficient to prove the claim conclusively? No, but it's more about presenting choices.
   - Is it a circular argument? No.
   - Are the causations drawn insufficient? No, causation isn't the primary issue here.
   - Is there an appeal to what many people believe? No.
   - Is there ambiguous or misleading language? No.

5. **Determine the appropriate type:**
   - Based on the analysis, the argument fits the type <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration).

### Conclusion:
The argument "Either we go to war or we appear weak" is best classified as an <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration), as it presents a false dilemma by only offering two options without considering other possible alternatives.

By following these steps, we have decomposed the task and classified the given statement.
