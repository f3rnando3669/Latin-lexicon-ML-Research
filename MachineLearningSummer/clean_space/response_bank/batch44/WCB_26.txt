For 
Let's break down the task into specific steps to classify the given string "Valencia bought a different brand of detergent at the store. She developed a rash after wearing clothes washed in the new detergent. She concluded that she was allergic to the new soap."

### Steps for IDAA:
1. **Extract the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Identify the main statement being made.
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Determine the causal basis given for the proposition.
   
3. **Evaluate the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Examine if the reason provided sufficiently supports the proposition or if there are any logical flaws in the causal relationship.
   
4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>)**:
   - Based on the evaluation, determine which type of defective argument the given reasoning falls under.

### Application of Steps:

#### Step 1: Extract the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition in the given string is:
   - "She concluded that she was allergic to the new soap."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason given for the proposition is:
   - "She developed a rash after wearing clothes washed in the new detergent."

#### Step 3: Evaluate the Reason (<R>)
   - This reason suggests a direct causal link between using the new detergent and developing a rash. 
   - However, it does not consider other potential causes of the rash, such as other allergens, skin conditions, or contaminants.

#### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type
   - The reason does not conclusively establish that the new detergent is the cause of the rash. This suggests a lack of sufficient causal basis.
   - The string demonstrates insufficient evidence to conclusively link the rash to the new detergent without ruling out other possible causes.

Based on this evaluation, the defective argument type is:

**<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**

### Conclusion:
The reasoning "Valencia bought a different brand of detergent at the store. She developed a rash after wearing clothes washed in the new detergent. She concluded that she was allergic to the new soap." is classified as <WCB> due to insufficient causal basis.
