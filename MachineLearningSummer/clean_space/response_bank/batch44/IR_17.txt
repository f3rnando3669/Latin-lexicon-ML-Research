For 
To apply <IDAA> to classify the given string "MacDougal roots for a British football team. Clearly he's unfit to be a police chief in Ireland." we need to break down this task into specific steps and classify the argument type. Here’s the step-by-step decomposition:

**Step 1: Understand and restate the argument being made in the string.**
- The statement suggests that because MacDougal supports a British football team, he is unfit to be a police chief in Ireland.

**Step 2: Identify the type of reasoning employed in the argument.**
- This statement uses a personal characteristic (supporting a British football team) to make a conclusion about someone's professional capability or suitability (being a police chief in Ireland).

**Step 3: Check if the reasoning requests further evidence or support.**
- The statement does not provide any evidence linking the support of a British football team to the ability to perform duties as a police chief. It suggests an inherent unsuitability based on personal preference.

**Step 4: Refer to known types of defective arguments and match the characteristics.**
- <G>: Generalization (unsupported assumption based on one characteristic)
- <FE>: Incomplete Enumeration (claiming two options without considering others)
- <IR>: Inconclusive Reason (reasoning that doesn't conclusively support the proposition)
- <RR>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition (circular reasoning)
- <WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis (weak causal relationship)
- <FU>: Presumptuous Consensus (claiming something is true because everyone believes it)
- <DEP>: Ambiguous Language Use (using ambiguous language to mislead)

**Step 5: Determine which type matches the argument best based on the attributes identified in Step 4.**
- The argument employs a characteristic (rooting for a football team) with no logical connection to the professional role (police chief). It appears to attack the person’s suitability based on irrelevant personal preferences, which points to an ad hominem fallacy but closely aligns with <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).

**Conclusion:**
The argument does not establish a conclusive logical connection between rooting for a British football team and being unfit for the role of a police chief. Therefore, the given string is best classified as:

**Type: <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**

The final classification provided by applying the decomposition process (IDAA) to the string is <IR>.
