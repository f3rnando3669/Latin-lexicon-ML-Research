Sure, let's apply <IDAA> to classify the argument in the given string "Why must you always take such a stupid and uninformed approach to ethics?" by breaking it down into specific steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Target of Classification (<s>)

The target string for classification is:
"Why must you always take such a stupid and uninformed approach to ethics?"

### Step 2: Understand the Target String

Analyze the statement. The statement is a question that implies a negative judgment towards someone's approach to ethics, labeling it as “stupid and uninformed.”

### Step 3: Establish the Criteria for Each Defective Argument Type
- **Generalization (<G>)**: Making a broad statement based on limited evidence.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Making an assertion by claiming only two possible outcomes when there are more.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Presenting a reason that does not conclusively support the proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Repeating the same information as the reason without providing new support.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Causal reasoning without a solid connection.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Claiming something is true because it is believed by many.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Using language that has multiple meanings or is misleading.

### Step 4: Compare the Target String Against Each Criteria
- **<G>**: The statement does not appear to make a broad generalization but rather addresses a specific person's approach.
- **<FE>**: This is not a binary assertion.
- **<IR>**: No reasoning is provided in the statement, only a judgment.
- **<RR>**: There is no repetition of the proposition as the reason.
- **<WCB>**: There's no causal relationship being claimed.
- **<FU>**: There is no appeal to popular belief.
- **<DEP>**: No specific use of words with multiple meanings.

### Step 5: Identify Ad Hominem Elements
Notice that the statement includes ad hominem language ("stupid and uninformed approach"), targeting the person rather than addressing an argument or providing logical reasoning.

### Step 6: Conclude the Classification

Given that the statement attacks the individual rather than their argument, and it doesn't fit neatly into other described categories of defective argument types, it most closely aligns with the category:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided for the criticism ("stupid and uninformed") does not substantiate any specific argument about ethics.

### Step 7: Confirm the Classification
Reviewing the criteria, <IR> is correct. This classification captures that the question does not provide a sound basis for the criticism; instead, it assumes the conclusion without evidence.

### Classification

The statement "Why must you always take such a stupid and uninformed approach to ethics?" is best classified as **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**.

The steps above show how the task <IDA> can be broken down into detailed steps (<IDAA>) to classify the argument properly.
