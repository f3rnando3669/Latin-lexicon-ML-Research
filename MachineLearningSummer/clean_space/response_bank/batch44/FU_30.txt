For 
To apply IDAA to the given argument, we need to break down the advanced task (<IDA>) of classifying the argument's defectiveness step by step. Here's the process:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition (<P>): "I am voting for Pepitone for President."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason (<R>): "The rest of my family is voting for her, and I don't want to be the only one not doing so."

3. **Determine the Defectiveness Category:**
   - We need to classify the given argument as one of the defect types: **Generalization (G)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**, **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**, or **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**.

### Applying IDAA:

1. **Analyze the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason given is "The rest of my family is voting for her, and I don't want to be the only one not doing so."
   - This implies that the action of voting for the candidate is justified based on what the majority (family) is doing, rather than on the candidate's qualities or policies.
   
2. **Match with Definitions of Defectiveness:**
   - **Generalization (G):** The argument does not generalize from specific instances to a broader claim unrelated to this classification.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument does not present an improperly limited set of choices here.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason provided does not require demonstration of correctness, but rather follows the consensus.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The argument does not restate the proposition as the reason.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** There’s no causal relationship proposed that’s inherently insufficient.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This is a direct appeal to consensus, assuming that because "the rest of my family" believes something, it must be correct or that the action must be followed.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** There’s no ambiguous language or double meaning in the statement.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The argument matches most closely with **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**. It appeals to the idea that because everyone else (in this case, the family) is voting for her, the speaker should as well, without providing a substantive reason for the proposition itself beyond following the crowd.

### Classification:
- The given argument "I am voting for Pepitone for President because the rest of my family is voting for her, and I don't want to be the only one not doing so." is of type <FU> **(Presumptuous Consensus)**.
