For 
To apply <IDAA> to the argument "Ten years ago I got a 170 on the LSAT, so I expect to get the same score again.", we will decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine the main claim being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the basis or support provided for the claim.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Identify any additional arguments or evidence provided to support the reason.
4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**: Based on the identified components, classify the argument under one of the predefined defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>).

### Application of <D> to the Given Argument:
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - **Proposition**: The speaker expects to get the same score (170) on the LSAT as they did ten years ago.
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - **Reason**: The speaker bases their expectation on the fact that they got a 170 on the LSAT ten years ago.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - **Proof of Reason**: There is no additional proof provided; the argument relies solely on the past event to support the expected outcome.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**:
   - **Defective Argument Type**: The argument makes an assumption that past performance guarantees future results without considering potential changes in the individual's abilities, the test format, or other relevant factors. This matches the characteristics of <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) because the causal connection between past and future LSAT scores is weak and unsupported by compelling evidence.

### Classification (Applying <IDAA>):
- **Final Classification**: The given argument "Ten years ago I got a 170 on the LSAT, so I expect to get the same score again." is of type <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis). 

The argument falls under <WCB> because it assumes that a past result will directly cause a similar future result without sufficient justification for the causal relationship.
