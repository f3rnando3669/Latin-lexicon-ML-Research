For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "Grace and Helen were both romantically interested in Brad. One day, with Brad sitting within earshot, Grace asked in an inquisitive tone whether Helen was still having problems with her drug habit." we need to follow a step-by-step process of decomposing the task of classifying the argument into specific steps. Below is the detailed decomposition:

### Step 1: Understand the Argument
Identify the core components and the nature of the argument being presented. Here, Grace is making a statement or asking a question in a context where Brad, who is interested in both Grace and Helen, can hear. Grace's question implies something negative about Helen (having a drug habit).

### Step 2: Identify the Type of Defective Argument
Review the definitions of the defective argument types to identify which one best fits the argument presented.

- **<G> (Generalization)**: Making a broad statement based on a few instances.
- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: Presenting only some options, ignoring other possibilities.
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: The reasons given do not conclusively demonstrate the proposition.
- **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: Repeating the proposition without additional support.
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The causal basis submitted is not compelling.
- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: Assuming something is certain because "everyone agrees".
- **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: Using language that can be taken in another sense than intended.

### Step 3: Analyze the Argument
Determine if the statement falls under any of the defective argument types listed above.

In this scenario, the statement by Grace doesn't seem to fit the typical definitions of generalization (<G>), incomplete enumeration (<FE>), inconclusive reason (<IR>), faulty repetition of proposition (<RR>), insufficient causal basis (<WCB>), or presumptuous consensus (<FU>).

However, it does involve ambiguous language use or potentially another category of fallacy not originally listed, such as an ad hominem.

### Step 4: Choose the Most Appropriate Classification
Based on the definitions and the analysis, decide whether the statement fits well with any of the defective argument types provided.

In this case, it seems to be aimed at undermining Helenâ€™s reputation in front of Brad, focusing on an irrelevant personal attack which is more aligned with the logical fallacy of **Ad Hominem** - though this is not in our listed categories, it fits well here.

Therefore, a refined step-by-step decomposition identifies this as **not fitting our predefined categories**, but closely resembling an **Ad Hominem** attack.

### Step 5: Verify the Classification
Ensure the classification aligns logically with the context and content of the statement.

- Conclusion: The statement by Grace is best described as an attack on Helen's character (Ad Hominem).

### Final Classification
Although Ad Hominem is not listed in the initial argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>, it seems most relatable. Therefore, acknowledging this involves flexibility and could suggest expanding categories to include common fallacies like ad hominem in the future steps.

### Final Answer:
Given the current options, **Outside of Defined Types** - This statement doesn't fit into <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP> precisely but most closely resembles an Ad Hominem logical fallacy which indicates a need for a comprehensive taxonomy update.
