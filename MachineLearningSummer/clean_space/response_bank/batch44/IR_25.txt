For 
To apply <IDAA> to classify "You can’t give me a C. I’ll lose my scholarship.", we need to follow a systematic decomposition of the classification task into specific steps. Here’s the process:

### Step 1: Understand the Propositions
Identify the proposition (\<P\>) and the reason (\<R\>).

- **Proposition (\<P\>):** You can’t give me a C.
- **Reason (\<R\>):** I’ll lose my scholarship.

### Step 2: Determine the Argument's Structure
Understand the structure of the argument and how the reason is supporting the proposition.

### Step 3: Assess the Cause-Effect Relationship
Evaluate if there's any logical fallacy in the causal link between the proposition and the reason.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument
Classify the argument as one of the defective types: \<G\>, \<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<RR\>, \<WCB\>, \<FU\>, or \<DEP\>. Determine which classification fits best based on the specific characteristics.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Identify Proposition and Reason:**
   - **Proposition (\<P\>):** You can’t give me a C.
   - **Reason (\<R\>):** I’ll lose my scholarship.

2. **Evaluate Cause-Effect Relationship:**
   - **Argument:** The argument suggests that losing the scholarship (\<R\>) is the cause or reason for why the grade (\<P\>) cannot be given.
   - **Logical Link:** Losing a scholarship is a consequence of getting a C, but this doesn’t address the academic merit of the grade itself. It's an emotional appeal rather than an academic criterion.

3. **Classify the Defective Argument:**
   - **Classification:** The argument attempts to persuade based on the consequence (losing the scholarship) rather than the merit of the grade itself. Therefore, it can be classified as **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**. Specifically, the reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate that the grade should not be given. It appeals to sympathy rather than addressing whether the grade accurately reflects the student's performance.

### Conclusion:
The argument "You can’t give me a C. I’ll lose my scholarship." falls under the category of **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)** because the given reason appeals to the consequence and does not conclusively establish that a C grade should not be awarded based on academic performance.
