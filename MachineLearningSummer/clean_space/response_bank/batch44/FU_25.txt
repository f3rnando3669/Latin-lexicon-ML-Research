For 
To apply IDAA to the string "Lahat nakamove-on na ikaw na lang hindi pa. #MarcosIsAHero", we'll decompose the task of classifying the string as one of the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP> into specific steps.

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**  
   We need to determine the exact assertion being made in the string:
   - The key proposition here is: "#MarcosIsAHero".

2. **Understand the Reasoning (R):**  
   Look for the causal basis or the reason given to support the proposition:
   - The reasoning given is: "Lahat nakamove-on na ikaw na lang hindi pa."
   - Translation: "Everyone has moved on, only you haven't."

3. **Check for Proof of Reason (PR):**  
   Identify any additional arguments or evidence provided to support the reasoning:
   - The statement does not provide additional arguments or evidence beyond the reasoning given.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:**

   **A. Generalization (<G>):**
   - Is the assertion based on one or a few instances and applied broadly? 
   - No, the argument isn't generalized from a few examples to a broad conclusion.

   **B. Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Does it claim to have considered all possibilities but miss some?
   - No, the statement isn't about enumerating all possible cases.

   **C. Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Does the reason fail to conclusively establish the correctness of the proposition?
   - Potentially, but let's check other categories first.

   **D. Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - Does the reasoning repeat the proposition without adding any new information?
   - No, the reasoning adds new information.

   **E. Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Is the causal basis provided weak or not compelling?
   - Yes, the idea that everyone moving on implies Marcos is a hero is a weak causal relationship.

   **F. Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - Is there an assumption that something is true because it is universally agreed upon?
   - Yes, it assumes that because "everyone has moved on," the issue should no longer be debated, implying Marcos is a hero based on presumed consensus.

   **G. Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - Is the language used in a way that can be interpreted in different ways?
   - No, the language isn't particularly ambiguous.

Given these steps, the string "Lahat nakamove-on na ikaw na lang hindi pa. #MarcosIsAHero" predominantly falls under the category of **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: It assumes that because it is claimed that "everyone has moved on," the proposition that Marcos is a hero should be accepted without further question.
