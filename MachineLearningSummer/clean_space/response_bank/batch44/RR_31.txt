To apply the decomposition of the task of identifying the argument type, we need to follow specific steps. Here, I'll break down the process step by step:

1. **Understand the Proposition (P):**
   - Identify the main statement or claim being made.
   - In this case: “Sophia Lloyd is the best-liked CEO in our company's history.”

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Determine the reason given to support the Proposition.
   - In this case: “Thanks to her enduring popularity with employees.”

3. **Type of Argument Identification:**
   - Analyze if the given reason appropriately supports the proposition.
   - Check if the reasoning used exhibits a particular defective argument type.

4. **Compare to Known Defective Argument Types:**
   - Review the list of defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP) to find a match.

Let's proceed step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Proposition (P)

The proposition is "Sophia Lloyd is the best-liked CEO in our company's history."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)

The reason given is "Thanks to her enduring popularity with employees."

### Step 3: Type of Argument Identification

Determine if the given reason appropriately supports the proposition. In this case, the reason given is indicating Sophia's popularity, which is used to conclude that she is the best-liked CEO.

### Step 4: Compare to Known Defective Argument Types

Let's compare this structure to our list of defective argument types:

- **Generalization (G):** Not applicable as it doesn't generalize from a few cases to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable as it doesn’t presume only two choices or alternatives.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Might be worth exploring as the reason might be non-conclusive.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Seems most likely, as the reason (popularity with employees) essentially restates the proposition (best-liked CEO).
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Also a candidate, as it presumes causation from popularity to being "best-liked."
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Not applicable as it doesn’t appeal to popularity directly as validation.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Not applicable as there's no ambiguous language used.

After evaluating, it fits best with:
**Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** - because the reason essentially repeats the proposition by restating that her popularity (best-liked) makes her the best-liked.

### Final Identification

The argument type is:

**<RR> - Faulty Repetition of Proposition**

**Conclusion:**

"Sophia Lloyd is the best-liked CEO in our company's history because of her enduring popularity with employees," is classified as a <RR> argument type: Faulty Repetition of Proposition.
