For 
To apply **<IDAA>** to the statement **"Michael Jackson, Kurt Cobain, and Jimi Hendrix were rock stars who died young. Therefore, if you become a rock star, don’t expect to live a long life."**, we will break down the task **<IDA>** (classifying the argument type) into specific steps (**<D>**). Here’s the decomposition and steps to follow:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (**<D>**):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine what is being asserted or proposed.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine what evidence or rationale is given to support the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Determine any additional arguments or evidence presented that corroborate the reason.
4. **Classify the Argument**: Based on the identified elements, determine which type of defective argument it is (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Applying **<D>** to our **<IDA>** task:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - The proposition is: "if you become a rock star, don’t expect to live a long life."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - The reason given is the example of Michael Jackson, Kurt Cobain, and Jimi Hendrix, who "were rock stars who died young."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - There is no additional evidence beyond the examples of these specific rock stars. The argument relies solely on these examples to prove the reason.

4. **Classify the Argument**:
   - The argument asserts a general conclusion based on specific examples of a few individuals. This suggests it might involve a logical fallacy related to over-generalization or insufficient reasoning.

### Classification:
- **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument takes a small, specific set of examples (rock stars who died young) and applies it to all cases (if you become a rock star, you won't live long). It makes a broad assertion based on limited evidence.

### Final Classification: **<G>**

The statement **"Michael Jackson, Kurt Cobain, and Jimi Hendrix were rock stars who died young. Therefore, if you become a rock star, don’t expect to live a long life."** is of type **<G>** (Generalization). 

This classification is based on identifying that the argument improperly generalizes from a few individual cases to all members of a category without sufficient evidence to support such a broad conclusion.
