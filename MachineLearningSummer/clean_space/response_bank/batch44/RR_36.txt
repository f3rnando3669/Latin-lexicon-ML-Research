For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "I shouldn't have flunked the test because I never get F's" is an example of, we must first decompose the advanced task of classifying the argument into specific steps. Here's the decomposition (<D>):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Determine the main assertion or claim put forth in the statement.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Identify the causal basis or reason provided to support the proposition.
3. **Identify the Defective Argument Type (if applicable):** Check if there is any logical fallacy present based on the defective argument types defined.
4. **Classify the Argument:** Based on the identified fallacy, classify the statement into one of the defective argument types defined.

Now, apply these steps to the statement "I shouldn't have flunked the test because I never get F's":

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- **Proposition (<P>):** "I shouldn't have flunked the test."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- **Reason (<R>):** "I never get F's."

### Step 3: Identify the Defective Argument Type
- **Analysis:** The reason provided ("I never get F's") is essentially repeating the proposition in a different form. It does not provide a new or valid causal basis for why the claim in the proposition should be accepted. Instead, the reason merely restates the proposition by implying a general rule from the claimed exception.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
- **Defective Argument Type:** This matches the pattern of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)** where the reason given does not add any substantive support but merely restates the proposition.

### Conclusion:
The statement "I shouldn't have flunked the test because I never get F's" is an example of Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>).
