For 
Let's apply the steps of <IDAA> to identify the fallacy type in the statement "Tyler's friends are all obnoxious, he's a bad kid."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the components of the statement:**
   - **Assertion about friends**: "Tyler's friends are all obnoxious."
   - **Conclusion about Tyler**: "he's a bad kid."

2. **Assess the logic used to connect the components:**
   - The statement draws a conclusion about Tyler based on his association with his friends.

3. **Identify the potential categories of fallacies:**
   - **<G> Generalization**: Drawing a broad conclusion from a specific set of cases.
   - **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: Assuming only two possibilities when there might be more.
   - **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
   - **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: Circular reasoning by restating the proposition as the reason.
   - **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: Assuming a causal relationship without sufficient evidence.
   - **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: Assuming something is true because many people believe it.
   - **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: Using an ambiguous term in a misleading way.

4. **Determine the type based on the logic used:**
   - The reasoning connects Tyler's character to the behavior of his friends.
   - This is an assumption that Tyler must be bad simply because his friends are obnoxious.
   - This follows a pattern of judging someone based on their associations rather than specific evidence about the person themselves.

5. **Classify the fallacy based on the identified logic pattern:**
   - The statement uses the fallacy of Generalization (<G>) as it generalizes Tylerâ€™s character based on his association with his friends ("guilt by association").

### Conclusion:
The statement "Tyler's friends are all obnoxious, he's a bad kid," uses the fallacy of **Generalization** (<G>).

In this step-by-step breakdown, we applied <D> to <IDA> methodically to classify the given string accurately.
