To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the logical fallacy in "Which type of logical fallacy is used when a writer incorrectly states that one event has caused another?", we'll break down this advanced task into specific steps and perform each step.

**Step 1: Understand the Task Context and the Question**
Read and interpret the given question to understand the task of classifying a specific type of logical fallacy.

**Step 2: Identify Key Elements in the Question**
Extract the essential elements needed for classification:
- A writer
- Incorrectly states
- One event has caused another

**Step 3: Reference Definitions of Known Defective Arguments**
Recall the definitions of the known defective arguments:
- <G> Generalization
- <FE> Incomplete Enumeration
- <IR> Inconclusive Reason
- <RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition
- <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis
- <FU> Presumptuous Consensus
- <DEP> Ambiguous Language Use

**Step 4: Match the Key Elements to the Definitions**
Compare the key elements with each known defective argument to find the match.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: This argument type is characterized by asserting a causal relationship between two events where the causal basis is not compelling or insufficient.

**Step 5: Confirm the Classification**
Verify that the matching defective argument, <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis, precisely corresponds to the given scenario where a writer incorrectly states that one event has caused another.

**Output the Classified Type**

The type of logical fallacy used when a writer incorrectly states that one event has caused another is:

**<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**.
