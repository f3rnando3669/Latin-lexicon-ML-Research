For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as a specific type of defective argument), we need to break down the task into specific steps. We will examine the given string and classify it according to the types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>:

1. **Identify the Propositions and Arguments:**
   - **Proposition (P):** "Don't use iPhones."
   - **Reason (R):** "Teachers use iPhones and teachers are extremely dorky."
   - **Proof of Reason (PR):** "If you use an iPhone, you will be dorky like a teacher."

2. **Break down the reasoning to classify the argument:**
   - The argument is suggesting that one should not use iPhones because teachers use them, and teachers are labeled as dorky.

3. **Determine if there are any logical fallacies or defects in the argument:**
   - **Generalization:** This argument generalizes teachers as "dorky" and conflates using an iPhone with becoming dorky due to association with teachers.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration:** This argument presents only two possibilities: using an iPhone will make one dorky, ignoring other reasons people might use or not use iPhones.
   - **Inconclusive Reason:** The reasoning that using an iPhone makes someone dorky because teachers use them, and teachers are dorky, is not a strong causal basis.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** The argument restates the initial proposition (not using iPhones) without providing additional solid grounds.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis:** The supposed cause (using an iPhone) and the effect (becoming dorky like teachers) lack a compelling, rational connection.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus:** There is an assumption that the reader will agree with the negative stereotype of teachers.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use:** The term "dorky" could be interpreted in various subjective ways, leading to an ambiguous understanding.

4. **Classify the Argument:**
   Based on the analysis, the most fitting classifications are:

   - **<G> Generalization:** The argument generalizes teachers as dorky and transfers that label to those who use iPhones.
   - **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate that using an iPhone will make someone dorky.
   - **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** The argument fails to present a compelling causal basis connecting iPhone use with being dorky.
   - **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:** The term "dorky" is used ambiguously without a clear, universally accepted definition.

Therefore, the given string "Don't use iPhones. Teachers use iPhones and teachers are extremely dorky. If you use an iPhone, you will be dorky like a teacher!" is primarily classified as follows:

- <G> Generalization
- <IR> Inconclusive Reason
- <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis
- <DEP> Ambiguous Language Use
