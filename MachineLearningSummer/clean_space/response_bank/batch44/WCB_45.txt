To apply the process of <IDAA> to the task of classifying the statement "Water fluoridation affects the brain. Citywide, student’s test scores began to drop five months after fluoridation began," we will decompose the task into specific steps and address each step sequentially. Here is the detailed breakdown:

1. **Comprehend the Statement**:
    - Analyze the given statement to understand what it is saying.
    - **Statement**: "Water fluoridation affects the brain. Citywide, students’ test scores began to drop five months after fluoridation began."

2. **Identify the Main Proposition (<P>)**:
    - Determine the main claim or proposition in the argument.
    - **Main Proposition (<P>)**: "Water fluoridation affects the brain."

3. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
    - Identify the reason given to support the main proposition.
    - **Reason (<R>)**: "Citywide, student’s test scores began to drop five months after fluoridation began."

4. **Analyze the Reason in relation to the Proposition (<PR>)**:
    - Check if the reason provided directly supports the proposition and whether it does so effectively.
    - Does the drop in test scores conclusively demonstrate that water fluoridation affects the brain?

5. **Match the Argument to One of the Defective Argument Types**:
    - Compare the argument’s structure to the definitions provided for the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP> to find the best fit.
    - Here, how does the drop in test scores causally connect to water fluoridation affecting the brain? Is there a logical fallacy in assuming the drop in test scores is a direct result of water fluoridation without ruling out other factors?

6. **Determine the Defective Argument Type**:
    - Based on the comparative analysis, the argument type that fits this pattern is <WCB> due to the weak causal link presented: "insufficient causal basis."
    - **Classification Type (<WCB>)**: The argument provides insufficient causal basis because a correlation between water fluoridation and a drop in test scores doesn't necessarily prove causation. Other factors could explain this drop.

### Conclusion:

**Classified Type**: `<WCB>` (Insufficient Causal Basis)

By breaking down the task into specific steps to analyze and interpret the statement, we concluded that it fits the defective argument type <WCB> due to an insufficient or weak causal basis between water fluoridation and the decline in student test scores.
