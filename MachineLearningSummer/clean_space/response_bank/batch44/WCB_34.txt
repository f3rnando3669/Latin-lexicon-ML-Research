For 
Certainly! To apply <IDAA> to classify the string "Fatima sneezed and she caused a tsunami in Tokyo," let's follow a systematic decomposition into specific steps.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for Classifying <s>:

1. **Identify the Assertion and Reasoning**: 
   - Examine the proposition made (what is being claimed).
   - Identify any reasoning provided or implied that supports the proposition.
   
2. **Evaluate the Argument Type Based on Reasoning**:
   - Compare the reasoning style used to the definitions of defective argument types.
   
3. **Determine Defective Argument Type**:
   - Generalization <G>
   - Incomplete Enumeration <FE>
   - Inconclusive Reason <IR>
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>
   - Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>
   - Presumptuous Consensus <FU>
   - Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>

4. **Apply Definitions**:
   - Apply the exact definitions of each defective argument type to the reasoning present in the proposition.

### Applying the Steps to the Given Statement:

1. **Identify the Assertion and Reasoning**:
   - **Assertion**: "Fatima sneezed and she caused a tsunami in Tokyo."
   - **Reasoning**: The assertion implies a direct cause-and-effect relationship between Fatima sneezing and a tsunami occurring in Tokyo.

2. **Evaluate the Argument Type Based on Reasoning**:
   - Determine if the reasoning is sufficient, logical, or falls into any known fallacy/defective argument type.

3. **Determine Defective Argument Type**:
   - This reasoning implies a causal relationship that seems highly implausible and lacks reasonable justification.

4. **Apply Definitions**:
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: As per definition, when the causal basis for <P> is weak or not compelling enough, it falls under <WCB>. 
   
     The statement "Fatima sneezed and she caused a tsunami in Tokyo" does not provide a reasonable or logical connection between the sneeze (cause) and the occurrence of a tsunami (effect). Therefore, it fits under the definition of **Insufficient Causal Basis**.

### Conclusion:
The string "Fatima sneezed and she caused a tsunami in Tokyo" is classified as of type **<WCB>** (Insufficient Causal Basis).

By breaking down the process to identify how the reasoning was flawed and comparing it to the given definitions, we determine that the causal claim is insufficiently substantiated, which matches the characteristics of an insufficient causal basis argument.

So, classifying it using <IDAA> yields:
```plaintext
<s> is of type <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)
```
