For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the string "President Petutti ordered a military strike that killed many civilians. He is no different than any other mass murder and he belongs in prison!", follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify Potential Argument Types
Examine the statement to identify features that may indicate it falls into one or more of the defined defective argument types. The focus will be on specific components that can classify it as <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step 2: Analyze the Proposition (<P>)
Determine the main proposition or claim made in the statement. In this case, the proposition is:
- President Petutti is no different than any other mass murderer and belongs in prison.

### Step 3: Examine the Reason (<R>)
Identify the reason given to support the proposition. Here:
- The reason is that President Petutti ordered a military strike that killed many civilians.

### Step 4: Assess the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
Check if the statement provides any additional arguments or evidence corroborating the reason. In this statement, no additional arguments are explicitly provided; the reason directly supports the proposition.

### Step 5: Evaluate for Argument Types
Now, classify the statement according to the defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The statement compares President Petutti's actions (a military strike) to those of mass murderers. A generalization might be applied if it assumes all military actions causing civilian casualties equate to mass murder.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - This would involve presenting choices without considering other possibilities. This argument doesn’t seem to fit <FE> directly.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - Evaluate if the reason provided (military strike resulting in civilian deaths) adequately backs up the proposition (mass murder and imprisonment). While strong emotion is present, the causality and context may be weak or not directly comparable to "mass murder" as a legal or moral context.
4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - There's no cyclical repetition where the reason is identical to the proposition.
5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - The argument might have an insufficient causal basis if saying a military strike causing civilian deaths directly equates to mass murder without considering context, intention, legal frameworks, etc.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - The claim doesn't rely on supposed universal agreement, so it doesn’t fit <FU>.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
   - This isn't majorly about ambiguous language but rather about moral equivalence.

### Step 6: Conclude the Classification
Based on the analysis steps above, the argument has characteristics most aligned with both <G> (Generalization) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):

- **Generalization (<G>)**: Equating a specific military strike with mass murder generalized all instances of causing civilian casualties to being mass murder.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Claims casualty directly means mass murder without full context.

Thus, the statement "President Petutti ordered a military strike that killed many civilians. He is no different than any other mass murder and he belongs in prison!" can be classified as a combination of **<G> (Generalization)** and **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.

### Conclusion
By decomposing the task of classifying the statement step by step, we derive that the statement primarily exhibits both **Generalization (<G>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** as the defective argument types.
