Sure, let's break down the task of classifying this argument as requested.

**Step 1: Identify the general structure of the argument.**
- The sentence provided is: "If I tell my teacher I have done my homework, but I have only done part of it, I am using"

**Step 2: Understand the meaning and the claim being made.**
- The speaker claims that by stating that they have done their homework, but in reality only completing a part of it, they are using some form of reasoning.

**Step 3: Analyze the types of reasoning we have defined.**

Let's go through each one to see if it matches:

1. **<G> (Generalization):** 
   - Generalization involves asserting something about all items based on some of them. This doesn't apply here since the statement is about a specific instance of doing homework.

2. **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):**
   - This involves claiming to have made a complete enumeration of possibilities but missing some. The homework statement doesn't involve potential options or outcomes but rather an action versus a claimed action.

3. **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):**
   - This involves a Reason not conclusively demonstrating the correctness of the Proposition. This doesn't quite match because the statement isn't about attempting to prove something conclusively; it's about the disparity between what is claimed and what is true.

4. **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):**
   - This involves circular reasoning, where the Reason just repeats the Proposition. The provided statement isn’t circular either; it’s more about a misleading statement.

5. **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):**
   - This would involve a weak causal link between events. The statement isn't trying to establish a cause-and-effect relationship.

6. **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):**
   - This relies on what others believe or do. There is no appeal to popular belief or consensus in the statement about homework.

7. **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):**
   - This involves using a word or phrase that can be taken in multiple ways. The statement about doing homework but meaning only part of it can be seen as misleading or using ambiguous terminology regarding what "done" means.

**Step 4: Determine the most appropriate classification.**
- From our analysis, it looks like the argument fits best with **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**. The ambiguity here is in the statement "I have done my homework," which technically is misleading because the entire homework wasn't completed.

**Step 5: Formulate the conclusion.**
- Therefore, the given statement "If I tell my teacher I have done my homework, but I have only done part of it, I am using" should be classified as using **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**.
