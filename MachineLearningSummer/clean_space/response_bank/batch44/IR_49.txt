For 
To apply IDAA to the argument "A real video game would include set goals," we need to classify the argument type by decomposing the task into specific steps. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Understand the Argument
- Identify the assertion being made: "A real video game would include set goals."
- Identify the context and any implied meanings: The statement seems to imply that in order for a video game to be considered "real," it must have set goals.

### Step 2: Identify Key Components
- Proposition (P): "A real video game would include set goals."
- Reason (R), if any: Not explicitly stated in the argument; it appears as a definitive statement without a presented reason.

### Step 3: Determine the Type of Argument
We now check each defective argument type to see if it fits the given argument:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This type involves making a broad statement based on limited evidence. The statement "A real video game would include set goals" does not provide evidence but asserts a definition, so it is not a generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This defective argument type involves presenting an argument as a complete enumeration when it may not be. The argument provided does not enumerate possibilities but asserts a requirement for being "real."

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This type involves giving a reason that does not conclusively support the proposition. The statement lacks an explicit reason, so it does not fall into this category.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This type involves circular reasoning or repeating the proposition. The statement does not involve circular logic but asserts a definition.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This type involves an unconvincing causal link. The assertion does not involve causality or an explanation of results due to causes.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This type claims something is true based on a consensus. The given statement does not refer to a consensus or popularity.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: This type involves using language that can be interpreted in multiple ways. The term "real" is subjective and can have different interpretations (e.g., real as in authentic, effective, or entertaining).

### Step 4: Match the Argument with the Defective Type

Considering the definitions and examples, the statement "A real video game would include set goals" fits most closely with **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**. The ambiguity lies in the term "real," which can be open to various interpretations by different people. 

### Conclusion

Thus, the argument "A real video game would include set goals" should be classified as type **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**.
