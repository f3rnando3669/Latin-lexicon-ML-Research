To classify the statement "The bigger a child's shoe size, the better the child's handwriting" as one of the specified types of defective arguments (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>), let's break down the task using a structured decomposition approach. This ensures a methodical analysis and accurate classification.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDA (IDAA):

1. **Identify the Key Elements of the Statement**:
    - **Proposition (P)**: The bigger a child's shoe size, the better the child's handwriting.
    - **Reason (R)**: Implicitly, that there is a causal relationship between the two variables: shoe size and handwriting quality.

2. **Analyze the Causal Relationship**:
    - Determine if the causal basis for the proposition is compelling or not.

3. **Match the Analysis to Defective Argument Types**:
    - Check which type of defective argument best describes this relationship.

### Detailed Steps:

#### Step 1: Identify Key Elements of the Statement
- **Proposition (P)**: "The bigger a child's shoe size, the better the child's handwriting."
- **Implicit Reason (R)**: There is a causal relationship between shoe size and handwriting quality.

#### Step 2: Analyze the Causal Relationship
- **Causal Analysis**: Does shoe size logically affect handwriting quality? Upon examination, it appears unlikely as these two factors don't have an obvious or scientifically supported causal link.

#### Step 3: Match the Analysis to Defective Argument Types
- **Generalization (<G>)**: This doesn't involve generalizing from a few examples or individuals to the whole population.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This doesn't provide an either/or situation missing pertinent possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This implies that the specified reason does not conclusively prove the proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The argument does not simply repeat the proposition without providing additional information.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This relates to arguments that lack a compelling causal connection.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This argument does not claim to be true because everyone agrees with it.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: There is no ambiguous language use here to mislead the audience.

Based on the analysis, the argument suggests a cause (shoe size) that does not plausibly lead to the effect (better handwriting). This fits best under the category of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:

### Classification:
```plaintext
<WCB>
```

**Conclusion:**
- The statement "The bigger a child's shoe size, the better the child's handwriting" is classified as a defective argument of type **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because it proposes a relationship between two variables (shoe size and handwriting quality) without a compelling causal basis to support this claim.
