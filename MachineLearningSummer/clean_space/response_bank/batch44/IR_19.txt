To classify the statement "We haven’t found the ruins of Troy, so the city of Troy didn’t really exist," we can follow specific steps to determine which type of defective argument it represents.

### Step 1: Identify Key Components
First, isolate the key components and the structure of the statement:
- Proposition (P): "We haven’t found the ruins of Troy"
- Conclusion (C): "the city of Troy didn’t really exist"

### Step 2: Analyze the Reasoning
Evaluate the reasoning behind the statement:
- The statement implies that the lack of ruins is the basis for claiming that the city didn’t exist.

### Step 3: Identify Potential Defective Argument Types
Consider the types defined:
- **Generalization (G)**: Making a broad conclusion based on limited evidence.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Presenting a limited set of options as the only ones.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Using weak or irrelevant reasons.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reasoning repeats or rephrases the proposition without providing new evidence.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: A weak causal connection between evidence and conclusion.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assuming widespread agreement as proof.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Misleading use of language.

### Step 4: Determine the Specific Argument Type
Based on the analysis, determine which category the statement falls into:
- The statement relies on the absence of evidence to conclude that something didn’t exist. This indicates a lack of sufficient basis for making such a conclusion.
- The reasoning does not establish a direct causal connection but rather jumps from "absence of evidence" to "evidence of absence," which is not logically valid.

Thus, this defective argument fits the type **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

### Step 5: Classify the Statement
Classify the statement by identifying its type:
- "We haven’t found the ruins of Troy, so the city of Troy didn’t really exist" is an example of an **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because it incorrectly concludes non-existence based on the lack of archaeological findings.

### Final Classification
- **Type**: Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)

By following these steps systematically, we analyzed and classified the statement under the appropriate defective argument type.
