For 
To apply <IDAA> to "You either are for us or you are all against", we need to break down the task (<IDA>) into specific steps (<D>) and classify the argument type.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):** Determine the main statement or assertion being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (R):** Determine the basis or rationale provided to support the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):** Determine if there are additional arguments or evidence provided to support the reason.
4. **Recognize Defective Argument Types and Patterns:**
    - **Generalization (<G>):** Look for over-generalizing statements.
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Look for arguments falsely claiming to present all the options when there are more.
    - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Check if the reason provided is not convincing.
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Check if the reason is just a restatement of the proposition.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Check if the causal relationship presented is weak.
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Look for arguments assuming consensus or popularity as proof.
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Look for language or terms being used in an ambiguous or misleading way.
5. **Classify the Argument Type:** Based on the identified pattern, classify the argument into one of the defective argument types.

### Application of <IDAA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Proposition: "You either are for us or you are all against."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Reason: Implied binary choice suggesting no middle ground or alternatives.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - There is no additional proof or detailed argumentation provided. The statement stands on the assertion alone.

4. **Recognize Defective Argument Types and Patterns:**
    - **Generalization (<G>):** Not applicable here.
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The statement presents only two extreme options (for or against) with no room for neutrality or alternative positions. This fits the pattern of missing out on pertinent alternatives.
    - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Not applicable since the reason is not more elaborate than presenting a binary choice.
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Not applicable. The reason isn't simply a restatement of the proposition.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Not applicable, as causality is not the focus.
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Not applicable here.
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** There is no misleading ambiguity in terminology.

5. **Classify the Argument Type:**
   - The argument type is **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**, because it presents a false dilemma by suggesting there are only two possible stances, missing out on other logical possibilities or alternatives.

### Conclusion

The classification of the argument "You either are for us or you are all against" is identified as **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**.
