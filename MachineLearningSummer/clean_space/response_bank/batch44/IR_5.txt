For 
To apply **\[IDAA\]**, we need to decompose the classification task **\[IDA\]** into specific steps and then systematically apply those steps to classify the provided argument "Your mom thinks you spend too much time playing video games. You bring up that she spends too much time shopping."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Step 1: Identify the Argument**
   - Read the argument carefully.
   - Identify the main proposition (<P>) and the reason (<R>).

2. **Step 2: Analyze the Structure of the Argument**
   - Evaluate the logical connection between the proposition and the reason.
   - Determine if the argument presented follows a logical structure.

3. **Step 3: Identify the Type of Defective Argument**
   - Check for common fallacies such as Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

4. **Step 4: Classify the Argument**
   - Based on the evaluation, classify the argument into one of the specified defective argument types.

### Applying the Steps

#### Step 1: Identify the Argument

- The argument consists of two main parts:
  - **Proposition (<P>)**: "Your mom thinks you spend too much time playing video games."
  - **Reason (<R>)**: "You bring up that she spends too much time shopping."

#### Step 2: Analyze the Structure of the Argument

- The structure of the argument suggests a comparison or a counter-argument. 
- Here, the person is responding to a criticism about their behavior (playing video games) by pointing out a similar behavior in their critic (too much shopping by the mom).

#### Step 3: Identify the Type of Defective Argument

- The argument does not directly address the criticism (spending too much time playing video games). Instead, it deflects it by attacking the critic's behavior.
- This type of argument focuses on the person rather than the issue at hand. This suggests it might be an **ad hominem tu quoque** fallacy.

#### Step 4: Classify the Argument

- The argument is an **ad hominem tu quoque** fallacy because it avoids addressing the original criticism and instead attacks the accuser's behavior as equally flawed. This aligns with the defective argument type **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**.
  
**Classification**: **<IR>**

By following the step-by-step decomposition and applying it to the given argument, we classify it as **<IR>**: **Inconclusive Reason**. The reason given does not logically address the proposition but rather deflects the argument onto the accuser's similar behavior.
