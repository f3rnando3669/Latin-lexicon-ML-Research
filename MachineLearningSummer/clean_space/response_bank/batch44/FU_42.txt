For 
To classify the statement "Four legs good, two legs bad" using the defined methodology, we need to follow specific steps to identify the type of defective argument it represents. Here is the step-by-step decomposition for this advanced task:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition in the statement "Four legs good, two legs bad" is an assertion that having four legs is inherently good and having two legs is inherently bad.

### Step 2: Examine the Reason (<R>)
In this case, the statement does not present an explicit reason (e.g., why four legs are good or two legs are bad). This lack of a clear reason can imply a categorical assumption without supporting evidence.

### Step 3: Check for a Proof of Reason (<PR>)
There is no explicit proof of reason provided. The statement simply states a conclusion without supporting arguments or evidence.

### Step 4: Compare with Defined Types of Defective Arguments
Based on our definitions and the characteristics of the statement, match the statement to the closest defective argument type:
- **Generalization (<G>), e.g., hasty generalization or overgeneralization**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**

### Step 5: Determine the Type of Defective Argument
The statement "Four legs good, two legs bad" seems to arbitrarily classify an entire group of beings (those with four legs) as good and another group (those with two legs) as bad without providing sufficient causal basis or evidence. It is a form of:
- **Generalization (<G>)** because it takes one characteristic (number of legs) and applies an absolute value judgment to all members of each group.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** might also be considered because it doesn’t consider other possible reasons or categories for goodness or badness beyond the number of legs.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** also applies since there's no rational basis or logical conclusion provided.

### Step 6: Conclude for Most Fitting Type
Upon closer consideration, "Four legs good, two legs bad" fits best with **Generalization (<G>)**, since it categorizes based on a single trait without considering exceptions or other relevant factors.

### Application of <IDAA> to "Four legs good, two legs bad"

1. **Proposition (<P>):** "Four legs good, two legs bad."
2. **Reason (<R>):** Not Explicitly Stated.
3. **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** None Provided.
4. **Comparison to Defined Types:**
   - Fits **Generalization (<G>)** due to unwarranted broad categorization.

Thus, the statement "Four legs good, two legs bad" is classified as <G> — Generalization.
