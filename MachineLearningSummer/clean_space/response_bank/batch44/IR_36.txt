For 
To apply <IDAA> to "What did you use to wipe your fingerprints from the gun?", we need to decompose the task of classifying the string into specific steps.

### Decomposition of <IDA>:

1. **Understand the Argument Context**:
   - Identify and understand the context of the argument presented in the string.

2. **Break Down the Argument**:
   - Dissect the argument to understand its components (Proposition <P>, Reason <R>, Proof of Reason <PR>).

3. **Identify Argument Type**:
   - Categorize the argument type based on the definition provided (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>).

4. **Classify the Argument**:
   - Use the characteristics of each argument type to classify the given string.

### Application of Decomposition to the Given String:

#### Step 1: Understand the Argument Context
The statement "What did you use to wipe your fingerprints from the gun?" implies a scenario where someone is being asked about their actions to remove their fingerprints, presumably in relation to a crime. This context hints at a legal or investigative setting.

#### Step 2: Break Down the Argument
- **Proposition <P>**: The implied proposition is that the person being asked may have wiped their fingerprints from the gun.
- **Reason <R>**: The question presupposes the act of wiping fingerprints, thus indirectly suggesting guilt or involvement.
- **Proof of Reason <PR>**: There is no explicit proof provided, but the structure of the question assumes that the act took place.

#### Step 3: Identify Argument Type 

Based on the context and the structure:
- The question implies a presumed consensus or a known action (wiping fingerprints) without direct evidence (<PR>).
- It indirectly suggests blame or wrongdoing by assuming the act of wiping fingerprints occurred.

#### Step 4: Classify the Argument

This falls under the category of **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)** because:
- The question uses an ambiguous construction, implying guilt through the act of asking what tool was used to wipe the fingerprints without establishing whether fingerprints were actually wiped.
- The ambiguity lies in presuming an action (wiping) as fact without presenting any direct evidence or confirmation that the action occurred. 

Thus, we can classify the string "What did you use to wipe your fingerprints from the gun?" as of type **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**.
