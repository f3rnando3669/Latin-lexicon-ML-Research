For 
To apply the IDAA (IDentify Argument Analysis Approach) to the statement "My grandmother smoked for 80 years and died at 100. Obviously, smoking isn’t harmful.", we'll follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The proposition in this statement is:
- "Smoking isn’t harmful."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason provided to support the proposition is:
- "My grandmother smoked for 80 years and died at 100."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason, if any (PR)
There isn't an elaborate proof of the reason provided other than the anecdotal evidence of the grandmother's long life despite smoking.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type
To classify the argument, we need to evaluate which category of defective argument it fits into based on our definitions:

- **Generalization (G)**: Assumes a general conclusion based on a specific or limited set of examples.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Claims a complete enumeration of possibilities but actually misses some.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason simply restates the proposition without providing additional support.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The reasoning relies on an insufficient causal basis to support the conclusion.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assumes the proposition is true because it is widely accepted.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The proof of reason can be taken in another sense than intended.

### Step 5: Analyze the Reason and Classify the Argument
Analyzing the reason:
- The statement relies on a personal anecdote of the grandmother's experience to generalize that smoking is harmless.
- This reasoning uses anecdotal evidence from one individual to make a broad claim about the effects of smoking.

Thus, the type of defective argument is:
- **Generalization (G)**: Because it makes a sweeping generalization based on a single instance.

### Final Classification
The statement "My grandmother smoked for 80 years and died at 100. Obviously, smoking isn’t harmful." is of type **G** (Generalization).
