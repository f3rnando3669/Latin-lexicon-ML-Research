For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying the given string "I go to my front porch every morning and yell, 'May no tigers enter this house!' and for 20 years, not a single tiger has entered my house. My tiger prevention strategy clearly works." as of type <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>) to the given string, we will break down the task into specific steps and proceed accordingly:

**Step 1: Understand the Given String**
- Read and comprehend the statement: "I go to my front porch every morning and yell, 'May no tigers enter this house!' and for 20 years, not a single tiger has entered my house. My tiger prevention strategy clearly works."

**Step 2: Identify Potential Defective Arguments**
- Recognize and recall the definitions of the defective arguments <G> (Generalization), <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration), <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis), <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus), and <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use).

**Step 3: Analyze the Structure and Content of the Argument**
- Determine if the statement contains an argument.
- Identify the components of the argument:
  - **Proposition (P)**: My tiger prevention strategy works.
  - **Reason (R)**: I go to my front porch every morning and perform an action (yelling), and for 20 years, no tigers have entered my house.

**Step 4: Compare with Definitions of Defective Argument Types**
- **Generalization (<G>)**: Not applicable, as the statement is not generalizing from a sample to a larger population.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not applicable, as it does not present a limited set of options as the only possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Not applicable, as the reason here is conclusive within the context of the argument, even if fallacious.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Not applicable, as the argument is not merely repeating the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument does assert a causal relationship (yelling prevents tigers), but does it provide a compelling causal basis?
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Not applicable, as the argument does not rely on universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Not applicable, as the argument does not involve ambiguity in terms of language.

**Step 5: Determine the Type of Defective Argument**
Given the evidence and steps above, the argument fits into the type where the causal connection between the action (yelling on the porch) and the outcome (no tigers entering the house) is weak or non-compelling.

Therefore, the correct classification is:

**Classification: <WCB> - Insufficient Causal Basis**

**Conclusion:**
The argument "I go to my front porch every morning and yell, 'May no tigers enter this house!' and for 20 years, not a single tiger has entered my house. My tiger prevention strategy clearly works." commits the logical fallacy of Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>) as it assumes a causal relationship between two unrelated events.
