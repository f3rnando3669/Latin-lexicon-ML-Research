Sure, let's decompose the task of classifying the given string "You should drive on the right side of the road because that is what the law says, and the law is the law." according to the steps for identifying defective argument types.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - "You should drive on the right side of the road."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - "because that is what the law says"

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - "and the law is the law"

4. **Determine if the argument exhibits any of the known defective argument types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** The statement does not make broad claims based on limited evidence.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The statement isn't offering a false dichotomy or incomplete set of choices.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The statement does provide a reason, but it should be examined further.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The proof of reason repeats the proposition without adding new evidence or explanation.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The reason doesn't involve a weak causal basis but simply refers to the authority of the law without further elaboration.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The statement doesn't rely on the presumed consensus of others.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The language in the statement is clear and unambiguous.

Based on the identification:
- The string does not fall under <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.
- The argument provided in the string, "You should drive on the right side of the road because that is what the law says, and the law is the law," demonstrates **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)** since it uses circular reasoning by restating the proposition as its own proof.

**Conclusion:**
The classification of the string "You should drive on the right side of the road because that is what the law says, and the law is the law." is <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
