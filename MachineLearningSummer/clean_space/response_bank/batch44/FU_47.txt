For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the string "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. You can't give me a ticket for doing what every other driver on the road was also doing." let's follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Task and Identify the Core Propositions
1. **Task Understanding**: The given task is to classify the argument as one of the specified defective argument types.
2. **Identify Core Propositions**:
   - **Proposition (P)**: "You can't give me a ticket."
   - **Reason (R)**: "I was only driving as fast as everyone around me."
   - **Proof of Reason (PR)**: Implicit assumption that because everyone else was driving the same speed, it justifies the action.

### Step 2: Compare with Definitions of Defective Argument Types
We need to compare the argument with definitions of each defective argument type to find the best match.

1. **Generalization (G)**: 
   - In this argument, the speaker is not applying a specific case to a broad generalization. **Not a Generalization.**

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - The argument is not claiming that there are only two possibilities or missing pertinent ones. **Not Incomplete Enumeration.**

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The argument could be considered in terms of whether the reason provided conclusively establishes the claim, but this is not primarily about moving goalposts or a weak argument. **Partially Inconclusive Reason, but not primarily.**

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - The argument does not simply repeat the proposition. **Not Faulty Repetition.**

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - The reason doesnâ€™t hinge on a direct causative claim linking an effect misleadingly. **Not Insufficient Causal Basis.**

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - This argument heavily relies on the appeal to what others are doing as a justification for behavior. It implies that since everyone else is doing it, it must be acceptable.
   - This matches most closely with **Presumptuous Consensus**. 

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
   - The argument does not employ ambiguous or equivocal terms that could mislead based on different interpretations. **Not Ambiguous Language Use.**

### Step 3: Classify the Argument
Given the steps above, the argument most closely fits the definition of **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**. It assumes that the behavior being widespread among others justifies the individual's action.

### Conclusion
The string "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. You can't give me a ticket for doing what every other driver on the road was also doing." should be classified as **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.
