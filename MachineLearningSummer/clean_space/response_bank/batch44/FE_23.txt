For 
To apply <IDAA> for classifying the statement "“I didn’t see you at the charity fundraiser today. I guess you are not a good person after all.”", we need to break down the classification process into specific steps. Below are the detailed steps to perform this task:

### Step 1: Identify the Type of Defective Argument
We'll analyze the statement to determine which category of defective argument it falls under: <G> (Generalization), <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration), <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis), <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus), or <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use).

### Step 2: Apply Identification Criteria

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Check if the statement makes an hasty assumption based on limited evidence.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Examine if the statement implies a binary choice when more options exist.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Determine if the reasoning provided fails to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: See if the reason given restates the proposition without providing additional support.
5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Identify if the causal relationship suggested is weak or not compelling.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Look for an appeal to popularity or consensus as a form of validation.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Check for usage of ambiguous language that can be interpreted in multiple ways.

### Step 3: Classify the Statement

1. The statement "“I didn’t see you at the charity fundraiser today. I guess you are not a good person after all.”" makes an assumption based on a lack of attendance at a single event.
2. This does not inherently use ambiguous language, so <DEP> can be ruled out.
3. It doesn’t state everyone believes it, so <FU> can be ruled out.
4. It doesn't restate itself in a circular manner, ruling out <RR>.
5. It’s not providing a binary choice, ruling out <FE>.
6. It doesn't present multiple propositions seeking confirmation, ruling out <IR>.

### Conclusion

From the analysis, the statement makes an assumption about someone's character based exclusively on their absence from one event, which could be classified as a **Generalization (<G>)**. The flawed reasoning lies in assuming that not attending one charity event necessarily implies a person's overall goodness or lack thereof.

### Final Classification

The statement "“I didn’t see you at the charity fundraiser today. I guess you are not a good person after all.”" is classified as **<G> Generalization**.

Thus, the application of <IDAA>—the decomposition of the task into specific steps for classification—leads us to categorize the statement as a Generalization.
