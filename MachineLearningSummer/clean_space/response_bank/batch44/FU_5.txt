For 
To apply the task of classifying the string "Slavery is accepted by just about everyone in our society, so it’s ethical to keep slaves." as one of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>), we'll follow a step-by-step decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (\<P>)**: The main statement or conclusion of the argument.
2. **Identify the Reason (\<R>)**: The rationale or basis provided to support the proposition.
3. **Examine the Proof of Reason (\<PR>)**: Analyze if there's any additional argument/corroboration validating the Reason.
4. **Evaluate the Argument Type**: Classify the argument type based on previously defined types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\<P>)
The proposition is:
"it’s ethical to keep slaves."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\<R>)
The reason provided is:
"Slavery is accepted by just about everyone in our society."

#### Step 3: Examine the Proof of Reason (\<PR>)
There is no additional argument or corroboration provided to validate the reason beyond the generalized claim.

#### Step 4: Evaluate the Argument Type
- **Generalization (\<G>)**: This involves making a broad statement based on limited examples. E.g., "All sports car drivers are too aggressive."
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE>)**: Misses out on pertinent possibilities. E.g., "Vote for Smith or live through four more years of higher taxes."
- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>)**: The reason provided does not conclusively establish the proposition. E.g., "Don't you want the best for your baby?"
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR>)**: Essentially repeating the proposition within the reason. E.g., "This legislation is sinful because it is the wrong thing to do."
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB>)**: Inadequate causal linkage. E.g., "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick."
- **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU>)**: Assuming something is true because "everybody believes it." E.g., "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong."
- **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP>)**: Misleading through ambiguity. E.g., "I want to have myself a merry little Christmas, but I refuse to do as the song suggests and make the yuletide gay."

The argument states that slavery is ethical because it is widely accepted. This fits into the category of **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU>)** because it assumes that because many people accept slavery, it must therefore be ethical.

### Conclusion:
The string "Slavery is accepted by just about everyone in our society, so it’s ethical to keep slaves." is classified as type **\<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**.
