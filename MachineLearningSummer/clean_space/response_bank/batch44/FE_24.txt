For 
To apply **<IDAA>** to the statement "We cannot support immigrants because we have too many homeless and poor Americans.", we'll follow a series of steps to classify the type of defective argument. Hereâ€™s the decomposition of the task **<IDA>**:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (**<D>**) for **<IDA>**:
1. **Identify the Proposition (**<P>**) in the argument**: The assertion or statement that the argument aims to prove.
2. **Identify the Reason (**<R>**) given for the Proposition**: The causal basis given to support the Proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (**<PR>**) provided**: Check any additional supporting arguments for the Reason.
4. **Determine the Logical Fallacy**: Identify which type of defective argument the statement represents (generalization, incomplete enumeration, inconclusive reason, faulty repetition, insufficient causal basis, presumptuous consensus, or ambiguous language use).

### Step-by-Step Execution (**<IDAA>**):
#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- **Proposition (P)**: "We cannot support immigrants."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- **Reason (R)**: "We have too many homeless and poor Americans."

#### Step 3: Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- No additional proof of reason is provided beyond the Reason itself.

#### Step 4: Determine the Logical Fallacy
- The argument asserts that the presence of homeless and poor Americans is a sufficient reason to not support immigrants. However, this reasoning shifts focus from one issue to another without directly addressing the proposition's validity regarding immigrants. This type of argument is characterized by raising one issue to avoid discussing the primary issue.

After evaluating the argument step-by-step, it matches the definition of:

### **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**:
The **Reason (R)** does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the **Proposition (P)**. The argument about homeless and poor Americans does not necessarily provide a conclusive basis to reject support for immigrants, as both issues may not be directly related.

Hence, the statement "We cannot support immigrants because we have too many homeless and poor Americans." is classified as an **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**.
