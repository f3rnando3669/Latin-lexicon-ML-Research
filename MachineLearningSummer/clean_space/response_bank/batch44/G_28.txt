For 
To apply <IDAA> (decomposing the task of classifying the string into specific steps) to the given string "His house is about half the size of most houses in the neighborhood. Therefore, his doors must all be about 3 1/2 feet high", we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Proposition (P)
Identify the main assertion or claim being presented.

In this string, the main assertion (Proposition) is:
- "His doors must all be about 3 1/2 feet high."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
Determine the causal basis or the reason provided for the proposition.

The reason provided is:
- "His house is about half the size of most houses in the neighborhood."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Logical Structure
Determine if the given reason logically supports the proposition. Consider whether the reason is relevant and sufficient to justify the proposition.

### Step 4: Recognize Potential Defective Argument Type
Based on the logical structure, compare it to the definitions of defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) to identify the most fitting category.

### Applying the Steps:

#### Step 1: Proposition
- "His doors must all be about 3 1/2 feet high."

#### Step 2: Reason
- "His house is about half the size of most houses in the neighborhood."

#### Step 3: Evaluate the Logical Structure
- The reason given pertains to the overall size of the house. However, it is making a specific conclusion about the height of the doors without any direct evidence linking the overall size of the house to the height of the doors.

#### Step 4: Recognize Defective Argument Type
- There is an assumption that the smaller overall size of the house correlates directly to the size of specific components like the doors, which isn't necessarily logical or backed by sufficient evidence.

### Classification
Based on the steps:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** is the most fitting defective argument type here as the causal basis provided (the size of the house) is not compelling enough to justify the conclusion (height of doors).

### Final Classification
The string "His house is about half the size of most houses in the neighborhood. Therefore, his doors must all be about 3 1/2 feet high." is classified under the type **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
