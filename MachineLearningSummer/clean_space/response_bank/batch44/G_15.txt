For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given statement, we will decompose the task of classifying the statement as a defective argument type into specific steps:

1. **Identify the proposition (P)**: Determine what the statement intends to prove.
2. **Identify the reason (R)**: Determine the causal basis submitted for the proposition.
3. **Identify the proof of reason (PR)**: Determine if additional arguments are being used to corroborate the reason.
4. **Classify the defective argument type**: Based on the analysis, classify the statement according to one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The statement intends to prove that redefining marriage to include same-sex couples will lead to a complete erasure of boundaries on the definition of marriage, making it a "free-for-all" where any combination of individuals or beings could be considered a marriage.

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason provided is that expanding the definition of marriage to include same-sex couples will set a precedent that eliminates any logical boundary, thereby leading to the acceptance of more extreme and non-traditional forms of marriage, such as polygamy or marrying non-humans.

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
The proof of reason given is an exaggerated slippery slope argument that once the definition of marriage is expanded, it will logically and inevitably lead to further expansions to include increasingly unconventional and socially unacceptable arrangements without any logical limit.

#### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type
The argument type here is based entirely on speculation that once a change occurs, it will lead inevitably to extreme outcomes without providing concrete evidence that these outcomes will occur. This falls into the category of a slippery slope argument, which is a type of defective reasoning. In the given classification schema, this would be classified as:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. The statement assumes that redefining marriage to include same-sex couples will lead to an undefined range of other expansions, but this is not conclusively proven. The argument assumes a chain reaction without sufficient evidence for each step in the causal chain. 

Thus, the given statement is best classified as <IR>.

### Conclusion
By applying <IDAA> step-by-step to the provided statement, we classify it as follows:
```plaintext
There is ... a radical element, a homosexual agenda that wants to redefine what marriage is. They want to say that a marriage not only is one man and one woman but it is two men or it is two women. What logical reason is there to keep us from stopping expansion of that definition to include three people or an adult and a child, or any other odd combination that we want to have?  ... and it does not even have to be limited to human beings by the way. I mean it could be anything. ... There is no reason why we cannot just completely erase whatever boundaries that currently exist on the definition of marriage and say it is a free-for-all, anything goes.
```
is classified as <IR>.
