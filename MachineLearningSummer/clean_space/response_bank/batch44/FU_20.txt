For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "Trying to convince others that everyone is doing it or everyone feels this way so they should too," letâ€™s break down the advanced task of classification into specific steps. Here's the process to identify which type of defective argument it is:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition 

1. **Understand the Definition of Each Defective Argument Type:**
    - **<G> Generalization:** Proposing a statement is true of all members based on one or some members.
    - **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:** Claiming complete enumeration of possibilities while missing pertinent ones.
    - **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
    - **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** Reason is weak because it merely circles back to the proposition.
    - **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** Causal basis for the proposition submitted is not compelling.
    - **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** Assuming a proposition is true because it is widely believed.
    - **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:** Language used can be interpreted in more than one way, leading to misunderstanding.

2. **Analyze the Provided String:**
   - String: "Trying to convince others that everyone is doing it or everyone feels this way so they should too."
   
3. **Identify Keywords or Phrases Indicating a Defective Argument:**
   - Keywords/Phrases: "everyone is doing it," "everyone feels this way," "so they should too."

4. **Use Definitions to Classify the String:**
    - The phrase "everyone is doing it" or "everyone feels this way" aims to convince by referencing the majority opinion or action.
    - This suggests an appeal to popularity or conformity.
    - The logic implies that because many people are engaging in or believing in something, it must be correct or valid.

5. **Determine the Appropriate Defective Argument Type:**
    - **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** This type is characterized by the attempt to validate something simply because it is popular or widely accepted.

### Application

Given the string "Trying to convince others that everyone is doing it or everyone feels this way so they should too," the identified type of defective argument is:

**<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**

This classification falls under attempting to validate an action or belief based on its popularity rather than logical reasoning or evidence.
