Sure, let's apply the structured approach of decomposing and classifying the argument step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Classification (<IDAA>)

1. **Identify the Argument Type**:
   - We need to determine what kind of defective argument is being made in the given statement:  
     _"Since 88% of people polled believe in UFOs, they must exist."_

2. **Break Down the Components of the Argument**:
   - **Proposition (\<P\>)**: "UFOs must exist."
   - **Reason (\<R\>)**: "Since 88% of people polled believe in UFOs."

3. **Analyze the Reason (\<R\>) for Types of Defective Arguments**:
   - The reason given is an appeal to the belief of the majority of people (88%) as evidence for the existence of UFOs.
   - This suggests that the argument relies on the popularity of a belief to establish its truth.

4. **Match the Argument to Known Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (\<G\>)**: Does not apply here, as this argument is not making a generalization from limited examples.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)**: Does not fit, as there’s no claim of missing pertinent possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**: Not directly applicable here; the reason is not simply weak but rather based on a logical fallacy.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)**: Does not fit, as the reason is not circular.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**: Not relevant; there’s no causal relationship being misrepresented.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)**: This matches well as the argument assumes that because many people believe in UFOs, they must exist.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)**: Not applicable, as the language is not ambiguous or intended to mislead by its dual meanings.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given statement most closely aligns with the defective argument type:
     **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)**.

### Final Classification
The argument “Since 88% of people polled believe in UFOs, they must exist.” is of type **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)**.

By following these steps in the decomposition and classification process, we've systematically determined the nature of the defective argument.
