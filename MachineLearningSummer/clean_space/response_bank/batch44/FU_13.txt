Sure, let's decompose the task of classifying the argument "The latest craze or fad; everyone has to have it." into specific steps and then apply those steps to the classification task:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine what is being asserted or claimed.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the stated reason or explanations given to support the proposition.
3. **Assess the Types of Defective Arguments**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: Check if the argument makes a broad conclusion from a limited sample.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Check if the argument falsely claims a complete enumeration of possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Check if the reason provided does not conclusively support the proposition.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Check if the argument repeats the proposition as the reason.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Check if the causal relationship presented is weak or unsupported.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Check if the argument assumes something is true/valid because many people believe it.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Check if the argument uses language that is unclear or can be interpreted in multiple ways.

### Application (<IDAA>):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - **Proposition**: Everyone has to have the latest craze or fad.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - **Reason**: It’s the latest craze or fad (implying popularity as the reason everyone should have it).

3. **Assess the Types of Defective Arguments**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: This does not seem like a generalization but rather an appeal to popularity.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This argument does not claim complete enumeration of possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided (popularity) does not inherently support the necessity, but we still need to check for better fit.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The argument is not simply repeating the proposition; it’s appealing to the action of those around.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This does not present a causal relationship needing evaluation.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument is effectively using the idea that because everyone is doing it, it must be done by you as well.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The language used is not ambiguous but clear in its appeal.

Given these considerations, we can classify the argument.

### Classification (<IDA>):
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**

The argument "The latest craze or fad; everyone has to have it." appeals to popularity and assumes that because many people are engaging in a behavior, it is something you should also do, fitting into the category of Presumptuous Consensus.

Therefore, the correct classification is:

```txt
The latest craze or fad; everyone has to have it. <FU>
```
