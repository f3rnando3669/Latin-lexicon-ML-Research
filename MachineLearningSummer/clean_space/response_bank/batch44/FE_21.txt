To apply the decomposition process of identifying the type of defective argument (`<IDA>`) step by step (`<IDAA>`), let's systematically break down the task to classify the string: "Either you recycle or you don't care about human life."

### Step 1: Understanding the Argument

1.1. Examine the structure of the argument:
- **Proposition (<P>)**: "Either you recycle."
- **Consequence/Alternative (<P>)**: "Or you don't care about human life."

1.2. Recognize the logical connectors and examine for forced dichotomies or limited options.

### Step 2: Apply Type Classifications

#### 2.1. Evaluate for <G> (Generalization):
- **Generalization**: Making an assumption about a whole group based on a part.
- **Example**: "All sports car drivers are too aggressive!"
- **Analysis**: This argument doesn't make a generalization about a group but rather presents a forced choice between two options.

#### 2.2. Evaluate for <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):
- **Incomplete Enumeration**: Claiming to list all possibilities, but missing pertinent ones.
- **Example**: "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."
- **Analysis**: This looks promising since the argument presents limited choices without considering other possibilities related to caring about human life apart from recycling.

#### 2.3. Evaluate for <IR> (Inconclusive Reason):
- **Inconclusive Reason**: Presenting reasons that do not conclusively prove the proposition.
- **Example**: "Don't you want the best for your baby?"
- **Analysis**: The argument doesn't present inconclusive reasons for the proposition; it forces a choice between two extremes.

#### 2.4. Evaluate for <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):
- **Faulty Repetition**: Restating the proposition as the reason.
- **Example**: "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."
- **Analysis**: This isn't a case of repetition of the same idea; it splits into an either/or scenario.

#### 2.5. Evaluate for <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):
- **Insufficient Causal Basis**: Citing causes that are not compelling enough to prove the proposition.
- **Example**: "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick."
- **Analysis**: No cause-and-effect direction is present; it's a dichotomy.

#### 2.6. Evaluate for <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):
- **Presumptuous Consensus**: Assuming agreement or correctness based on popularity or majority belief.
- **Example**: "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong."
- **Analysis**: This isn't about consensus but about presenting an either/or scenario.

#### 2.7. Evaluate for <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):
- **Ambiguous Language**: Using language that can be interpreted in different ways.
- **Example**: "I want to have a merry little Christmas, but I refuse to make the yuletide gay."
- **Analysis**: There is no ambiguous use of language here, just a forced choice.

### Step 3: Classification

The classification most fitting for the argument "Either you recycle or you don't care about human life" is:

- **<FE>**: Incomplete Enumeration

#### Explanation:
The argument forces a binary choice between recycling and not caring about human life, without acknowledging the many other ways in which one might show concern for human life apart from recycling.

Therefore, the argument "Either you recycle or you don't care about human life" commits the fallacy of **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**.

So, we've systematically decomposed the task and arrived at the classification:
- **Type**: <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)
