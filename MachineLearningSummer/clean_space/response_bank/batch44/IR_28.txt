Sure, let's break down the task of classifying the given string using a systematic approach:

### Steps for Decomposition (D)
1. **Identify the Parts**: Break down the argument into its propositions and reasonings.
2. **Evaluate the Argument Types**: Compare the identified parts of the argument with definitions of defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).
3. **Match the Defect**: Determine which defective argument type best matches the argument.

### Applying Decomposition to the Classification Task (IDAA)

#### Step 1: Identify the Parts
We have two speakers in the argument:
- **Speaker 1**: "No fault divorce is really harmful to the family and the larger society."
  - **Proposition (P1)**: No fault divorce is harmful.
  - **Reasoning (R1)**: It is harmful to the family and society.
- **Speaker 2**: "Well, you must not really think that since you’re divorced yourself."
  - **Proposition (P2)**: Speaker 1's claim is invalid.
  - **Reasoning (R2)**: Because Speaker 1 is divorced.

#### Step 2: Evaluate the Argument Types
1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Broad, sweeping claims without sufficient evidence.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: False dichotomy or presenting limited possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Circular reasoning.
5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Weak causal connection.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Assuming something is true because it is universally agreed upon.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Using language in a misleading or ambiguous way.

#### Step 3: Match the Defect
We see that **Speaker 2** tries to invalidate **Speaker 1's** argument by pointing out **Speaker 1's** personal circumstance (being divorced). This is an attack on the person making the argument, rather than addressing the argument itself.

The fallacy here is recognized as **Ad Hominem**, which falls under the broader category of arguments where the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.

- **Classification**: This does not exactly match <G> (Generalization), <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration), <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), or <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis), or <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).
- **Best Fit**: The closest fit from the provided categories is **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** because Speaker 2's reason does not conclusively demonstrate that Speaker 1's argument about no-fault divorce is wrong.

Therefore, the argument "Speaker 1: No fault divorce is really harmful to the family and the larger society. Speaker 2: Well, you must not really think that since you’re divorced yourself." can best be classified as:
**<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**.
