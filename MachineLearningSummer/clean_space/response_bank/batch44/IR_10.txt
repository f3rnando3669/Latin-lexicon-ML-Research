Alright, let's apply the process of decomposing the task of classifying <s> ("No one has ever been able to prove that extraterrestrials do not exist, so they must be real.") into specific steps and then perform the classification. Here we go step by step:

### Step 1: **Identify the proposition (<P>)**
- The statement sets forth a claim: "Extraterrestrials must be real."

### Step 2: **Identify the reason (<R>)**
- The causal basis provided is: "No one has ever been able to prove that extraterrestrials do not exist."

### Step 3: **Examine the proof of reason (<PR>)**
- Here, <PR> seems to reiterate the reason without offering substantial evidence: It relies on the fact that because no one has disproven the existence of extraterrestrials, they must exist.

### Step 4: **Match the statement against the predefined categories of defective argument types**
Let's examine each category to see which one fits:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** This category is about making broad claims based on insufficient evidence. This doesn't seem to fit as the argument is not about a broad application.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This type suggests missing out on some pertinent possibilities. This statement doesn’t seem to classify into this category.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This category involves <R> that doesn’t conclusively demonstrate the correctness of <P>. This is a potential candidate because the reason given doesn't logically establish the proposition.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Circular reasoning where the <P> and <R> essentially say the same thing. This doesn't seem to fit as the reasoning isn't repeating the proposition itself.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This involves <R> being weak if the causal basis is not compelling. Although the basis involves lack of disproof, it does not directly establish a weak causal argument.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This suggests certainty based on a presumption of universal agreement. This doesn’t fit as the argument doesn’t claim universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** This involves ambiguity in the language used. This doesn't seem to fit as there is a clear, albeit flawed, reasoning process.

### Step 5: **Determine the best fit for the defective argument type**
Upon close inspection, the strongest category that matches the statement's flaw is:

**Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** 
- **Reason**: The reason given ("No one has ever been able to prove that extraterrestrials do not exist") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition ("Extraterrestrials must be real").

Thus, the classification of the statement "No one has ever been able to prove that extraterrestrials do not exist, so they must be real." is **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**.
