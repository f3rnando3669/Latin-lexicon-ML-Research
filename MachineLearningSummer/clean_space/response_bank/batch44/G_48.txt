For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument into specific steps), we can break down the task into a series of logical steps to identify the type of defective argument in the given string:

### Step 1: Understanding the Argument Form
First, let's break down the argument presented:
- **Proposition** ("P"): "If I don't get this 5 point assignment done then I will fall behind in my grade and will get backed up so I can't get my other assignment done."
- **Chain of Consequences**:
  - Fall behind in grade.
  - Get backed up.
  - Can’t get other assignments done.
  - Fail the class.
  - Turn to a life of crime.

### Step 2: Identifying the Nature of the Argument
Next, assess the logical structure and the nature of the argument:
- The argument uses a sequence of hypothetical consequences, escalating from a small initial event (not completing a 5-point assignment) to a much larger and severe outcome (turning to a life of crime).
- Evaluate if the steps logically and reasonably follow from one another:
  - Not completing a small assignment leads directly to turning to a life of crime, a highly improbable conclusion, thus making an exaggerated or dramatic leap.

### Step 3: Mapping to Defective Argument Types
Now, let's review the provided defective argument types:
1. **<G> Generalization**: Applying a conclusion about a specific case to a whole group.
2. **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: Claiming only limited possibilities exist when more options are available.
3. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: Reasons provided don’t conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
4. **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: Repeating the same point without providing additional evidence.
5. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: Making a causal claim without sufficient basis.
6. **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: Assuming something is true because it’s universally agreed upon.
7. **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: Using a term or phrase in a misleading way.

### Step 4: Choosing the Best Fit
Given the significant leap in consequences:
- The argument fits best into **<G> Generalization** if it generalized a scenario based on one instance.
- Fits best into **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis** if it lacks sufficient causal connections.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason** naturally follows from the steps but does not conclusively establish their connection.
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus** or **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use** do not fit the nature of the argument as no consensus or misleading language is involved primarily.

We can conclude that the string mostly aligns with:<br>
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: The argument presents a series of highly exaggerated and implausibly connected hypothetical consequences without sufficient causal basis to justify how one leads to another.

### Final Classification
**Classification Type**: **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**
