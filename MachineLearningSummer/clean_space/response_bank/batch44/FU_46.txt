For 
To apply <IDAA> to "“McDonald’s has served 100 billion people in the world. It must be the best fast food restaurant in the world" is an example of", we need to break down the task of classifying the statement as one of the defective argument types. Here’s how we can do it step by step:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Key Components of the Statement**: Analyze the claim and the evidence provided.
2. **Understand the Logical Fallacies**: Review the definitions and examples of each defective argument type.
3. **Match Given Components to Fallacies**: Compare the components of the statement to the characteristics of the different fallacies.
4. **Classify the Argument**: Determine which fallacy best describes the argument.

### Step 1: Identify the Key Components of the Statement
The statement to classify is: 
**"McDonald’s has served 100 billion people in the world. It must be the best fast food restaurant in the world."**

- **Claim**: McDonald’s must be the best fast food restaurant in the world.
- **Evidence Provided**: McDonald’s has served 100 billion people in the world.

### Step 2: Understand the Logical Fallacies
Review the provided definitions for each type of defective argument:
- **Generalization (<G>)**: An assertion based on a small or unrepresentative sample.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: A false dilemma presenting only two choices when more exist.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Circular reasoning or repeating the same proposition in different words.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Weak causal relationship where the evidence provided does not sufficiently support the claim.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Assuming something is true because many people believe or do it.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Using a word with multiple meanings to mislead.

### Step 3: Match Given Components to Fallacies
- The argument points to the large number of customers (100 billion served) as evidence that McDonald's is the best fast food restaurant.
- This suggests that popularity (number of people served) equates to quality (being the best), which aligns closely with the fallacy that assumes something is good/correct/desirable because it is popular.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)** fits the argument because it assumes that McDonald’s is the best simply because a large number of people have been served there. This is precisely the fallacy of assuming that widespread belief or practice validates the claim.

### Conclusion
The classification of the statement:
**"McDonald’s has served 100 billion people in the world. It must be the best fast food restaurant in the world"** is an example of **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**.
