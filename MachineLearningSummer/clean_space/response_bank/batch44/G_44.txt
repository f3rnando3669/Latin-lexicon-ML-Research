For 
To apply \(IDAA\) to the string "If we ban Hummers because they are bad for the environment eventually the government will ban all cars, so we should not ban Hummers.", we will follow the following steps for the decomposition of \(IDA\):

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Propositional Statement (\(P\)):**
   - Break down the argument to identify the main point being argued or claimed.
   
2. **Identify the Reasoning (\(R\)):**
   - Determine the rationale or logic given to support the main proposition or claim.
   
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\(PR\)):**
   - Look for any additional evidence, reasoning, or examples provided to back up the stated reason (\(R\)).

4. **Classify the Argument Type:**
   - Based on the components identified, classify the argument into one of the types: \(G\) (Generalization), \(FE\) (Incomplete Enumeration), \(IR\) (Inconclusive Reason), \(RR\) (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), \(WCB\) (Insufficient Causal Basis), \(FU\) (Presumptuous Consensus), or \(DEP\) (Ambiguous Language Use).

Let's apply each of these steps to the given string.

### 1. Identify the Propositional Statement (\(P\)):

The main point being argued here is:
- "We should not ban Hummers."

### 2. Identify the Reasoning (\(R\)):

The rationale provided to support the proposition is:
- "Banning Hummers because they are bad for the environment will eventually lead the government to ban all cars."

### 3. Identify the Proof of Reason (\(PR\)):

No additional specific examples or evidence are directly given here; the argument relies on a projected slippery slope effect.

### 4. Classify the Argument Type:

Based on the identified components, classify the argument:
- The reasoning suggests a domino effect from banning Hummers leading to the banning of all cars.
- This represents a classic "slippery slope" argument where a relatively small first step is asserted to lead to a chain of related events culminating in some significant impact.

Thus, the correct classification of the argument type is:
- **\(G\) (Generalization)** : \( \textcolor{red}{No it does not fit, eliminate this.} \)
- **\(FE\) (Incomplete Enumeration)** : \( \textcolor{red}{No it does not fit, eliminate this.} \)
- **\(IR\) (Inconclusive Reason)** \( \textcolor{red}{No it does not fit, eliminate this.} \)
- **\(RR\) (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)** : \( \textcolor{red}{No it does not fit, eliminate this.} \)
- **\(WCB\) (Insufficient Causal Basis)** \( \textcolor{red}{No it does not fit, eliminate this.} \)
- **\(FU\) (Presumptuous Consensus)** \( \textcolor{red} No it does not fit, eliminate this. \)
- **\(DEP\) (Ambiguous Language Use)** \( \textcolor{red}{No it does not fit, eliminate this.} \)

Clearly, this fits none of them. However, "slippery slope" arguments are \( \textcolor{red}{a classical inconclusive reason\). Therefore the Logical Fallacy is
**\(IR (Inconclusive Reason)\).**
