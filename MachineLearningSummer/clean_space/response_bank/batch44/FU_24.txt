For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the string "During class, Alex whispers to Jeff, 'More than 80% of university professors are voting against the Republicans. Clearly, it's the only intelligent vote to make.'" as of type <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU> or <DEP>, we need to decompose the task into specific steps:

### Step 1: Extract Propositions and Reasons
Identify the main proposition (P) and the reason (R) presented in the string.
- **Proposition (P):** It’s the only intelligent vote to make.
- **Reason (R):** More than 80% of university professors are voting against the Republicans.

### Step 2: Analyze the Argument Structure
Determine if the proposition and reason form a coherent argument and identify any logical fallacies.
- **Structure:** The argument suggests that because a large percentage of university professors are voting against the Republicans, it must be the intelligent choice.

### Step 3: Identify the Type of Defective Argument
Evaluate the argument to see which type of defective argument it falls into.

#### Analyze:
- The argument assumes that because 80% of university professors (an authority) are voting a certain way, it must be the intelligent choice. This implies an appeal to popularity or authority to validate the claim.
  
#### Types:
1. **<G> Generalization:** Not applicable. The argument doesn't claim all professors or use a small sample to generalize.
2. **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:** Not applicable. The argument doesn’t present false dichotomy or limited options.
3. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** Not applicable. The reasoning isn’t inherently conclusive but appeals to authority/popularity.
4. **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** Not applicable. The reason is different from the proposition.
5. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** Not applicable. There's no unclear causation given.
6. **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** **Applicable.** The argument relies on the popularity of the professors' vote to claim it is the intelligent choice.
7. **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:** Not applicable. No ambiguous language detected.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
Determine which classification fits based on the analysis.
- **Classification:** <FU> Presumptuous Consensus.

### Conclusion:
By following these steps, we classified the string as <FU> Presumptuous Consensus since it relies on the popularity of a viewpoint among university professors to assert its correctness.
