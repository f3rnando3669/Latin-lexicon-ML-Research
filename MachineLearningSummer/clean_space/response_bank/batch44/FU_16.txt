To decompose the task of classifying the string "<s>" as one of the provided types of defective arguments, we can break down the process into specific, identifiable steps. Here's the fully detailed application of this decomposition:

### Step 1: **Identify the proposition**
In this step, we identify the main proposition presented within the string.

- **String:** "With 80% of consumers choosing our product, isn't it obvious that you should, too?"

### Step 2: **Determine the reasoning**
Determine what reasoning is provided to support the proposition.

- **Reasoning:** The reasoning provided is that since 80% of consumers choose the product, that implies you should choose it as well.

### Step 3: **Identify the logical structure**
Examine the logical structure to identify any patterns or common themes with known fallacies.

- The argument relies on a majority or consensus to validate the proposition.
- It appeals to the behavior of others as the primary justification for an action.

### Step 4: **Compare with fallacy definitions**
Compare the suspected reasoning identified with the definitions of each fallacy type.

- **<G>:** Generalization – This is typically characterized by sweeping statements; not the case here.
- **<FE>:** Incomplete Enumeration – Provides a binary choice excluding other possibilities; not applicable here.
- **<IR>:** Inconclusive Reason – The reasoning provided here is conclusive within its own logical framework.
- **<RR>:** Faulty Repetition of Proposition – This involves circular reasoning; not applicable here.
- **<WCB>:** Insufficient Causal Basis – Involves weak causation; not relevant here.
- **<FU>:** Presumptuous Consensus – Relies on general acceptance as evidence.
- **<DEP>:** Ambiguous Language Use – Relies on ambiguous interpretations which doesn't fit.

### Step 5: **Match to Definition**
Based on the comparison, determine the best fit for the fallacy type.

- **<FU>:** This is fitting as it appeals to popularity, suggesting that because a majority does something, it is inherently correct and you should follow suit. 

### Step 6: **Verify and Conclude**
Validate and conclude with the appropriate definition.

- **Conclusion:** The identified fallacy is **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**.

### Application of Decomposition to <s>:

- **Step 1:** Proposition: "you should choose our product."
- **Step 2:** Reasoning: "80% of consumers are choosing our product."
- **Step 3:** Logical Structure: Appeal to popularity.
- **Step 4:** Compare with fallacies, identifying **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus** as the most fitting.
- **Step 5:** Match and Verify: It appeals to widespread acceptance as justification.
- **Step 6:** Conclude: The fallacy is **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**.

Thus, the logical fallacy in the statement "With 80% of consumers choosing our product, isn't obvious that you should, too?" is **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**.
