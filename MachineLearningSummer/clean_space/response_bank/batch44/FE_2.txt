For 
To apply \(<IDAA>\) to the task of classifying the string "If you can't prove that Ken had an affair with the nanny, then he's been faithful to his wife," we need to decompose the classification task \(<IDA>\) into specific steps and execute them systematically.

**Step 1: Understand the String**
- Read and comprehend the provided string to catch its meaning and implications.
  - String: "If you can't prove that Ken had an affair with the nanny, then he's been faithful to his wife."
  - Meaning: The string suggests that, in the absence of proof of infidelity, Ken should be considered faithful.

**Step 2: Identify the Type of Reasoning or Logical Structure**
- Determine the logical form and identify the type of reasoning being used in the statement.
  - The structure indicates a reliance on the absence of disproof to affirm a proposition:
    - Premise: "If you can't prove that Ken had an affair with the nanny,"
    - Conclusion: "then he's been faithful to his wife."

**Step 3: Match with Defined Defective Argument Types**
- Compare the identified reasoning type with the predefined defective argument types: 
  - <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

- Known definitions of defective argument types:
  1. **<G> (Generalization)**: Assumes that what is true for some is true for all.
  2. **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: Incorrectly claiming to have considered all possibilities.
  3. **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: The reason does not prove the proposition.
  4. **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: Circular reasoning.
  5. **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: Weak casual relationship.
  6. **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: Assumes something is true because it's widely accepted.
  7. **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: Ambiguous use of language.

**Step 4: Analysis of the Logical Structure**
- Evaluate if the reasoning falls into one of the defective types:
  - The statement argues that the absence of proof of infidelity (Ken having an affair) is proof of fidelity (Ken has been faithful).
  - This uses the absence of evidence as evidence for fidelity.

**Step 5: Classification**
- Identify that the logical structure corresponds to the argument type where proof of a proposition is shifted based on the absence of counter-evidence, i.e., Argument from Ignorance.

- In this context:
  - The correct type is **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**, since the reasoning – absence of proof of infidelity – does not conclusively verify Ken's faithfulness to his wife. This type of argument is also known as Argument from Ignorance.

**Final Classification**
- The string "If you can't prove that Ken had an affair with the nanny, then he's been faithful to his wife" is classified under **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**.
