For 
To apply <IDAA> (the task of classifying a defective argument step by step), we will decompose the classification task into specific steps and apply each step to the provided statement. Here are the steps:

1. **Identify the proposition (P) and reason (R):** Determine the main claim (P) and the reason given to support this claim (R).
2. **Examine the reason (R) for its logical validity:** Evaluate if the reason logically supports the proposition.
3. **Check for the specific types of defective arguments (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP):** Determine which specific type of defective argument the statement falls under.

Let's apply these steps to the provided statement:

**Step 1: Identify the proposition (P) and reason (R).**
- **Proposition (P):** "We should keep her locked up in the closet."
- **Reason (R):** If we unlock the child from the closet, it will lead to her being sold in a sex slavery ring.

**Step 2: Examine the reason (R) for its logical validity.**
- The reason given involves a slippery slope argument, suggesting that one action (unlocking the child) will inevitably lead to a series of increasingly extreme and negative events (roaming the house, roaming the neighborhood, being picked up by a stranger and sold into sex slavery). This is an example of faulty reasoning where the connection between the steps is not logically substantiated or inevitable.

**Step 3: Check for the specific types of defective arguments:** 
- **G (Generalization):** The argument does not make broad generalizations based on limited observations.
- **FE (Incomplete Enumeration):** The argument does not present a false dichotomy or false choice.
- **IR (Inconclusive Reason):** The argument's reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition, but that's not the main defect here.
- **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** The argument does not restate the claim as its reason.
- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The reason provided does not offer a compelling causal basis, but the argument's structure suggests another type.
- **FU (Presumptuous Consensus):** The argument does not appeal to popular belief as its reason.
- **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use):** The argument does not rely on ambiguous language.

The argument falls under the defective argument type where an extreme outcome is presupposed based on a chain of causation without sufficient evidence.

**Classification:**
- **Type:** <G> (Generalization)
- **Type:** <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)
- **Type:** <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)
- **Type:** <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)
- **Type:** <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)
- **Type:** <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)
- **Type:** <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)

Based on the analysis, the statement is most accurately classified as:

**Type:** **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**, because it suggests a false dichotomy where allowing the child to roam inevitably leads to extreme and unrelated consequences.

Thus, the complete answer for classifying the given statement under the defective argument types is:

"We cannot unlock our child from the closet because if we do, she will want to roam the house. If we let her roam the house, she will want to roam the neighborhood. If she roams the neighborhood, she will get picked up by a stranger in a van, who will sell her in a sex slavery ring in some other country. Therefore, we should keep her locked up in the closet." is an example of <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration).
