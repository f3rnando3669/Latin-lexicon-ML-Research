For 
To apply <IDAA> to classify the argument "Is your stupidity inborn?" step by step, we need to decompose the task of identifying the type of defective argument into specific steps. Let's break it down into a systematic approach:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D> for Task <IDA>):

1. **Understand the Argument**:
    - Parse the statement to understand its structure and claims.
    - Identify the proposition and any implied or explicit reasonings.

2. **Classify the Argument Type**:
    - Compare the argument to the definitions of defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

3. **Evaluate Each Defective Argument Type**:
    - Verify if the argument fits the description for any of the following:
        - Generalization (<G>)
        - Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
        - Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
        - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
        - Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
        - Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
        - Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)

4. **Determine the Best Match**:
    - Based on the characteristics, decide which category is most appropriate.

## Applying <IDAA> to "Is your stupidity inborn?"

### Step 1: Understand the Argument
The statement "Is your stupidity inborn?" is a loaded question implying that the person being asked is inherently stupid. It does not present a reason or evidence, but it assumes the proposition (that the person is stupid).

### Step 2: Classify the Argument Type
We need to examine if this fits into any categories listed.

### Step 3: Evaluate Each Defective Argument Type:

- **Generalization (<G>)**:
  - There's no generalization about a group of people.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
  - No assertion based on missing possibilities is being made.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
  - There's no provided reason to establish the truth of the proposition.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
  - This does not restate the proposition in other terms.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
  - No cause-and-effect relationship is being asserted.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
  - The statement does not rely on the consensus of others.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
  - The statement does not use ambiguous language.

### Step 4: Determine the Best Match
The argument "Is your stupidity inborn?" fits a category not listed in the defective argument types specified but is commonly recognized as a **Loaded Question** logical fallacy. This fallacy assumes the truth of a proposition (that someone is stupid) within the question itself, coercing an answer that implicitly accepts the assumption.

As this fallacy aligns closest with the above definitions provided but isn't explicitly listed, we can note its similarity to Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>) in terms of making assuming preconditions as a fact, but as a better fit, it directly aligns with an unlisted category of **Loaded Question**.

Consequently, we can classify "Is your stupidity inborn?" as a **Loaded Question** â€” a specific form of a logical fallacy that shares traits with some outlined defective argument types but isn't explicitly covered in the predefined set. If we need it to fit precisely into the given categories, we note the closest but recognize the more accurate term outside the given strict definitions.
