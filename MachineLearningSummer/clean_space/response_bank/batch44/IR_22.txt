For 
To apply IDAA to the given statement "We should abolish the death penalty. Many respected people, such as actor Guy Handsome, have publicly stated their opposition to it," we will decompose the task of classifying the statement as one of the defective argument types.

### Decomposition Steps 
1. **Identify the main claim or proposition (P).**
2. **Identify the reason (R) supporting the main claim.**
3. **Evaluate the reasoning (R) to determine if it fits any defective argument type definitions:**
   - **Generalization (<G>)**
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**

Let's go through the steps:

### Step 1: Identify the main claim (P)
**Proposition (P):** "We should abolish the death penalty."

### Step 2: Identify the reason (R) supporting the main claim
**Reason (R):** "Many respected people, such as actor Guy Handsome, have publicly stated their opposition to it."

### Step 3: Evaluate the reasoning (R)

Now evaluate the reasoning to see if it fits any of the defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** This type refers to extending a specific example to all cases. 
   - Not applicable here.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This type refers to presenting only specific options, ignoring other potential relevant options.
   - Not applicable here.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This type occurs when reason (R) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (P).
   - This reason seems inconclusive as it merely points to the opinion of respected people without directly establishing why the death penalty should be abolished.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This type involves the reason repeating the proposition without providing new information.
   - Not applicable here.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This type involves a weak causal connection between (R) and (P).
   - Not applicable here as no causal relationship is being purported.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This type involves assuming a proposition is correct because "everyone agrees" or "many people believe it."
   - This seems applicable since the reasoning (R) depends on the popularity of the opinion among respected individuals to validate the correctness of the proposition (P).

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** This involves ambiguous terms or phrases that mislead.
   - Not applicable here as the language isn't ambiguous.

### Conclusion
Based on the evaluation:

**Classify the Statement:** **<FU>** (Presumptuous Consensus)

**Explanation:** The statement "Many respected people, such as actor Guy Handsome, have publicly stated their opposition to it" relies on the authority and consensus of respected individuals to justify abolishing the death penalty, which fits the definition of Presumptuous Consensus.

Thus, the statement is classified as \(<FU>\).
