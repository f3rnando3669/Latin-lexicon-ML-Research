To apply the decomposition of the advanced task (t) of classifying an argument string (s) by its type (IDAA), we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the nature of the argument**: Determine what the argument is claiming.
2. **Analyze the proposition (P)**: Identify the proposition being set forth.
3. **Examine the reason (R)**: Identify the causal basis provided to support the proposition.
4. **Consider the proof of reason (PR)**: Check for any additional arguments or evidence provided to support the reason.
5. **Match the argument to known defective types**: Compare the structure and content of the argument to known defective argument types: Generalization (G), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).
6. **Classify the argument**: Decide which type of defective argument the string matches.

Let's apply each step to the given argument:

**Argument: "If someone said, 'all kids love Cinnamon Toast Crunch, but you don't love it so you must not be a real kid,' what logical fallacy are they using?"**

1. **Identify the nature of the argument**: The argument is making a claim about the identity of someone as a "real kid" based on their preference for a specific cereal.

2. **Analyze the proposition (P)**: The proposition is that someone who doesn't love Cinnamon Toast Crunch is not a real kid.

3. **Examine the reason (R)**: The reason provided is that all kids love Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

4. **Consider the proof of reason (PR)**: The argument assumes PR without providing additional evidence, based solely on the generalization that "all kids love Cinnamon Toast Crunch."

5. **Match the argument to known defective types**: 
   - **Generalization (G)**: The argument makes a sweeping generalization about all kids based on the assumption of a common behavior (loving a specific cereal).
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument assumes that the majority consensus (all kids love Cinnamon Toast Crunch) makes the claim universally true and broadly applied.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This doesn't exactly apply, as the argument isn't merely repeating the same proposition without a different reason.

6. **Classify the argument**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: The clearest classification here is Generalization, as it uses a broad general claim ("all kids love Cinnamon Toast Crunch") to draw a specific conclusion about someone's identity as a "real kid."

Thus, the logical fallacy being used in the argument is **Generalization (G)**.
