For 
To apply <IDAA> (Decomposition of the classification of a string into a defective argument type) to the statement, let's break down the process into specific steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Statement
Analyze the provided text to identify the core argument and its components:

**Statement:**
"Everyone is selfish; everyone is doing what he believes will make himself happier. The recognition of that can take most of the sting out of accusations that you're being 'selfish.' Why should you feel guilty for seeking your own happiness when that's what everyone else is doing, too?"

### Step 2: Identify Key Elements
Identify specific arguments, claims, or propositions within the text:

1. **Proposition:** "Everyone is selfish; everyone is doing what he believes will make himself happier."
2. **Reason:** "The recognition of that can take most of the sting out of accusations that you're being 'selfish.'"
3. **Conclusion:** "Why should you feel guilty for seeking your own happiness when that's what everyone else is doing, too?"

### Step 3: Classify the Defective Argument Type
Determine which defective argument type the statement falls under. We need to check each type defined above against the specifics of the statement:

- **Generalization (<G>):** A statement that makes a broad claim about a group based on a few instances.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** A claim that presents limited options or outcomes.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** A reason that doesn't conclusively support the proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Circular reasoning where the reason repeats the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** A weak causal link between the reason and the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Assuming something is true because it's widely believed or done.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** A statement that uses ambiguous or misleading language.

### Step 4: Evaluate the Statement Against Each Type
Analyze the text to see which category it fits:

- **Generalization (<G>):** The statement makes a broad claim that "everyone is selfish" and "everyone is seeking their own happiness." This can be considered a generalization.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The text does not seem to restrict options or claim limited outcomes.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reasoning here is an example of appealing to common behavior to justify one's own.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The statement does not repeat the proposition as a reason.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal link here is more about social justification rather than proving selfishness leads to happiness.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The statement assumes seeking one's own happiness is justified because everyone else is doing it, relying on popular behavior as a validation.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Words like "selfish" and "happiness" are used consistently without misleading ambiguity.

### Step 5: Conclusion
Based on the evaluation, the most fitting classification for this statement is:

**Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
The fallacy is assuming that seeking one's own happiness is justified because everyone else is doing it. The statement relies on the idea that if a behavior is common, it must be acceptable.

**Final Fallacy Classification:**
*Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)*

The logical fallacy in the statement is **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.
