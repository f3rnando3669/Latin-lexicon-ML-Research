For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying the given string into the correct defective argument type step by step), we'll break down the process of classifying the provided statement "It is either you are for the US war on terror or against it."

1. **Understand the Task (<IDA>)**:
   - The task is to classify the given statement into one of the predefined defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

2. **Identify the Components of the Argument**:
   - Read the statement carefully and break it down into its logical components.
   - Identify the structure and any keywords that may indicate a specific type of fallacy.

3. **Compare with Definitions of Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: Making an assertion based on insufficient or non-representative examples.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Claiming a complete set of options when others exist.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Using an inconclusive or weak reason to support a conclusion.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Repeating the proposition without providing new evidence.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Using weak or insufficient causation to support a conclusion.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Assuming something is true because many believe it.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Using ambiguous or misleading language.

4. **Evaluate the Statement**:
   - "It is either you are for the US war on terror or against it."
   - This statement presents two options with no middle ground.

5. **Match to the Correct Defective Argument Type**:
   - The statement creates a false dichotomy, suggesting there are only two possible stances without acknowledging any other positions or nuances.
   - This matches the definition of **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Claiming a complete set of options when other possible options are ignored.

Based on the steps outlined, we classify the provided statement as:

### Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)

The statement "It is either you are for the US war on terror or against it." commits the fallacy of Incomplete Enumeration by presenting only two options and ignoring the spectrum of possible opinions on the issue.
