For 
To apply <IDAA>—the decomposition of the task of classifying a string, "The United States is the wealthiest nation in the world. So every American is wealthy." into specific steps—we break it down as follows:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of Identifying the Defective Argument Type

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- **Identify the initial statement or proposition**: "The United States is the wealthiest nation in the world."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- **Identify the reasoning or causal basis**: The implicit reasoning here is that because the United States as a whole is wealthy ("wealthiest nation"), individuals within it (i.e., every American) must also be wealthy.

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- **Identify any supporting arguments or further corroborations**: The statement does not provide additional supporting arguments or evidence beyond restating the nation's wealth to conclude individual wealth.

#### Step 4: Determine if Any Defective Argument Matches
- **Check for common defective argument types** among Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

### Classification of the Given String

#### Review Fallacy Definitions for a Match:
1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - Applicable if it draws conclusion about all members of a group based on an attribute of the group or a subset.
   - **Match**: This argument assumes every member of a nation shares an attribute of the nation, generalizing national wealth to individual wealth.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - Applicable if it artificially restricts options without considering all possibilities.
   - **Not a Match**: The argument does not falsely limit options but generalizes based on an attribute.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - Applicable if the argument's reasoning does not conclusively support the conclusion.
   - **Related, but not exact**: The reason could be more precisely a specific instance of generalization.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - Applicable if the reasoning restates the proposition without adding new evidence.
   - **Not a Match**: The fallacy here isn't about restating but inaccurately extending an attribute.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - Applicable if the cause given for an effect is weak or questionable.
   - **Related, but not exact**: There's weak reasoning, though the main flaw is generalization.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - Applicable if it appeals to popularity or widespread belief as validation.
   - **Not a Match**: The type doesn't appeal to consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
   - Applicable if a word is used with multiple meanings leading to confusion.
   - **Not a Match**: No ambiguity in wording used.

### Conclusion:
Given the steps and fallacy definitions, the argument "The United States is the wealthiest nation in the world. So every American is wealthy." commits the fallacy of **Generalization (G)**, as it inaccurately applies a characteristic of a whole (the nation's wealth) to its individual members (every American).

Therefore, the classification of the given string is of type <G>.
