To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of <IDA>) to "Angus declares that Scotsmen do not put sugar on their porridge, to which Lachlan points out that he is a Scotsman and puts sugar on his porridge. Furious, like a true Scot, Angus yells that no true Scotsman sugars his porridge.", we will follow a systematic approach:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for Identifying Argument Type

1. **Identify the Proposition <P>**:
    - **<P>**: Scotsmen do not put sugar on their porridge.

2. **Identify the Reason <R>**:
    - **<R>**: The statement "Scotsmen do not put sugar on their porridge" is refuted by Lachlan's counterexample.
    - **Counter <R>**: Angus's rebuttal that "no true Scotsman sugars his porridge" modifies the initial <P> to exclude counterexamples by redefining what it means to be a true Scotsman.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason <PR>**:
    - **<PR>**: Lachlanâ€™s example of being a Scotsman who sugars his porridge should refute the original <P>, but Angus exploits a redefinition to avoid refutation.

4. **Detect Defective Arguments**:
   - The given argument involves changing the definition of what constitutes a "true Scotsman" to dismiss a counterexample instead of addressing the initial proposition logically.
   - This is characteristic of a specific defective argument type.

### Classification of Argument Type
Using the provided definitions for defective argument types:
- **<G> (Generalization)**: Not applicable, as this is not a general claim being improperly extended.
- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: Not applicable, as we are not dealing with enumerating possibilities.
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: Not applicable, as the rejected counterexample leads directly to redefining terms.
- **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: Not applicable, as there is no restatement but rather a redefinition.
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: Not applicable, as there is no causal relationship being discussed.
- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: Not applicable, as the argument isn't based on broad consensus.
- **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: Not directly applicable; "true Scotsman" is a redefinition rather than an ambiguous term.

- **No True Scotsman Fallacy**: This fallacy fits under a specific type of equivocation or shifting definitions, and is commonly categorized within fallacy taxonomies focused on argument consistency.

**Conclusion**: The statement exemplifies a **"No True Scotsman" fallacy**. Although this fallacy is not defined explicitly in the provided set of defective argument types, it primarily involves redefining the category to exclude counterexamples, often considered a fallacy of ambiguity or shifting definitions.

Thus, based on these insights, we might align this example closest to **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)** due to the redefinition aspect involved.

### Final Classification
The argument "Angus declares that Scotsmen do not put sugar on their porridge, to which Lachlan points out that he is a Scotsman and puts sugar on his porridge. Furious, like a true Scot, Angus yells that no true Scotsman sugars his porridge." is of type **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)** based on the provided classification schema.
