For 
To apply <IDAA> to "I’m raising funds to help cure XYZ disease. If you don’t donate, then you’re part of the problem," let's break down the task into specific steps to classify the string:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**
   - Determine what the argument is trying to assert or prove.
   - In this case: "If you don’t donate, then you’re part of the problem."

2. **Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**
   - Analyze the reason provided for why the Proposition (<P>) should be accepted.
   - Here: The reason implied is that contributing to the fundraising effort is essential to solving the problem.

3. **Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**
   - Check whether there is additional justification or evidence provided to support the Reason (<R>).
   - In this statement, there is no additional proof given other than the implied moral duty.

4. **Step 4: Classify the Argument Based on Identified Patterns**
   - Compare the identified elements with the definitions of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Applying <D> Steps to Classify the String:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The Proposition presented is: "If you don’t donate, then you’re part of the problem."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The Reason implied here is: "Not donating contributes to the problem."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - There is no additional argument or evidence given to support the Reason. The argument leans on the implicit pressure of guilt or responsibility.

4. **Classify the Argument:**
   - By examining the structure and the lack of substantial proof or evidence for the argument, and focusing on the technique used, it aligns with the definition of **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**. This is because the argument sets up an either/or situation without acknowledging other possible ways to support the cause or to contribute to solving the problem.

**Conclusion:**
The string "I’m raising funds to help cure XYZ disease. If you don’t donate, then you’re part of the problem." is an example of the defective argument type **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**.
