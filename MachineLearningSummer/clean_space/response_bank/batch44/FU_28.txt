For 
To classify the statement "Don't be the only one not wearing Nike!" using the process of decomposing the task into specific steps, we can follow the next steps:

1. **Identify the nature of the statement in question**. Examine if the statement relies on any form of persuasion, logical reasoning, or a specified form of faulty logic.

2. **Examine the content and purpose of the statement**. Determine if the statement is aimed at invoking an emotional, social, or logical appeal.

3. **Check for logical consistency and reasoning**. Analyze if the statement uses sound reasoning or if it falls into any typical logical fallacies or defective arguments.

4. **Compare with known defective argument types**. Determine if it matches any specific types of defective arguments we've defined: Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Insufficient Causal Basis, Presumptuous Consensus, or Ambiguous Language Use.

Here is the step-by-step application of these steps to the statement:

### Step-by-Step Application:

1. **Nature of the Statement**:
   - The statement "Don't be the only one not wearing Nike!" seems to be an advertisement or persuasive statement encouraging conformity or group behavior.

2. **Content and Purpose**:
   - The purpose of the statement is to persuade the audience to wear Nike shoes by emphasizing a fear of being left out or not being part of a social norm.

3. **Logical Consistency and Reasoning**:
   - The statement does not use logical reasoning to explain why one should wear Nike shoes based on their quality or any other intrinsic property. Instead, it appeals to social conformity.

4. **Comparison with Known Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: The statement does not make a broad assertion based on insufficient evidence about a group.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement does not present a false dichotomy or miss out on pertinent options.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The statement does not give a weak or irrelevant reason for the assertion.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The statement is not just a repetition of the same claim without justification.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The statement does not make a faulty causal link based on insufficient evidence.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The statement suggests that because many people (presumably) wear Nike, the audience should too. This is an appeal to popularity or bandwagon fallacy.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The statement does not play on ambiguous language that could be taken in multiple ways.

Given the analysis, the statement "Don't be the only one not wearing Nike!" falls under the defective argument type of **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** because it assumes popularity and peer behavior as a compelling reason for an individual to conform and purchase the product.

### Conclusion
After decomposing the classification task (IDA) into specific steps (D) and applying those steps (IDAA), we classify the statement "Don't be the only one not wearing Nike!" as type **<FU>** (Presumptuous Consensus).
