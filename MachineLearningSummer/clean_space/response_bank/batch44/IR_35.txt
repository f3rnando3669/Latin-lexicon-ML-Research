For 
To apply \(IDAA\) to the task of classifying the string "Where did you hide the marijuana you were smoking?", we need to decompose \(IDA\) into specific steps. Here is the step-by-step process:

1. **Identify the Argument Type**:
   - Determine the nature of the argument presented in the string.

2. **Analyze the String**:
   - Break down the string to find the core proposition and reason, if any.

3. **Evaluate Argument Components**:
   - Determine if the proposition \(P\) and reason \(R\) are present. 
   - Check if \(PR\) (Proof of Reason) is provided or implied.

4. **Classify as Defective Argument**:
   - Compare the components to the defect types (\(G\), \(FE\), \(IR\), \(RR\), \(WCB\), \(FU\), \(DEP\)).

Let's apply these steps to the given string.

### Step 1: Identify the Argument Type

Determine the nature of the argument: The string "Where did you hide the marijuana you were smoking?" is phrased as a question but implies an assertion.

### Step 2: Analyze the String

Break down the string:
- **Core Proposition**: You were smoking marijuana.
- **Implied Reason**: You must have hidden it.

### Step 3: Evaluate Argument Components

- **Proposition \(P\)**: The assertion that you were smoking marijuana.
- **Reason \(R\)**: The implication that you have hidden the marijuana.

### Step 4: Classify as Defective Argument

This is a leading question that presumes guilt without evidence. It does not conclusively validate the proposition; instead, it assumes the veracity of \(P\) (you were smoking marijuana) to ask about the hidden object.

### Conclusion

The string falls into the defective argument type:
- **Defective Argument Type**: **Incomplete Enumeration (\(FE\))**

**Reason**: The string presumes guilt (you were smoking marijuana) based on an assumed scenario, missing pertinent possibilities like "you were not smoking at all." It presents a false dilemma by leading the respondent to confirm aspects of the assumption.

Therefore, using \(IDAA\):

\[ \text{The string "Where did you hide the marijuana you were smoking?" is of type <FE>.} \]
