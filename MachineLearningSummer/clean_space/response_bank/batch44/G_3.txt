For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string into specific steps), we need to methodically determine the type of defective argument based on the defined categories. The steps are as follows:

### Step 1: Understand the String
- **String**: "The more things change, the more they remain the same."

### Step 2: Identify Key Components
- **Key Components to Analyze**: "the more things change" and "the more they remain the same."

### Step 3: Compare with Different Defective Argument Types
- **<G> Generalization**: This involves making broad statements about all members of a group based on a few instances. The string doesn't seem to overgeneralize a group but rather draws a conclusion about the nature of change.
  
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: This type suggests that possibilities are limited to those mentioned, missing out pertinent ones. The string does not make a list or try to enumerate possibilities.

- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: Inconclusive Reason doesn't provide a sufficient causal basis for the proposition. The sentence is more of an aphorism rather than making an argument requiring specific reasons.

- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: This happens when the reason given is just a rephrasing of the proposition. The string doesn’t seem to circularly repeat, though it does present an inherent paradoxical proposition.

- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: This involves weak causal reasoning behind a claim. The string is not causative; it’s more observational about change and constancy.

- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: This involves assuming a statement is true because many people agree with it. The string doesn't seem to rely on the consensus for its validity.

- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: This involves words that can be taken in more than one sense. In our string, "change" and "remain the same" could potentially have different interpretations depending on context.

### Step 4: Final Classification

Given the analysis based on the definitions provided, the string subtly implies a paradox or ambiguity where "change" simultaneously leads to things "remaining the same." This would fall under ambiguous language use because it can be interpreted in multiple contexts and senses.

### Final Classification:
- **Type**: <DEP> Ambiguous Language Use

Thus, applying the specific steps of <IDAA> to "The more things change, the more they remain the same" classifies it as <DEP> due to its ambiguous language use.
