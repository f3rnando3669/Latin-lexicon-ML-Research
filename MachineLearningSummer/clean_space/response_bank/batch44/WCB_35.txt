For 
To apply <IDAA> (the process of decomposing and applying specific steps for classifying the given string), we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition \( <P> \)**: Identify the main assertion or claim made in the string.
2. **Identify the Reason \( <R> \)**: Identify the causal basis submitted for the Proposition \( <P> \).
3. **Evaluate the Causal Basis**: Determine if the causal relationship between \( <R> \) and \( <P> \) is compelling or logically valid.
4. **Classify the Argument Type**: Based on the evaluation, classify the argument as one of the defective types \( <G> \), \( <FE> \), \( <IR> \), \( <RR> \), \( <WCB> \), \( <FU> \), or \( <DEP> \).

### Step-by-Step Application:

1. **Identify the Proposition \( <P> \)**:
   - The main assertion in the string is: "They claimed to have brought the snow."

2. **Identify the Reason \( <R> \)**:
   - The causal basis given for the assertion is: "Lois and Jan did a 'snow dance' one afternoon, and it snowed that night."

3. **Evaluate the Causal Basis**:
   - The argument suggests a cause-and-effect relationship between the "snow dance" and the subsequent snowfall.

4. **Classify the Argument Type**:
   - We need to check if the reasoning provided is logically valid. In this case, the claim that doing a "snow dance" caused it to snow falls into the category of assuming a causal relationship without sufficient evidence.

### Final Classification: <WCB>

The argument presented in the string "Lois and Jan did a 'snow dance' one afternoon, and it snowed that night. They claimed to have brought the snow." contains the fallacy of **Insufficient Causal Basis**. The Reason (\( <R> \))—that the snow dance caused the snow—is not a compelling causal basis to support the Proposition (\( <P> \)) that they brought the snow. Thus, this is classified as a defective argument of type \( <WCB> \).
