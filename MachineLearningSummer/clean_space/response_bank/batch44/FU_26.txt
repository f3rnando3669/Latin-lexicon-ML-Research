For 
To classify the argument "All professional athletes use Apple watches to track their training, so our team needs to purchase Apple watches for everyone." appropriately, we need to follow a structured approach. Here is the detailed decomposition and application of the task:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of the Task (D)

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Find the main assertion or statement that is being made or implied in the argument.
   
2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Determine the causal basis or reasoning provided to support the Proposition.
   
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR), if any:**
   - Look for any additional arguments or evidence used to corroborate the Reason.
   
4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:**
   - Compare the identified structure with known defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) and classify the argument appropriately.

### Applying the Decomposition to the Specific Argument (IDAA)

#### 1. Identify the Proposition (P)
- **Proposition (P):** "Our team needs to purchase Apple watches for everyone."

#### 2. Identify the Reason (R)
- **Reason (R):** "All professional athletes use Apple watches to track their training."

#### 3. Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
- There is no additional argument or evidence provided beyond the Reason. The argument relies solely on the statement that professional athletes use Apple watches. 

#### 4. Classify the Defective Argument Type

Using the identified Proposition (P) and Reason (R), we compare with the known defective argument types:

- **Generalization (<G>):** Not applicable here because the argument does not extend specific instances to a general claim.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Not applicable here because it does not present a binary choice or a false dichotomy.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Not applicable as the reason aligns correctly with the proposition without inherently lacking relevancy.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Not applicable since the Reason is not repeating the Proposition.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Applicable. The reason provided suggests causation without sufficient evidence. Just because professional athletes use Apple watches does not mean it is necessary or the best option for all teams.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Also applicable. The argument assumes that because "everyone (all professional athletes)" is doing it, it must be the correct action to follow.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Not applicable as there is no ambiguity in the language used.

### Conclusion

The argument can be classified as both **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)** and **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**. However, the most salient classification here would be **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)** since it directly appeals to the idea that something must be right because everyone else is doing it.

Therefore, the final classification is:

**"All professional athletes use Apple watches to track their training, so our team needs to purchase Apple watches for everyone."** is of type **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**.
