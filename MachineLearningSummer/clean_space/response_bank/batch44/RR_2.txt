For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of IDA into specific steps) to classify the given string "God exists because the Bible says so. The Bible is a reliable source because it is the word of God.", we need to follow a step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Understand the Argument Structure
The first step is to break down the given string into its component parts (Proposition, Reason, and the Proof of Reason):

1. **Proposition (P):** "God exists."
2. **Reason (R):** "because the Bible says so."
3. **Proof of Reason (PR):** "The Bible is a reliable source because it is the word of God."

### Step 2: Identify the Argument Type
Next, we'll classify the defective argument type by analyzing what's wrong with the **Reason** and **Proof of Reason**:

- **Reason (R) Analysis:** The reason provided for the proposition "God exists" is that "the Bible says so."
- **Proof of Reason (PR) Analysis:** The proof that the Bible is a reliable source is that "it is the word of God."

### Step 3: Match with Defined Defective Argument Types
Now that we have the **Reason** and **Proof of Reason** identified and understood, we need to see which defective argument type it matches. Here's a quick review of the defective argument types:

1. **<G> - Generalization:** An assertion about all instances based on some instances.
2. **<FE> - Incomplete Enumeration:** Claiming to have considered all possibilities but missing pertinent ones.
3. **<IR> - Inconclusive Reason:** Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
4. **<RR> - Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** Reason simply repeats the proposition without adding anything new.
5. **<WCB> - Insufficient Causal Basis:** The causal basis for the reason is weak or not compelling.
6. **<FU> - Presumptuous Consensus:** Assuming something is true because it is widely believed or popular.
7. **<DEP> - Ambiguous Language Use:** Using language that can be taken in another sense than intended.

### Step 4: Analyze for Circular Reasoning/Faulty Repetition (RR)
Looking closely, we see that the reason ultimately relies on the proof of reason without providing independent justification:

- **Circular Reasoning:** "God exists because the Bible says so. The Bible is a reliable source because it is the word of God."
- The argument's reason and proof of reason essentially repeat the initial proposition, leading to circular reasoning.

### Step 5: Conclusion
Given our analysis, the defective argument type for the string "God exists because the Bible says so. The Bible is a reliable source because it is the word of God." is **<RR> - Faulty Repetition of Proposition**.

Thus, classifying the given string using IDAA we conclude:

**<RR>**
