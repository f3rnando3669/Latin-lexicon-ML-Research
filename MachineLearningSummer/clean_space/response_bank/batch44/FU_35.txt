For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition method) to the given task of classifying the string based on the logical fallacy it commits, we'll break down the steps systematically. 

**Step 1: Understand the string <s>**

**String (s):**  
"I know the Professor said that the Bridges of Madison County was smarmy trash and lacked any artistic worth. But I still think he's wrong. After all, it was on the best-seller list for over 100 weeks."

**Step 2: Identify the Argument**

- The Professor made a claim: "The Bridges of Madison County" is smarmy trash and lacks artistic worth.
- The counterclaim is that the Professor is wrong.
- Justification for the counterclaim: The book was on the best-seller list for over 100 weeks.

**Step 3: Determine the Type of Fallacy**

Examine the justification for the counterclaim:
- The counterclaim that the Professor is wrong is solely based on the book's popularity (being on the best-seller list for over 100 weeks) rather than addressing the Professor's arguments about the book's artistic merit.

**Step 4: Compare with Definitions**

- **<G> (Generalization):** No broad assumptions are made about a group based on this.
- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):** This is not presenting an incomplete list of possibilities.
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** This doesn't quite fit, as it's not providing a weak reason directly correlating to the proposition.
- **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** This isn't saying the same thing in a different way.
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** Doesn't quite fit, as it's not assuming causation from correlation.
- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):** Matches the pattern! It appeals to popularity as the reasoning (argumentum ad populum).
- **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):** There's no ambiguous language used in the argument.

**Step 5: Classify**

The identified fallacy in the argument is **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)** because it relies on the book's popularity (sales figures) to refute a claim about its artistic worth.

**Conclusion**
The logical fallacy committed in this argument is an example of **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**.
