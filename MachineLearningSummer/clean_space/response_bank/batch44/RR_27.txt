For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the argument "Whatever is less dense than water will float, because such objects won't sink in water," we need to break the task into specific steps. Here’s the decomposition:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>) of <IDA>:
1. Parse the given argument and identify <P> and <R>.
2. Examine the relationship between <P> and <R>.
3. Identify the general form of the argument type.
4. Match the characteristics of the argument with the definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.
5. Conclude the classification of the argument.

### Apply <D> to <IDA>

#### Step 1: Parse the given argument and identify <P> and <R>
- **Proposition (<P>):** "Whatever is less dense than water will float."
- **Reason (<R>):** "Such objects won't sink in water."

#### Step 2: Examine the relationship between <P> and <R>
- The reason given is that objects less dense than water won’t sink, which is restating in a different form that they will float.

#### Step 3: Identify the general form of the argument type
- Look for patterns or characteristics that fit into one of our predefined defective argument types.

#### Step 4: Match the characteristics of the argument with the definitions:
- **Generalization (<G>):** Not applicable, no broad generalization of a small sample to all cases.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Not applicable, doesn't present a dichotomy.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** **Not applicable**, while the reason might be considered restating, it completes a logical explanation.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This matches since the reason for the proposition is essentially a restatement of the proposition itself, not providing new information or supporting evidence.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Not applicable, it doesn't provide a weak causal basis but rather a tautological restatement.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Not applicable, doesn't appeal to consensus.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Not applicable, isn't relying on ambiguous language usage.

#### Step 5: Conclude the classification of the argument
- The argument fits the classification of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)** because it uses circular reasoning, where the proposition "Whatever is less dense than water will float" is supported by the reason that "such objects won't sink in water," which is essentially repeating the same idea.

Thus, the argument "Whatever is less dense than water will float, because such objects won't sink in water" can be classified as of type **<RR>**.
