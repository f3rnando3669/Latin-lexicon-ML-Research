For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the statement "blame opponent's policy for the country's problems," follow the prescribed steps systematically. 

### Step 1: Identify the Components and Context
First, let's break down the statement and identify its context:
- **Proposition (P):** The country's problems
- **Potential Reason (R):** The opponent's policy is the cause of the country's problems
- **Potential Proof of Reason (PR):** Examining if there are any arguments or additional details that corroborate this reason for the proposition.

### Step 2: Analyze the Types of Defective Arguments
Next, classify the argument as one of the defective types:
1. **Generalization (<G>):** Does the statement rely on broad, sweeping assertions about groups or situations?
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Does the statement present an either/or scenario without considering other possibilities?
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Does the statement use an inconclusive or tangential reason to support the proposition?
4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Does the argument repeat the proposition as its reason?
5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Is the causal reason proposed weak or inadequate?
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Does the claim rely on the notion that many people believe it, so it must be true?
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Does it use language that can be interpreted in multiple ways?

### Step 3: Classify the Statement
Now, let's analyze the statement "blame opponent's policy for the country's problems" in light of these defective argument types:

- The assertion is that the opponent's policy is directly responsible for the country's problems without providing concrete evidence or a strong causal link.
- The statement lacks a detailed analysis and relies on attributing general problems to the opponent's policy, typically seen during political debates or campaigns.

Given this, the most fitting defective argument type here is:
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The reason offered (opponent's policy) is likely not a strong or compelling causal basis for the proposition (country's problems).

### Conclusion
**Classification:** The statement "blame opponent's policy for the country's problems" is best classified under **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
