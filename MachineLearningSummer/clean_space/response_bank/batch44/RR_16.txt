For 
To apply the decomposition process for the classification task <IDAA> to the given proposition "All useless laws, such as Reform Bill 13, should be repealed.", we'll break down the task into specific steps and classify the argument accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition and Reasoning:**
   - Proposition (\<P>): "All useless laws, such as Reform Bill 13, should be repealed."
   - Reason (\<R>): The law is useless.

2. **Analyze the Reasoning:**
   - The reasoning provided for the proposition is that the law in question, along with others classified as "useless," should be repealed.

3. **Evaluate Reasoning for Defective Argument Types:**
   - Check for Defective Argument Types as per the definitions provided:
     1. **Generalization (\<G>)**: 
        - The proposition does not seem to assert a generalization based on a limited set of examples. It directly states a specific law and classifies it.

     2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE>)**: 
        - The proposition implies that all “useless laws” should be repealed without enumeration of which laws are useless; however, the argument as presented does not force a binary choice or miss pertinent possibilities.

     3. **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>)**: 
        - The reason "useless" is taken as an established fact without conclusive proof. "Reform Bill 13 is useless" is an assertion needing proof which is not provided.

     4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR>)**: 
        - The statement might be circular if "useless" implicitly means "should be repealed" without additional proof.

     5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB>)**: 
        - Here, "useless" is a subjective judgment without a detailed causal basis for repeal. The causal link between being "useless" and requiring repeal isn't established.

     6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU>)**: 
        - The reasoning does not rely on a "presumptuous consensus"; it does not claim that others' agreement on the uselessness of the law supports its repeal.

     7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP>)**: 
        - The term "useless" is subjective and ambiguous, and could be taken in different ways. What defines a law as "useless" is not clearly explained.

4. **Classification:**
   - The argument could fall under **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP>)** due to the term "useless" being not clearly defined, leading to potential misunderstanding.
   - Additionally, it has components of **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB>)** because the provided reason “useless” does not have a detailed causal explanation of why the law should be repealed.

### Final Classification
The argument "All useless laws, such as Reform Bill 13, should be repealed" is of type:

**<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)** and partially **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.

Thereby, the term "useless" is vague and lacks a clearly defined basis for repeal, leading to potential ambiguity and a lack of sufficient reasoning to connect the fact that a law is “useless” to the necessity of repeal.
