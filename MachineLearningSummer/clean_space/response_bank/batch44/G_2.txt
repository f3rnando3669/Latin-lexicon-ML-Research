For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "We can’t legalize marijuana; if we do, then the next thing you know people will be strung out on heroin," we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify and Understand the Statement (<s>):**
   - **Statement (<s>):** "We can’t legalize marijuana; if we do, then the next thing you know people will be strung out on heroin."

2. **Break Down the Statement for Analysis:**
   - **Proposition (<P>):** "We can’t legalize marijuana"
   - **Reason (<R>):** "if we do, then the next thing you know people will be strung out on heroin"
   - **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Implied chain of causality from marijuana legalization to heroin use.

3. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:**
   - **Types to Consider:**
     - Generalization (<G>)
     - Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
     - Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
     - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
     - Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
     - Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
     - Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)

4. **Analyze the Reason (R) for Faults:**
   - The argument presented posits a slippery slope from legalizing marijuana to widespread heroin use without sufficient causal link or evidence.

5. **Determine the Most Fitting Defective Argument Type:**
   - The statement suggests that legalizing marijuana will lead to a severe and unrelated consequence (heroin use) without providing evidence for the intermediate steps necessary to establish such a progression.

6. **Final Classification of the Defective Argument Type:**
   - **Type (<WCB>):** Insufficient Causal Basis, because the reason given does not provide compelling or direct causative evidence linking marijuana legalization to heroin use.

**Final Step-by-Step Decomposition Result:**

1. **Identify and Understand the Statement (<s>):**
   - **Statement (<s>):** "We can’t legalize marijuana; if we do, then the next thing you know people will be strung out on heroin."

2. **Break Down the Statement for Analysis:**
   - **Proposition (<P>):** "We can’t legalize marijuana"
   - **Reason (<R>):** "if we do, then the next thing you know people will be strung out on heroin"
   - **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Implied chain of causality from marijuana legalization to heroin use.

3. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:**
   - **Types to Consider:**
     - Generalization (<G>)
     - Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
     - Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
     - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
     - Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
     - Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
     - Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)

4. **Analyze the Reason (R) for Faults:**
   - The argument presented posits a slippery slope from legalizing marijuana to widespread heroin use without sufficient causal link or evidence.

5. **Determine the Most Fitting Defective Argument Type:**
   - **Type (<WCB>):** Insufficient Causal Basis, because the reason given does not provide compelling or direct causative evidence linking marijuana legalization to heroin use.

Therefore, the statement "We can’t legalize marijuana; if we do, then the next thing you know people will be strung out on heroin" is best classified as of type **<WCB>** Insufficient Causal Basis.
