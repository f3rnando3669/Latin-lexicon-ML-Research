To apply the task of classifying the argument "Look, you are going to have to make up your mind. Either you decide that you can afford this stereo, or you decide you are going to do without music for a while" as one of the defective argument types, we'll decompose the task into specific steps and execute them accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of Classifying the Argument:

1. **Identify the structure of the argument:**
   - The argument consists of two choices presented in a way that forces a decision between them.

2. **Determine if multiple options are presented:**
   - The argument presents only two choices without considering other possible alternatives.

3. **Check for logical fallacies:**
   - Analyze whether presenting only two choices ignores other possibilities that may exist.

4. **Classify the argument based on the criteria from the definitions provided:**
   - Match the argument observed to one of the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Execution of the Steps:

1. **Identify the structure of the argument:**
   - The statement provides two choices: (A) deciding that you can afford the stereo, or (B) deciding to do without music.

2. **Determine if multiple options are presented:**
   - The statement does not present any other options besides affording the stereo or doing without music.

3. **Check for logical fallacies:**
   - This presentation can be considered a false dilemma (also known as black-and-white thinking), where the argument forces a choice between two extreme positions, ignoring other potential alternatives (e.g., saving money, considering financing, or finding a cheaper option).

4. **Classify the argument:**
   - From the definitions provided, the argument appears to show characteristics of defective argument type called **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, which presents only two choices when more logically valid options exist and are omitted for rhetorical effect.

### Conclusion:

The argument "Look, you are going to have to make up your mind. Either you decide that you can afford this stereo, or you decide you are going to do without music for a while" should be classified as **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**.
