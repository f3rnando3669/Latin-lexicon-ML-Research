For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string, we will use the following steps:

1. **Identify the propositions <P>, Reason <R>, and Proof of Reason <PR> if present.**
2. **Classify the defect in the argument according to the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.**
3. **Provide justification for the classification based on the defective argument types.**

### Step 1: Identify Propositions, Reason, and Proof of Reason

**Proposition (P):** "Captain Shah must have been the individual who caused the crash."

**Reason (R):** "A news story that reported that Captain Shah was under investigation was shared widely on social media."

### Step 2: Classify the Defect in the Argument

In this case, the defect in the argument appears to be assuming that because Captain Shah was under investigation and the news story was widely shared, this necessarily means he caused the crash. This involves a presumptuous assumption and reliance on social consensus without concrete evidence.

### Step 3: Justification for Classification

Based on the evidence and reasoning, the defective argument type can be classified as **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>**. 

- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** The argument assumes that because the news story about Captain Shah being under investigation was widely shared on social media, it must be true that he caused the crash. It relies on the presumed consensus established by the wide sharing of the story rather than providing solid proof or factual evidence.

### Conclusion

The string "A news story that reported that Captain Shah was under investigation was shared widely on social media. He must have been the individual who caused the crash." is an example of the defective argument type **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>**.
