To apply **<IDAA>** to "My new sport psychology intervention works! I chose the player with the lowest batting average based on the last game from each of the teams in our amateur baseball league. Then I gave each of them my 5-minute intervention. And almost all of them improved their batting average in the next game!", we need to decompose **<IDA>** into its specific steps first. Here’s the step-by-step breakdown of the decomposition process **<D>** for the task of identifying the defective argument type **<IDA>**:

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine what the proposition is that the argument is attempting to prove.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine the causal basis offered as the reason for <P>.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Look for any evidence or corroboration meant to support <R>.

4. **Analyze the Argument for Defectiveness:**
   - Examine the argument for inconsistencies, weaknesses, or logical fallacies that render it defective.

5. **Classify the Argument Type:**
   - Based on the analysis above, classify the argument as one of the defective types: **<G>**, **<FE>**, **<IR>**, **<RR>**, **<WCB>**, **<FU>**, or **<DEP>**.

### Application of **<IDAA>**:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - **<P>:** The new sport psychology intervention works.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - **<R>:** After a 5-minute intervention, players improved their batting average in the next game.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - **<PR>:** The intervention was applied to players with the lowest batting averages from each team, and most improved in a subsequent game.

4. **Analyze the Argument for Defectiveness:**
   - The argument assumes that the 5-minute intervention is the cause for improvement.
   - Fails to consider alternative explanations such as natural variability, particularly the statistical phenomenon of "regression to the mean," where exceptionally low performances are likely to be followed by more average performances purely by chance.
   - Lack of control group: there’s no comparison to players who did not receive the intervention.
   - The improvement could be due to numerous other factors unrelated to the intervention.

5. **Classify the Argument Type:**
   - **<WCB>** — Insufficient Causal Basis: The reason provided doesn't compellingly demonstrate that the intervention caused the improvement <P>, especially given the likely impact of regression to the mean.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and applying the step-by-step decomposition, the argument "My new sport psychology intervention works! I chose the player with the lowest batting average based on the last game from each of the teams in our amateur baseball league. Then I gave each of them my 5-minute intervention. And almost all of them improved their batting average in the next game!" can be classified as **<WCB>** - Insufficient Causal Basis, due to the weak causal link between the intervention and the improvement observed.
