For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the string "We know he’s not lying since he says he’s telling the truth," we need to follow these defined steps:

1. **Identify the Argument's Purpose**: Determine what is being argued or claimed in the string.
2. **Determine the Proposition (<P>)**: Identify what the main assertion or claim (<P>) is.
3. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the basis or reason (<R>) given to support the proposition.
4. **Examine the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Check for any proofs or additional arguments provided to validate the reason.
5. **Classify the Argument Type**: Based on the identified elements, classify the argument as one of the defective types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

Let's perform each step for the given string:

### Step 1: Identify the Argument's Purpose
The purpose of the argument in the string "We know he’s not lying since he says he’s telling the truth" is to establish the truthfulness of a person based on their own statement.

### Step 2: Determine the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition (<P>) is: "We know he’s not lying."

### Step 3: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason (<R>) provided is: "since he says he’s telling the truth."

### Step 4: Examine the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
There are no additional arguments or proofs provided to validate the reason. The reason itself is being used directly to support the proposition, without further evidence.

### Step 5: Classify the Argument Type
Now we need to classify the argument based on the types given:

- **<G>**: Generalization
- **<FE>**: Incomplete Enumeration
- **<IR>**: Inconclusive Reason
- **<RR>**: Faulty Repetition of Proposition
- **<WCB>**: Insufficient Causal Basis
- **<FU>**: Presumptuous Consensus
- **<DEP>**: Ambiguous Language Use

The argument "We know he’s not lying since he says he’s telling the truth" is a form of **circular reasoning** where the conclusion (he’s not lying) is supported by a premise that essentially restates the conclusion (he says he’s telling the truth). This fits under the type **<RR>**: Faulty Repetition of Proposition.

Thus, according to the decomposition and step-by-step analysis, the given string "We know he’s not lying since he says he’s telling the truth" is classified as type **<RR>**.
