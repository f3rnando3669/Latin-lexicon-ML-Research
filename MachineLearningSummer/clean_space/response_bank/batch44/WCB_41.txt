For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the statement "I ate Oreos, and then I was sick the next day. It must have been the Oreos that caused my sickness.", we will decompose the classification task into systematic steps.

### Decomposition of <IDA> (Classifying the Statement)

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**
- The **Proposition** (P) is: "It must have been the Oreos that caused my sickness."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)**
- The **Reason** (R) is: "I ate Oreos, and then I was sick the next day."

**Step 3: Evaluate the Logical Structure**
- We need to assess whether the Reason (R) conclusively establishes the Proposition (P).

**Step 4: Determine the Defective Argument Type**

Examining the possible defective argument types:
1. <G> Generalization - Not applicable; the argument is specific to one incident.
2. <FE> Incomplete Enumeration - Not applicable; there is no false dilemma or limited choices presented.
3. <IR> Inconclusive Reason - Possible; the reason might not conclusively prove the correlation.
4. <RR> Faulty Repetition - Not applicable; no circular reasoning is present.
5. <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis - Possibly applicable; the Reason (R) might not be sufficient to claim causation conclusively.
6. <FU> Presumptuous Consensus - Not applicable; no mention of consensus or popularity.
7. <DEP> Ambiguous Language Use - Not applicable; no ambiguous language.

**Step 5: Final Classification**
- Since the Reason (R) does not provide a strong causative link to the Proposition (P) and suggests a causal relationship based on a temporal sequence alone, the Reason (R) presents an insufficient causality.

Therefore, the statement "I ate Oreos, and then I was sick the next day. It must have been the Oreos that caused my sickness." can be classified as of type:

- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**

### Application of <IDAA>
1. **Decompose the task of classification:** 
    - Identify Proposition (P)
    - Identify Reason (R)
    - Evaluate logical structure
    - Determine applicable defective argument type
2. **Identify (P):** "It must have been the Oreos that caused my sickness."
3. **Identify (R):** "I ate Oreos, and then I was sick the next day."
4. **Evaluate logical structure:** The reason provided does not conclusively establish causation.
5. **Determine defective argument type:** This falls under <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis, due to the weak causal link inferred based on temporal association.

The classification for "I ate Oreos, and then I was sick the next day. It must have been the Oreos that caused my sickness." is: **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**.
