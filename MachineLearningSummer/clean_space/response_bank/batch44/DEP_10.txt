To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying the string into its respective type of defective argument), we will break down the process into specific steps:

1. **Read the string to understand its context and content**:
    - *Bernice*: Do you support Black Lives Matter?
    - *Mildred*: Of course, I do!
    - *Bernice*: Then you should support me looting that store.
    - *Mildred*: Wait... what?

2. **Identify the propositions and reasoning within the string**:
    - Proposition (P) 1: Do you support Black Lives Matter?
    - Proposition (P) 2: Then you should support me looting that store.
    - Response (R): Of course, I do!
    - Confused Response: Wait, what?

3. **Analyze the type of argument and determine if it fits any of the defective argument types**:
    - Identify any logical fallacies or defective reasoning within the conversation.
    - Look for patterns of reasoning and assumptions within Bernice's argument.

4. **Determine the specific type of defective argument**:
    - Evaluate whether Bernice's argument makes an unjustifiable leap from supporting a movement (Black Lives Matter) to supporting a specific illegal act (looting).

Based on the conversation, Bernice is suggesting that supporting Black Lives Matter inherently means supporting looting a store, which is a false assumption. This is not a clear case of generalization (<G>), or incomplete enumeration (<FE>), nor an inconclusive reason (<IR>), faulty repetition (<RR>), insufficient causal basis (<WCB>), presumptuous consensus (<FU>), or ambiguous language use (<DEP>).

The type of logical fallacy here best matches the **False Dilemma** or **False Equivalence** fallacy: Bernice implies that supporting a social movement (Black Lives Matter) equates to supporting illegal activities like looting.

5. **Classify the string under the appropriate defective argument type**:
    - The string falls under **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** because the reasoning does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition that supporting Black Lives Matter equivalently means supporting looting.

Therefore, by following the steps in <IDAA>, we classify the string "Bernice: Do you support Black Lives Matter? Mildred: Of course, I do! Bernice: Then you should support me looting that store. Mildred: Wait... what?" as an **example of an Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**.
