For 
To apply **<IDAA>** to the task of classifying the string "You moved the goalposts or made up an exception when your claim was shown to be false," we need to break down the process of identifying the logical fallacy in this statement step by step.

**Step 1: Understand the Statement**
- "You moved the goalposts or made up an exception when your claim was shown to be false" means someone changed the criteria or added exceptions when their original claim was proven incorrect.

**Step 2: Identify the Nature of the Fallacy**
- Determine the primary nature of the fallacy from the options <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.
 
**Step 3: Check Each Fallacy Definition**
1. **<G> (Generalization)**: This involves making a broad assertion based on limited evidence. This does not fit as the statement involves changing criteria rather than generalizing.
   
2. **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: This involves missing out on relevant possibilities. This does not fit as the statement does not involve an enumeration process.

3. **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: This involves conclusions that are not sufficiently supported by the given reasons. The statement in question deals with changing the criteria after a claim is shown to be false, which is different.

4. **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: This involves repeating the same claim without new evidence. The statement does not fit this definition because it involves changing criteria, not repeat of proposition.

5. **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: This involves weak or insufficient causal connections. The statement does not involve causal connections at all.

6. **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: This involves assuming something is true because it is believed by many. The statement does not fit this definition, as it deals with changing criteria rather than consensus.

7. **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: This involves using ambiguous language that can be interpreted in multiple ways. The statement is not dealing with ambiguous language, but rather changing criteria when a claim is shown false.

**Step 4: Match Correct Definition**
- The correct match for the statement is not any of the fallacies listed. Instead, the statement "You moved the goalposts or made up an exception when your claim was shown to be false" precisely identifies the **fallacy of 'Moving the Goalposts.'**

**Step 5: Document the Conclusion**
- Since "Moving the Goalposts" is not explicitly listed among the given fallacies, we need to acknowledge the mismatch with the provided options.

In conclusion, while "Moving the Goalposts" is identified as a viable fallacy outside the provided categories, none of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP> fits perfectly. Therefore, we conclude that none of the provided options directly classify this specific fallacy.
