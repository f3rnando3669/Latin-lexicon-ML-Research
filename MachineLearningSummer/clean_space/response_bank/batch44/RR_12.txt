For 
To classify the statement "Being overweight leads to a shortened lifespan because it's unhealthy," we can break it down step by step using <IDAA>. 

1. **Identify the argument components**:
   - **Proposition (P)**: Being overweight leads to a shortened lifespan.
   - **Reason (R)**: It's unhealthy.

2. **Decompose into specific steps** to identify the correct category:
   - **Step 1: Analyze the logical structure**: 
     - Evaluate whether the Reason (R) truly supports the Proposition (P).
   
   - **Step 2: Determine if there is sufficient causal basis**:
     - Assess whether "unhealthy" is a compelling and sufficient reason for a shortened lifespan.

   - **Step 3: Cross-check against defined defective argument types**:
     - Generalization (G)
     - Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
     - Inconclusive Reason (IR)
     - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
     - Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
     - Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
     - Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)
     
   - **Step 4: Match the statement to the most fitting defective argument type**.

3. **Application to the statement step-by-step**:

   - **Step 1: Analyze logical structure**:
     - Proposition (P): “Being overweight leads to a shortened lifespan.”
     - Reason (R): “It's unhealthy.”

   - **Step 2: Determine if there is sufficient causal basis**:
     - Does "being unhealthy" definitively explain why being overweight shortens lifespan?
     - "Unhealthy" is a broad term and can encompass a variety of factors. If the argument doesn’t provide specific health-related issues that directly link to a shortened lifespan, the reason may be insufficient.

   - **Step 3: Cross-check against defective argument types**:
     - Does it generalize without sufficient evidence? 
       (No, it doesn’t make a broad generalization applicable to all cases)
     
     - Is it an incomplete enumeration? 
       (No, it doesn’t claim to enumerate all possibilities but misses pertinent ones)
     
     - Does it present an inconclusive reason? 
       (Possibly, "unhealthy" does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of "shortened lifespan")
     
     - Is there a faulty repetition of Proposition?
       (No, the reason ("unhealthy") is not a direct restatement of the proposition)
     
     - Is there an insufficient causal basis? 
       (Possibly, “unhealthy” is not specific or sufficiently compelling to establish "shortened lifespan" definitively)
     
     - Is it a presumptuous consensus? 
       (No, it does not rely on presumed universal agreement)
     
     - Is it ambiguous language use? 
       (No, the language is clear and not misleadingly ambiguous)

   - **Step 4: Match the statement to the most fitting defective argument type**:
     - The most fitting type for this argument appears to be **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because "it's unhealthy" doesn’t sufficiently and specifically explain why being overweight directly causes a shortened lifespan.

Therefore, the statement "Being overweight leads to a shortened lifespan because it's unhealthy" would be classified as type **<WCB>** (Insufficient Causal Basis).
