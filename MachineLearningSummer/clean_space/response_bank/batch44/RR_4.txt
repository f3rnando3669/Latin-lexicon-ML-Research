For 
To apply the decomposition of the task of classifying the argument "Tik Tok is popular among teens because so many of them use it" into specific steps (IDAA), we will break down the process of identifying the type of defective argument as follows:

1. **Understand the Argument:**
   - Examine the argument to understand its structure and the claim it is making.
   - Identify the proposition (\<P\>) and the reason (\<R\>).

2. **Identify Key Elements:**
   - Recognize any key terms or phrases that indicate the type of reasoning or logic used.
   - Look for clues that might signal a specific type of defective argument.

3. **Compare with Defined Types:**
   - Compare the argument with each type of defective argument \(G\), \(FE\), \(IR\), \(RR\), \(WCB\), \(FU\), and \(DEP\).
   - Determine which type it matches based on the definitions provided.

4. **Classify the Argument:**
   - Assign the argument to the most fitting defective argument type based on the analysis.

Let's apply these steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Argument
The argument states that "Tik Tok is popular among teens because so many of them use it."

- **Proposition (\<P\>):** Tik Tok is popular among teens.
- **Reason (\<R\>):** Because so many of them use it.

### Step 2: Identify Key Elements
- The key term here is "popular" and the justification for it being popular is the high number of users.

### Step 3: Compare with Defined Types

- **\(G\) (Generalization):** The argument is not generalizing based on a subset's characteristics to a whole set; it simply describes popularity based on usage.
  
- **\(FE\) (Incomplete Enumeration):** The argument doesn't present a scenario where possibilities are omitted; it focuses on a single reason for popularity.
  
- **\(IR\) (Inconclusive Reason):** The reason given does not conclusively explain popularity but operates on correlation. However, it's not solely about reason failure.

- **\(RR\) (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** The reason here essentially reiterates the proposition. Tik Tok's popularity is justified solely by its usage, which is a repetition in essence.
  
- **\(WCB\) (Insufficient Causal Basis):** This focuses on an unconvincing causal link; while related, this doesn't seem to fit precisely here.

- **\(FU\) (Presumptuous Consensus):** This is a likely candidate because it involves assuming something's validity based on widespread acceptance or use.

- **\(DEP\) (Ambiguous Language Use):** There is no ambiguous term creating confusion.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument

The argument "Tik Tok is popular among teens because so many of them use it" best matches <FU>:
- **\(FU\) (Presumptuous Consensus):** The argument relies on the popularity of Tik Tok based on the number of users, which implies that the reason for its popularity is universally accepted due to its widespread use.

Hence, the argument "Tik Tok is popular among teens because so many of them use it" is classified as <FU>.
