Sure, let's apply the decomposition of the task of classifying the given argument according to the defined types step by step.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Analysis:

1. **Identifying the Parts of the Argument**:
   - **Proposition (<P>)**: The main claim being made.
     - "Standardized dress should be used in schools."
   - **Reason (<R>)**: The justification provided for the proposition.
     - "because kids should wear standardized dress."

2. **Checking for Correspondence Between <P> and <R>**:
   - Verify if the reason given actually justifies or provides a new insight for the proposition.
     - Proposition: "Standardized dress should be used in schools."
     - Reason: "because kids should wear standardized dress."
   - Observation: The reason provided simply restates the initial proposition without offering any new evidence or justification.

3. **Classifying the Argument Type**:
   - Given the reason is merely a repetition of the proposition, rather than providing an actual causal basis or additive justification, this indicates a form of circular reasoning.

4. **Mapping to Defined Defective Argument Types**:
   - **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: The reason essentially repeats the proposition in different words.

### Conclusion:

The argument "Standardized dress should be used in schools because kids should wear standardized dress." falls under the defect type **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**.

Thus, applying the methodical decomposition to classify the argument, we identify it as:

**<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**.
