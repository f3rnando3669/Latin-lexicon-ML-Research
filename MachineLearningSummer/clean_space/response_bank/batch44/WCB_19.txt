To decompose the task of classifying the given argument "Our garage sale made lots of money before Joan showed up. Obviously, she scared off all the customers." into specific steps, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition or claim seems to be:
- "Joan scared off all the customers."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason given for the proposition is:
- "Our garage sale made lots of money before Joan showed up."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
There is no additional proof provided other than the claim that the garage sale was successful before Joan's arrival.

### Step 4: Analyze the Argument Structure
Ensure that the argument structure conforms to the definitions provided for types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

### Step 5: Compare Argument to Defined Defective Types
#### Generalization (<G>):
- This type involves making a broad claim from a specific instance. The argument doesn't generalize beyond Joan or the garage sale context.

#### Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):
- This type suggests presenting limited possibilities as exhaustive. The argument doesn't seem to present limited choices or possibilities that ignore alternatives.

#### Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):
- This occurs when the reason doesn't conclusively support the proposition. It actually seems like what we might classify this argument as, but let's consider the causal basis more closely.

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):
- This type involves circular reasoning or restating the proposition as the reason. This argument doesn't restate the proposition in this way.

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):
- This occurs when the reason given for a proposition is not a compelling causal link. The argument attributes the drop in customer turnout to Joan's arrival without sufficient evidence linking the two (it’s a classic example of confusing correlation with causation).

#### Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):
- This involves claiming something is true because it is universally agreed upon. This argument does not appeal to consensus.

#### Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):
- This involves using ambiguous or double-meaning terms. The argument doesn't use ambiguous terms.

### Step 6: Assign the Argument Type
Based on the analysis:
- The given argument "Our garage sale made lots of money before Joan showed up. Obviously, she scared off all the customers." fits most appropriately under **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** because the reason provided doesn’t conclusively demonstrate that Joan's arrival was the cause of the drop in customers. It assumes a causal relationship without sufficient evidence.

### Conclusion
Thus, "Our garage sale made lots of money before Joan showed up. Obviously, she scared off all the customers." is classified as <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
