For 
Let's apply the process of **IDAA** to classify the string "Tries to persuade the reader to do, think or buy something because it is popular or because "everyone" is doing it." into one of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

**Step-by-Step Decomposition (D):**

1. **Identify the core message of the string**: Understand what the string is attempting to convey in terms of argumentative or persuasive content.
2. **Recognize keywords or phrases**: Detect specific words or phrases that indicate the type of argument being used.
3. **Match the argument type**: Compare the identified core message and keywords to the definitions and examples provided to find the closest match.

**Step 1: Identify the core message**:
- **Core message**: The string talks about persuading the reader to take action, think a certain way, or buy something simply because it is what "everyone" is doing.

**Step 2: Recognize keywords or phrases**:
- **Keywords/Phrases**: "persuade the reader," "do, think or buy something," "because it is popular," "because 'everyone' is doing it."

**Step 3: Match the argument type**:
- Review the defective argument types:
  - **<G>**: Generalization
  - **<FE>**: Incomplete Enumeration
  - **<IR>**: Inconclusive Reason
  - **<RR>**: Faulty Repetition of Proposition
  - **<WCB>**: Insufficient Causal Basis
  - **<FU>**: Presumptuous Consensus
  - **<DEP>**: Ambiguous Language Use

- Based on the core message and keywords, the string emphasizes persuading the reader by appealing to popularity or the fact that many people are engaging in an activity, which perfectly matches **<FU>**: Presumptuous Consensus.

**Classification**:
- The correct classification for the string "Tries to persuade the reader to do, think or buy something because it is popular or because 'everyone' is doing it." is **<FU>**.
