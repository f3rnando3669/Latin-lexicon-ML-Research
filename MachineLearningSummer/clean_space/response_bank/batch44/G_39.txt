To classify the given string "Colin Closet asserts that if we allow same-sex couples to marry, then the next thing we know we'll be allowing people to marry their parents, their cars and even monkeys" as a type of defective argument, we will decompose the task into specific steps as follows:

### Decomposition of <t> into Specific Steps (Defining <D>):
1. **Identify the Core Proposition (<P>):** 
   - Identify the main claim or assertion being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine the reason provided to support the main claim.
3. **Examine the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Analyze any additional support given to corroborate the reason.
4. **Classify Argument Type:**
   - Compare against the predefined types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>.
   - Select the type that best matches the defective pattern observed in the argument.

### Application of <D> to <IDA> (Defining <IDAA>):
1. **Identify the Core Proposition (<P>):**
   - The core proposition is: "If we allow same-sex couples to marry."
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason provided is: "then the next thing we know we'll be allowing people to marry their parents, their cars and even monkeys."
3. **Examine the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - The proof of reason is not explicitly stated, but the claim is trying to create a slippery slope effect, i.e., suggesting an extreme and unlikely sequence of events as consequences of allowing same-sex marriage.
4. **Classify Argument Type:**
   - The argument does not fit as a Generalization (<G>) since it doesn't generalize a few instances to a broader conclusion.
   - It is not an Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>) because it does not claim to have covered all possibilities.
   - It does not present an Inconclusive Reason (<IR>) since the reasoning provided, while flawed, is specific rather than inconclusive.
   - It isn't a Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>) as it introduces new elements (parents, cars, monkeys).
   - It doesn't present an Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>) connected in an otherwise plausible but inadequate manner.
   - It’s not necessarily a Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>) as it does not claim universal agreement as proof of correctness.
   - It doesn’t involve Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

By the process of elimination and recognizing the slippery slope nature of the argument, it involves asserting that one action (allowing same-sex marriage) will inevitably lead to extreme and unrelated actions (marrying parents, cars, monkeys). 

**Conclusion:**
- The string "Colin Closet asserts that if we allow same-sex couples to marry, then the next thing we know we'll be allowing people to marry their parents, their cars and even monkeys" best fits the defective argument type **Slippery Slope**, which is technically classified under <G> (Generalization) because it generalizes a single decision to a chain of extreme and unfounded potential consequences.

Therefore, it can be identified as:
- **<G> (Generalization)** due to its slippery slope nature.
