For 
To apply <IDAA> to "fallacy suggesting that because everyone believes something or does something, it must be valid, accurate, or effective", we need to decompose the classification task into specific steps and systematically execute these steps. Here is the decomposition and the step-by-step process:

**Step 1: Understand the Nature of the Task**
- Task <IDA> requires classifying a given string based on predefined defective argument types.
- The given string describes a fallacy suggesting that if everyone believes or does something, it must be valid, accurate, or effective.

**Step 2: Review the Definitions of Each Defective Argument Type**
- **<G>: Generalization** - Broad assertions based on a subset of evidence.
- **<FE>: Incomplete Enumeration** - Claiming completeness of options while omitting some.
- **<IR>: Inconclusive Reason** - Reason provided does not conclusively support the proposition.
- **<RR>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition** - Repeating the same idea as proof without new evidence.
- **<WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis** - Weak causal connection between reason and proposition.
- **<FU>: Presumptuous Consensus** - Assuming an argument is valid because it is widely accepted.
- **<DEP>: Ambiguous Language Use** - Using ambiguous or double-meaning language leading to misunderstanding.

**Step 3: Analyze the Given String**
- The string "fallacy suggesting that because everyone believes something or does something, it must be valid, accurate, or effective" clearly describes a situation where the validity or correctness of something is assumed based on its popularity or common acceptance.
  
**Step 4: Match the Analysis to the Definitions**
- Given the string analysis and the fallacy it describes, we match this to the definition:
  - **<FU>: Presumptuous Consensus** - This exactly matches the provided description.

**Step 5: Confirm the Classification**
- Cross-check with the definition for <FU>: Presumptuous Consensus to verify.
  - This fallacy assumes an argument is valid because it is universally or widely accepted.

**Step 6: Finalize the Classification**
- Based on the matching, it is confirmed that the string best fits the defect type <FU>.

**Conclusion:**
Apply <IDAA> Step-by-step Result:
The string "fallacy suggesting that because everyone believes something or does something, it must be valid, accurate, or effective" is classified as **<FU>: Presumptuous Consensus**.
