For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "Fred, do you still cheat on your girlfriend?", we will decompose the task of classifying the statement into specific steps and then identify the type of defective argument it represents. Here are the steps for decomposition:

1. **Understand the Definitions**: Understand the different types of defective arguments provided (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).
2. **Analyze the Statement**: Break down the given statement into its core components.
3. **Identify Key Features**: Look for specific characteristics in the statement that match the definitions of the argument types.
4. **Match the Features**: Compare the identified features to the definitions of the argument types.
5. **Classify the Statement**: Assign the statement to the most appropriate argument type.

### Step 1: Understand the Definitions
- **<G> (Generalization)**: Makes broad claims based on insufficient evidence.
- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: Presents a dichotomy or false dilemma.
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: Uses insufficient reasoning or evidence to support the claim.
- **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: Circular reasoning or tautology.
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: Incorrectly attributes causation.
- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: Assumes something is true because many believe it.
- **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: Uses words with multiple meanings or ambiguous terms.

### Step 2: Analyze the Statement
- **Statement**: "Fred, do you still cheat on your girlfriend?"
- This is a question directed at Fred, implying a presupposition that Fred has cheated on his girlfriend at some point.

### Step 3: Identify Key Features
- **Key Feature**: The question presupposes a past action of "cheating" without establishing whether it actually happened.

### Step 4: Match the Features
- The key feature here is the assumption embedded in the question. This directly characterizes a **loaded question** because it implies guilt regardless of how Fred answers:
  - If Fred answers "yes", he confirms ongoing cheating.
  - If Fred answers "no", he implicitly confirms that he did cheat in the past.

### Step 5: Classify the Statement
- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)** encompasses **loaded questions**, which assume a certain premise is true by presenting it as a binary choice (yes/no) while ignoring other possible scenarios, thus presenting an incomplete enumeration of possibilities.

### Conclusion
The classification of the statement "Fred, do you still cheat on your girlfriend?" is:

- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**

This type matches the definition provided for **Incomplete Enumeration** because the statement presents a loaded question that forces an assumption about Fred's behavior.
