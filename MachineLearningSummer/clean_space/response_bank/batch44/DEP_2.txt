For 
To apply <IDAA> to "Noisy children are a real headache. Two aspirin will make a headache go away. Therefore, two aspirin will make noisy children go away," we need to decompose the task of classifying the statement into steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
Analyze the main claim or assertion that needs to be proven.

Proposition: 
"Two aspirin will make noisy children go away."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Find the causal basis provided to support the proposition.

Reason:
"Two aspirin will make a headache go away."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
Look for additional arguments that support the reason.

Proof of Reason:
This part is not explicitly provided in the statement. However, it implicitly relies on the known effectiveness of aspirin against headaches.

### Step 4: Determine the Type of Defective Argument
Analyze if the argument is defective and identify which type of defective argument it is.

### Analysis:

1. **Examine the connection between <P> and <R>:**
   - The proposition claims that aspirin, which treats physical headaches, can also "treat" noisy children.
   - The reason given is based on the effectiveness of aspirin in treating headaches.

2. **Evaluate the logical coherence:**
   - The argument uses the metaphorical expression "real headache" for noisy children and treats it literally, as if aspirin would have the same effect on the children as it does on a literal headache.

### Step 5: Classify the Defective Argument
Based on the analysis, classify the defective argument appropriately.

- **Type: Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**
  - The term "headache" is used ambiguously. It is first used metaphorically to describe the effect of noisy children and then literally to justify an illogical conclusion that aspirin can solve the metaphorical problem of noisy children by treating it as a literal headache.

### Conclusion:
The statement "Noisy children are a real headache. Two aspirin will make a headache go away. Therefore, two aspirin will make noisy children go away." is of type <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use).

By decomposing the task and analyzing each component step by step, we can confidently classify the argument as relying on ambiguous language.
