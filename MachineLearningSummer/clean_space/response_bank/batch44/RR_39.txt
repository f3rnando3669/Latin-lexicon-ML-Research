For 
To classify the string "This is an example of...." using <IDAA>, we will follow these specific steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Propositional Statement
- **Task**: Understand what the statement "This is an example of...." is trying to classify or explain.
- **Action**: Recognize that the statement is implying an example of some category or type. This implies there should be context or additional information following "...." that specifies the example.

### Step 2: Determine if the Statement Alone is Complete
- **Task**: Analyze if the given statement provides enough information to be classified.
- **Action**: Since the statement ends with "....," it is inherently incomplete. It requires context that is missing to identify what type of example is being referred to.

### Step 3: Check for Contextual Ambiguity or Dependence
- **Task**: Verify if the statement had prior context or if it stands alone.
- **Action**: Given the current string alone, it does not provide enough context or specific information to determine its classification based on the types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

### Step 4: Provide a Tentative Classification (If Possible)
- **Task**: Using known categories, see if a partial classification is feasible or declare it undeterminable.
- **Action**: With the stand-alone phrase, it is undeterminable as it lacks necessary details.

### Step 5: Document the Need for Additional Context
- **Task**: Conclude the need for additional context to correctly classify the statement.
- **Action**: Note that this specific classification task cannot be completed without the additional information that would typically follow "This is an example of....".

### Result:
Given the application of <IDAA> to "This is an example of....", it is determined that the string is incomplete and undeterminable without further context. Hence, no specific type classification can be conclusively applied from the provided categories.

**To proceed accurately, more context is required to apply a specific defective argument classification.**
