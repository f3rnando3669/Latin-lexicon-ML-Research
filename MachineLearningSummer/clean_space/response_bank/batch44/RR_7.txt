For 
To apply \( <IDAA> \) to the statement "Murder is morally wrong. Therefore, abortion is morally wrong.", let's break down the task into specific steps.

### Step 1: Understand the Statement
Examine the statement and identify the structure and any key terms involved.

- **Statement**: "Murder is morally wrong. Therefore, abortion is morally wrong."
- **Key Terms**: "Murder," "morally wrong," "abortion"

### Step 2: Identify the Proposition \( <P> \)
Determine what the statement is trying to prove.

- **Proposition** (\<P\>): "Abortion is morally wrong."

### Step 3: Identify the Reason \( <R> \)
Identify the reason given to support the proposition.

- **Reason** (\<R\>): "Murder is morally wrong."

### Step 4: Identify the Type of Defective Argument
Evaluate if the statement fits any of the types of defective arguments.

1. **Generalization (\<G\>)**: The statement is not making a generalization about a class of things based on insufficient evidence.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)**: The statement is not presenting an either/or situation.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**: Check if the reason provided conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the proposition.
4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)**: Check if the reason provided is a repetition or restatement of the proposition.
5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**: Check if the causal basis for the proposition is compelling or not.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)**: The statement does not appeal to popularity or consensus.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)**: Check if any key terms are used ambiguously.

### Step 5: Analyze for Ambiguity or Equivocation
Determine if any key terms are used ambiguously.

- The term "morally wrong" is used in both clauses but in potentially different contexts. The argument hinges on treating "murder" and "abortion" as equivalent actions in terms of morality without sufficient justification provided in the statement itself.

### Step 6: Conclusion
Based on the analysis, classify the statement as \( <G> \), \( <FE> \), \( <IR> \), \( <RR> \), \( <WCB> \), \( <FU> \), or \( <DEP> \).

- The argument uses "morally wrong" in both clauses, applying moral wrongness from "murder" to "abortion" without sufficient reasoning, and hence it seems to rely on ambiguous language.

### Classification:
The statement "Murder is morally wrong. Therefore, abortion is morally wrong." primarily falls under **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)** because it uses the phrase "morally wrong" ambiguously, assuming without sufficient justification that both "murder" and "abortion" are morally wrong in the same way.

Therefore, the classification of the statement is \( <DEP> \).
