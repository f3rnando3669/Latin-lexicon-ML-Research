For 
To apply <IDAA> to "Word processed papers are clearer and more error-free than typed papers because they make use of new technology," we need to decompose the task <IDA> (classifying the argument type <s>) into specific steps. Here's how we can proceed:

### Step 1: Identify and Isolate the Proposition (\<P\>)
Identify the main claim or the proposition in the argument.

**Proposition (P):** "Word processed papers are clearer and more error-free than typed papers."

### Step 2: Identify and Isolate the Reason (\<R\>)
Identify the causal basis or the reason given for the proposition.

**Reason (R):** "because they make use of new technology."

### Step 3: Check the Reason against Common Defective Argument Types
Using the classifications <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>, assess if the reason (\<R\>) correctly supports the proposition (\<P\>), or if it falls into any defective argument type.

- **Generalization (\<G\>):** Does the argument assume that because a part/many exhibit properties, all must exhibit the same?
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>):** Does the argument claim complete enumeration while missing out on other possibilities?
- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>):** Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>):** Does the reason repeat the proposition in a different form?
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>):** Is the causal basis given inadequate or not compelling enough to support the proposition?
- **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>):** Does the argument assume consensus without establishing it effectively?
- **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>):** Does the argument rely on ambiguous language to mislead or equivocate?

### Step 4: Evaluate the Argument Based on These Classifications
Now, assess the argument:

**Reason (R):** "because they make use of new technology."

- **Generalization (\<G\>):** The reason does not generalize the users but rather focuses on the tools used (word-processing technology).
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>):** The argument does not claim complete enumeration.
- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>):** The reason does not conclusively prove that clarity and error-freeness result solely from using new technology. It might be influential but not conclusive by itself.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>):** The reason is not a repetition of the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>):** The proposition "Word processed papers are clearer and more error-free" implies a qualitative difference, but the reason "they make use of new technology" is a broader statement that doesn't directly address other factors (skills of the person, inherent errors in technology, etc.) This falls under insufficient causal basis.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>):** There is no reference to consensus making the argument true.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>):** There is no ambiguous use of language in the reason provided.

Given the assessment, the argument most likely belongs to **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)** because the reason provided does not strongly justify the proposition and lacks specificity.

### Step 5: Final Classification
Classify the argument based on the analysis.

**Final Classification (<s>):** Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)

Thus, we successfully decomposed the task and classified it step by step.
