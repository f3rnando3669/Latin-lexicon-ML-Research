For 
To classify the argument "Chick fil A is the greatest food chain in existence. Look at the crowds!" we can break down the task into specific steps as follows:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - "Chick fil A is the greatest food chain in existence."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - "Look at the crowds!"

3. **Analyze the Reason's Causal Basis:**
   - The reason given ("Look at the crowds!") implies that the popularity of Chick fil A (indicated by crowds) serves as evidence for its greatness.

4. **Determine Argument Type:**
   - We need to classify the type of this argument based on its logical structure and content.

5. **Match with Defined Argument Types:**
   - Compare to the provided argument types definitions: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

### Applying Each Step:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - **P:** "Chick fil A is the greatest food chain in existence."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - **R:** "Look at the crowds!"

3. **Analyze the Reason's Causal Basis:**
   - The logical linkage suggests that the proposition is supported by the observation of crowds. The underlying assumption is that because many people go there, it must be the greatest.

4. **Determine Argument Type:**
   - The reasoning relies on the popularity (crowds) as the main justification for the claim of greatness.

5. **Match with Defined Argument Types:**
   - **<G> (Generalization):** Not applicable, as it doesn’t generalize based on insufficient instances; rather, it uses a popularity claim.
   - **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):** Not applicable; the argument does not present a false dilemma or incomplete set of options.
   - **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** Not directly applicable; though the reason might not be strong, it’s not inconclusive in the provided manner.
   - **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** Not applicable; the reason is not a repetition.
   - **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** Not directly; while the basis may be weak, it’s not inherently causal.
   - **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):** The argument uses popularity (crowd size) as the primary evidence for the claim.
     - "Appealing to popularity or the fact that many people do something as an attempted form of validation."
   - **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):** Not applicable; there’s no ambiguous term causing misunderstanding.

### Classification:
- **Conclusion:** The argument "Chick fil A is the greatest food chain in existence. Look at the crowds!" is of type **<FU>** (Presumptuous Consensus) because it assumes that popularity (crowds) validates the claim of greatness.
