For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "Jose, join us because everybody will come to the party and only you will be left behind.", we first need to decompose <IDA> into specific steps. Here’s how we can break down the process of classifying the statement into one of the given argument types:

## Decomposition (<D>)
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)** - Determine what the statement intends to prove.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)** - Determine the causal basis or support for the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)** - Corroborate the reason via additional arguments if needed.
4. **Check for Generalization (<G>)** - See if the statement makes a broad assertion based on a small sample.
5. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** - Determine if the statement falsely claims to have covered all possibilities.
6. **Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** - Examine if the reason provided does not conclusively support the proposition.
7. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)** - Identify if the reason is merely a restatement of the proposition.
8. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** - Assess if the reason provided does not adequately support the proposition.
9. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)** - See if the statement assumes agreement based on supposed universal acceptance.
10. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)** - Determine if the statement uses ambiguous terms that can be taken in multiple senses.

## Application (<IDAA>)
Let’s apply these steps to classify the statement.

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - **<P>:** "Jose should join us at the party."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - **<R>:** "Because everybody will come to the party."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - This is embedded in the reason stating "only you will be left behind."

4. **Check for Generalization (<G>)**:
   - Not applicable. The statement does not generalize characteristics of a group based on one or a few examples.

5. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - Not applicable. The statement does not present a false dichotomy or pretend to cover all possibilities.

6. **Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - Not applicable. The reason given does provide a plausible basis, though it may not conclusively support the proposition in a strict logical sense.

7. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - Not applicable. The reason provided is not simply a repetition of the proposition; it attempts to provide a justification.

8. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - Not applicable. There is no assumed cause-effect relationship that requires an adequate basis to support the proposition.

9. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - This is the most fitting classification. The argument is urging Jose to join the party based on the assumption that since everyone else is going, he should too. It appeals to popularity or the desire not to be left out.

10. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
    - Not applicable. The language used in the statement is clear and unambiguous.

Based on these analyses, the statement "Jose, join us because everybody will come to the party and only you will be left behind" falls under the category of **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**. It appeals to Jose’s fear of being left out by emphasizing that everyone else will be at the party.
