For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the string "President Reagan was a great communicator because he had the gift of talking effectively to the people," we need to decompose the task into specific steps and classify the string based on the given categories: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Decomposition of Task (<D>):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine what the main claim or proposition in the string is.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine what justification or reason is given for the proposition.
3. **Classify the Argument Type**:
    - Check if the argument type could be a Generalization (<G>).
    - Check if the argument type could be an Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>).
    - Check if the argument type could be an Inconclusive Reason (<IR>).
    - Check if the argument type could be a Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>).
    - Check if the argument type could be an Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).
    - Check if the argument type could be a Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>).
    - Check if the argument type could be an Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

### Application of <D> to <IDA> for Given String:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - *"President Reagan was a great communicator"*

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - *"because he had the gift of talking effectively to the people"*

3. **Classify the Argument Type**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument isn't making a generalization based on a subset.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument isn't claiming completeness based on limited options.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: It is not presenting an unrelated reason or an inconclusive one.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Check if the reason given is just a restatement of the proposition.
     - "President Reagan was a great communicator" because "he had the gift of talking effectively to the people" essentially says the same thing using different words; it states Reagan's effective talking skills both as the claim and the reason without adding new information.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: It isn't presenting an insufficient or weak causal basis.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: It isn’t relying on popularity or consensus to justify the proposition.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: It isn’t using language with multiple meanings that cause confusion.

### Conclusion:

The string "President Reagan was a great communicator because he had the gift of talking effectively to the people" most closely fits the category <RR>. This is because the reason given (talking effectively) essentially restates the proposition (great communicator) without providing additional substantive evidence.

**Classified as: <RR>**
