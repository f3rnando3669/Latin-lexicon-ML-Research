For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a given string as a specific type of defective argument) to the string "People either like coffee or hate it," we will undertake the process step by step as follows:

1. **Decompose the Task of Classification (<IDA>) into Specific Steps (<D>)**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the structure of the statement.
   - **Step 2**: Determine if the statement is presenting a proposition (<P>).
   - **Step 3**: Analyze whether the proposition is supported by a reason (<R>).
   - **Step 4**: Check for supporting arguments or proofs (<PR>).
   - **Step 5**: Classify the types of defects in the argument using the definitions provided (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

2. **Apply the Decomposition Steps to the Given String**:
   
   - **Step 1**: Identify the structure of the statement.
     - The statement is "People either like coffee or hate it."
     - Structure: It is presented as a binary choice or a dichotomy.

   - **Step 2**: Determine if the statement is presenting a proposition (<P>).
     - The proposition appears to be "People either like coffee or hate it."

   - **Step 3**: Analyze whether the proposition is supported by a reason (<R>).
     - The string does not provide an explicit reason; it declares a proposition without support.

   - **Step 4**: Check for supporting arguments or proofs (<PR>).
     - There are no additional supporting arguments or proofs provided. 

   - **Step 5**: Classify the types of defects in the argument using the definitions provided.
     - The statement suggests a binary choice without considering other possibilities, such as someone being indifferent to coffee. This indicates that it is presenting fewer options than actually exist.

3. **Final Classification**:

Given the analysis, the statement "People either like coffee or hate it" falls under the category of **False Enumeration (<FE>)** because it lists fewer options than actually exist by presenting a false dichotomy.
