For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!", we will follow the steps necessary for classifying the defective argument type:

1. **Identify Proposition (P)**: Determine what the assertion or main claim in the argument is.
   - In this case, the proposition is that "my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!"

2. **Identify Reason (R)**: Identify the causal basis that supports the proposition.
   - The reason given is that "the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up."

3. **Check for defective argument types**:
   - Look for specific errors in reasoning as per the defined defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

   - **<G> Generalization**: Checks if the assertion is based on some part or a majority but applied to all.
     - Yes, the argument makes a generalization by attributing guilt to an individual based on the actions of the broader Catholic Church.

   - **<FE> False Enumeration**: Checks if the argument lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
     - No, it does not modify or limit options in its reasoning.

   - **<IR> Inappropriate Reason**: Checks if the reason logically supports the proposition.
     - No, the argument does not directly fit an inappropriate reason unrelated to the claim.

   - **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: Checks if the Reason repeats the Proposition.
     - No, the reason and proposition differ.

   - **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: Checks if the Reason is weak in establishing the causal basis of the Proposition.
     - Yes, the reason is weak because it relies on the guilt by association fallacy without a direct causal link.

   - **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: Checks if the Proof of Reason assumes unanimous agreement on a disputed matter.
     - No, it does not claim universal agreement.

   - **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: Checks if ambiguous language leads to misunderstanding.
     - No, it uses specific terms with clear intent, albeit flawed reasoning.

4. **Final Classification**:
   - The argument is primarily a **Generalization** <G>, as it applies the actions of the broader group (Catholic Church) to an individual (102-year-old neighbor) without evidence specific to that individual.
   - It also exhibits **Insufficient Causal Basis** <WCB> since the reason given does not provide a substantiated causal link to the proposition about the neighbor's guilt.

By following these steps to break down and analyze the argument, we classify the argument as containing defective types: **Generalization <G>** and **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>**.
