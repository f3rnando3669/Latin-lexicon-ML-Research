For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given argument "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses.", we need to first break down the classification task <IDA> into specific steps and then apply these steps to analyze the argument.

### Decomposition of <IDA> (Define Steps for Classification)
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine the main proposition or claim being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Identify the causal basis or premises provided to support the proposition.
3. **Identify Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Assess any additional arguments or evidence used to corroborate the reason.
4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**: Evaluate the argument and classify it into one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP> based on the structure and form of the argument.

### Application of <IDAA> to the Argument

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**
   - The main proposition is: "Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**
   - The reasons provided to support the proposition are:
     - "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being."
     - "Fetuses are innocent human beings."

3. **Identify Proof of Reason (<PR>)**
   - The argument does not provide further proof or evidence beyond the initial reasons provided.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**
   - Analyze the argument to determine if it fits any of the defective argument types.
   - The argument follows a syllogistic structure:
     1. Major premise: "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being."
     2. Minor premise: "Fetuses are innocent human beings."
     3. Conclusion: "Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."
   - This structure matches a logical form of deductive reasoning rather than any specific fallacy defined previously. However, the validity of the argument depends on the truth of its premises.

   Given the task is to identify a defective argument type and the argument is structurally sound:

   - **Not <G> (Generalization)**: The argument does not generalize from one or a few cases to all.
   - **Not <FE> (False Enumeration)**: The argument does not list incorrect options.
   - **Not <IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**: The reasons logically support the conclusion given the premises.
   - **Not <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: The reason is not an exact repetition of the proposition.
   - **Not <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The reason's strength is debatable, but it presents a causal link.
   - **Not <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: The argument does not rely on presumed consensus.
   - **Not <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: The language used is not ambiguous within this context.

Since the argument does not clearly fall into any of the provided defective argument types, it can be concluded that the argument is not inherently defective per the classifications defined. Therefore, <IDA> does not classify this argument as fitting any specific defective type.
