For 
In order to apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying the given string into specific steps), we need to follow a structured approach to identify the type of defective argument in the provided text. Here's a step-by-step decomposition:

### Step 1: Breakdown the Statement
First, we need to break down the given text into meaningful portions that encapsulate its core argument and any supporting statements.

**Given text**:
"Perhaps the most classic example of this fallacy is the argument for the existence of God. Due to the understanding of nature through science, many of the arguments that used to be used for God (or gods) were abandoned, only to be replaced with new ones, usually involving questions to which science has not definitively answered yet. The move from creationism to intelligent design is a prime example. Currently the origin of life is a popular argument for God (although a classic argument from ignorance), and an area where we very well may have a scientific answer in the next decade, at which time, the “origin of life” argument will fade away and be replaced by another, thus moving the figurative goalposts farther back as our understanding of the natural world increases. Exception: This fallacy should not be confused with an argument or set of arguments, with multiple propositions inherent in the argument. The reason for the difference between this kind of argument and the moving the goalposts fallacy, is a subtle one, but indicated by a strong initial claim (“has to be”, “must”, “required for”, etc.) that gets answered and/or what appears to be ad hoc objections that follow eventually leading to an impossible request for proof. Fun Fact: The name “moving the goalposts” comes from the analogy of kicking a perfect field goal in American football, only to have the goalposts be moved on you. This would be very unfair. References: This a logical fallacy frequently used on the Internet. No academic sources could be found. Questions about this fallacy? Ask our community!"

### Step 2: Identify the Core Proposition (<P>)
What is the primary assertion being made in the text?

- The core proposition is that arguments for the existence of God frequently shift as scientific understanding progresses, often resulting in "moving the goalposts" to maintain their validity.

### Step 3: Identify the Reason (<R>)
What reason is given to support the core proposition?

- The reason given is that as science answers more questions, theists replace old arguments with new ones about questions that science has not yet answered conclusively.

### Step 4: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
Are there any additional arguments given to support the reason?

- Yes, examples such as the move from creationism to intelligent design, and the current focus on the origin of life, are cited as examples of shifting arguments.

### Step 5: Classification
Based on our definitions, we can now classify the type of defective argument.

#### Definitions Recap:
- **<G> Generalization**: applying a conclusion to all based on some or many.
- **<FE> False Enumeration**: listing fewer or more options than exist.
- **<IR> Inappropriate Reason**: reason given doesn't support the proposition.
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: reason is a repetition of the proposition.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: causal basis for reason is weak.
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: universal agreement asserted where there is dispute.
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: language can be interpreted in another sense.

### Step 6: Apply the Classification
When we analyze the provided text against these defective argument types:

- The text does not assert universal consensus wrongly, nor does it provide fewer or more options than there are.
- It does not repeat the proposition as the reason or use ambiguous language.
- It does not seem to fit an inappropriate reason format.

The closest match is:

**<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: The argument relies on the notion that as science progresses, theological arguments shift focus. While this may appear to make sense, without substantial evidence or causal link between scientific answers and theological shifts, this claim may be deemed weak or insufficient.

Thus, the defective argument type for the given text is:

**<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**.
