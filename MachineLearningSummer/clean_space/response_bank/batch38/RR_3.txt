To apply the IDAA method to the given dialogue, we need to break down the advanced task of classifying the argument:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: This is the statement or assertion that is being argued for or against.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: This is the causal basis provided for the <P>.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: This is the additional support given to corroborate the <R>.
4. **Check for Defective Arguments (<G>, <IR>, <FE>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>)**: Examine the argument to identify if it contains any of the defined defective argument types.

### Step-by-Step Application

1. **Identify the Propositions (<P>):**
   - Proposition 1: Jesus was not really crucified.
   - Proposition 2: The Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.
   - Proposition 3: God tells us so, here in the Quran.

2. **Identify the Reasons (<R>):**
   - Reason 1 for Proposition 1: Because the Quran says so.
   - Reason 2 for Proposition 2: Because God tells us so, here in the Quran.

3. **Identify the Proofs of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Proof 1 for Reason 1: Implicitly relies on Propositions 2 and 3 being true.
   - Proof 2 for Reason 2: Implicitly relies on Proposition 3.

4. **Check for Defective Arguments:**
   - **Proposition 1:** Jesus was not really crucified.
     - **Reason (<R 1>):** Because the Quran says so.
       - This repeats as an assertion that relies on the Quran’s authority, which is itself under dispute.
     - **Defective Argument:** Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>) and Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>).
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** "Jesus was not crucified" is supported by the assertion "the Quran says so." The claim relies on an authority rather than independent evidence.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The argument assumes everyone agrees the Quran is the definitive word of God, a matter still in dispute.

5. **Examine further arguments for Reason 2 and Proof:**
   - **Proposition 2:** The Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.
     - **Reason (<R 2>):** Because God tells us so, here in the Quran.
       - **Defective Argument:** Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>) and Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>).
       - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Proving the Quran's truth by the Quran itself is circular.
       - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Assumes universal acceptance of the Quran's divine origin, which is debated.

Given the structure, Proposition 3 and Reason 2 exhibit <RR> and <FU>, mirroring the same errors as derived from Proposition 1 and Propagation 2.

### Conclusion

Applying the IDAA method clearly classifies the argument as containing defective argument types:
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
- Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)

This conclusion underscores the logical flaws in Speaker 1’s arguments where the propositions rely on circular reasoning and assumptions of consensus without independent verification.
