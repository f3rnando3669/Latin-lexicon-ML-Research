For 
To apply the process of <IDAA> to the statement "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way," we must first break it down into specific steps as required by <D>. Here's how we can decompose and tackle the task:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA> for Classifying the Argument

1. **Identify the Core Argument**: 
   - The core argument here is "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way."

2. **Determine the Feature of the Argument**:
   - The main feature of this argument involves urging the audience to take action based on the actions of others.

3. **Match to Known Defective Argument Types**:
   - Analyze the argument's feature and compare it to the definitions provided for each defective argument type:
     - **<G> (Generalization)**: Asserts something about a group based on a part. Not applicable here.
     - **<FE> (False Enumeration)**: Provides a misleading number of options. Not applicable here.
     - **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**: Provides a reason unrelated to the proposition. Not directly applicable here.
     - **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: Repeats the same proposition as the reason. Not applicable here.
     - **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: Provides a weak causal basis. Not directly applicable here.
     - **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: Assumes consensus to argue the point, often citing popular opinion. Potentially applicable.
     - **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: Uses language ambiguously. Not applicable here.

4. **Application of Definitions**:
   - The statement encourages an action due to others doing it, which lines up with the presumptive consensus related to popular opinion. This aligns with the definition of <FU>.

5. **Conclude with Classification**:
   - Given that the statement urges action based on the behavior of others, fitting the pattern of a Presumptuous Consensus, it belongs to type <FU>.

### Conclusion

Therefore, by applying the step-by-step process of <IDAA>, we classify the statement **"Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way."** as an instance of **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**.
