To identify the type of defective argument in the string "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today", we will decompose the task into specific steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

#### Step 1: **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**
Examine the given string to identify what the central assertion or claim is.

#### Step 2: **Identify the Reason (<R>)**
Determine what reason or justification is provided to support the proposition.

#### Step 3: **Determine if the Reason Logically Supports the Proposition**
Analyze the relationship between the proposition and the reason to see if the reason logically supports the proposition.

#### Step 4: **Classify the Defective Argument**
Based on the analysis, classify the type of defective argument by comparing with definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

### Application of Steps:

#### Step 1: **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**
"I thought you were a good person"

In the given string, the central claim seems to be a judgment about the person's character — specifically, the speaker thought that the other person was a good person.

#### Step 2: **Identify the Reason (<R>)**
"but you weren’t in class today"

The reason provided for questioning the person's character is that the person was not in class today.

#### Step 3: **Determine if the Reason Logically Supports the Proposition**
Analyze the logical connection between the proposition and the reason.

- Does absence from class logically refute the idea of being a good person?

The reason provided (being absent from class) does not logically support the conclusion (not being a good person). 

#### Step 4: **Classify the Defective Argument**

Given the analysis, the argument type seems to fit well with <IR> (Inappropriate Reason), where the reason does not logically support the proposition.

### Conclusion:

Applying the steps of <IDAA> to "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today", we classify the string as:

``` 
<IR> Inappropriate Reason
``` 

The reason provided (absence from class) does not logically undermine the assertion that the person is a good person.
