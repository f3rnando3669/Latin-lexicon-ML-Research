For 
To classify the string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you." according to the defined defective argument types, we will apply the decomposition method (<D>) to the task of identifying the argument type (<IDA>). Here are the steps broken down in detail:

### Decomposition Steps (<D>)

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Look for the main statement or assertion being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine what causal basis or reason is given to support the proposition.
3. **Evaluate Against Defined Argument Types:**
   - Check if the argument fulfills the criteria of any of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Applying Decomposition to the Given Argument (<IDAA>)

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The main assertion or proposition in the argument is: "I’m not going to talk to you."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason provided for this assertion is: "My best friend says you’re a liar."

3. **Evaluate Against Defined Argument Types:**
   - **<G> (Generalization):**
     - The argument does not state a generalization about a group of people, so it's not a <G>.
   - **<FE> (False Enumeration):**
     - There are no enumerations of alternatives or choices being made, so it's not a <FE>.
   - **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason):**
     - The reason given ("My best friend says you’re a liar") does not logically support the proposition ("I’m not going to talk to you"). The character judgment provided by a third party (the best friend) is not a valid causal basis for deciding not to talk to someone. 
     - Because the reason is not directly related to the proposition in a logically valid way, this is an example of <IR>.
   - **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):**
     - The reason does not simply repeat the proposition, so it's not a <RR>.
   - **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):**
     - The reason might be seen as insufficient or weak, but it would not necessarily fit this category as neatly as it does <IR>.
   - **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):**
     - The argument does not appeal to a presumed universal agreement, so it’s not a <FU>.
   - **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):**
     - There is no ambiguous or double-meaning language being used, so it is not a <DEP>.

### Conclusion
Our evaluation shows that the reason provided does not logically support the proposition, because it relies on an appeal to a third-party opinion rather than relevant evidence or reasons. Thus, the argument is best classified as:

- **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**

So, the argument "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you." falls under the defective argument type <IR>.
