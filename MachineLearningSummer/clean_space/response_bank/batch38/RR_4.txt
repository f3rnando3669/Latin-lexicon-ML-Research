For 
To apply <IDAA> to "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there," we need to decompose the task of classifying this defective argument into specific steps. Here’s the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Identify the Components of the Argument
- **Proposition (P)**: "That restaurant is popular."
- **Reason (R)**: "Because everyone in town goes there."

### Step 2: Determine the Potential Defective Argument Type
We will evaluate the Reason (R) in relation to the Proposition (P) to determine if it falls into one of our predefined defective argument types.

### Step 3: Analyze the Reason (R)
- **Generalization (G)**: This would apply if the statement made a broad and unjustified assertion about a group based on incomplete information. The statement does not follow this structure.
- **False Enumeration (FE)**: This defective argument lists fewer or more options than actually exist. The statement does not present a limited set of options.
- **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**: This would be if the reason provided doesn’t logically support the proposition. The reason given is not irrelevant; it actually attempts to support the popularity claim logically.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This would apply if the reason does not provide a strong causal basis for the proposition. We will consider this.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This would apply if the reason repeats the proposition without adding new information. The reason "because everyone in town goes there" does add new information rather than just restating the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This applies if the reason assumes universal agreement without support. The phrase "everyone in town goes there" could imply a consensus, though it’s mainly attempting to establish popularity through social proof.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: This would apply if the language could be taken in a different sense than intended. The language in the statement appears clear and unambiguous.

### Step 4: Final Classification
Given the analysis:
- The reason relies on the idea that "everyone in town goes there," which presumes a consensus.
- It aims to validate the proposition by suggesting widespread agreement without strong evidentiary support.

The most fitting defective argument type is **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**.

### Conclusion
The classification of the string "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there" using <IDAA> is that it is of type **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**.
