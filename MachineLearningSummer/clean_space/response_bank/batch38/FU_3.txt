For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding.", we need to decompose the task <IDA> (classifying the argument type) into specific steps. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Understand the argument within the string:** 
   - The person is giving a reason to the officer for not speeding: "I was only driving as fast as everyone around me."

2. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition: "I wasn't speeding."

3. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason: "I was only driving as fast as everyone around me."

4. **Examine the Reason (<R>) and the Proposition (<P>) against the given defective argument types to classify the argument:**
   - Check for Generalization (<G>): The argument does not make a sweeping statement about a group.
   - Check for False Enumeration (<FE>): The argument does not list a limited set of options.
   - Check for Inappropriate Reason (<IR>): The Reason fails to logically support the Proposition because driving as fast as others does not necessarily mean one wasn't speeding.
   - Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>): The Reason provided does not have a compelling causal connection to the Proposition.
   - Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>): The Reason is not merely repeating the Proposition.
   - Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>) : The argument appeals to what everyone else is doing as a justification, which might be applied here.
   - Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>): There isn't any ambiguous language in the argument.

5. **Determine which defective argument type best fits:**
   - The argument "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding." is trying to use the behavior of others to justify the action, assuming a consensus that if many people are doing it, then it must be acceptable or correct. 

Given this breakdown, the argument best fits the type <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).

**Conclusion: The argument "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding." is of type <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).**
