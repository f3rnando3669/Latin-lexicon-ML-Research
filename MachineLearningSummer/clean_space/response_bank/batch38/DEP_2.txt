To apply the task of classifying the given string as of type <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP> using the advanced task of decomposition (IDAA), we'll follow these specific steps:

### Step-by-Step IDAA Procedure:

#### Step 1: Understand and Interpret the Provided Dialogue
Read and understand the exchange between Speaker 1 and Speaker 2.

#### Provided Dialogue:
- **Speaker 1:** We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change.
- **Speaker 2:** Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people.

#### Step 2: Identify Parts of the Argument
Identify the parts of the arguments (Proposition <P>, Reason <R>, Proof of Reason <PR>) in both statements.

- **Speaker 1:**
  - **P1:** There is a need to spread the word about social injustice and the need for change.
  - **R1:** Thousands of people are going door to door to help.

- **Speaker 2:**
  - **P2:** I can't be a part of this.
  - **R2:** I was always taught that it's wrong to use people.

#### Step 3: Analyze Speaker 2's Reasoning for Defective Argument Types
Examine Speaker 2's reasoning in R2 relative to the statement P1/P2 and determine if it fits any defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

1. **<G> Generalization:** Not applicable here as Speaker 2's argument isn't based on an unsubstantiated generalization about a group.
2. **<FE> False Enumeration:** Not applicable. Speaker 2 is not listing options.
3. **<IR> Inappropriate Reason:** This is worth exploring. Speaker 2 refuses to participate based on a teaching that using people is wrong, which suggests a moral stance that might not directly relate to the context of social activism.
4. **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** Not applicable as R2 does not merely repeat P2.
5. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** Also plausible. The causal link between learning that using people is wrong and not helping in social activism is weak and could be considered insufficient.
6. **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** Not applicable. No assumption of universal agreement is made here.
7. **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:** This might also fit. The term "use people" is ambiguous and can be interpreted in various ways (e.g., exploitation vs. active participation).

#### Step 4: Select the Most Appropriate Defective Argument Type(s)
Given the dialogue, the most appropriate defective argument types for Speaker 2’s statement ("Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people.") are:

- **<IR> Inappropriate Reason (Speaker 2’s moral teaching doesn’t logically connect to the issue at hand of spreading the word about social justice)**
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use (The phrase "use people" can be interpreted differently than what was intended in the context of social activism)**

#### Conclusion:
Based on the step-by-step process, we classify the argument as primarily possessing:
- <IR> Inappropriate Reason: The moral teaching about not "using people" does not logically address the systemic use of volunteers for a social cause.
- <DEP> Ambiguous Language Use: The term "use people" is ambiguous and leads to a misinterpretation of the intended meaning.

Hence, the final classification of the given string is a combination of <IR> and <DEP>.
