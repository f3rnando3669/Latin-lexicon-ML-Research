For 
To classify the string "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess all the other classes will all fail it, too." as one of the types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>, we need to decompose the pattern recognition task <IDA> into specific steps <D>. 

Here are the decomposition steps <D> for performing <IDA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine the central claim or conclusion of the argument.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Determine the rationale or evidence provided to support the Proposition.
3. **Analyze the Structure**: Compare the argument's structure to the definitions of defective arguments (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).
4. **Classify the Defect**: Based on the analysis, classify the argument as one of the defective types.

Let's proceed with applying these steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (IDAA)

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - "I guess all the other classes will all fail it, too."
   
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz."

3. **Analyze the Structure**:
   - The string suggests that because three kids in one class failed the quiz, all other classes will fail it too. It makes a general conclusion about all the classes based on a specific instance in one class.
   
4. **Classify the Defect**:
   - This argument makes a broad generalization about all classes based on the performance of just three students in one class.
   - According to the definitions, this type of defective argument is a **Generalization (<G>)**: It draws a conclusion about all the classes from a limited sample.

Therefore, the string "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess, all the other classes will all fail it, too." is classified as of type **<G>**.
