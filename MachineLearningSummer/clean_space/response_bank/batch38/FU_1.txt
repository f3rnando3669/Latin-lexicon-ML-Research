For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong," we need to decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps and then execute those steps. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step procedure:

### Decomposition of Task <IDA> (<D>):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   Determine what the statement is trying to prove or advocate for.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   Analyze what causal basis or reason the statement gives for the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   Look for any additional support or argument that corroborates the reason given.

4. **Classify the Argument**:
   Evaluate the statement using the definitions provided for defective argument types to determine the type it falls under.
 
### Application of Steps to the String "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong" (<IDAA>):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   The proposition in the argument is to get Verizon. 

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   The reason given is that 1 billion people can't be wrong, implying that the popularity of Verizon is a sufficient reason to get it.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   There is no further proof of reason provided in the argument beyond the assertion of popularity.

4. **Classify the Argument**:
   To classify the argument, we evaluate it against the defective argument types:
   
   - **<G> (Generalization)**: Does not apply.
   - **<FE> (False Enumeration)**: Does not apply.
   - **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**: Does not apply.
   - **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: Does not apply.
   - **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The statement does not evaluate the quality or correctness, only the number of people, which is not a strong logical reason.
   - **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: This classification fits. The reason is based on the assumption that because a large number of people (1 billion) use Verizon, that makes it inherently the right choice. This is an appeal to popularity to validate the argument.
   - **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: Does not apply.

Given this analysis, the argument "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong" most appropriately falls under the defective argument type <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus) because it assumes that the sheer number of people using Verizon makes it the correct choice.

Thus, the classified defective argument type for the given string is:

**<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**.
