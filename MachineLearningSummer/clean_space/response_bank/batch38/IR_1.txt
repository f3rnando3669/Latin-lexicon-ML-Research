Sure, let's use the <IDAA> approach to classify the argument type of the given string "Don't you want the best for your baby?". 

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine what the speaker is intending to prove or suggest indirectly.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Assess the causal basis that the speaker might be using to support the <P>.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Look for any additional argument or corroborating evidence presented to substantiate the <R>.
4. **Evaluate the Argument Type**: Using the previously defined defective argument types, classify the argument. This involves checking if the argument fits into any categories such as Generalization (<G>), False Enumeration (<FE>), Inappropriate Reason (<IR>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

### Applying <IDAA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The proposition in this case seems to be implicit. The speaker is suggesting that what they are proposing (though not explicitly stated in the question) is the best for the baby.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reasoning part is also implicit. It suggests something along the lines of "You should do [unspoken action] because it's the best for your baby."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - There isn't an explicit proof of reason given in this string. The statement is framed as a rhetorical question.

4. **Evaluate the Argument Type:**
   - The statement appears to be an example of emotional appeal, which doesn't directly fit the provided defective argument types but closely aligns with the idea of Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>). The implicit assumption is that any parent would naturally want the best for their baby, which is universally assumed to be true even though no explicit proof is provided.
   
   - Additionally, it could also be argued to have elements of Inappropriate Reason (<IR>) if the context of the question doesnâ€™t logically lead to the proposed action but rather manipulates by invoking parental guilt or duty.

### Final Classification:

Given the analysis, the string "Don't you want the best for your baby?" primarily falls under:
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: It assumes consensus on the desire for the best for one's baby to imply action or belief without further justification.

In some contexts, it might also border on:
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: If the implied action does not logically follow from the desire for the best for the baby, making the reason (emotional appeal) inappropriate.
