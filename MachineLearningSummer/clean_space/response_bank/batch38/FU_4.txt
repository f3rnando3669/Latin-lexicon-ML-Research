For 
Let's apply the process of <IDAA> to classify the given string, "Everyone else is doing it, so should you."

1. **Identify the proposition (\<P\>)**:
   - Here, the proposition is: "You should do it."

2. **Identify the reason (\<R\>) given for the proposition**:
   - The reason provided is: "Everyone else is doing it."

3. **Determine the causal basis for the reason and whether it logically supports the proposition**:
   - We should evaluate if the reason "Everyone else is doing it" supports the proposition "You should do it."

4. **Identify the potential defective argument types**:
   - \<G\> Generalization: Does the argument apply a general rule from a specific case?
   - \<FE\> False Enumeration: Does the argument list limited or more options than exist?
   - \<IR\> Inappropriate Reason: Does the reason logically support the proposition?
   - \<RR\> Faulty Repetition of Proposition: Is the reason merely repeating the proposition?
   - \<WCB\> Insufficient Causal Basis: Is the causal basis (reason) for the proposition weak?
   - \<FU\> Presumptuous Consensus: Is the proof of reason assumed certain because it is "universally agreed"?
   - \<DEP\> Ambiguous Language Use: Can the reason be taken in another sense than intended?

5. **Match the given argument against the definitions of defective argument types**:
   - The given string suggests that because everyone else is doing something, it is valid for you to do it too. 
   - This reasoning relies on the assumption that the action is justified simply because it is popular, which does not logically establish the action as correct or desirable.

6. **Classify the argument based on the identified characteristics**:
   - The argument fits the description of \<FU\> Presumptuous Consensus because it relies on the popularity of an action as a form of validation. It assumes the action is correct because "everyone else is doing it," which is still in dispute and not confirmed as a valid reason.

Based on the above steps, the classification of the string "“Everyone else is doing it, so should you”" is of type \<FU\> Presumptuous Consensus.
