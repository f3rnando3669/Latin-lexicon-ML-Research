For 
Let's apply <IDAA>, the decomposition of an advanced task into specific steps, to classify the given string "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" into one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Steps for Classification (<IDAA>):
1. **Identify the proposition (<P>):**
   - "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights"
   
2. **Identify the reason (<R>) that supports the proposition:**
   - The reason implied here is that support for Hillary Clinton is synonymous with believing in women's rights.

3. **Analyze the components of the argument:**
   - Determine if it falls into the categories of false enumeration, inappropriate reason, generalization, insufficient causal basis, faulty repetition of proposition, presumptuous consensus, or ambiguous language use.

4. **Classify the argument:**

   - **False Enumeration (<FE>):** This argument lists fewer options than actually exist, presenting a false dichotomy. It suggests there are only two options: either you support Hillary Clinton or you don't believe in women's rights, ignoring other possibilities (e.g., supporting women's rights but preferring another candidate).

5. **Conclude the classification:**
   - The argument is best classified as <FE>: False Enumeration.

### Final Classification
The string "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" is classified as type <FE> (False Enumeration). This is because it presents a limited set of options that does not encompass all possible viewpoints.
