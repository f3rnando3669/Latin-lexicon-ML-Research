For 
Applying <IDAA> to the string "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (IDAA):
1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Here, the proposition is "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - The reason here appears to be implied rather than explicitly stated, but it can be interpreted as "because electing new people will fix our broken judicial system."

3. **Evaluate the components using the defective argument classifications (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>):**
   - **<G> (Generalization):** This doesn't apply since the statement is not generalizing a characteristic to all members of a group.
   - **<FE> (False Enumeration):** This doesn't apply since there aren't any listed options.
   - **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason):** This seems like a potential candidate because it presupposes that electing new people is the solution without providing evidence that this will indeed fix the "broken" system. However, let's review the other types.
   - **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** This does not apply here because the reason given is not a repeat of the original proposition.
   - **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** This fits well. The reason given (electing new people will fix our broken judicial system) is not validated and does not provide a compelling causal basis for the proposition. It's a potentially weak argument because there's no evidence that simply electing new people is a sufficient solution.
   - **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):** This does not apply since the argument does not appeal to universal agreement.
   - **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):** This does not apply since there is no ambiguity in the language used.

4. **Determine the best fit:**
   - The best fit classification for this argument would be **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**, since the causal reason provided lacks evidence and does not strongly support the proposition.

### Conclusion:
The logical fallacy in the statement "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people." is best classified as **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
