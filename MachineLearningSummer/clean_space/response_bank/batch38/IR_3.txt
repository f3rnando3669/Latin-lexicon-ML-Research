For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "In the race for mayor, Lara says a vote for her opponent will lead to you losing your job. What fallacy has she committed?", we need to decompose the task <IDA> into specific steps and classify the string as one of the defective argument types:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine what proposition is being put forward.
   - Proposition: "Voting for Lara's opponent will lead to you losing your job."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the reason offered to support the proposition.
   - Reason: Implicitly, the reason is that voting for the opponent has a direct connection to job loss.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Determine if there is any additional proof provided to support the reason.
   - Proof of Reason: There is no additional proof provided to support this connection.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument**: Determine which type of defective argument fits the proposition, reason, and proof of reason.

Based on the analysis, we observe the following:

- The argument involves creating a false dilemma or suggesting that there are only two possible outcomes or choices, which is a hallmark of the fallacy type <FE> (False Enumeration), as it limits the choices to either voting for Lara or losing your job.
  
  It doesn't present any valid causal link between voting for the opponent and losing one's job, indicating a lack of sufficient causal basis, but the fundamental flaw is the false binary choice provided.

Therefore, the fallacy committed in this argument is:

**<FE> (False Enumeration)**
