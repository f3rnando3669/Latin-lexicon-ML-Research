For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of decomposition to the identification of defective argument types) to the string "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong," we need to follow the specified steps. Here is the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step-by-Step Application of <IDAA>

**Step 1: Parse and Analyze the String**

- **String \( s \)**: "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong."
- **Analysis**: The statement is making an appeal to the popularity of Verizon by claiming that because 1 billion people are using it, it must be a correct choice.

**Step 2: Pattern Matching with Known Defective Argument Types**

- The statement seems to imply that the large number of people using Verizon validates the choice of using Verizon.

**Step 3: Evaluate Logical Structure**

- The logical structure is as follows:
  - **Premise**: 1 billion people use Verizon.
  - **Conclusion**: Therefore, getting Verizon is the right choice.
- The logic here is based on the assumption that a large number of people can't be wrong, which is an appeal to popularity.

**Step 4: Identify Key Phrases and Constructs**

- **Key Phrases**: "1 billion people can't be wrong."
- This phrase appeals to the popularity or the fact that many people do something as an attempted form of validation.

**Step 5: Classify \( s \) into the Defective Argument Type**

- Using our defined categories, this type of fallacy fits into the category of **False Universals (<FU>)** because it asserts a universally agreed point (that many people can't be wrong) without substantial proof.

### Conclusion

By following the structured steps of <IDAA>, we classify the defective argument presented in "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong" as:

**False Universal (<FU>)**

This means that the argument relies on a fallacious appeal to popularity to validate its proposition.
