To identify the type of defective argument present in the string "People either like coffee or hate it," let's apply the decomposition process (\(<D>\)) step by step:

### Steps for Decomposing the Task \( <IDA> \) (\(<D>\)):

1. **Step 1: Understand the Proposition**
   - Proposition: "People either like coffee or hate it."
   - Supporting Statements: There are no explicit supporting statements; the proposition itself is making a dual-option claim.

2. **Step 2: Classify the Argument Type**
   - The string presents two options as the only possibilities for people's opinions on coffee.

3. **Step 3: Match Against Specific Examples**
   - This matches the example given for False Enumeration (\(<FE>\)): "America: Love it or leave it," which similarly limits the options available to just two when more likely exist.

4. **Step 4: Evaluate Logical Consistency**
   - The proposition is not logically consistent because it oversimplifies people's feelings toward coffee, ignoring the possibility that some people might be indifferent, have mixed feelings, or other nuanced positions.

5. **Step 5: Conclude the Type**
   - Identified Type: <FE>
   - Explanation: The string uses a false enumeration fallacy by presenting only two options (either like coffee or hate it) and ignoring other possible opinions people might have about coffee.

### Conclusion
By following the decomposition steps, we identify that the defective argument type of the string "People either like coffee or hate it" is \( <FE> \) (False Enumeration). This conclusion is based on the fact that the argument limits the options available to just two when more possibilities exist.
