For 
To apply the decomposition method (<IDAA>) to identify the type of defective argument in the provided string, let's break it down step-by-step as follows:

**String (s)**: "Perhaps the most classic example of this fallacy is the argument for the existence of God. Due to the understanding of nature through science, many of the arguments that used to be used for God (or gods) were abandoned, only to be replaced with new ones, usually involving questions to which science has not definitively answered yet. The move from creationism to intelligent design is a prime example. Currently the origin of life is a popular argument for God (although a classic argument from ignorance), and an area where we very well may have a scientific answer in the next decade, at which time, the 'origin of life' argument will fade away and be replaced by another, thus moving the figurative goalposts farther back as our understanding of the natural world increases. Exception: This fallacy should not be confused with an argument or set of arguments, with multiple propositions inherent in the argument. The reason for the difference between this kind of argument and the moving the goalposts fallacy, is a subtle one, but indicated by a strong initial claim (‘has to be’, ‘must’, ‘required for’, etc.) that gets answered and/or what appears to be ad hoc objections that follow eventually leading to an impossible request for proof.
Fun Fact: The name 'moving the goalposts' comes from the analogy of kicking a perfect field goal in American football, only to have the goalposts be moved on you. This would be very unfair.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (IDAA):

1. **Preliminary Reading**
   - Read the statement fully and carefully to grasp the content and context.

2. **Identification of the Argument**
   - The text makes a claim about the nature of arguments for the existence of God, describing how such arguments change over time as scientific understanding increases.

3. **Categorization**
   - Determine if this text fits any of the defined categories of defective arguments.

4. **Analysis**
   - Analyze the nature of the argument being presented:
     - Is it broad and generalizing? 
     - Does it present limited options?
     - Is the reasoning relevant or appropriate?
     - Is it just restating the proposition?
     - Is the causal basis weak?
     - Does it assert universals without proof?
     - Is it a double-edged phrase?

Let's analyze the argument further:

5. **Conclusion**

**Analysis of Argument Characteristics:**
- The text could be suggesting that arguments for the existence of God are continually revised to address new scientific discoveries, thus "moving the goalposts." This doesn't fit neatly into the defined categories like Generalization, False Enumeration, Inappropriate Reason, and others.

**Evaluate the Context:**
- The string identifies a logical fallacy often discussed under the name "moving the goalposts." This isn’t directly one of the predefined categories but involves always changing the criteria of proof to make it impossible to meet.

**Determining the Closest Fit:**
- While it doesn’t fit perfectly into the predefined defective argument types, the description indicates a practice where the criteria for proof are adjusted such that the argument is never settled. This could be interpreted as having an inappropriate reason within the argument (since the goalposts are constantly moved) or as a fallacy of Weak Causal Basis because the change in criteria undermines a strong causal analysis.

However, since "moving the goalposts" specifically isn't a provided category, let's identify the closest match based on what's presented and the goalpost-moving analogy.

Given the nature of this argument and how it aims to show the perpetual shifting criteria of proof when it suits an agenda, it most closely aligns with:

### Conclusion:
- **<IR>: Inappropriate Reason**, as it demonstrates a shifting basis for the argument inappropriately by changing criteria to suit new needs rather than presenting a stable and coherent reason.

Therefore, the most appropriate category from the provided definitions would be **<IR>: Inappropriate Reason**.
