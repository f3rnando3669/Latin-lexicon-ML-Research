For 
To apply the decomposition steps (<D>) to identify the type of defective argument (<IDA>) in the given conversation, we will proceed as follows:

### Decomposition Steps (<D>) for Identifying Defective Arguments (<IDAA>):

Given Argument: 
"Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified.  
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?  
Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so.  
Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct?  
Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.  
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?  
Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran."  

1. **Step 1: Break Down the Argument**
   - Premises:
     - Jesus was not really crucified.
     - The Quran says so.
     - The Quran is the Word of God.
     - Everything the Quran says is true.
     - God tells us in the Quran.
   - Conclusion: Jesus was not really crucified because the Quran, which is claimed to be the Word of God, says so.

2. **Step 2: Classify the Nature of the Argument**
   - The argument cycles through dependent claims without breaking out of the circular verification of its own premises.

3. **Step 3: Match Against Defined Categories**
   - The argument exhibits characteristics of <RR> (Redundant Reason) or more specifically, it displays circular reasoning within these premises.

4. **Step 4: Validate the Classification**
   - The reasoning is redundant because it repeats the initial proposition in different forms without providing external validation.

5. **Step 5: Document the Identified Argument Type**
   - Classification: <RR> (Redundant Reason)

### Conclusion:
The argument type for the given conversation is <RR> (Redundant Reason), as it relies on circular reasoning where the conclusion is supported by premises that are simply restating the conclusion in a different form.
