For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today", we will follow the decomposed steps defined by <D>:

### Steps for <D>:

1. **Understand the Argument**: Analyze the string to understand its content and context.
2. **Identify Key Elements**: Determine the main claim and the supporting evidence or reasoning.
3. **Match with Definitions**: Compare the argument's reasoning with the predefined defective argument types.
4. **Classify the Argument**: Determine which defective argument type best fits the reasoning provided in the string.

#### Step 1: Understand the Argument
- The string expresses disappointment in someone's character based on a single instance of them not being in class.

#### Step 2: Identify Key Elements
- Main claim: "I thought you were a good person."
- Supporting evidence: "but you weren’t in class today."
- Implicit reasoning: The person's goodness is questioned due to their absence from class.

#### Step 3: Match with Definitions
- The reasoning suggests a false dichotomy: being good is equated with attending class, or the lack of attendance disproves being good.
- This fits the description of **<FE> False Enumeration**, where fewer or more options than actually exist are listed. 

#### Step 4: Classify the Argument
- The argument assumes only two possible scenarios: presence in class equates to goodness, and absence equates to not being good. This false dichotomy simplifies the complex nature of character into an inappropriate binary choice.

Therefore, the type of defective argument for the string "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today." is **<FE> False Enumeration**.
