For 
Let's apply the IDAA process to the given string: 

### "Farmer McDonald: Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain. I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature."

**1. Component Identification**:
   - **Proposition/Main Claim**: Building the new power plant has stopped the rain, indicating mankind's dangerous influence on nature.
   - **Supporting Reason(s)**: Since the power plant was built, there has been no rain.

**2. Pattern Matching**:
   - **Generalization**: No generalization from a specific instance to a broad conclusion.
   - **False Enumeration**: No limited set of options are listed.
   - **Inappropriate Reason**: While the reasoning seems to link two unrelated events (construction of the power plant and lack of rain), it's not just a logically misconstrued reason; the claim relies on a weak causal link due to the lack of compelling evidence.
   - **Redundant Reason**: The reason is not a restatement of the proposition.
   - **Weak Causal Basis**: The assertion that the power plant caused the lack of rain is a weak and implausible causal link.
   - **False Universals**: No attempt to assert universally agreed points without proof.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases**: No phrases open to dual interpretations.

**3. Classification**:
   - The argument best fits the description of a **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**. The statement claims a weak causal link between the building of a power plant and the lack of rain, which lacks compelling evidence.

**4. Verification**:
   - Re-evaluation confirms that the argument tries to establish a weak and implausible causal connection between the construction of the power plant and no rainfall, fitting the definition of a weak causal basis.

Hence, applying the decomposition to the identification task, the identified defective argument type for the string is **<WCB>**.
