For 
Let's apply the step-by-step decomposition (IDAA) to the string "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (IDAA)

1. **C1: Comprehension of the Argument Structure**
   - Read <s>: "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people."
   - Identify the main claim: "We need to fix our broken judicial system."
   - Identify the proposed solution: "by electing new people."

2. **IKC2: Identification of Key Components**
   - Premise: The judicial system is broken.
   - Conclusion: We need to fix it by electing new people.

3. **C3: Comparison to Known Defective Argument Types**
   - Compare with <G> (Generalization): No specific instance generalizing a truth.
   - Compare with <FE> (False Enumeration): This appears to list fewer options than exist; it implies that the only way to fix the judicial system is by electing new people.
   - Compare with <IR> (Inappropriate Reason): This does not logically showcase why electing new people would fix the judicial system necessarily.
   - Compare with <RR> (Redundant Reason): This does not rephrase the claim itself in different words.
   - Compare with <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis): The causal link (electing new people will fix the system) seems weak without supportive arguments.
   - Compare with <FU> (False Universals): Does not appear to assert universally agreed points without proof; rather, it proposes a specific solution.
   - Compare with <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases): No dual interpretations are inherently present.

4. **E4: Elimination of Irrelevant Types**
   - Eliminate <G>, <RR>, <FU>, and <DEP> based on the mismatch of structure and logical components. 
   - Focus on <FE>, <IR>, and <WCB>.

5. **D5: Determination of the Argument Type**
   - The argument implies that the only solution is to elect new people, suggesting fewer options than there likely are. This matches <FE> (False Enumeration).
   - The argument provides a weak basis that electing new people will fix the system without further substantiation, fitting <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis).
   - The reason does not directly address how electing new people will logically support the proposition of fixing the system, fitting <IR> (Inappropriate Reason).

6. **V6: Validation**
   - Reassess against all definitions: The main fallacy seems to emphasize limited options (False Enumeration) but also includes an inappropriate and weak reason.

Upon reassessment, "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people" most closely aligns with <FE> (False Enumeration), as it implies that electing new people is the singular solution, neglecting other potential options or solutions.

The string <s> "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people" represents the defective argument type <FE> (False Enumeration).

So, the fallacy here is primarily False Enumeration.
