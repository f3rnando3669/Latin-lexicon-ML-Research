### Application of Decomposition (<IDAA>):

Let's follow the steps to identify the defective argument type in the given string:

**Argument:** "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."

#### Step 1: Parse the Argument
- Sentence: "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."

#### Step 2: Identify the Primary Claim
- Primary claim: "Paranormal activity is real."

#### Step 3: Analyze the Support
- Support: "I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."

#### Step 4: Determine Defective Argument Type
- The support provided is essentially restating the claim without adding new information or evidence. The argument states that paranormal activity is real because the speaker has experienced something they call paranormal activity.
- This is an example of **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**, as the reasoning merely restates the proposition in other words.

### Final Result
