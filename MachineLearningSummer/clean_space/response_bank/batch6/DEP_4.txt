For 
Certainly! Let's apply the decomposition process <IDAA> to the string "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."

1. **Understand the Argument:**
   * The argument states that it's immoral to kill innocent human beings. It defines fetuses as innocent human beings and concludes that it is therefore immoral to kill fetuses.

2. **Identify Key Features:**
   * The argument establishes a moral principle (it is immoral to kill an innocent human being).
   * It applies a category definition (fetuses are innocent human beings).
   * The conclusion is derived by applying the initial principle to the defined category.

3. **Compare with Definitions:**
   * We need to determine if this argument fits into one of the predefined types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>.
   * This argument appears to be heavily reliant on the interpretation of phrases and definitions, which can potentially make the argument open to dual interpretations. 

4. **Determine the Most Applicable Category:**
   * This argument seems to fit with <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases) because it uses terms like "innocent human beings" and "fetuses" in a way that can lead to dual interpretations. While one interpretation supports the conclusion directly, another interpretation might question or challenge the definitions provided.

5. **Justify the Categorization:**
   * The phrase "innocent human beings" can be interpreted in multiple ways, and whether or not fetuses fit this definition is subject to debate.
   * This duality in interpretation makes the argument susceptible to being categorized as having Double-Edged Phrases.

6. **Report the Result:**
   * The defective argument type for the string "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses." is <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases).

By following the <IDAA> process, we identify that the argument primarily relies on ambiguous definitions, justifying its classification as <DEP>.
