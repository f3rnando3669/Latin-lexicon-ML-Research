For 
Let's apply the structured approach (IDAA) to identify the type of defective argument in the string "“Everyone else is doing it, so should you”."

### Application of Decomposition (IDAA) to IDA

#### Step-by-Step Application (IDAA) to the String:

1. **Understand the Argument:**
   - The statement is suggesting that because everyone else is doing something, the person addressed should do it too.

2. **Check for Generalized Claims:**
   - The statement doesn't make a generalized claim based on specific instances, so it's not <G>.

3. **Check for Enumeration Errors:**
   - The argument doesn't list options incorrectly, so it's not <FE>.

4. **Check for Inappropriate Reasons:**
   - The reasoning relies on what others are doing to support the proposition that you should do it as well, which could be seen as inappropriate, but let's evaluate further steps to be precise.

5. **Check for Redundant Reasons:**
   - The statement isn't merely restating the conclusion in other words, so it's not <RR>.

6. **Check for Weak Causal Basis:**
   - The argument doesn't attempt to establish a weak causal connection; it's more about a social proof fallacy.

7. **Check for False Universals:**
   - The statement asserts a false universal ("Everyone else is doing it"), encouraging action based on supposed universal behavior without any proof. This fits <FU>.

8. **Check for Double-Edged Phrases:**
   - The statement isn’t ambiguous or open to dual interpretations, so it’s not <DEP>.

##### Conclusion:
The example string "“Everyone else is doing it, so should you”" primarily fits the description of a False Universal (<FU>), because it relies on the supposed universal behavior of others to justify the proposed action without offering substantial proof.
