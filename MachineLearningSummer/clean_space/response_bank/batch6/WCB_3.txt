For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick," we will follow the outlined steps:

1. **Understand the Argument**:
   - The statement claims a direct causal relationship between drinking bottled water and the subsequent illness.

2. **Identify Key Characteristics**:
   - The person got sick after drinking bottled water, and they attribute their sickness directly to the bottled water without considering other potential causes.

3. **Match with Definitions**:
   - The argument offers a cause-and-effect relationship with insufficient evidence to support the causation. This fits the pattern of Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>), as the reasoning doesn't provide a compelling enough connection to conclude that the bottled water caused the sickness.

4. **Cross-Verification**:
   - It doesn't involve generalizing a specific instance to a broader conclusion (<G>), nor does it list too few or too many options (<FE>).
   - It doesn't provide an irrelevant reason (<IR>), repeat the idea in different words (<RR>), state universally agreed points without proof (<FU>), or use dual interpretations (<DEP>).
   - The statement fits best as a Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>), as it mainly lacks a compelling causative link.

Therefore, the logical fallacy used in the statement "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick" is best identified as:

- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
