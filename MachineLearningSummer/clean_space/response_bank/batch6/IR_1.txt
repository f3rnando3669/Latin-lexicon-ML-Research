Sure, let's apply the decomposed process of identifying the type of defective argument in the given string using the steps outlined:

### String: "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you."

### Step-by-step IDAA Process:

1. **Read and Comprehend:**
    - Carefully read the string: "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you."
    - The argument suggests that because the speaker's best friend believes someone is a liar, the speaker also decides not to engage with that person.

2. **Identify Key Components:**
    - Key components:
        - "My best friend says you’re a liar"
        - "so I’m not going to talk to you"
    - The conclusion is drawn based on the statement from the speaker's best friend.

3. **Match Patterns with Definitions:**
    - Compare the identified components with the definitions of defective argument types:
        - **Generalization (<G>)**: Not relevant, as this doesn't generalize from specific instances.
        - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not relevant, as it doesn't list fewer or more options.
        - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Possibly; the reason given (the friend’s opinion) may not logically support the action taken.
        - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Not relevant, as it doesn't restate the proposition in different words.
        - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Possibly; the basis (friend’s accusation) might not be strong enough to support the conclusion.
        - **False Universals (<FU>)**: Not relevant, as it doesn't assert a universal claim without proof.
        - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Not relevant, as there are no dual interpretations present.

4. **Select Matching Argument Type:**
    - Inappropriate Reason (<IR>): The reason provided (the best friend's accusation) does not necessarily logically support the speaker's decision to cut off communication.
    - Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>): The causal connection between the friend's statement and the action of not talking may be weak.

5. **Validate and Confirm:**
    - Re-reading confirms the initial suspicion:
        - The argument hinges on the friend's statement, which may not be substantial enough to justify the speaker's action, making it both weak in causal basis and inappropriate as a rationale.

Thus, the identified defective argument type in the string is **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**, as the reason given (best friend's opinion) does not logically warrant the conclusion (not talking to the person). However, it also slightly overlaps with **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)** since the causal link between the friend's statement and the speaker's action is weak. The primary classification would be **<IR>**.
