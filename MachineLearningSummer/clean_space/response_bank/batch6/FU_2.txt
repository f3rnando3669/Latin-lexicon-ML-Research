For 
Certainly! Let's apply the <IDAA> method to identify the defective argument type in the given string: "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way."

### Application of IDAA:

**Advanced Task <t>**: Identify the defective argument in the given string.

**Decomposition <D>**:
1. **Step 1**: Read the string.
2. **Step 2**: Compare the content of the string with definitions of defective argument types.
3. **Step 3**: Check for patterns or keywords that match any of the defective argument types.
4. **Step 4**: Determine which defective argument type the string falls under.
5. **Step 5**: Output the identified defective argument type.

**Applying the Decomposition to the Task (<IDAA>)**:

1. **Step 1**: Read the string:
   - "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way."

2. **Step 2**: Compare the content with definitions of defective argument types.
   - Generalization <G>: General truth based on specific instance.
   - False Enumeration <FE>: Listing fewer or more options than exist.
   - Inappropriate Reason <IR>: Reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
   - Redundant Reason <RR>: Repeats the same thing in different words.
   - Weak Causal Basis <WCB>: Reason that is not strong enough to support the proposition.
   - False Universals <FU>: Assert universally agreed points without proof.
   - Double-Edged Phrases <DEP>: Statements open to dual interpretations.

3. **Step 3**: Check for patterns or keywords that match any of the defective argument types:
   - The string describes encouraging behavior based on the actions of others.
   - Keywords: "become part of a group," "because other people are acting in the same way."

4. **Step 4**: Determine which defective argument type the string falls under.
   - The described behavior refers to promoting an action because many others are doing it.
   - This aligns closely with the definition of False Universals <FU>, which often involve validating a point due to its popularity or widespread acceptance.

5. **Step 5**: Output the identified defective argument type.
   - The identified defective argument type is <FU>: False Universals.

### Summary:
The given string "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way." represents a **False Universal <FU>** defective argument type. This type encourages behavior based on the universal but unproven acceptance or action of others.
