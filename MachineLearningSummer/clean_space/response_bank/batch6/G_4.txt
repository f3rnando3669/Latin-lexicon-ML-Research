For 
To apply the process of IDAA (Application of Decomposition to Identify Defective Argument) to the given string "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess, all the other classes will all fail it, too.", we can follow the structured steps provided. 

**Example String:**  
"Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess, all the other classes will all fail it, too."

### Decomposition of Task (D) Applied to IDA:

1. **Understand the definitions and characteristics of each defective argument type:**
   - **<G>:** Generalization
   - **<FE>:** False Enumeration
   - **<IR>:** Inappropriate Reason
   - **<RR>:** Redundant Reason
   - **<WCB>:** Weak Causal Basis
   - **<FU>:** False Universals
   - **<DEP>:** Double-Edged Phrases

2. **Identify key markers or phrases:**
   - The string states that three kids in one class failed the quiz and then jumps to the conclusion that all other classes will fail it as well. This indicates a generalization from a specific instance.

3. **Match these markers against definitions:**
   - The phrase "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess, all the other classes will all fail it, too." is projecting the outcome of a single specific instance across a broader group (all other classes).

4. **Select the defective argument type:**
   - The argument best matching this characteristic is <G> (Generalization).

### Conclusion for the Example String:
- The string "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess, all the other classes will all fail it, too." represents a defective argument of type <G> (Generalization).

This methodical approach ensures a structured and accurate identification of the defective argument type in any given string.
