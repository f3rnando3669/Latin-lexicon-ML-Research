### Application of IDAA to "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far."

Let's break down the task of identifying the defective argument type in the given statement step-by-step using IDAA:

1. **Step 1: Read and Understand the Argument (RUA)**:
   - Read the statement carefully to understand its meaning.
   - **Statement**: "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far."

2. **Step 2: Check for Generalization (<G>)**:
   - Is the statement making a broad claim based on specific instances?
   - **Analysis**: The statement doesn't make a broad generalization based on specific instances. It focuses on one event (Trump's election) and one supposed reason (liberals and political correctness).

3. **Step 3: Check for False Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - Does the argument list too few or too many options about why something happened?
   - **Analysis**: The statement is not listing limited options nor creating a false enumeration. It points to one specific reason without comparing alternatives.

4. **Step 4: Check for Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**:
   - Is the reason given logically supporting the proposition?
   - **Analysis**: The reasoning may be more about a perceived cultural or social reaction rather than a logical, directly connected cause-and-effect relationship supporting Trump's election.

5. **Step 5: Check for Redundant Reason (<RR>)**:
   - Is the reason simply restating the proposition in different words?
   - **Analysis**: The statement does not seem to be just a repetition of the proposition. It offers a specific explanation (liberals and political correctness).

6. **Step 6: Check for Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - Is the reason provided too weak to support the causal claim?
   - **Analysis**: The statement seems to suggest a weak causal link between liberals taking political correctness too far and Trump's election. This causal link is highly debatable and oversimplified, failing to account for the multitude of factors involved in an election result.

7. **Step 7: Check for False Universals (<FU>)**:
   - Does the argument assert a universally agreed point without proof?
   - **Analysis**: The statement does not claim universal agreement, but it does imply a somewhat overarching perspective on what led to Trump's election.

8. **Step 8: Check for Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**:
   - Could the statement be open to dual interpretations?
   - **Analysis**: The statement is unlikely to have a dual interpretation. It is straightforward in its claim.

9. **Step 9: Label the Argument Type**:
   - Based on the analysis, identify the defective argument type.
   - **Conclusion**: The defective argument in the statement, "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far," is best identified as **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**. The statement posits a causal relationship that is too simplistic and fails to consider the complexity of the factors that led to Trump's election.

Therefore, the argument type for "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far." is **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
