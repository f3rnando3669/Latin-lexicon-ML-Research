Sure, let's apply the decomposition steps (<D>) for identifying the type of defective argument (<IDA>) to the argument: 

"One of our clients doubled their conversions after changing all their landing page text to bright red. Therefore, changing all text to red is a proven way to double conversions."

### Decomposition Steps (<D>) for Identifying the Type of Defective Argument (<IDA>):

1. **Understand the Argument**:
   - The argument claims that because changing landing page text to bright red worked for one client in doubling conversions, this change is proven to double conversions for any situation.

2. **Identify Keywords and Phrases**:
   - Key phrases: "One of our clients" and "changing all their landing page text to bright red."
   - Conclusion phrase: "Therefore, changing all text to red is a proven way to double conversions."

3. **Classify the Argument**:
   - The argument makes a general truth claim based on a specific instance. It generalizes from one case and implies universality without sufficient evidence that it applies broadly. This points toward <G> (Generalization).

4. **Verify with Examples**:
   - Compare with examples of generalization such as: "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess, all the other classes will all fail it, too."
   - The argument structure is similar as it makes a broad claim based on limited evidence (one client's result in this case).

5. **Rationalize the Classification**:
   - This argument fits <G> (Generalization) because it assumes that what worked for one client (changing text to red) will universally work for all situations without additional supporting evidence.

### Final Identification:
The given argument "One of our clients doubled their conversions after changing all their landing page text to bright red. Therefore, changing all text to red is a proven way to double conversions." is classified as <G> (Generalization).

By following these steps, we ensure a systematic and clear identification of the specific type of defective argument involved.
