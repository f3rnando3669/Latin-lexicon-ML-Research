For 
Let's apply the decomposed process <IDAA> to identify the type of defective argument in the statement "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there."

### Steps for Identifying the Type of Defective Argument (**<IDA>**):

1. **Read and Understand the Argument**:
   - The argument states that the reason for the restaurant's popularity is the fact that everyone in town goes there.

2. **Identify Key Components**:
   - Claim: The restaurant is popular.
   - Reason: Everyone in town goes there.

3. **Compare Components with Argument Types**:
   - We need to compare this reasoning with the definitions provided for the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>.

4. **Match Characteristics**:
   - Look for specific characteristics in the argument: Is it a generalization, false enumeration, inappropriate reason, redundancy, weak causal basis, false universal, or double-edged phrase?

5. **Determine Argument Type**:
   - Based on the matches identified, determine the appropriate defective argument type.

### Applying Decomposition to Identifying Defective Argument (**<IDAA>**):

1. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - Break down the argument systematically to identify its logical structure.

2. **Examine Specific Elements and Markers**:
   - The reason given is that "everyone in town goes there."
   - Check if this reason logically supports the claim or if it is merely restating the claim in other words.

3. **Logical Verification**:
   - Verify if stating "everyone in town goes there" provides a new reason or simply reiterates the claim about the restaurant's popularity.

4. **Categorical Confirmation**:
   - Confirm the categorization by cross-referencing with the definition of the appropriate argument type.

### Example Application:

1. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - The argument: "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there."
     - Claim: The restaurant is popular.
     - Reason: Everyone in town goes there.

2. **Examine Specific Elements and Markers**:
   - The reason given (everyone goes there) is an explanation for the restaurant's popularity.
   - Examine if this explanation effectively supports the claim or merely restates it.

3. **Logical Verification**:
   - The reasoning does not provide a new, substantial reason for the restaurant's popularity. Instead, it repeats the claim in a different form.

4. **Categorical Confirmation**:
   - By cross-referencing, this fits the description of <RR> (Redundant Reason). The argument repeats the proposition in different words without providing an independent reason.

### Conclusion:

The argument "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there" is an example of the defective argument type <RR> (Redundant Reason). 

By systematically applying the decomposition process <IDAA> to the original task <IDA>, we've identified that this argument commits the redundancy fallacy.
