For 
To identify the type of defective argument in the provided string using the IDAA methodology, we will follow the decomposed steps:

### String:
"I see nobody on the road," said Alice.  
"I only wish I had such eyes," the king remarked..."To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why it's as much as I can do to see real people, by this light."

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Recognize the Argument**:
   - Primary Claim: The king interprets Alice’s statement literally.
   - Supporting Reason(s): The king praises Alice's ability to see “Nobody” from a distance, as if she is literally seeing a person named "Nobody."

2. **Compare against Definitions**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: This does not involve claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: It does not involve listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: The reason given by the king does not logically support the proposition. Instead, it is a misinterpretation of Alice's statement.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: It is not about saying the same thing as the proposition in other words.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The proposition offered does not rely on a weak causal basis.
   - **False Universals (<FU>)**: There are no universally agreed points asserted without proof.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: The king's statement can be seen as open to dual interpretations and backfire against the speaker (the king).

3. **Categorize**:
   - The argument demonstrates a misinterpretation that leads to a humorous or ironic situation. The king interprets "nobody" as a literal person. This fits best with **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**.

4. **Validation**:
   - Cross-checking the definitions, the king’s response aligns with the concept of a Double-Edged Phrase wherein the statement made is open to dual interpretations and potential humorous contradiction.

### Result:
The argument in the string “I see nobody on the road,” said Alice.  
"I only wish I had such eyes,” the king remarked...”To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why it’s as much as I can do to see real people, by this light." is identified as a **Double-Edged Phrase (<DEP>)**.

By breaking down the process step-by-step, we see that the argument falls under this specific defective type due to the dual interpretation and potential for irony or contradiction inherent in the king's statement.
