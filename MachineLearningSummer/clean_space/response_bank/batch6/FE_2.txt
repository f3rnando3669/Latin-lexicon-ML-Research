For 
Let's apply **<D>** to the task **<IDA>** using **<IDAA>** to identify the defective argument type in the statement:

"You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."

### Steps for Applying <IDAA> on <IDA>:

1. **Parse the Argument (<s>):**
   - Statement: "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."
   
2. **Identify Keywords and Phrases:**
   - Keywords indicating a binary option: "either," "or"
   - Implied consequence: not supporting Hillary Clinton equates to not believing in women's rights.

3. **Classify the Defect:**

   - **Check if it is a Generalization (<G>):** 
     - No, it doesn't generalize a broad claim from a specific instance.

   - **Check if it is a False Enumeration (<FE>):**
     - Yes, it presents a false choice by listing only two options when more exist. Supporting Hillary Clinton is not the only way to support women's rights, and not supporting her does not necessarily mean one doesn't support women's rights.

   - **Check if it is an Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):**
     - No, the reason provided (support for women's rights) is directly tied to the proposition (supporting Hillary Clinton).

   - **Check if it is a Redundant Reason (<RR>):**
     - No, it does not restate the proposition using different words.
  
   - **Check if it is a Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
     - No, it's more about falsely limiting the options rather than providing a weak causal connection.
  
   - **Check if it is a False Universal (<FU>):**
     - There is an implication of a universal belief, but the core issue is the false choice being presented.
  
   - **Check if it is a Double-Edged Phrase (<DEP>):**
     - No, it is not about dual interpretations; rather, it restricts choices unreasonably.

4. **Verify Context and Logical Soundness:**
   - The argument erroneously limits the choices to two extreme options, ignoring other possible positions one can have regarding support for women's rights that do not involve supporting Hillary Clinton.

5. **Return Identified Defective Argument Type:**
   - The argument is a clear example of **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: it presents an artificially limited set of options — support Hillary Clinton or don't believe in women's rights — thereby ignoring the spectrum of possible views.

### Conclusion:
The statement "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" is identified as a **False Enumeration (<FE>)** within the context of defective argument types.
