### Applying <IDAA> to: 
"Every day, I eat cereal for breakfast. One time, I had a muffin instead, and there was a major earthquake in my city. I've eaten cereal ever since."

**Step 1: Extract Proposition and Reason**
- **Proposition**: "I've eaten cereal ever since."
- **Reason**: "One time, I had a muffin instead, and there was a major earthquake in my city."

**Step 2: Match Patterns for Argument Types**
- Analyze if the reason logically supports the proposition:
  - The argument implies that the choice of breakfast (cereal vs. muffin) has a causal relationship with a major earthquake, which is an external and unrelated event.

**Step 3: Assign the Argument Type**
- The provided reason (eating a muffin linked to a major earthquake) is not logically compelling to support the proposition (eating cereal will prevent earthquakes).
- This falls under the category of "Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)", as the causation inferred is weak and illogical.

**Step 4: Review and Confirm**
- The classification as "Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)" is accurate because the argument presents a weak causal connection between eating cereal and preventing earthquakes.

### Conclusion
The argument "Every day, I eat cereal for breakfast. One time, I had a muffin instead, and there was a major earthquake in my city. I've eaten cereal ever since." is identified as a "Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)" because the reason provided does not offer a compelling or logical basis to support the claim.
