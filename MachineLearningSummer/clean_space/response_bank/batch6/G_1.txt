### Applying IDAA to the Given String

#### String:
"I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!"

Let's apply the decomposition task for identifying the type of defective argument in this string.

1. **Read and Understand the Statement:**
   - Central claim: The 102-year-old Catholic neighbor is guilty of being involved in a sex scandal cover-up.
   
2. **Identify Key Components:**
   - Proposition: The elderly neighbor is guilty of involvement in a sex scandal cover-up.
   - Reason: The Catholic Church as an institution was involved in such a scandal.

3. **Classify the Argument:**
   - Compare the argument structure to the definitions provided:
     - **Generalization (<G>):** This argument claims something about an individual based on the actions of the larger group they are associated with. This can be seen as a flawed generalization, taking a specific instance of wrongdoing by some members of an organization and applying it to any individual associated with that organization.
     - **False Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument does not list options, so this does not apply.
     - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** The reason given (institutional wrongdoings) does not logically support the proposition of the individual's guilt.
     - **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** The reason and the proposition are not restatements of each other.
     - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The reason provided is not sufficiently connected to compellingly justify the conclusion.
     - **False Universals (<FU>):** The argument does not assert an universally accepted point without proof.
     - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** The statement is not open to dual interpretations that might go against the speaker.

   The primary basis of the argument (guilt by association) falls under **Generalization (<G>)** and **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**, as it makes an illogical assumption linking the behavior of an institution to an individual member.

4. **Evaluate Context and Nuance:**
   - Context: The argument relies on the perceived guilt of the institution to infer the guilt of individuals associated with it, which is a flawed reasoning approach.

5. **Determine the Defective Argument Type:**
   - The argument type is best classified under Generalization (<G>) because it generalizes the guilt associated with the institution to an individual member without a direct factual connection. It also demonstrates Inappropriate Reason (<IR>) because the reasoning does not logically support the claim.
    
6. **Confirm and Document:**
   - Confirmed as Generalization (<G>) and Inappropriate Reason (<IR>) with rationale: the specific conduct of the Catholic Church as an institution is used to unjustifiably generalize guilt to an individual church member, and the reasoning does not provide a logical basis for this claim.

### Conclusion

The string "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!" exhibits both <G> (Generalization) and <IR> (Inappropriate Reason) as the defective argument types.
