For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "In the race for mayor, Lara says a vote for her opponent will lead to you losing your job.", we'll follow the systematic breakdown of steps as outlined in the Decomposition (<D>):

### Task (_t_): Identify the defective argument type in the given string (_s_).

#### Step 1: Pre-process the string (_s_)
- The string "In the race for mayor, Lara says a vote for her opponent will lead to you losing your job." is grammatically correct and readable.

#### Step 2: Extract key components
- Protagonist: Lara
- Claim: "a vote for her opponent will lead to you losing your job."

#### Step 3: Compare identified components with types
- The key claim here presents a dire consequence (losing your job) based on a single action (voting for her opponent).
- This seems to limit the options available or distorts them to emphasize a binary choice: vote for Lara to secure your job or vote for the opponent and lose your job.

#### Step 4: Classify the type
- The claim "a vote for her opponent will lead to you losing your job" is an example of **False Enumeration (<FE>)**. It erroneously lists fewer options than actually exist, suggesting a binary and dire choice, where there could be other outcomes not explored in the statement.

#### Step 5: Validate the classification
- Similar examples of <FE> are "Vote for Smith or live through four more years of higher taxes." and "America: Love it or leave it", which also present limited, overly simplistic choices.

Thus, for the string:

**_s_**: "In the race for mayor, Lara says a vote for her opponent will lead to you losing your job." 

â†’ **Type**: <FE> (False Enumeration)
