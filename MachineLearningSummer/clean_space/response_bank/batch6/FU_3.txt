For 
To apply IDAA (the application of the decomposition of a complex task into specific steps) to the given statement "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding," we will systematically follow the outlined procedure to identify the type of defective argument in the statement.

### Step 1: Extract the Proposition and Reasoning
- **Proposition**: The speaker asserts that they were not speeding.
- **Reasoning**: The speaker justifies their driving speed by comparing it to the speed of others around them.

### Step 2: Match to Definitions
We will now compare the extracted components with the definitions of the defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Does the statement make a general conclusion based on a specific instance?
   - No. The statement does not generalize from a specific instance to a broader conclusion.

2. **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Does the statement present fewer or more options than actually exist?
   - No. The statement does not involve presenting limited or alternative options.

3. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Does the provided reason logically support the proposition?
   - The reason given, "everyone around me was driving at that speed," does not logically support the claim of not speeding. Speeding is determined by the posted speed limit, not by the behavior of others.

4. **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Does the reason restate the proposition in different words?
   - No. The reasoning is not simply a restatement of the proposition.

5. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Is there an unconvincing causal link between the reason and the proposition?
   - No causal relationship is implied here.

6. **False Universals (<FU>)**: Does the statement assert a universally agreed point without proof?
   - The statement does seem to imply that following the speed of everyone around is an acceptable basis for not speeding, potentially invoking a widespread, but not logically sound, belief.

7. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Does the statement use phrases open to dual interpretations?
   - No dual interpretations are immediately apparent in this context.

### Step 3: Check for Fallacy Characteristics
We identify indications matching specific defective argument types:
- **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**: Speeding is determined by objective measures (speed limits) rather than relative measures (the speed of others). The provided reason (everyone was going at that speed) does not logically support the proposition (I wasn't speeding).
- **<FU> (False Universals)**: There is an underlying assumption that following the behavior of the majority is a valid reason for adherence to laws (implied: "If everyone is doing it, it must be fine"), but this is not directly stated or universally agreed without proof.

### Step 4: Determine the Defective Argument Type
Based on our analysis, the primary defective argument type is:
- **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**

**Conclusion**: The statement “Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding” primarily exhibits the defective argument type **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**, because the justification for not speeding (matching the speed of surrounding drivers) does not logically support the claim that the speaker was in compliance with speed limits.
