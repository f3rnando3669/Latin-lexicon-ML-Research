For 
Let's apply the decomposition strategy <D> to the task <IDA> for the given string:

**Argument:** 
"Speaker 1: We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change.
Speaker: Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>) and Identification (<IDAA>):

1. **Parse the Argument:**
   - Speaker 1: States that they are using people to spread awareness about social injustice.
   - Speaker 2: Responds by stating that it's wrong to "use" people, implying a moral objection.

2. **Identify Key Features:**
   - The key feature here is the word "use," which in this context can be understood in two different ways:
     1. **Speaker 1's usage:** "Using" people means organizing and mobilizing individuals for a cause.
     2. **Speaker 2's interpretation:** "Using" people implies exploitation or unethical manipulation.

3. **Match with Defective Argument Types:**
   - The main feature identified is semantic ambiguity—two different interpretations of the word "use." This leads to a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of Speaker 1's intent.
   - This suggests a **Double-Edged Phrase** because the word "use" has dual interpretations that Speaker 2 exploits to object to the argument.

4. **Determine the Type:**
   - The defective argument type in this case is **<DEP>** (Double-Edged Phrases).

5. **Cross-Verification (Optional):**
   - Verify if this conclusion stands by checking other argument types:
     - **Generalization (<G>):** Not applicable, as it doesn’t involve a general truth based on a specific instance.
     - **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Not applicable, as it doesn't list limited options.
     - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Not applicable, the reason is semantically ambivalent rather than irrelevant.
     - **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Not applicable, as it isn't repeating the same thing.
     - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Not applicable, the argument is not about weak cause-effect.
     - **False Universals (<FU>):** Not applicable, the argument doesn’t assert universal acceptance without proof.

By applying <IDAA> to the provided argument, we identify the defective argument type as **<DEP>** (Double-Edged Phrases).
