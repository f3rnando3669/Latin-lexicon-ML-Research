### Step-by-Step Decomposition of Task <IDA> Applied to the Given String

Letâ€™s apply the IDAA process to classify the provided string:

#### Step 1: Understand the Argument Types
Review definitions of defective argument types: <G> (Generalization), <FE> (False Enumeration), <IR> (Irrelevant Reason), <RR> (Restating Reason), <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis), <FU> (False Universals), and <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases).

#### Step 2: Parse the Input String <s>
Input String <s>:
"Perhaps the most classic example of this fallacy is the argument for the existence of God. Due to the understanding of nature through science, many of the arguments that used to be used for God (or gods) were abandoned, only to be replaced with new ones, usually involving questions to which science has not definitively answered yet. The move from creationism to intelligent design is a prime example. Currently the origin of life is a popular argument for God (although a classic argument from ignorance), and an area where we very well may have a scientific answer in the next decade, at which time, the 'origin of life' argument will fade away and be replaced by another, thus moving the figurative goalposts farther back as our understanding of the natural world increases. Exception: This fallacy should not be confused with an argument or set of arguments, with multiple propositions inherent in the argument. The reason for the difference between this kind of argument and the moving the goalposts fallacy, is a subtle one, but indicated by a strong initial claim ('has to be', 'must', 'required for', etc.) that gets answered and/or what appears to be ad hoc objections that follow eventually leading to an impossible request for proof. Fun Fact: The name 'moving the goalposts' comes from the analogy of kicking a perfect field goal in American football, only to have the goalposts be moved on you. This would be very unfair."

#### Step 3: Identify Key Components of the Argument
- **Subject**: Arguments for the existence of God.
- **Predicate**: Arguments are replaced as science advances.
- **Reason**: Science provides new explanations, rendering the old arguments obsolete.
- **Proposition**: Arguments for God's existence are consistently being replaced by new ones as science progresses.

#### Step 4: Apply Argument Type Characteristics
- **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument is not claiming a general truth based on a specific instance but rather a broad trend.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not relevant here as it doesn't enumerate options.
- **Irrelevant Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided (advances in science) seems relevant to the proposition about arguments for God.
- **Restating Reason (<RR>)**: The reason and proposition are not restating each other in different words.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument does not hinge on a weak causal relationship.
- **False Universals (<FU>)**: The argument implies a broad application but is supported by the given explanation that science replaces arguments for God's existence.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: No ambiguity or dual interpretation is presented against the speaker.

Assessing the characteristics, the argument in the string is detailed and contains specifics about how scientific understanding evolves and how arguments for God's existence have responded to that evolution. The main aspect of the analysis is whether it can be classified under 'False Universals' since it touches on universally agreed points without proof or provides sweeping statements without adequate support.

#### Step 5: Classify the Argument
Given the pervasive nature of the argumentation and broad claims about advancement in science supplanting various deity-related arguments, and considering that the string mentions generalized trends without specific cited evidence:

- **Classification**: <FU> (False Universals)

#### Step 6: Verify the Classification
- **Verification**: Double-check that the string fits the <FU> classification. It mentions broad trends without specific evidence, making universal claims about arguments for God being replaced as science advances.

Thus, the argument can be effectively classified as <FU> (False Universals).
