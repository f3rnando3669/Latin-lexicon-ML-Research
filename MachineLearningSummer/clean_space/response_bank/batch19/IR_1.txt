For 
Let's decompose the task <IDA> into specific steps to classify the given string <s>: "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you."

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Understand the Definitions**
   - Familiarize yourself with the defective argument types:
     - **<G>**: Generalization
     - **<FE>**: False Enumeration
     - **<WCB>**: Weak Causal Basis
     - **<FU>**: False Universals
     - **<DEP>**: Double-Edged Phrases
     - **<RR>**: Restatement Reasoning
     - **<IR>**: Irrelevant Reasoning

2. **Analyze the Structure of <s>**
   - "My best friend says you’re a liar," (Reason - providing some external opinion or testimony)
   - "so I’m not going to talk to you." (Proposition - conclusion based on the reason)

3. **Identify Key Characteristics of <s>**
   - The first clause provides a reason based on an external opinion (best friend calling someone a liar).
   - The second clause concludes an action (not talking to someone) based on that reason.
   - There isn't a universal claim, a weak causal basis, a generalization, a false enumeration, or a double-edged phrase.

4. **Classify the Type of Defective Argument**
   - The first clause (Reason) is an assertion that someone is a liar, without providing any evidence or relevance to substantiate it.
   - The second clause (Proposition) bases the decision not to talk to the person solely on an unverified opinion.
   - This fits the definition of **<IR>** (Irrelevant Reasoning) because the reason provided (opinion of a best friend) does not adequately support the conclusion (decision not to talk).

5. **Verification and Adjustment**
   - Review if the first clause indeed does not give a valid reason for the conclusion.
   - Confirm that the Reason (best friend's opinion) is not relevant to the Proposition (deciding not to talk without any supportive evidence).

Final classification for <s>: **<IR>**

By systematically applying the steps of <D>, the string <s>: "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you." is classified as **<IR>**.
