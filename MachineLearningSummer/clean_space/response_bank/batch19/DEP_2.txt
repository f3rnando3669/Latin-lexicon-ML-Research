For 
Sure, let's systematically apply the step-by-step decomposition \( <D> \) to the given string \( <s> \).

**Example string**: 
"Speaker 1: We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change. Speaker: Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (\(<D>\)) for \( <IDA> \):

1. **Identify the Structure of the Argument:**
   - The string consists of a dialogue between two speakers.
   - The argument is mainly in the second speaker's statement: "Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."
   - It has two parts: "I can’t be a part of this" (Proposition) and "because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people" (Reason).

2. **Check for Generalization (\(<G>\)):**
   - The statement does not claim a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - **Not \( <G> \)**.

3. **Check for False Enumeration (\(<FE>\)):**
   - It does not present limited options or choices.
   - **Not \( <FE> \)**.

4. **Check for Weak Causal Basis (\(<WCB>\)):**
   - It does not propose a weak causal link between events.
   - **Not \( <WCB> \)**.

5. **Check for False Universals (\(<FU>\)):**
   - It does not assert universally agreed points without proof.
   - **Not \( <FU> \)**.

6. **Check for Double-Edged Phrases (\(<DEP>\)):**
   - It does not contain phrases open to dual interpretations that may reflect negatively on the speaker.
   - **Not \( <DEP> \)**.

7. **Check for Redundant Reasoning (\(<RR>\)):**
   - The \( <Reason> \) "because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people" does not simply restate the \( <Proposition> \) "I can’t be a part of this" in different words. 
   - **Not \( <RR> \)**.

8. **Check for Irrelevant Reasoning (\(<IR>\)):**
   - The \( <Reason> \) "because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people" does not provide relevant support specific to the \( <Proposition> \).
   - There is a misalignment between the stated reason and the actual situation which implies that using people for a positive cause like spreading awareness about social injustice is wrong in the same sense as exploiting them, without considering the different contexts. 
   - This matches the definition of \( <IR> \).

### Result:
The string \( s \): "Speaker 1: We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change. Speaker: Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people." is classified as type \( <IR> \) (Irrelevant Reasoning).

This completes the task \( <IDAA> \) in a step-by-step manner.
