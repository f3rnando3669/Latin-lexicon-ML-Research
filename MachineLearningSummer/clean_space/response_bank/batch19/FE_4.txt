### Step-by-Step Decomposition of Classification ( \( <IDAA> \) ):

1. **Identification of Components**:
   - Subject: "I" 
   - Predicate: "thought you were a good person"
   - Subject: "you"
   - Predicate: "weren’t in class today"
   - Overall structure: The sentence consists of two parts. The first part ("I thought you were a good person") can be considered a reason (implying a positive judgment about the person). The second part ("but you weren’t in class today") is a proposition providing evidence against the positive judgment.

2. **Compare with Definitions**:
   - **<G>**: Is \( <s> \) making a broad claim based on a specific instance? Not applicable in this context.
   - **<FE>**: Is \( <s> \) listing fewer or more options than there actually are? Not applicable.
   - **<WCB>**: Is \( <s> \) offering a cause that doesn’t adequately support the proposition? Not applicable.
   - **<FU>**: Is \( <s> \) asserting something as universally agreed without proof? Not applicable.
   - **<DEP>**: Is \( <s> \) using phrases that can be interpreted in two different ways? Not applicable.
   - **<RR>**: Is \( <s> \) providing a reason that just restates the proposition? Not applicable.
   - **<IR>**: Is \( <s> \) giving a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition? The reason ("I thought you were a good person") does not logically support the proposition ("but you weren’t in class today").

3. **Pattern Matching**:
   - Look for keywords and structures typical of each argument type.
   - The sentence structure points towards giving a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition. The idea of being a "good person" is irrelevant to the unrelated action of not being in class.

4. **Cross-Verification**:
   - Ensure that it is indeed a case of irrelevant reasoning.
   - Re-check that it does not fit better in other categories. It fits the irrelevance of the reason to the proposition provided.

5. **Final Classification**:
   - **<IR>**: The argument type is identified as "Irrelevant Reason," since "I thought you were a good person" does not logically support or relate to "you weren’t in class today."

### Result:
The string "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today." is classified as **<IR>**.
