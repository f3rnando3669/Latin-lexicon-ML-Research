For 
To classify the string "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding." using the IDAA approach, we will follow the steps (D) as decomposed for the IDA task:

### String \( s \) Analysis:

1. **Read and Understand the Argument**:
   - The speaker is arguing that they were not speeding because they were driving at the same speed as others around them.

2. **Identify Clauses**:
   - Clause 1 (Reason): "I was only driving as fast as everyone around me."
   - Clause 2 (Proposition): "I'm sure I wasn't speeding."

3. **Check for Generalization (G)**:
   - The argument is not making a broad statement based on a specific instance.
   - **Result**: Not G.

4. **Check for False Enumeration (FE)**:
   - The argument does not list fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - **Result**: Not FE.

5. **Check for Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - Is the reason given (driving at the same speed as everyone else) a weak causal basis for the proposition (not speeding)? It could be argued it is not convincing enough because the speed of others does not legally justify one's speed.
   - **Result**: Not conclusively WCB, but let's proceed to other checks to see if there's a better match.

6. **Check for False Universals (FU)**:
   - The argument does not assert universally agreed points without proof.
   - **Result**: Not FU.

7. **Check for Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**:
   - The argument is not open to dual interpretations that could potentially contradict the speaker.
   - **Result**: Not DEP.

8. **Check for Restating Reason (RR)**:
   - Clause 1 does not just restate what is said in clause 2 in different words.
   - **Result**: Not RR.

9. **Check for Irrelevant Reason (IR)**:
   - Clause 1 (Reason: "I was only driving as fast as everyone around me.") does not provide logical support or give credence to Clause 2 (Proposition: "I'm sure I wasn't speeding.") because what others are doing does not determine whether the speaker was speeding according to the speed limit.

### Conclusion
The argument type of the string "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding." is **IR** (Irrelevant Reason).
