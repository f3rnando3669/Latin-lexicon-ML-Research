Let's apply IDAA step-by-step to classify the given argument:

### Given Argument \( s \):
"When the judge asked the defendant why he hadn't paid his parking fines, he said that he shouldn't have to pay them because the sign said 'Fine for parking here' and so he naturally presumed that it would be fine to park there."

#### Step 1: Understand the Definitions

- **G**: Generalization
- **FE**: False Enumeration
- **WCB**: Weak Causal Basis
- **FU**: False Universals
- **DEP**: Double-Edged Phrases
- **RR**: Reason-Reasoning
- **IR**: Irrelevant Reasoning

#### Step 2: Analyze the Structure
- The sentence describes a situation where the defendant misconstrued the meaning of a sign.
- It involves the interpretation of the phrase "Fine for parking here."

#### Step 3: Apply Specific Checks
- **Generalization (G)**: This isn’t making a broad claim based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (FE)**: No listing of options is presented.
- **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**: There’s no causal relationship proposed that is weak or unsupported.
- **False Universals (FU)**: The statement does not assert a universally accepted fact without evidence.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**: The sentence includes an interpretation of the phrase "Fine for parking here", which can be seen as dual interpretations. One interpretation is that parking is allowed and the other is that there will be a fine imposed for parking.
- **Reason-Reasoning (RR)**: No reason given which simply restates the proposition.
- **Irrelevant Reasoning (IR)**: No irrelevant reason observed.

#### Step 4: Classify \( s \)
- Given that the argument hinges on the dual interpretation of "Fine for parking here," it fits the category of **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**.

By following these steps, we can systematically classify the argument "When the judge asked the defendant why he hadn't paid his parking fines, he said that he shouldn't have to pay them because the sign said 'Fine for parking here' and so he naturally presumed that it would be fine to park there." as **<DEP>**.
