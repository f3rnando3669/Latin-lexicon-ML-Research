### Application of <IDAA> to the String:
Given string <s>: "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."

**Step 1: Read and Understand the String**:
- Carefully read the statement to understand the claim being made:
  - The claim presents two options: supporting Hillary Clinton for President or not believing in women's rights.

**Step 2: Identify the Structure**:
- Analyze the structure:
  - The statement is composed of a single sentence with two options presented.

**Step 3: Analyze Specific Indicators**:
- Look for indicators of specific defective argument types:
  - Phrases suggestive of a forced dichotomy or false choice.

**Step 4: Match to Argument Types**:
- Compare the statement against the defined defective argument types:
  - **<FE> (False Enumeration)**: This argument type involves listing fewer or more options than actually exist. The statement seems to present a false dichotomy, i.e., it suggests only two choices when there might be more nuanced positions. 

**Step 5: Initial Hypothesis**:
- Form an initial hypothesis based on the analysis:
  - The argument seems to fit the type <FE> because it presents a limited set of options that excludes other possibilities.

**Step 6: Verification**:
- Re-check the string to confirm the hypothesis:
  - Cross-check with the specific definition of <FE> to ensure the classification is accurate:
    - **<FE>**: The argument either omits alternative options or creates a binary choice when there are other possibilities.
    - The string indeed creates a binary choice between supporting Hillary Clinton for President or not believing in women's rights, ignoring any other possible beliefs or actions one might take regarding women's rights without supporting her.

**Step 7: Conclusion**:
- Finalize and document the classification:
  - The string "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights." is classified as <FE> (False Enumeration).

By following the steps of <IDAA>, we systematically decomposed the task and determined that the given string exemplifies the defective argument type <FE> (False Enumeration).
