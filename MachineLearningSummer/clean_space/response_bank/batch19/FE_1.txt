For 
Let's apply the step-by-step decomposition \( <IDAA> \) to the given string:

\( s \): "The museum's new gemstones and precious minerals exhibit needs more security guards. If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal a piece of the exhibit."

### Step 1: Identify the main components of the argument
   - Clause 1: "The museum's new gemstones and precious minerals exhibit needs more security guards." (\<Proposition>)
   - Clause 2: "If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal a piece of the exhibit." (\<Proposition> which also implies a reason or consequence)

### Step 2: Check for Generalization (\<G>)
   - The argument does not seem to be claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.

### Step 3: Check for False Enumeration (\<FE>)
   - The argument does not appear to provide a limited set of choices where more options actually exist.

### Step 4: Check for Weak Causal Basis (\<WCB>)
   - We need to assess if the causal link (not agreeing means planning to steal) is compelling. This connection seems unjustified and extreme.

### Step 5: Check for False Universals (\<FU>)
   - The argument does not assert universally agreed points without proof.

### Step 6: Check for Double-Edged Phrases (\<DEP>)
   - The statement does not utilize phrases that can be interpreted in multiple and contradictory ways.

### Step 7: Check for Redundant Reasoning (\<RR>)
   - The clauses are not restatements of each other using different words.

### Step 8: Check for Irrelevant Reasoning (\<IR>)
   - Clause 2 essentially makes an irrelevant or unjustified assumption about someone's motives if they don't agree.

### Step 9: Compare and classify
   - The most fitting classification for \( s \) involves \( <IR> \) since the reason provided (planning to steal a piece of the exhibit) is irrelevant and not supportive of the proposition needing more security guards.

Thus, \( s \) is classified as of type \( <IR> \).
