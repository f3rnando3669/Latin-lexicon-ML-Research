For 
Certainly! Let's apply the step-by-step decomposition \( \langle D \rangle \) to the given string \( s \): "People either like coffee or hate it."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition: \( \langle D \rangle \)
1. **Identify Components**: Break down the given string \( s \) to identify if it has distinct clauses or phrases.
   - Clause 1: "People either like coffee" \(\Rightarrow\) \( \langle Proposition \rangle \)
   - Clause 2: "or hate it" \(\Rightarrow\) \( \langle Proposition \rangle \)

2. **Clause Analysis**: Determine the nature of each clause (whether it acts as \( \langle Reason \rangle \) or \( \langle Proposition \rangle \)).
   - Both clauses are making propositional statements about people's preferences for coffee.

3. **Match to Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (\( \langle G \rangle \)): The string does not generalize from a specific instance to make a broad claim.
   - **False Enumeration (\( \langle FE \rangle \)): The string presents a limited set of options: either liking coffee or hating it, excluding any possible middle ground or alternative preferences.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (\( \langle WCB \rangle \)): The string does not provide a causal relationship.
   - **False Universals (\( \langle FU \rangle \)): The string does not assert a universal point without proof but rather presents two specific options.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (\( \langle DEP \rangle \)): The string is not open to dual interpretations that could work against the speaker.
   - **Restatement Reason (\( \langle RR \rangle \)): The string does not restate the proposition in different words.
   - **Irrelevant Reason (\( \langle IR \rangle \)): The string does not provide a reason that is irrelevant to the proposition.

4. **Classification**: Based on the analysis, the argument type that fits the given string \( s \) is False Enumeration.

### Conclusion
The string "People either like coffee or hate it." can be classified as \( \langle FE \rangle \) (False Enumeration) because it lists fewer options than actually exist, limiting the possibilities to liking or hating coffee without considering other possibilities, such as being indifferent, having mixed feelings, or liking it under certain conditions.
