For 
To apply the decomposition (IDAA) to the string \( s \) = "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people. This logical fallacy is called...", we'll follow the steps outlined. 

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (\<D>):

1. **Extract Information from \( s \)**:
   - **Step 1.1**: Read and parse \( s \).
     - \( s \) is "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people."
   - **Step 1.2**: Identify the clauses within \( s \).
     - Clause 1: "We need to fix our broken judicial system"
     - Clause 2: "by electing new people."

2. **Identify Propositions and Reasons**:
   - **Step 2.1**: Determine if \( s \) contains <Proposition>.
     - "We need to fix our broken judicial system" is a <Proposition>.
   - **Step 2.2**: Determine if \( s \) contains <Reason>.
     - "by electing new people" is intended as <Reason>.

3. **Classify Based on Argument Types**:
   - **Step 3.1**: Check for <G>:
     - No specific instance generalized into a broader truth.
   - **Step 3.2**: Check for <FE>:
     - No enumeration of choices.
   - **Step 3.3**: Check for <WCB>:
     - Yes, the argument presents a weak causal relationship. Electing new people does not compellingly support the proposition that it would fix the judicial system, as several other factors need to be taken into account in such a complex system.
   - **Step 3.4**: Check for <FU>:
     - No universal agreement assertion.
   - **Step 3.5**: Check for <DEP>:
     - No double-edged phrases.
   - **Step 3.6**: Check for <RR>:
     - No redundant restatement.
   - **Step 3.7**: Check for <IR>:
     - No irrelevant reason provided; the reason attempts to support the proposition, though weakly.

4. **Identify the Defective Argument Type**:
   - **Step 4.1**: Based on the above checks, classify \( s \).
     - The string \( s \) exhibits characteristics of <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis).

**Result**:
- \( s \): "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people." is classified as of type <WCB>.

The logical fallacy in the argument provided is termed **Weak Causal Basis**, since the reason offered is insufficiently compelling to support the proposition.
