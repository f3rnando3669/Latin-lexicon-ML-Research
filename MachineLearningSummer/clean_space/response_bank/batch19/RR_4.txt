For 
To apply the process of IDAA to the string "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there," let's follow the step-by-step decomposition:

### Step 1: Understand the Argument

**String \( s \)**: "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there."

- **Proposition**: "That restaurant is popular."
- **Reason**: "Everyone in town goes there."

### Step 2: Identify Argument Structure

- The structure of the argument includes a proposition supported by a reason.
- The reason given is that "everyone in town goes there," supporting the proposition that "the restaurant is popular."

### Step 3: Match with Defect Types

Let's compare this structure to the defined defective argument types:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument does not generalize from a specific instance to a universal claim.
  
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not list options, so it's not about enumeration.
  
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument does provide a cause ("everyone in town goes there") for the effect ("the restaurant is popular"), but it relies heavily on the popularity of the restaurant being proven by everyone's attendance, which suggests it might be more about universal acceptance.

- **False Universals (<FU>)**: The argument claims that "everyone in town goes there," which is an assertion based on universal agreement or popularity without independent proof. This might fit the <FU> type because it presumes that because everyone is doing something (going to the restaurant), the conclusion (restaurant is popular) must be true.

- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: This argument does not seem open to dual interpretations.

- **Restating Reason (<RR>)**: The reason ("everyone in town goes there") and proposition ("the restaurant is popular") are closely linked but do not merely restate each other in different words. 

- **Irrelevant Reason (<IR>)**: The reason given does support the proposition, so this is not an irrelevant reason.

### Step 4: Apply Classification

Based on the steps above, the argument in the string most closely fits the **False Universals (<FU>)** type. The reason relies on a claimed universal fact (everyone in town goes there) to support the proposition without proving the popularity through another means.

### Step 5: Review and Verify

Reviewing the classification:
- The argument appeals to the popularity of the restaurant based on the assumption that if everyone goes there, it must be popular, which is an attempt to validate the claim through universal agreement without additional proof.
  
Thus, the string "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there" is classified as type **<FU>** (False Universals).
