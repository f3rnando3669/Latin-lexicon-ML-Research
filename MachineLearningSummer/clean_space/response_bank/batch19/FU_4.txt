For 
Certainly! Let's apply IDAA to the string "Everyone else is doing it, so should you."

### Decomposition and Classification (IDAA) for the Given String

1. **Identify Key Elements**:
    - The key elements are:
        - Reason: "Everyone else is doing it"
        - Proposition: "so should you"

2. **Classify the Argument Type**:
    - Check for **Generalizations (G)**: No claim of a general truth based on a specific instance.
    - Check for **False Enumeration (FE)**: No listing of options that are fewer or more than actually exist.
    - Check for **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**: The statement does not offer a weak causal relationship.
    - Check for **False Universals (FU)**: This argument makes a universal claim without proof: stating that because everyone else is doing it, it must be a valid or correct action. This fits the definition of a false universal.
    - Check for **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**: Not applicable here, as the statement doesnâ€™t have a potential dual interpretation.
    - Check for **Reason Restatements (RR)**: The reason ("everyone else is doing it") does not just restate the proposition ("so should you") in different words.
    - Check for **Irrelevant Reasons (IR)**: The reason somewhat supports the proposition by appealing to popularity, but without providing valid logical grounding, it aligns best with False Universals.

3. **Match the Argument to a Defective Type**:
    - The most fitting classification for this argument seems to be **False Universals (FU)**, as it falls under the category of making a universally agreed-upon point without proof.

4. **Output the Classification**:
    - The string "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" is classified as <FU>.

**Classification**: <FU> (False Universals)

By following these steps, we've decomposed the argument and identified that the given string fits the type of a defective argument known as False Universals.
