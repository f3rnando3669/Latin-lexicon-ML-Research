For 
To apply the decomposition approach (<D>) to the classification task (<IDA>), we'll analyze the dialogue step-by-step according to the specified defective argument types. Here's how we can apply <IDAA> to the given conversation:

### Step 1: Identify the Key Components of the Statements

1.1. **Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified.**
- Subject: Jesus
- Predicate: was not really crucified.

1.2. **Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?**
- Questioning the validity of the previous statement.

1.3. **Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so.**
- Subject: Quran
- Predicate: says so (Jesus was not really crucified).

1.4. **Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct?**
- Questioning the validity of the Quran.

1.5. **Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.**
- Subject: Quran
- Predicate: is the Word of God, everything it says is true.

1.6. **Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?**
- Questioning the validity of the predicate.

1.7. **Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran.**
- Subject: God
- Predicate: tells us so in the Quran.

### Step 2: Determine Relevance and Causal Connection

2.1. **Check for Generalization (<G>)**
- None of the statements are claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.

2.2. **Check for False Enumeration (<FE>)**
- None of the statements list fewer or more options than actually exist.

2.3. **Check for Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
- None of the statements provide a weak causal basis. They rely on the authority of the Quran without giving a causal reason.

2.4. **Check for False Universals (<FU>)**
- Speaker 1's assertions rely on the assumed universal truth of the Quran's divine nature, but it doesn't assert universally agreed points without additional proof.

### Step 3: Evaluate Logical Consistency and Directness

3.1. **Check for Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**
- No statements appear to have dual interpretations.

3.2. **Check for Redundant Reasoning (<RR>)**
- Statements involve a circular reasoning pattern rather than reiterative reasoning:
  - The Quran is correct because it's the Word of God.
  - It's the Word of God because God tells us so in the Quran.

3.3. **Check for Irrelevant Reasoning (<IR>)**
- Evaluate each claim. There is a direct reliance on the authority of the Quran but in a circular manner.

### Step 4: Classify the Statement

4.1. **Apply Criteria**
- The argument relies on circular reasoning:
  - The Quran is the Word of God because the Quran says so.
  - This reasoning is circular because it assumes the Quran's authority to prove the Quran's authority.

The conversation involves circular reasoning. Although this is often classified as a broader logical fallacy, the closest type among our defined set is:

- **<RR> (Redundant Reasoning)**, although extended to circular logic, which is essentially redundancy of the entire reasoning process by repeating the claim.

### Conclusion
The dialogue provided can be classified as a type of <RR> (Redundant Reasoning), specifically using circular logic. The reasoning process is flawed because it assumes what it is attempting to prove.

Thus, applying <IDAA> to "Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified. Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true? Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so. Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct? Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true. Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true? Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran." results in identifying the conversation as exhibiting <RR> due to circular reasoning.
