For 
To classify the string "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses." using the decomposition approach (\(<IDAA>\)):

### Decomposition of \( <IDA> \) into Steps (\( <D> \)):

1. **Identify Clauses:**
   - Clause 1: "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being." (\( <Proposition> \))
   - Clause 2: "Fetuses are innocent human beings." (\( <Proposition> \))
   - Clause 3: "Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses." (\( <Conclusion> \))

2. **Type Recognition:**
   - Clause 1 makes a proposition about morality.
   - Clause 2 makes a proposition about fetuses.
   - Clause 3 concludes based on the previous two propositions.

3. **Check for Generalization (\( <G> \)):**
   - The argument does not claim a general truth based on a specific instance. It applies a general moral principle.

4. **Check for False Enumeration (\( <FE> \)):**
   - The argument does not list options; it draws a moral conclusion based on given premises.

5. **Check for Weak Causal Basis (\( <WCB> \)):**
   - The argument does not offer a causal connection. It follows a logical structure.

6. **Check for False Universals (\( <FU> \)):**
   - The argument does not assert universally agreed points without proof directly. It relies on definitions and moral claims.

7. **Check for Double-Edged Phrases (\( <DEP> \)):**
   - The argument does not use statements that can be interpreted in two different ways.

8. **Check for Redundant Reasoning (\( <RR> \)):**
   - The argument does not restate the same idea in different words. It logically progresses from a moral principle to a specific application.

9. **Check for Irrelevant Reasoning (\( <IR> \)):**
   - The premises are intended to be relevant to the conclusion. Therefore, irrelevant reasoning does not apply here.

10. **Assign Classification:**
    - The argument does not fall into any of the defective argument types defined. It is a structured logical argument where the conclusion follows from the premises.

### Conclusion:
The string "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses." does not classify as \( <G> \), \( <FE> \), \( <IR> \), \( <RR> \), \( <WCB> \), \( <FU> \), or \( <DEP> \) using the steps provided. This argument appears logically valid within the given framework and is not a defective argument according to the specified types.
