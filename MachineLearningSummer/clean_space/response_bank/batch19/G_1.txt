For 
To classify the given string as one of the defective argument types using the decomposed steps (\( <IDAA> \)), let's break it down step by step.

### Given String for \( <IDAA> \)
String \( s \): "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!"

### Step 1: Understanding the String
- **Parse the string**: The statement makes a claim based on an instance involving the Catholic Church and extends the guilt to an individual member of the Church.

### Step 2: Identify Key Characteristics
- **Extract key components**: The statement involves a general accusation against the Catholic Church and then attributes guilt to a specific individual based on their association with the Church.

### Step 3: Match with Defective Argument Types
- **Generalization (\(<G>\))**: Check if it makes a broad generalization based on a specific instance.
  - This statement takes a specific instance (a scandal involving the Catholic Church) and generalizes it to implicate a specific individual (the 102-year-old neighbor).
- **False Enumeration (\(<FE>\))**: Determine if it lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
  - This does not list options.
- **Weak Causal Basis (\(<WCB>\))**: Evaluate if it offers a weak causal basis to support the proposition.
  - This does not primarily rely on causal reasoning.
- **False Universals (\(<FU>\))**: Assess if it involves universally agreed points without sufficient proof.
  - There is no universal claim here.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (\(<DEP>\))**: Look for statements open to dual interpretations that can be viewed oppositely.
  - The statement is straightforward and does not have dual interpretations.
- **Redundant Reasoning (\(<RR>\))**: Check if it restates the same idea in different words.
  - The reasoning is not redundant.
- **Irrelevant Reasoning (\(<IR>\))**: Determine if a part does not support or give credence to the other part.
  - The reasoning is directly tied to the proposition, despite being flawed.

### Step 4: Evaluation
- **Evaluate the extracted components**: The statement generalizes guilt from a large group (the Catholic Church involved in scandal) to an individual (the neighbor) without individual evidence.

### Step 5: Classification
- **Classify the string \( s \)**: The string \( s \) is classified as type \( <G> \) (Generalization).

By following these steps, we have decomposed and classified the given string \( s \) as a Generalization (type \( <G> \)).
