For 
To classify the given statement by applying the step-by-step approach of <IDAA>, we will break down the process as follows:

### Step 1: Initial Identification
1. **Read the string <s> carefully:**
   ```
   "I see nobody on the road," said Alice.
   "I only wish I had such eyes," the king remarked..."To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why it's as much as I can do to see real people, by this light."
   ```
   Ensure you understand what the argument is claiming: Alice mentions she sees "nobody" on the road, and the king responds by interpreting "nobody" as a person who is hard to see.

2. **Identify the Structure:**
   The argument involves a dialogue between Alice and the king. Alice makes an observation, and the king responds with an interpretation that plays with the word "nobody."

### Step 2: Determine Argument Type
1. **Check for Generalization (<G>):**
   - No broad conclusion from a specific instance is being made here.
2. **Check for False Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - No specific options or limited choices are mentioned.
3. **Check for Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - There is no causal relationship discussed in the argument.
4. **Check for False Universals (<FU>):**
   - No universal assertion is made without proof.
5. **Check for Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):**
   - The statement contains a play on words ("nobody" interpreted as a person).
   - This dual interpretation could potentially undermine logical consistency.
   - Example pattern fits as it involves ambiguous phrases: "Nobody" is interpreted humorously as a challenging person to see.
6. **Check for Reason-Reasoning (<RR>):**
   - The statement doesn't fit the pattern of reason restating the proposition.
7. **Check for Irrelevant Reasoning (<IR>):**
   - The reasoning does not deviate from the topic.

### Step 3: Application of Decision Criteria
1. **Match with Definitions:**
   - Comparing with the definitions, <DEP> seems the closest match as it uses statements open to dual interpretation.
2. **Look for Keywords and Phrases:**
   - The phrase "see Nobody" illustrates the keyword "nobody" used in an ambiguous or playful manner.

### Step 4: Conclusion
1. **Classify <s>:**
   - Based on the closest match, the argument fits the type <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases).
2. **Re-evaluate if Necessary:**
   - There is no need for re-evaluation as the classification is quite clear based on the given arguments.

Thus, the string:

```
"I see nobody on the road," said Alice.
"I only wish I had such eyes," the king remarked..."To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why it's as much as I can do to see real people, by this light."
```

is classified as <DEP>.
