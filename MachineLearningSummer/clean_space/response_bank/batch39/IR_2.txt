For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you," we need to decompose the task of classifying the string into specific steps. Here's the step-by-step process:

**Step 1: Understand the Argument Structure**
1. **Proposition (<P>)**: "I’m not going to talk to you."
2. **Reason (<R>)**: "My best friend says you’re a liar."

**Step 2: Analyze and Classify the Reason**
- Evaluate whether the reason logically supports the proposition.
- Determine if the argument falls under any defective argument types by matching the reason with the definitions provided for <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

**Step 3: Match with Definitions**
- **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument doesn’t generalize based on some group or part.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: There is no listing of options.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: The reason "My best friend says you’re a liar" doesn’t logically support the decision to not talk to someone. The trust in the friend’s opinion isn’t sufficient causal basis for the action.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: While <R> might seem insufficient, it’s more accurately inappropriate to constitute a causal basis.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The reason is not repeating the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument doesn’t claim universality.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The reason is clear and unambiguous.

**Step 4: Conclusion**
After evaluating the string against all the possible defective argument types, the best classification is:

**<IR>**: Inappropriate Reason.

The final classification for the string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you." is <IR>, because the reason provided does not logically justify the proposition.

So the application of <IDAA> yields the classification of the argument as <IR>.
