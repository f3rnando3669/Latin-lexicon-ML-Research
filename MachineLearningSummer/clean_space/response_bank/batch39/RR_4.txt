For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the string "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there.", we need to break down this task (<IDA>) into specific steps. Here's the detailed decomposition and step-by-step analysis:

### Decomposition (<D>) of <IDA>:
1. **Identify components of the argument**: Break down the statement into its proposition (<P>), reason (<R>), and proof of reason (<PR>), if any.
2. **Analyze the reason (<R>)**: Examine the logical connection between the reason and the proposition to determine if the reason supports the proposition appropriately.
3. **Classify the type of defective argument**: Based on the analysis, determine which type of defective argument (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>) the statement fits into.

### Application of <IDAA>:

1. **Identify components of the argument**:
   - **Proposition (<P>)**: "That restaurant is popular"
   - **Reason (<R>)**: "because everyone in town goes there."

2. **Analyze the reason (<R>)**:
   - The reason given is "because everyone in town goes there."
   - This reason suggests that the popularity of the restaurant is based on the fact that many people go there.

3. **Classify the type of defective argument**:
   - The reason relies on the idea that the restaurantâ€™s popularity is validated by the sheer number of people going there, implying that the fact that "everyone in town goes there" is sufficient enough to conclude that "the restaurant is popular."
   - This aligns with the concept of **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)** where the reason assumes the proposition is true because "it is universally agreed upon" or "everyone is doing it."
   - The statement is assuming consensus (everyone in town goes there) as a proof without providing a causal reason for why the restaurant's popularity is justified beyond the number of patrons.

Thus, the classification of the string "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there." is:
**<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**
