For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a string as a specific type of defective argument) to the given statement "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far.", we’ll break it down into specific steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - **Proposition (<P>):** "Donald Trump got elected."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - **Reason (<R>):** "because liberals took political correctness too far."

3. **Check for Defective Argument Types:**
   
   - **Generalization (<G>):** This would occur if the statement made a broad assertion about a group based on limited evidence. The given statement doesn’t seem to broadly categorize individuals or groups; instead, it provides a singular reason for a specific event.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>):** This occurs when fewer or more options are listed than actually exist. The given statement doesn't enumerate options.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** This would occur if the reason provided doesn’t logically support the proposition. In this case, the reason—liberals taking political correctness too far—can be argued as a contributing factor to Trump's election, though it might not be universally accepted.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This occurs when the reason provided isn’t compelling enough to establish causality. Evaluating whether liberals taking political correctness too far is a strong enough reason for Trump's election can be subjective, but many would argue it is insufficient as the sole reason for such a complex event.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This occurs if the reason is just a repetition of the proposition. The statement does not merely repeat the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This occurs when a proof of reason is assumed as certain because it is "universally agreed upon," without actual dispute. There is no consensus assumed in the statement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** This covers cases where language can be interpreted differently. The reason given is not particularly ambiguous, though subjective.

4. **Determine the Appropriate Defective Argument Classification:**
   - The strongest indication here is that the reason given, "because liberals took political correctness too far," may not be a compelling or sufficiently strong causal basis for the proposition. This aligns with the definition of <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).

Hence, after decomposing the task and evaluating the argument against each defective type, we classify the given argument as type:
   - **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**
