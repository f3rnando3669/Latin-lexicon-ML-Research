For 
To apply the process of IDAA to the given sentence "Everyone else is doing it, so should you," we will break down the task of classifying the string into specific steps.

### Steps for Decomposition (D) of IDA:
1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine the main assertion or claim made in the string.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Determine the causal basis provided to support the proposition.
3. **Identify or Detect Any Proofs of Reason (PR)**: Check if there are any additional arguments provided to corroborate the reason.
4. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types**: Check the argument against definitions of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

Now, let's apply these steps to “Everyone else is doing it, so should you”.

### Step-by-Step Application (IDAA):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - P: "You should do it."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - R: "Everyone else is doing it."

3. **Identify or Detect Any Proofs of Reason (PR)**:
   - There are no additional arguments provided. The R stands alone without further corroboration.

4. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument does not fall under generalization, as it does not assert something about a group based on insufficient evidence.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: This argument does not propose a limited or an excessive number of choices; it simply presents a behavior (everyone is doing it) as a reason to follow.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: The argument is based on what others are doing, which doesn’t logically support the idea that one should do the same.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The reason does not simply restate the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal link (everyone is doing it) is weak in convincing why someone should do it, but not necessarily because it lacks causality.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument assumes that because everyone is doing it, it should be done, appealing to a presumed consensus.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The language is not ambiguous.

Based on the analysis, the argument primarily fits the description of **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**, but it could also be argued to fit **Inappropriate Reason (IR)** depending on the context.

However, given the prominence of appealing to popularity (everyone is doing it) it best aligns with **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.

### Conclusion:
The given string "“Everyone else is doing it, so should you”." is classified as Presumptuous Consensus (FU).
