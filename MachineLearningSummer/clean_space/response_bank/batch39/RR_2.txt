For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people. This logical fallacy is called...", we will decompose the advanced task of classifying the given string into specific steps and then apply these steps to classify the fallacy.

### Steps for Decomposition (<D>):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Recognize the main assertion or proposition being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Determine the causal basis provided for the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Check if there is any proof or further arguments corroborating the reason.
4. **Classify the Fallacy:** Based on the identified <P>, <R>, and <PR>, classify the argument into one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Application of Decomposition to <IDA> (<IDAA>):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition: "We need to fix our broken judicial system."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason: The reason provided is implied by "by electing new people," suggesting that electing new people will fix the judicial system.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - No explicit proof of reason is provided, so we will assess based on the given information.

4. **Classify the Fallacy:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** This argument doesn't make a broad assertion about a group that isn't universally applicable.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>):** No enumeration of options is presented, so this category doesn't apply.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** This could be a candidate because the argument essentially states that the judicial system can be fixed simply by electing new people, which may not logically follow or fully address the complexity of the issue.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason doesn't repeat the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The reasoning provided (electing new people) isn't a compelling causal basis for fixing the entire judicial system, making this a strong candidate.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** There's no mention of universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** No ambiguous language is present.

Based on the steps, the argument provided is best classified as having an **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**, as it relies on a simplistic solution (electing new people) to address a complex issue without providing substantial causal reasoning.

Thus, the logical fallacy is called **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
