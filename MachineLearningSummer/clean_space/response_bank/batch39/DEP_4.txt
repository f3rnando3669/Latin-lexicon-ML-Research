For 
To apply the process of decomposing the task of classifying a defective argument (<IDAA>) step by step, we need to break down the advanced task of classifying the given argument into specific steps. Here are those steps:

1. **Identify and Separate Components**:
   - Identify the Proposition (<P>).
   - Identify the Reason (<R>).
   - Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>) if present.

2. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types**:
   - Check if the terms used generalize improperly (<G>).
   - Ensure all options or conditions are enumerated correctly (<FE>).
   - Determine if inappropriate reasons are provided (<IR>).
   - Look for weak causal bases (<WCB>).
   - Assess if there is a faulty repetition of the proposition as the reason (<RR>).
   - Check for presumptuous consensus (<FU>).
   - Evaluate the language use for ambiguity (<DEP>).

3. **Classify the Argument**:
   - Based on the analysis, classify the argument into one of the defective argument types.

Let's apply these steps to "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify and Separate Components**:
   - **Proposition (<P>)**: "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being."
   - **Reason (<R>)**: "Fetuses are innocent human beings."
   - **Conclusion (<P2, a derived Proposition)**: "Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."

2. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types**:
   - **<G> (Generalization)**:
     - The argument doesn’t seem to overgeneralize about a group improperly. It’s applying a moral principle (about killing innocent human beings) to a specific case (fetuses).
   - **<FE> (False Enumeration)**:
     - It doesn’t appear to list options fewer or more than exist, as it doesn't present a range of options.
   - **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**:
     - The reason provided ("Fetuses are innocent human beings") does appear to aim at logically supporting the proposition that "It is immoral to kill fetuses."
   - **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**:
     - The causal linkage between being an "innocent human being" and the immorality of killing is presupposed to be universally valid without further support.
   - **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**:
     - There doesn’t seem to be an obvious case of repetition of the proposition as the reason.
   - **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**:
     - The argument assumes universally agreed moral principles without addressing potential disputes.
   - **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**:
     - Terms like "innocent" and "human beings" are used, which could have potential ambiguity but appear mostly clear within the context provided.

3. **Classify the Argument**:
   - **Primary Identification**: <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)
     - The justification for the Proposition that "it is immoral to kill fetuses" rests solely on an assumed universal moral principle without substantive proof. This fits <WCB>, as the causal basis for the immorality is not effectively substantiated beyond presupposition.

Given the steps and analysis:

The defective argument type <s> seems to be primarily of type <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) because the causal basis (that fetuses are innocent human beings making it immoral to kill them) isn't sufficiently compelling without additional support.
