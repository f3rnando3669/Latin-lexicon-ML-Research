For 
To apply the process of **IDAA** (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying the string as one of the defined defective argument types) to the given string "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding.", we will break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the components of the argument in the string**:
   - Proposition: The speaker is implying that they were not speeding.
   - Reason: The speaker provides a reason that they were driving at the same speed as everyone else around them.

2. **Analyze the Reason provided (to identify if it fits any defective argument types)**:
   - The reason given is: "I was only driving as fast as everyone around me."
   
3. **Match the Reason with the predefined defective argument types**:

   - <G> (Generalization): 
       - Does it generalize a specific behavior to all? 
       - Not applicable here.
   
   - <FE> (False Enumeration):
       - Does it list fewer or more options than actually exist?
       - Not applicable here.
   
   - <IR> (Inappropriate Reason):
       - Is the reason provided unrelated or insufficient to support the proposition?
       - This might be applicable if the reason does not logically support the proposition. However, this needs more investigation.
   
   - <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):
       - Does the reason repeat the proposition without adding new information? 
       - Not applicable here.
   
   - <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):
       - Is the causal basis weak?
       - This might be considered if the reason given does not logically lead to the proposition.
   
   - <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):
       - Is an assumed consensus used as a proof?
       - This suggests since "everyone else is doing it" validates the action.
       - Applicable here.
   
   - <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):
       - Is there ambiguous language? 
       - Not applicable here.

4. **Compare and select the most fitting defective argument type**:
   - The best match for the provided reason is <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus), as the argument assumes that because "everyone else" was driving at that speed, it justifies the behavior and implies it wasn't incorrect.
   
5. **Conclude the classification**:
   - The given string "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding." is best classified as <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).

### Conclusion:
By applying the decomposition to the classification task, the argument in the string was classified as <FU>, a defective argument type called Presumptuous Consensus.
