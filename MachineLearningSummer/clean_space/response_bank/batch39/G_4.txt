For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the given string as of type <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>, we first need to decompose the task of classification into specific steps. 

Let's break down the process:

1. **Step 1: Understand the Statement**
   - Parse and comprehend the string: "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess, all the other classes will all fail it, too."

2. **Step 2: Identify the Proposition, Reason, and Proof of Reason (if any)**
   - Identify the Proposition (P): "all the other classes will all fail it"
   - Identify the Reason (R): (implied) "because three kids in one class failed the quiz"
   - Identify the Proof of Reason (PR): Not explicitly stated

3. **Step 3: Determine the Nature of the Defect**
   - Analyze if there is an inappropriate reason (<IR>): The reason provided ("three kids in one class failed") does not logically support the proposition about all other classes.
   - Assess if there is false enumeration (<FE>): This does not seem to be about listing options.
   - Evaluate if it's a generalization (<G>): The proposition ("all the other classes will fail") is based on the result from just three kids in one class.
   - Check if there is insufficient causal basis (<WCB>): There seems to be a very weak causal link between three kids failing and the entire school failing.
   - Determine if there's a faulty repetition of the proposition (<RR>): There's no repetition of the proposition in the reason.
   - Look for presumptuous consensus (<FU>): There's no reference to universal agreement or consensus here.
   - Identify ambiguous language use (<DEP>): The language is not ambiguous.

4. **Step 4: Match with the Defective Argument Types**
   - Based on the analysis, the statement is most closely aligned with <G> and <WCB>:
     - <G> (Generalization): Because the proposition is based on a small sample (three kids in one class) and applies it to the entire population.
     - <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis): Because the causal link between the failure of three kids and all other classes failing is weak and unsubstantiated.

Now, we can conclude that the given string "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess, all the other classes will all fail it, too." can be classified as:

- **Primary Classification**: <G> (Generalization)
- **Secondary Classification**: <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)

Given this process, the most appropriate classification within the context provided is:

**<G> (Generalization)**
