For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given dialogue "Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified. Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true? Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so. Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct? Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true. Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true? Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran." we need to decompose the task into specific steps to classify the given string appropriately.

### Steps for <IDAA>

1. **Identify candidate arguments and propositions in the dialogue.**
2. **Analyze each argument for its components: Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), and Proof of Reason (<PR>).**
3. **Determine which defective argument type, if any, applies to each identified argument component within the dialogue.**
4. **Classify the string (<s>) based on the defective argument types identified.**

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Step 1: Identify Candidate Arguments and Propositions

- **Speaker 1:** Jesus was not really crucified. [**P**]
- **Speaker 1:** Because the Quran says so. [**R**]
- **Speaker 1:** Because the Quran is the Word of God. [Implied **PR**]
- **Speaker 1:** Everything it says is true. [Supporting **PR**]
- **Speaker 1:** Because God tells us so, here in the Koran. [Circular reasoning used as **PR** to justify itself]

#### Step 2: Analyze Each Argument for Its Components

- **Initial Proposition (<P>):** "Jesus was not really crucified."
- **Primary Reason (<R>):** "Because the Quran says so."
- **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Initially implied that "The Quran is the Word of God and everything it says is true."

#### Step 3: Determine Defective Argument Types

1. **Classifying <R>:**
   - **"Because the Quran says so"** by itself is not necessarily providing a strong causal basis for the proposition about Jesus.
   - This seems biased towards authority, potentially an **<FU>** because it assumes the Quran's assertion is universally accepted without providing independent evidence.

2. **Classifying <PR> (Support for Reason):**
   - **"Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true."**
   - This repeats the reliance on authority without new independent reason.
   - This leads to **<RR>** (Faulty Repetition of Proposition) since the Reason (Quran's word) is justified by the same assertion.

3. **Classifying the Circular Argument:**
   - **"Because God tells us so, here in the Koran."**
   - This is a circular reasoning as it uses its own statement (assertion by the Quran) to prove itself.
   - This also counts as **<RR>** due to reliance on self-repetition without independent evidence.

#### Step 4: Classify the Overall String

Considering the above analysis, the string mainly suffers from circular reasoning and faulty repetition of propositions. Specifically, the **<RR>** type fits well.

### Conclusion

Applying **<IDAA>**, the argument presented in the dialogue string classifies primarily as **<RR>** (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), since the reasons given for the propositions ultimately loop back to asserting the same statement without new independent proof.
