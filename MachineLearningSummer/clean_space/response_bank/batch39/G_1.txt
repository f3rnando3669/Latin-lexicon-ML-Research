For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given statement, we will decompose the task of classifying the defective argument into specific steps and then apply those steps to identify the type of defective argument.

Here are the specific steps for the decomposition (<D>):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine the main assertion or claim being made in the statement.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Identify the causal basis that is provided to support the proposition.

3. **Assess the Reason (<R>)**: Evaluate the logical connection between the reason and the proposition. Check if the reason logically supports the proposition or if it falls into one of the defective argument types.

4. **Identify the Defective Argument Type**: Match the issue identified in the reason with one of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>).

Now, we will apply these steps to the statement "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!"

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition (<P>) is:
"My 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!"

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason (<R>) is:
"I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up."

### Step 3: Assess the Reason (<R>)
Evaluate the logical connection between the reason and the proposition. The reason provided is that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. The proposition concludes that because of this, the 102-year-old Catholic neighbor is also guilty.

The reason does not logically support the proposition because being a member of a group (the Catholic Church) does not imply individual guilt for actions of the entire group.

### Step 4: Identify the Defective Argument Type
The defective argument type in this case is:

**Generalization (<G>)**

This is because the proposition makes a generalization that implicates an individual (the 102-year-old Catholic neighbor) based on the actions of a larger group (the Catholic Church). This type of argument is erroneous as it unjustly associates the actions of some members of a group with all members of the group, which in this case results in a sweeping assumption that all Catholics are guilty of a sex scandal cover-up if the Church was involved.

So, the classification <s> of the given statement is of type <G>, which stands for Generalization.
