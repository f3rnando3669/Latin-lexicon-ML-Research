For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string provided, we need to decompose the advanced task of classifying the argument into the specified defective argument types step by step. 

**Step-by-Step Decomposition of Classification (<IDAA>)**

1. **Extract the Core Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Identify the main claim made in the string.
   - Proposition: "The move from creationism to intelligent design is a prime example."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Determine the causal basis for the proposition.
   - Reason: "Questions to which science has not definitively answered yet are used for arguments for the existence of God, and as science provides answers, new questions are chosen."

3. **Evaluate the Presence of Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - Check if there are additional arguments or evidence supporting the reason.
   - Proof of Reason: "Currently the origin of life is a popular argument for God (although a classic argument from ignorance), and an area where we very well may have a scientific answer in the next decade, at which time, the 'origin of life' argument will fade away and be replaced by another."

4. **Check for Defective Argument Types**:
   - Compare each defective argument type with the proposition, reason, and proof of reason:

   a. **<G> Generalization**: The proposition does not assume a generalization that applies to an entire group based on the behavior of a few.
   
   b. **<FE> False Enumeration**: The statement does not force a choice between limited options; it elaborates on the evolving nature of arguments.
   
   c. **<IR> Inappropriate Reason**: The reason provided does logically follow and support the proposition, albeit elaborated with a historical perspective.
   
   d. **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: The reason is not a repetition of the proposition.
   
   e. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: The provided cause-effect relationship is weakly implied but not sufficiently proven. 
       - Example context: "Currently the origin of life is a popular argument for God (although a classic argument from ignorance), and an area where we very well may have a scientific answer in the next decade, at which time, the 'origin of life' argument will fade away and be replaced by another, thus moving the figurative goalposts farther back as our understanding of the natural world increases."

   f. **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: There is an underlying assumption that the case of evolving arguments for God's existence is universally agreed upon. 
       - Example context: "This fallacy should not be confused with an argument or set of arguments, with multiple propositions inherent in the argument."

   g. **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: There is no discernible use of ambiguous language in this context.

**Step-by-Step Outcomes of Classification**:

1. The proposition is: "The move from creationism to intelligent design is a prime example."
2. The reason is: "Questions to which science has not definitively answered yet are used for arguments for the existence of God, and as science provides answers, new questions are chosen."
3. The proof of reason: "Currently the origin of life is a popular argument for God (although a classic argument from ignorance), and an area where we very well may have a scientific answer in the next decade, at which time, the 'origin of life' argument will fade away and be replaced by another."
4. Defective Argument Types found: 
   - Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
   - Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)

Thus, the string "Perhaps the most classic example of this fallacy is the argument for the existence of God. Due to the understanding of nature through science, many of the arguments that used to be used for God (or gods) were abandoned, only to be replaced with new ones, usually involving questions to which science has not definitively answered yet. The move from creationism to intelligent design is a prime example. Currently the origin of life is a popular argument for God (although a classic argument from ignorance), and an area where we very well may have a scientific answer in the next decade, at which time, the 'origin of life' argument will fade away and be replaced by another, thus moving the figurative goalposts farther back as our understanding of the natural world increases." can be classified as primarily exhibiting **Insufficient Causal Basis** (<WCB>) due to the weakly implied causal relationship and **Presumptuous Consensus** (<FU>) due to assuming a supposed universal agreement.
