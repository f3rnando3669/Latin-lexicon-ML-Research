Applying the process of IDAA (the decomposition of the task of identifying defective arguments into specific steps) to the given string "The teenagers where rude and disrespectful therefore all teenagers are rude and disrespectful":

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   The proposition is the statement that we intend to prove.
   - In this case, the proposition is: "all teenagers are rude and disrespectful."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   The reason is the causal basis that establishes the truth of the proposition.
   - In this case, the reason appears to be: "The teenagers were rude and disrespectful."

3. **Examine the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   The proof of reason would provide additional arguments to corroborate the reason.
   - In this case, there does not seem to be any additional evidence or data supporting the reason. The statement relies solely on the initial observation, "The teenagers were rude and disrespectful."

4. **Evaluate if the Argument is Defective**:
   Compare the argument against the definitions of defective argument types to identify its classification:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: This is when the proposition is an assertion based on some one part or on a majority of individuals, but not necessarily applicable to all, and is referred to all.
     - The statement seems to be a classic case of generalization. It takes the behavior of a particular group of teenagers and extends that behavior to all teenagers.

Therefore, the argument "The teenagers were rude and disrespectful therefore all teenagers are rude and disrespectful" is classified as <G>, a Generalization. This string falls under the Generalization defective argument type because it asserts that a characteristic observed in some individuals (the teenagers who were rude and disrespectful) applies to an entire group (all teenagers) without sufficient evidence to support such a sweeping conclusion.
