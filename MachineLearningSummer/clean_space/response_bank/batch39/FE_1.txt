For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "The museum's new gemstones and precious minerals exhibit needs more security guards. If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal a piece of the exhibit.", we need to carry out a step-by-step decomposition of the task of classifying the defective argument type:

**Step 1: Identify the proposition (P) in the argument.**
- The proposition is: "The museum's new gemstones and precious minerals exhibit needs more security guards."

**Step 2: Identify the reason (R) provided to support the proposition.**
- The reason is: "If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal a piece of the exhibit."

**Step 3: Analyze the reason to see if it logically supports the proposition.**
- The reason given does not logically support the proposition. Instead, it implies that disagreement with the need for security guards automatically means an intent to steal, which is not a logical or reasonable causal basis.

**Step 4: Determine which defective argument type best classifies this reasoning.**
- We examine the defective argument types defined:

  **<IR> Inappropriate Reason:** 
    - The reason provided ("If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal a piece of the exhibit.") does not logically support the proposition (the need for more security guards). Instead, it attacks the person who disagrees by suggesting they have malicious intent.

  **<FE> False Enumeration:** 
    - Not applicable here as the argument does not involve listing options.

  **<G> Generalization:** 
    - Not applicable as the argument does not involve generalization based on some part or majority of individuals.

  **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** 
    - This could be somewhat relevant as the reason given is not a compelling basis, but it is more accurately classified under <IR>.

  **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** 
    - Not applicable because the reason is not a repetition of the proposition.

  **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** 
    - Not applicable as the reason does not assume universal agreement.

  **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:** 
    - Not applicable since the language usage isn't ambiguous in the relevant sense.

**Conclusion:**
- The argument falls under the defective argument type <IR> (Inappropriate Reason) because it provides a reason that does not logically support the proposition and instead implies an inappropriate accusation.

Therefore, the classification of the string "The museum's new gemstones and precious minerals exhibit needs more security guards. If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal a piece of the exhibit." is:

<IR>
