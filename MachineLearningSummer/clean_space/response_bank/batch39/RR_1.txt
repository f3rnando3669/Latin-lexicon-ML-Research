For 
To apply the task of classifying the given string as a defective argument type, we will follow the steps outlined in the decomposition of the task:

### Steps of Decomposition (D):
1. **Understand the Defective Argument Categories**: Review the definitions of each defective argument type (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).
2. **Analyze the String (<s>)**: Break down the string to understand the structure and intent.
3. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine what the string is trying to prove or assert.
4. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the causal basis provided for the proposition.
5. **Assess the Reasoning**: Evaluate whether the reasoning is logically sound or falls into one of the defective argument categories.
6. **Classify the Defective Argument (<IDA>)**: Determine which defective argument type best describes the flawed reasoning.

### Application of the Decomposition to the Task (IDAA):
Let's apply these steps to the provided string: "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."

#### Step 1: Understand the Defective Argument Categories
- **<G>**: Generalization — Applying an assertion to all based on a limited sample.
- **<FE>**: False Enumeration — Listing fewer or more options than exist.
- **<IR>**: Inappropriate Reason — Providing a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition.
- **<RR>**: Faulty Repetition of Proposition — The reason repeats exactly what the proposition says.
- **<WCB>**: Insufficient Causal Basis — The reason provided is weak or not compelling.
- **<FU>**: Presumptuous Consensus — Assuming consensus as proof.
- **<DEP>**: Ambiguous Language Use — Language ambiguity.

#### Step 2: Analyze the String 
- The string makes a claim about the reality of paranormal activity and provides a personal experience as the reason for this claim.

#### Step 3: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- **Proposition (P)**: "Paranormal activity is real."

#### Step 4: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- **Reason (R)**: "I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."

#### Step 5: Assess the Reasoning
- Evaluate the reason in the context of the proposition.
- The reason provided is essentially a restatement of the claim using personal anecdote as evidence. It does not provide an independent, verifiable, or logical basis for the proposition, rather it relies on the assumption that a personal experience is adequate proof of the broader claim.

#### Step 6: Classify the Defective Argument (<IDA>)
- The reason is repeating the proposition in a different form, without providing an additional logical basis.
- This matches the description of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**.

### Conclusion
Applying the steps of decomposition to identify the defective argument type for the given string, we classify the string "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity." as:

- **<RR>**: Faulty Repetition of Proposition.
