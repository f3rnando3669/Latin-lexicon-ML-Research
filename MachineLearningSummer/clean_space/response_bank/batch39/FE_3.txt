For 
Certainly! Let's apply <IDAA> to the string "People either like coffee or hate it." by decomposing the task of classifying the string into specific steps.

**Step-by-step approach:**

1. **Identify the proposition (if any) within the string:**
    - Proposition <P>: "People either like coffee or hate it."

2. **Analyze the proposition to see if it presents an issue typical of defective argument types:**
    - Check if it involves a generalization.
    - Check if it falsely limits or expands the number of options.
    - Check if it includes inappropriate reasons.
    - Check if it involves insufficient causal basis.
    - Check if it repeats the proposition without providing reasoning.
    - Check if it assumes a consensus that is not proven.
    - Check if it uses ambiguous language.

3. **Determine the precise nature of the defect by cross-referencing the common characteristics of defective argument types.**

4. **Match the string to the closest defective argument type:**
    - <G>: (Generalization) - Not applicable here as it's not about asserting something about all individuals based on a subset.
    - <FE>: (False Enumeration) - The string presents two and only two options when more likely exist.
    - <IR>: (Inappropriate Reason) - Not applicable as there is no reasoning provided to support the proposition.
    - <RR>: (Faulty Repetition of Proposition) - Not applicable as nothing is repeated.
    - <WCB>: (Insufficient Causal Basis) - Not applicable as no causal basis is provided.
    - <FU>: (Presumptuous Consensus) - Not applicable as no universal agreement is assumed.
    - <DEP>: (Ambiguous Language Use) - Not applicable as the language used is clear in its intent.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis, the string "People either like coffee or hate it." is an example of <FE> (False Enumeration) because it presents only two possibilities (like or hate) when in reality, there are more nuanced opinions about coffee.

**Output:**
The string "People either like coffee or hate it." is classified as <FE>.
