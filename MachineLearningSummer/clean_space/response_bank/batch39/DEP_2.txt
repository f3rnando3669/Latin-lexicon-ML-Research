For 
To apply the IDAA process to classify the given string, we'll decompose it into specific steps (D) and then apply those steps to identify the argument type.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) for IDA Task:
1. **Rewrite the given string for clarity.**
2. **Analyze the proposition (P), reason (R), and proof of reason (PR) to identify any potential logical flaws.**
3. **Compare identified potential flaws with definitions for G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, and DEP.**
4. **Classify the argument based on the closest matching defect type.**

### Given String
```
Speaker 1: We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change.
Speaker: Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people.
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis (D):

1. **Rewrite for clarity:**
   - Speaker 1 is stating a proposition about using people to spread the word about social injustice.
   - The second speaker rejects participation on the grounds that they were taught it's wrong to use people.

2. **Analyze P, R, and PR:**
   - **Proposition (P1)** from Speaker 1: "We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change."
   - **Reason (R1)** from Speaker 1 is embedded in the purpose of the activity: helping spread the word about social injustice and the need for change.
   
   - **Proposition (P2)** from Speaker 2: "I can’t be a part of this."
   - **Reason (R2)** from Speaker 2: "because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."

3. **Identify potential logical flaws:**
   - Speaker 2’s reason "because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people" does not directly address the context provided by Speaker 1, which suggests a form of using people for a cause that may not align with the moral teaching in question.
   
4. **Classify the argument:**
   - The reasoning given by Speaker 2 does not logically support the proposition made by Speaker 1 concerning the campaign about social injustice. It’s an example of a reason that is not contextually appropriate or logically supportive for the proposition about spreading word for social injustice.
   - This is an example of **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**.

Thus, applying IDAA, we classify the given string as <IR> (Inappropriate Reason).
