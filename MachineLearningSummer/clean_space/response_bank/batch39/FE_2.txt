For 
To classify the statement "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" using the IDAA framework, we will decompose the advanced task of classifying the statement into specific steps. Here are the steps we will follow:

1. **Identify the Components of the Statement**:
   - **Proposition (P)**: The assertion in the statement.
   - **Reason (R)**: The causal basis provided for the assertion.
   - **Proof of Reason (PR)**: Any additional arguments that corroborate the reason.

2. **Analyze the Components**:
   - Determine if the Reason supports the Proposition.
   - Check for common defective argument types.

3. **Classify the Defective Argument**:
   - Compare the statement with the definitions of defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) to find the best match.

**Step-by-Step Analysis**:

1. **Identify the Components of the Statement**:
   - **Proposition (P)**: "[You] [either support Hillary Clinton for President]"
   - **Reason (R)**: "[or you don't believe in women's rights]"

2. **Analyze the Components**:
   - The proposition is setting forth the idea that supporting Hillary Clinton for President is necessary.
   - The reason provided is that not supporting Hillary Clinton implies you don't believe in women's rights.
   - This presents the idea as a dichotomy (only two options).

3. **Classify the Defective Argument**:
   - Compare the statement to <IR> (Inappropriate Reason): The reason doesn't logically support the proposition.
        - This statement implies a false dichotomy, suggesting that the rejection of one option means necessarily embracing the only other provided option, which in itself may not be true.
   - Compare the statement to <FE> (False Enumeration): Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
        - The statement assumes that there are only two options when, in reality, there are more nuanced positions available. 

**Conclusion**:

The statement "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" is best classified as a **False Enumeration (FE)** because it presents a false dichotomy, limiting the options to only two when there are actually more possibilities.

Therefore, the statement can be analyzed and classified as `<FE>`.
