Alright, let's apply <IDAA> to the statement "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today." This will involve breaking down the task of classifying the type of defective argument in the given string into specific steps.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown of <IDAA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The assertion or main claim in the statement.
   - **Proposition (<P>):** "I thought you were a good person"

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The causal basis or the justification provided for the proposition.
   - **Reason (<R>):** "but you weren’t in class today."

3. **Check for Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** Is the proposition based on an assertion applicable to all based on a specific instance?
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Does the argument present an incomplete or incorrect list of options?
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Does the reason fail to logically support the proposition?
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Does the reason merely repeat the proposition without adding anything new?
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Is the causal basis for the proposition weak or not compelling?
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Does the proof of reason assume universal consensus on something still in dispute?
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Is the proof of reason based on language that can be taken in another sense than intended by the speaker?

### Classification:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The proposition is not making a sweeping generalization based on specific or insufficient data; it’s simply evaluating one incident.

2. **False Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The argument does not present fewer or more options than actually exist.

3. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):**
   - The reason "you weren’t in class today" doesn’t logically support the proposition "I thought you were a good person." The correlation between being a good person and attending class is not established, making the reason inappropriate.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - The reason does not repeat the proposition.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Although the causal connection is weak, this is more specifically an example of <IR> since the reason is not merely weak but entirely inappropriate.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - No universal agreement or consensus assumption is invoked here.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - No ambiguous language is used.

### Conclusion:
The defective argument type in the given statement "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today." is classified as **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**.
