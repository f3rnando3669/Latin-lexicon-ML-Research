For 
To classify the statement "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way" within the set {<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>}, we will break down the classification task using the decomposed steps outlined in <IDAA>.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Main Point**: Determine the core message or purpose of the statement.
2. **Analyze the Argument Structure**: Assess if the statement offers a proposition, a reason, or a proof of reason.
3. **Compare with Definitions**: Match the structure and logic (or lack thereof) in the statement to the definitions of the defective argument types.
4. **Classify the Argument Type**: Based on the analysis, classify the statement into one of the specified types.

### Step 1: Identify the Main Point
The main point of the statement is to encourage or persuade individuals to join a group or perform an action based on the fact that others are doing the same.

### Step 2: Analyze the Argument Structure
This statement suggests that the reason for taking a particular action or joining a group is that other people are already doing it. It implies a proposition ("You should join/act"), and the supporting reason ("because other people are doing it").

### Step 3: Compare with Definitions
- **Generalization (<G>)**: Not applicable as it does not make a broad assertion based on limited evidence.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not applicable as it does not list limited options.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Not precisely fitting because <IR> usually involves a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Not applicable as it does not repeat the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Not a perfect fit since it doesn't offer a weak causal relationship but more of a social rationale.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This is a fitting category. It suggests that something should be done because others are doing it, assuming a consensus (popularity or majority behavior) which does not necessarily validate the action.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Not applicable as the language used is not ambiguous.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument Type
Given the nature of the argument, it fits best under the category of <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus). It appeals to the popularity or the fact that many people are participating as an attempted form of validation.

### Conclusion
The argument in the statement "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way" is best classified as <FU>, which stands for Presumptuous Consensus.
