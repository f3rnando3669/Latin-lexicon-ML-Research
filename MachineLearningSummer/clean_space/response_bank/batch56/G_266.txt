It seems there may be a typographical error in your request regarding <IDAA>. None of the defective argument types you listed are labeled as <IDAA>. However, the argument provided can still be analyzed for defects according to the defective types defined earlier.

Let's break down the argument step-by-step:

1. "We cannot unlock our child from the closet because if we do, she will want to roam the house."

2. "If we let her roam the house, she will want to roam the neighborhood."

3. "If she roams the neighborhood, she will get picked up by a stranger in a van, who will sell her in a sex slavery ring in some other country."

4. "Therefore, we should keep her locked up in the closet."

Now, let's identify the defects:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The argument assumes that because the child will roam the house, she will definitely want to roam the neighborhood. This is a generalization about her behavior without sufficient evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The argument selectively lists potential outcomes (roaming the house to roaming the neighborhood to being kidnapped) without considering any other possibilities (such as the child understanding boundaries, supervised roaming, or other safety measures).

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The reasoning steps from unlocking the closet to eventual kidnapping lack strong, direct, and logical connection. Each step is assumed but not convincingly justified.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The causal link between unlocking her from the closet and her being sold into slavery is extremely tenuous. There's an insufficient causal basis for the drastic final outcome from the initial action.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - This particular fallacy does not directly apply here as there isn’t a repetition of the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - This is not immediately applicable as there is no assumption of a consensus within the argument provided.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - The language used is relatively straightforward and doesn’t contain ambiguous terms that would change the interpretation of the argument.

Therefore, the given argument could be labeled as a combination of multiple defective argument types, specifically:
- <G> Generalization
- <FE> Incomplete Enumeration
- <IR> Inconclusive Reason
- <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis

This argument employs several faulty reasoning tactics to persuade, but lacks solid logical grounding.
