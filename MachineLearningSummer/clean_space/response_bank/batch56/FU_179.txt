For 
To analyze the given argument "Believing that Taco Bell is healthy for you because everyone else does." using the defective argument types you've defined, let's break it down:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument does not seem to generalize a claim from a small sample size. Thus, it is not an instance of Generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This defective argument type involves making a conclusion based on an incomplete list of possibilities. Since the argument doesn't list options or possibilities, it isn't an instance of Incomplete Enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This involves providing a reason that does not sufficiently support the conclusion. While the appeal to popularity (everyone else does) doesn't conclusively support the healthiness of Taco Bell, we have a better match coming up, so we will consider other options first.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This involves claiming a causal relationship without sufficient evidence. The argument doesn't explicitly claim a causal relationship between "everyone else does" and "Taco Bell is healthy."

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This involves repeating a proposition without supporting evidence. This isn't what the argument is doing; it's making an appeal to popularity.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This matches the argument most closely because it involves saying something is true simply because others believe it is true. This is a clear appeal to the perceived consensus that Taco Bell is healthy based on others' beliefs.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The argument doesn't seem to rely on ambiguous or unclear language.

Based on this analysis, the argument "Believing that Taco Bell is healthy for you because everyone else does." can be classified under **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**, as it relies on an appeal to what others believe without providing substantive evidence for the healthiness of Taco Bell.
