Sure, let's analyze the argument and determine if any defective argument types apply.

Argument: "Trump asked Clinton about her “33,000“ deleted emails, but Clinton responds by correcting him rather than addressing the deleted emails: “Not — well, we turned over 35,000, so…”"

Given your request to apply <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Analysis Applied), here is the breakdown:

1. **Potential Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: Making a broad claim based on limited evidence.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Providing an incomplete list that is meant to appear comprehensive.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Offering a reason that doesn't conclusively support the argument.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Claiming a cause-and-effect relationship without sufficient evidence.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Repeating a proposition without adding new evidence or reasoning.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assuming that a consensus exists without sufficient evidence.
   - **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Using language that is unclear or has multiple interpretations. 

2. **Applying the Analysis**:
   - Clinton's response does not directly address the issue of the "33,000" deleted emails. Instead, she appears to shift the conversation to the number of emails turned over, which is **not inherently addressing the specific concern**.
   - This shift in focus might be classified under **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the response does not conclusively address the concern about the deleted emails.
   - There also could be an argument for **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**, depending on how Clinton's response could be interpreted. The statement "we turned over 35,000" might create ambiguity about the handling of the emails, potentially leading to confusion.

From the given options, the most applicable defective argument types for Clinton's response would likely be:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Because her response does not address the specific concern of the "33,000" deleted emails but rather redirects to a different point (the "35,000" turned over).
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: If the language used causes confusion or misleads the audience about what is being addressed.

Therefore, **<IR>** and **<DEP>** seem to be the most relevant defective argument types for this scenario.
