For 
To analyze the argument "Most people think the world is flat, therefore it is flat." and identify the defective argument type, we can break it down and see which category it fits.

The argument suggests that the belief of the majority (people thinking the world is flat) is being used as evidence to conclude that the belief is true (the world is flat). This is a type of argument where consensus or popular opinion is presumed to validate the claim. This corresponds with the definition provided for:

<FU> Presumptuous Consensus

The argument bases its conclusion on the assumption that the popular belief must be correct, without providing empirical evidence for the actual state of the world.

So, applying the <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Application) to "Most people think the world is flat, therefore it is flat." we get:

<FU> Presumptuous Consensus
