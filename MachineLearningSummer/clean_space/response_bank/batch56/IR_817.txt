For 
>IDAA (Irrelevant Deflection of Attention Argument) can be applied to the given statement. The statement "I did not complete my homework last night? Well, you did not do yours last week either," shifts the focus from the speakerâ€™s failure to complete their homework last night to another person's failure to complete homework the previous week.

By doing this, the speaker is deflecting attention away from the original issue (their own failure) and pointing to a separate but similar issue involving someone else. This technique distracts from the initial topic and is a defective argumentative tactic because it does not address or resolve the original issue.
