For 
<IDAA> stands for "Identify Defective Argument Application." Let's apply this to the dialogue between Helga and Hugh:

---
**Helga: You should not be eating that... it has been scientifically proven that eating fat burgers are no good for your health.**

This part of the conversation is presenting what appears to be a conclusion supported by scientific evidence. Though we don't have the details of the evidence, let's focus on Hugh's response for identifying the defective argument type.
   
**Hugh: You eat fat burgers all the time so that canâ€™t be true.**
   
In this response, Hugh is attacking Helga's behavior rather than addressing the scientific evidence she presented. This is an example of a type of defective argument known as:

**<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** 

- Hugh's response does not provide any relevant counter-evidence to the claim that fat burgers are harmful to health. Instead, Hugh is suggesting that Helga's behavior invalidates her argument, which it does not.
  
Additionally, this could also be seen as an **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**, as Hugh assumes that Helga's actions can determine the truth of the claim in question, something not necessarily relevant to the argument's validity.
