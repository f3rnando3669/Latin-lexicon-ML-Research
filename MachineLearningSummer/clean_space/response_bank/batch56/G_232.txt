For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Types and Analysis) to the given statement, let's break it down and assess each part for any defective argument types as defined:

1. **Statement**: "A study was done recently showing that church attendance was positively correlated with marriage longevity, that is, those couples who attended church together more often were more likely to stay married."

   - **Analysis**: This part presents a correlation between church attendance and marriage longevity.
   - **Defective Argument**: None identified here directly. The correlation itself is a stated finding from a study.

2. **Statement**: "This really should not be a surprise considering the general view of divorce within religion."

   - **Analysis**: This generalizes the view of divorce within religion as a justification for the observed correlation.
   - **Defective Argument**: <G> Generalization â€“ The argument assumes that the "general view of divorce within religion" is a sufficient explanation for the observed correlation without providing concrete evidence or considering other possible variables.

3. **Statement**: "What this does not mean is that any given couple who does not attend church is more likely to get divorced than any given couple that does attend church."

   - **Analysis**: This part correctly highlights that correlation does not imply causation, and it acknowledges that individual cases may differ.
   - **Defective Argument**: None identified here directly. This statement actually serves as a clarification to prevent a common misconception.

Overall, applying <IDAA>:

1. **Generalization** (G): The claim that the positive correlation should not be a surprise given the general view of divorce within religion broadly generalizes without addressing other contributing factors.

In conclusion, the defective argument identified within the passage is a Generalization (G). The other parts of the statement clarify the limitations of the correlation and do not themselves constitute defective arguments.
