For 
The argument "Cheesecake Factory is the best because it is always crowded" can be analyzed for defective argument types as follows:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This argument fails to consider other reasons or criteria that might define "the best" restaurant. Just because a place is crowded does not necessarily mean it is the best. There could be many other factors contributing to a crowd, such as location, lack of alternatives, or specific promotions.

2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument assumes a direct causal relationship between being crowded and being the best without sufficient evidence to support this linkage. Crowdedness can be due to many reasons that do not directly correlate with quality or "best" status.

So the identified defective argument types are:

- <FE> Incomplete Enumeration
- <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis
