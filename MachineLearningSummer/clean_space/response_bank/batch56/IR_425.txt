For 
Let's break down the identified defective argument types <IDAA> in the given statement: "All this time that you're telling me to improve, you're being lazy yourself."

**Defective Argument Analysis:**

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - The statement makes a sweeping claim that the person being accused of laziness has been lazy the entire time without providing specific instances or evidence. It generalizes their behavior based on an unspecified time period.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - The statement lists only one fault (laziness) of the accuser without considering or mentioning any other possible actions or qualities they may possess. It presents an incomplete picture.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - The accusation fails to provide substantial reasoning or evidence to conclusively prove that the person has indeed been lazy. The statement does not offer a strong foundation for the claim.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - The argument implies that the accused personâ€™s laziness invalidates their advice to improve, but it lacks a clear causal connection. The fact that someone might be lazy does not necessarily undermine the validity of their advice.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - This type of defect does not directly apply to the given statement as there is no repetition of a proposition without new evidence or argument.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - The statement assumes that the listener will agree with the characterization of the person as lazy, without providing any substantial evidence to support this view. It presumes a shared belief without consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - The term "lazy" is somewhat ambiguous and subjective. What one person considers laziness might be seen differently by another, making the term vague and open to interpretation.

In conclusion, the provided argument "All this time that you're telling me to improve, you're being lazy yourself" can be identified as defective using the types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.
