For 
To analyze the given argument using the specified defective argument types <IDAA> (Identification of Defective Argument Attributes), let's break down the argument and apply the appropriate labels:

**Argument:**

"In arguing that abortion is not really a private moral matter, Fr. Frank A. Pavone, National Director Priests for Life, has written that 'Abortion is our problem, and the problem of every human being. We are one human family. Nobody can be neutral on abortion. It involves the destruction of an entire group of human beings!'"

**Analysis by Defective Argument Types:**

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - The statement "We are one human family" and "Nobody can be neutral on abortion" implies a broad generalization. Not everyone might agree with this view, as opinions on abortion are diverse.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - The argument implies consensus by stating that "Abortion is our problem, and the problem of every human being," without providing evidence to support that every human being feels this way.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - The argument leans heavily on the moral and emotional claim that abortion involves "the destruction of an entire group of human beings" without providing a nuanced ethical, legal, or scientific rationale to substantiate the absolutist position.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - The assertion that abortion is not a private moral matter due to its impact on a "human family" lacks a causal basis between individual decisions and a collective moral responsibility.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - There is repetition in saying the problem concerns "every human being" and "nobody can be neutral" without adding new substantiated points.
   
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - The statement assumes a universal consensus, indicating that everyone must share this concern and view on abortion, which may not be the case.
   
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - Phrases like "destruction of an entire group of human beings" can be seen as using poignant but ambiguous language. The argument doesn't specify what is meant precisely by "destruction" and "group of human beings."

**IDAA Conclusion:**

Fr. Frank A. Pavone's argument contains several defective argument attributes:
- **Generalization (G)**:
  - "We are one human family," "Nobody can be neutral on abortion."
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
  - "Abortion is our problem, and the problem of every human being."
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
  - "...the destruction of an entire group of human beings!"
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
  - The connection between personal moral decisions regarding abortion and a purported collective impact.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
  - Reiteration of the universally problematic nature of abortion.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
  - Suggestion that all people are concerned about abortion to the same degree.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
  - Phrases about destruction and group identification without clear definitions.

By applying <IDAA>, we see that Fr. Pavone's argumentation suffers from several logical fallacies and defective argument types, as detailed above.
