For 
<Sukaina to her mom: Either you buy me this new book, or you decide that reading is not important at all.> 

The defective argument type applied here is:

<IDAA> - Inadequate Dichotomy and Arbitrary Alternatives.

This occurs when the arguer presents two extreme and unlikely choices as the only possible options. In this case, Sukaina suggests that the only alternatives are either buying the new book or deciding that reading is not important at all. This is a false dichotomy because there are many other possibilities, such as recognizing the importance of reading but not buying the book for various other reasons (e.g., financial constraints, the book being inappropriate, availability of other books, etc.).
