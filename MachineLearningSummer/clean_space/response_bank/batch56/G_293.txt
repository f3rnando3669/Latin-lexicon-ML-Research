For 
<IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Attributes) applied to "Southerners talk fast. I was just on the phone with one, and I could barely keep up!" reveals the following defective arguments:

1. **<G> (Generalization)**: This statement takes a single anecdotal experience and generalizes it to all Southerners. Just because the speaker had difficulty keeping up during a conversation with one Southerner doesn't mean that all Southerners talk fast.

2. **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: This statement doesn't consider the diversity within the population of Southerners. It fails to enumerate the possible variations in speech patterns among different individuals or groups within the Southern region.

By identifying these attributes, it becomes clear that the argument is flawed in its overgeneralization and lack of comprehensive enumeration.
