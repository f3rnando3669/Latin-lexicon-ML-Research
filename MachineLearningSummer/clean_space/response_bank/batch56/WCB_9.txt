Sure, let's analyze the argument "Texting has killed people’s ability to write in complete sentences with proper grammar" using the defective argument types defined.

**Generalization (<G>):**
The claim may be a generalization because it applies a broad statement to all people based on limited evidence or examples. It assumes that the impact of texting on writing ability is universally bad without accounting for variations in individuals' writing skills or the benefits that texting might offer.

**Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
The argument does not provide a comprehensive list of factors that could affect people's writing abilities. It ignores other possible influences such as education, reading habits, or different forms of digital communication besides texting.

**Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
The reasoning might be inconclusive because it fails to establish a direct and unavoidable consequence between texting and degraded writing skills. It does not provide sufficient evidence to show a necessary causal link.

**Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
There is an assumption of causality here without adequately proving that texting is directly responsible for a decline in writing abilities. The argument lacks strong empirical support to establish texting as the sole or primary cause.

**Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
If the claim is repeated frequently in public discourse without sufficient evidence, it might be considered a faulty repetition. This argument gains perceived credibility through repetition rather than through solid proof.

**Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
The argument might imply that this viewpoint is widely accepted without providing actual evidence of consensus. It can mislead by suggesting a general agreement where none may exist.

**Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
The wording "killed people’s ability" is strong and could be seen as hyperbolic or ambiguous. It doesn't clarify to what extent writing skills are affected or how pervasive the issue is. Such language can weaken the argument by being too vague or dramatic.

Each type of defective argument provides a different lens to critique the statement "Texting has killed people’s ability to write in complete sentences with proper grammar," revealing several potential flaws and assumptions embedded in the claim.
