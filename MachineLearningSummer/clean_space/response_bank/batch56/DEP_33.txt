For 
The argument you've provided can be analyzed as follows:

"Noisy children are a real headache. Two aspirin will make a headache go away. Therefore, two aspirin will make noisy children go away."

This argument is problematic because it uses an equivocation on the term "headache." In the first statement, "headache" is used metaphorically to describe a difficult or annoying situation (noisy children). In the second statement, "headache" is used literally to refer to a physical pain in the head. The erroneous conclusion then combines these two different meanings.

<DEP> applies here because the argument uses ambiguous language, specifically the word "headache," in different senses without acknowledging the difference. 

Therefore, the defective argument type for this example is:

**<DEP> Ambiguous Language**
