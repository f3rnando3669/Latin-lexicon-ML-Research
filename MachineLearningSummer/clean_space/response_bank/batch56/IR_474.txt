Let's go through the defective argument types you've defined and see how they might apply to the quote under consideration:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This involves drawing a broad conclusion from a potentially small sample or specific instances. In the context of the Nostradamus quatrain, one might argue that the interpretation of "Hister" as "Hitler" is a form of generalization, assuming a specific and modern reference from a vague historic text.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This happens when crucial alternatives or possibilities are omitted in forming a conclusion. Interpreting Nostradamus's prophecies often overlooks other potential meanings or individuals "Hister" could refer to, thereby rushing to the conclusion that it means "Hitler".

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: When reasoning from premises that don't necessarily lead to the conclusion, it could be seen as a form of inconclusive reason. The assumption that a vague prophecy is definitive evidence of historical foresight falls under this defective argument type. The specificity of "Hitler" from "Hister" isn't justified firmly by the text.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This occurs when a causal relationship is inferred without sufficient evidence. Assuming Nostradamus had a specific vision of Hitler without strong evidence connecting the prophecy directly to historical facts exemplifies this flaw.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This involves reiterating a debatable proposition without strengthening its support. In the genre of Nostradamus prophecies, people often cite the same passages repeatedly to claim proof of prediction, without additional support.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This refers to assuming a consensus exists without proper justification. People often assume that everyone or experts agree that Nostradamus predicted Hitler, which may not actually be the case.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: When language is open to multiple interpretations, any specific conclusion drawn from it may be weak. Nostradamus's prophecies are famously cryptic, and interpreting "Hister" as "Hitler" uses ambiguous language to assert a specific historical fact.

**Applying <IDAA> to the Original Statement:**

Given the provided quatrain from Nostradamus and the claim that it surely refers to Hitler, several defective argument types can be identified:

1. **Generalization (G)**: The interpretation generalizes the term "Hister" to mean "Hitler" without strong evidence.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement ignores other potential interpretations or historical figures that "Hister" might represent.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning from the text to the conclusion that it refers to Hitler is not necessarily supported by any conclusive evidence.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Suggesting that Nostradamus had a specific vision of Hitler without concrete evidence forms an insufficient causal connection.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This interpretation might be repetitively pushed without substantial new evidence.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The assumption that this passage is widely accepted as referring to Hitler could be an unfounded presumption.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language used by Nostradamus is ambiguous, and drawing a specific conclusion from such language is flawed.

By identifying these various defective argument types, we critically analyze the textual interpretation and highlight the lack of strong evidential basis supporting the conclusion that Nostradamus specifically foresaw Hitler.
