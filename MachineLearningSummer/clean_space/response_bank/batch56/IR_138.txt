For 
The argument you provided appears to be an example of a type of defective argument that oversimplifies the characterization of a person by highlighting selective actions while ignoring other relevant actions that may offer a more complete picture. Based on the definition provided in the prompt, let's evaluate the argument with respect to <IDAA> and identify which type of defective argument it falls under.

The argument states:

"My political candidate gives 10% of his income to the needy, goes to church every Sunday, and volunteers one day a week at a homeless shelter. Therefore, he is honest and morally straight."

In the explanation, it's revealed that the candidate's actions are not as virtuous as they appear when additional information is considered:

- The 10% of income is given to needy prostitutes in exchange for services.
- Goes to the bar every Sunday after church (and sometimes before).
- Works at the homeless shelter to get clients for his drug dealing business.

This suggests that the initial portrayal leaves out critical information that significantly alters the interpretation of the candidate's character.

Based on this analysis, the flawed reasoning in the argument initially presented can be classified as follows:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument cherry-picks positive actions to create a favorable impression, leaving out other significant but unfavorable actions. By not considering the complete range of the candidateâ€™s behaviors, it fails to provide an accurate and fair evaluation.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The conclusion that the candidate is "honest and morally straight" does not necessarily follow from the given selective actions, especially when other critical actions are disclosed that indicate otherwise.

Combining these points, we can use <IDAA> to categorize the specific defective elements in the argument as primarily:

<FE> - Incomplete Enumeration: The argument selectively lists the candidate's actions without considering the complete range of behaviors, omitting essential negative actions which are highly relevant to forming a justified conclusion.
