For 
Applying **Identify Defective Argument Analysis (IDAA)** to the statement **"Beware of appeals made only to your feelings and not to your logic."**, we should assess whether the statement itself could fall under any of the defined defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument warns against appeals made only to feelings, which might be seen as a broad general statement. However, it is not making a general claim about all appeals, but rather emphasizing a cautious approach. Therefore, it doesn't seem to commit the defect of a generalization since it's about a specific type of appeal.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement does not list alternatives or present an incomplete set of examples. It speaks categorically about appeals to emotions versus appeals to logic.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The suggestion to be wary of emotional appeals might lack a detailed reasoning within the statement itself. This could be seen as an inconclusive reason if it doesn't elaborate on why emotional appeals are insufficient or problematic.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The statement doesn't seem to make a causal assertion needing more causal evidence or support. It advises caution without asserting a direct cause-effect relationship.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: There is no repeated proposition within this single statement.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The statement does not claim a consensus or presumptuously appeal to an assumed agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language used in the statement is quite clear. It differentiates between appeals to feelings and appeals to logic without ambiguity.

Given these considerations:
- The statement most closely aligns with the defective argument type **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**, as it advises caution against emotional appeals without necessarily providing detailed reasoning or evidence to support why logic-based appeals are always superior or preferable in every context. It assumes that appeals to emotion are less valid without detailed substantiation within the statement itself.
