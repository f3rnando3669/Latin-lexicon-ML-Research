The statement "Some teenagers in our community recently vandalized the park downtown. Teenagers are so irresponsible and destructive." can be analyzed by recognizing defective argument types as follows:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument takes a specific incident involving "some teenagers" and generalizes it to the entire group of teenagers, labeling all of them as "irresponsible and destructive." This is a classic example of a hasty generalization, where a broad conclusion is drawn from a limited set of observations.

It's worth noting that while the primary defective argument type here is Generalization, there could also be elements of Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), as the argument fails to consider the behavior of the many teenagers who do not engage in vandalism or destructive behavior. This omission complements the generalization but isn't the primary flaw. The key issue is the leap from a few individuals' actions to a blanket statement about an entire group.
