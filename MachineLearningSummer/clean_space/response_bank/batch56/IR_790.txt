For 
The acronym <IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Applications. To apply <IDAA> to the statement "Two words: New Coke," let's first analyze the possible defective arguments at play based on the provided definitions.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This type is used when a broad conclusion is drawn from a small or unrepresentative sample. The statement might fall under this if it is using "New Coke" as a representative example to make a broader claim about product failures or marketing strategies without sufficient backing evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This is an argument that incorrectly attempts to enumerate examples to support a conclusion. If "New Coke" is used to imply all marketing or product changes lead to failure without considering successful examples, it would be <FE>.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This type refers to an argument where the premises do not sufficiently support the conclusion. The statement "Two words: New Coke" may be an inconclusive reason if it tries to imply a broader marketing lesson but doesn't provide the necessary reasoning behind it.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This is an argument where a cause-and-effect relationship is claimed without sufficient evidence. If the phrase is used to imply "change is bad" with New Coke as the sole example, it would be <WCB>.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This occurs when the same proposition is repeated without additional support to make it sound more credible. If "New Coke" is mentioned repeatedly in various contexts as a failure without additional details, it might be an <RR>.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Here, the argument assumes that because many people believe something, it must be true. If "New Coke" refers to a well-known failure assuming consensus without further argument, it is <FU>.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This argument uses vague or ambiguous language leading to unclear reasoning. The statement "Two words: New Coke" could be considered ambiguous if it relies heavily on the audienceâ€™s presumption without clear context.

Based on the context provided, where "Two words: New Coke" seems to imply a widely-recognized failure in marketing:

**Application of <IDAA>:**

- **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement potentially generalizes by taking the failure of New Coke as a comprehensive lesson applicable to all similar business decisions.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: It suggests a conclusion about product changes or marketing strategies but only considers the failure of New Coke without listing successful instances.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This leverages the general awareness and consensus about the New Coke failure, assuming the audience accepts it as an example without additional clarification.

Therefore, the statement "Two words: New Coke" might primarily represent **Generalization (<G>)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**, and **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)** defective argument types.
