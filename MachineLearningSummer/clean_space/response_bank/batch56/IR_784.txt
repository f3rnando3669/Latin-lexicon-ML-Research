<IDAA> stands for Irrelevant Deflection of Argument Application. The argument "Don't you want the best for your baby?" is an example of <IDAA> because it deflects the focus from the actual point of discussion by appealing to a parent's desire for their child's well-being, without addressing the specific issue at hand. This type of argumentation is irrelevant because it manipulates emotions rather than providing a logical reason or evidence related to the original topic.
