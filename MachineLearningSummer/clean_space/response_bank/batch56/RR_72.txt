For 
<IDAA> stands for "Identify Defective Argument Analysis." Let's apply it to the given argument.

Bill: I think capital punishment is wrong.
Adam: No it isn't. If it was wrong, it wouldn't be legal.

Identifying the Defective Argument:

Adam's response can be broken down into a premise and a conclusion:
- Premise: If something is legal, then it is not wrong.
- Conclusion: Capital punishment is not wrong because it is legal.

This reasoning assumes that legality inherently determines moral correctness, which is a flawed assumption. The legality of an action does not necessarily entail its moral correctness.

Upon examining the argument types defined:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: Not applicable, as Adam is not making a sweeping generalization.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not applicable in this context.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: There isn't enough consideration of underlying reasons here.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument isn't about causation.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Not applicable as the argument doesn't repetitively assert a proposition without change.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This doesn't seem to be an appeal to a consensus.
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: Language ambiguity is not the issue here.

The best match from these options is <IR>â€”**Inconclusive Reason**. Adam's argument fails to provide a conclusive reason why capital punishment is not wrong and relies solely on its legality to make a moral claim. This makes the reason provided inconclusive to the point being debated (the morality of capital punishment).

So, the argument could be identified as an example of an **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** fallacy.
