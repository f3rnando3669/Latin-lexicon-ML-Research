For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Analysis.

To apply IDAA to the argument provided:

**Argument Presented:**
Parent: "I really don’t want you to smoke pot. It’s still illegal, and could get you into trouble."
Child: "Didn’t you smoke pot when you were my age? You must not think it’s a big deal."

Let's identify the defective arguments present in this exchange.

1. **Fallacy Identification:**
   - The child's argument seems to imply that because the parent engaged in the same behavior when they were younger, the behavior is acceptable or not serious. This might fall under the category of a <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), as the child's reasoning is based on personal anecdote about the parent's past behavior rather than addressing the legality or potential consequences of smoking pot.
   
2. **Potential Fallacies Present:**
    - The child is using what's referred to as Tu Quoque, a form of ad hominem where the argument is deflected by accusing the other party of hypocrisy. This does not address the initial issue at hand—whether smoking pot is legal or could get the child into trouble.
    - This also opens up a possible <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus), suggesting that because the parent did it, it implies an implicit approval or consensus regarding the behavior.
    
3. **Argument Analysis:**
   - The parent’s argument is straightforward and focused on legal and potential trouble-related consequences.
   - The child’s argument diverts from these points and focuses instead on the parent’s past behavior, implying it’s not a big deal since the parent did it, which lacks a solid factual or logical basis regarding the current implications of smoking pot.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The child's argument is an example of defective argumentation, primarily using Inconclusive Reason (<IR>) by shifting the focus to the parent’s past behavior without addressing the core concerns about legality and potential trouble.
   - Additionally, there's an element of Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>) but primarily the defective argument here is <IR>.
