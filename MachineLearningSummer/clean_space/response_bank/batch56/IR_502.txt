For 
"<IDAA>" hasn't been defined in the list provided, but based on common argument analysis, the argument "Because doctors smoke it must be a healthy choice" could be evaluated using one or more of the defective argument types you've provided.

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument makes a broad generalization based on the actions of a subset of doctors. Just because some doctors smoke does not mean that smoking is universally considered healthy.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument only includes the doctors who smoke while ignoring those who don't or the medical advice against smoking that is well-documented.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument draws a conclusion about the healthiness of smoking based on insufficient or unrelated information. The fact that doctors do something does not directly imply it's healthy.

4. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: It assumes a consensus among doctors about the healthiness of smoking without any evidence. This type of argument presumes agreement without verifying it.

The statement "Because doctors smoke it must be a healthy choice" can be mainly categorized under **Generalization (G)** and **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. It generalizes the behavior of some doctors to make a broad claim about the healthiness of smoking, and the reason provided (doctors smoke) does not conclusively support the claim that it is healthy.
