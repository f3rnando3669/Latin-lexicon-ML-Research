For 
The acronym <IDAA> is not defined in the provided context, so I'll introduce it based on common logical reasoning standards as "Identifying Defective Argument Analysis." 

Let's apply the analysis to the statement: "You can't be my partner in class because you didn't donate to the Hurricane Sandy fundraiser."

Upon examining the statement, it seems to be relying on an irrelevant criterion (donating to a specific fundraiser) as the basis for determining a suitable class partner. This suggests the use of an irrelevant reason or potentially an incomplete reasoning process. 

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning given does not strongly support the conclusion. The donation to a fundraiser is unrelated to academic partnership capabilities, which makes the reason inconclusive and irrelevant to the actual suitability for being a class partner.

Thus, the statement "You can't be my partner in class because you didn't donate to the Hurricane Sandy fundraiser." can be categorized as having a defective argument type of <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
