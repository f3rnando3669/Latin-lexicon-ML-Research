For 
To clarify, it looks like you're requesting for application of a defective argument type on the statement "You didn’t even finish high school, how could you possibly know about this?". It seems you forgot to define <IDAA>, but it closely resembles an established logical fallacy known as **Ad Hominem** or **Attacking the Person**.

**Ad Hominem** occurs when an argument attacks a person's character or qualifications rather than addressing the substance of their argument.

So if we define <IDAA> to be **Ad Hominem**, the application to "You didn’t even finish high school, how could you possibly know about this?" would highlight that the argument attacks the person's educational background rather than addressing any points they may have made about the subject at hand.
