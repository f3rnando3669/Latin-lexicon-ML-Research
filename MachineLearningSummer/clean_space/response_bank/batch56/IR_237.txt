For 
To apply a defective argument type classification to the dialogue between Jack and Jill, you need to identify the nature of the argument and whether it fits into one of the provided defective argument types.

Let's analyze Jack's statement and Jill's response:

Jack: "You should stop smoking - it's bad for you."
Jill: "Look who's talking! You smoke three packs a day!"

Here, Jill's response seems to dismiss Jack's argument by pointing out that Jack himself also smokes, rather than addressing whether smoking is objectively bad. This is an example of a type of argument known as "Tu Quoque" (you also), which is a form of ad hominem that deflects the criticism back on the critic, thereby avoiding the substance of the argument.

Given the definitions provided, let's match it to one of the defective argument types:

- **<G> Generalization**: This does not fit, as the conversation is not making a broad generalization.
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: This does not fit because there is no partial list being given.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: This does not strictly apply, as the reason provided by Jill is about Jack's credibility rather than an inconclusive reason regarding smoking's harm.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: This does not fit as itâ€™s not arguing about a causation issue.
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: This does not apply as there is no repetition in the argument.
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: This does not fit because there is no appeal to a false consensus.
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**: This does not fit because the language used is clear and not ambiguous.

The defective argument type in this specific dialogue match is closest to <IR> Inconclusive Reason, since Jill's response does not provide a conclusive reason against Jack's claim about smoking being bad, but rather deflects from the issue by pointing out Jack's hypocritical behavior. If we stretch the provided definitions, it could be categorized under <IR> because Jill's response does not address the actual argument's validity and thus sidesteps the real issue with an inconclusive and diversionary reason.
