For 
Let's break down and apply the defined defective argument types (<IDAA> stands for Identify Defective Argument Applied) to the statement:

"Everyone loves Post Malone and can name at least one of his songs!"

This statement can be evaluated for various types of defective arguments defined. Here's the analysis:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - The statement claims that "everyone" loves Post Malone and can name at least one of his songs, which is an overly broad generalization. Not everyone may love him or even know who he is.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - It asserts that if someone is part of "everyone," they must conform to this liking and knowledge of Post Malone. It doesn't account for those who may not fit this criteria.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - It doesn't provide a basis or evidence to support why everyone would love Post Malone and be able to name one of his songs. The statement is presented without supporting reasoning.
   
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - This specific type of defective argument might not directly apply here as there isn’t a cause-and-effect relationship being suggested that needs to be scrutinized.
   
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - The statement itself is standalone and doesn’t repeat the same proposition in an illogical manner. This defective argument type does not apply.
   
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - The statement presumes a consensus by claiming "everyone" shares the same opinion about Post Malone. It assumes unanimous agreement without evidence.
   
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - The language in the statement is not overtly ambiguous or unclear, as it directly targets the supposed views about Post Malone. Therefore, this defective argument type does not apply.

Given the above analysis, the statement "Everyone loves Post Malone and can name at least one of his songs!" can be identified primarily with the following defective argument types:

- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**

So, the answer is:

**"<IDAA> Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), and Presumptuous Consensus (FU)"**
