For 
"Either you love me, or you hate me." is an example of a defective argument type commonly known as a false dilemma. A false dilemma, also known as a false dichotomy, is a logical fallacy that presents only two options or sides when there are actually more alternatives available.

However, according to your given definitions, none of the specified defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>) match the characteristics of a false dilemma directly. 

<IDAA>, based on common understanding, does not match the standard logical fallacies definitions provided. You might have meant a defective argument type that was not listed. To fit this into your provided categories, one would need to redefine or consider adding another category that captures the essence of a false dilemma.

If this is an error or oversight in the provided categories, and we have to choose from the existing list, the closest might be:

- <IR> - Inconclusive Reason: This could apply because the argument does not logically conclude or cover all possible reasons and outcomes.

But strictly speaking, a new definition, like "False Dilemma" (FD), would better categorize this type of argument.
