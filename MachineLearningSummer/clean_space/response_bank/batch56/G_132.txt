For 
The argument "10 of the last 14 National Spelling Bee Champions have been Indian American. Indian Americans must all be great spellers!" fits the defective argument type of Generalization (<G>).

Here is how it applies:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument type occurs when a conclusion is drawn about all members of a group based on data about only a subset of that group. In this case, the argument draws a conclusion about all Indian Americans being great spellers based on the success of a small number of individuals (10 out of 14 National Spelling Bee Champions).

Therefore, you can label the argument as follows:

**<G>** The argument commits the defective argument type of Generalization because it generalizes the spelling ability of all Indian Americans based on the achievements of a few participants in the National Spelling Bee.
