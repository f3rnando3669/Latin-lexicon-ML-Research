For 
<IDAA> stands for Identify Defective Argument Application. Let's apply <IDAA> to the dialogue provided:

David: We have way too much police presence in this city.  
Pete: What are you going to do about it?  
David: Vandalize, loot, and perhaps a little arson.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - David's statement "We have way too much police presence in this city" could potentially be a generalization depending on the context and evidence provided. If David is basing his argument on a few instances without comprehensive data, this would be classified as <G>.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - David's suggestion of actions ("Vandalize, loot, and perhaps a little arson") implies that these are the only or best possible responses to the problem he identifies. This is an <FE> because he doesn't consider other possible responses, such as peaceful protests, community organizing, or policy advocacy.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - Pete's response "What are you going to do about it?" could be seen as diverting the conversation without addressing the argument of police presence. However, this is more of a follow-up question rather than an argument which makes its categorization as <IR> debatable.
   - David's leap to vandalism and arson as a response doesn't logically follow from the statement about police presence, making this reasoning inconclusive (<IR>).

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - The leap from excessive police presence to the need for vandalism or arson does not establish a sufficient causal relationship. It doesn't show why less police presence would justify these acts, thus it's a <WCB>.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - There isn't an instance of repetition of a proposition in this dialogue, so <RR> does not apply here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - There is no indication that David assumes everyone agrees with his plan of action (vandalism and arson) based on consensus. So <FU> isn't relevant here.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - The language used is quite clear in terms of what David is proposing, so <DEP> does not seem applicable.

Summary for this argument:

- **Generalization (<G>)** potentially applies if David's claim about police presence lacks thorough evidence.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** applies to David’s response of vandalism, looting, and arson as the only solutions to his perceived problem.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** applies to David’s logic, as his proposed solutions do not clearly follow from his assertion about police presence.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** applies due to the lack of a clear causal link between police presence and the need for vandalism and arson.

So, we can highlight the relevant defective arguments in the dialogue:

- **David: We have way too much police presence in this city.** <G>
- **Pete: What are you going to do about it?**
- **David: Vandalize, loot, and perhaps a little arson.** <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>
