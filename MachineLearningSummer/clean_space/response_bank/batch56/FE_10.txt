For 
By applying the identified defective argument types to the given statement, we can determine if any of them fit as a fallacy for the argument presented by Autumn.

Autumn's argument proceeds as follows:
1. We must raise tuition to cover the cost of new books.
2. Otherwise, the library will be forced to close.

Let's see if the argument can be classified into one of the defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This does not seem to be a generalization, as it isn't inferring broad conclusions from a limited set of observations.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This doesn't seem to be a method of reasoning by listing only some possible options.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This could be a candidate, as the reason given seems to present a forced dichotomy without exploring other possible outcomes or solutions.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: There is definitely a causality issue here; it assumes that not raising tuition will directly lead to the closure of the library, without sufficient evidence of causation.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This argument does not seem to use repetition to erroneously support a proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This does not appear to assume unanimous agreement without evidence.
7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The language used does not seem particularly ambiguous in this case.

Given that Autumn's argument strongly implies a direct cause-effect relationship between not raising tuition and the library's closure without sufficiently establishing that causal link, it appears to match the fallacy described by <WCB> or Insufficient Causal Basis.

Thus, the fallacy in Autumn's argument is an example of:
**Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
