For 
<IDAA> can be applied to the statement, "My friend told me to quit singing in the car since I have a 'bad voice.' She sings in the car all of the time!" by identifying which type of defective argument is being used in this reasoning.

In this case, the argument appears to be criticizing the friend's recommendation not based on the merit of the recommendation itself, but on the friend's behavior. This is an example of the defective argument type known as Inconclusive Reason (<IR>).

Inconclusive Reason (<IR>): The argument or conclusion is drawn based on an irrelevant or insufficiently related premise. Here, the fact that the friend sings in the car does not necessarily invalidate the friend's assessment or feedback about the speakerâ€™s singing ability. The friend's action could be hypocritical, but it doesn't directly address whether the speaker has a "bad voice."

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the statement identifies it as <IR>, an Inconclusive Reason.
