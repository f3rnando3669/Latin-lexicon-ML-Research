The argument presented is:

"Ross Geller, an evolutionary biologist and perhaps the foremost expert in the field, says that evolution is true. Therefore, it's true."

To apply the defective argument analysis method (<IDAA>), we need to identify and diagnose any defective arguments types that might be present. Here are the steps broken down:

1. **Identify** the components of the argument:
   - Claim: "Evolution is true."
   - Reason: "Ross Geller, an evolutionary biologist and perhaps the foremost expert in the field, says so."

2. **Diagnose** the type(s) of defective argument(s):
   - The argument is based on the authority of Ross Geller in asserting the truth of evolution.

3. **Apply** the relevant defective argument type(s):
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument relies on the authority of a single expert to claim the truth of a scientific theory, without providing additional evidence or logical reasoning. Just because an expert states something, it doesn't automatically mean it is true without further empirical support.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument might overstate the consensus supported by one expert's opinion, assuming that the expertâ€™s view alone sufficiently represents a universal truth within the scientific community.

Therefore, the primary defective argument type identified here is:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Just because one expert asserts something, it doesn't guarantee the absolute truth of the statement without supporting evidence or logical reasoning. Evolutionary theory, while widely supported by evidence in the scientific community, requires more than just an appeal to authority to validate its truth.

We could also consider **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** if the argument implied that the single expert's opinion represents a broader consensus improperly.

In conclusion, the argument applies **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and potentially **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** as defective argument types.
