For 
<IDAA> stands for Identify Defective Argument Application. Let's break down the argument and identify any defective argument types that apply:

"**Animal experimentation reduces our respect for life.** If we don't respect life, we are likely to be more and more tolerant of violent acts like war and murder. Soon our society will become a battlefield in which everyone constantly fears for their lives. It will be the end of civilization."

1. **Animal experimentation reduces our respect for life.**
   - This statement is a sweeping assertion without supporting evidence, which can be considered a **Generalization (G)**.

2. **If we don't respect life, we are likely to be more and more tolerant of violent acts like war and murder.**
   - This statement introduces a causal relationship without sufficient evidence to support it, qualifying as **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

3. **Soon our society will become a battlefield in which everyone constantly fears for their lives.**
   - This assumes extreme outcomes from the initial premise without providing evidence, making this an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.

4. **It will be the end of civilization.**
   - This is a drastic prediction that escalates from the initial claim without adequate justification, another example of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.

Overall, the argument employs:
- **Generalization (G)**: The initial claim about animal experimentation.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The connection between respect for life and tolerance of violence.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The progression to a battlefield society and the end of civilization.

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the argument, we identify the following defective argument types:
- **<G>** for Generalization.
- **<WCB>** for Insufficient Causal Basis.
- **<IR>** for Inconclusive Reason.
