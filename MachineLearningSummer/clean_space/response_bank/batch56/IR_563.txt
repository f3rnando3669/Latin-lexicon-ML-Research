Sure! Let's analyze the argument step by step by using the definitions provided:

### Original Argument:
"Sometimes kids ride skateboards and fall off, breaking their arms or legs. Clearly, riding a skateboard is extremely dangerous. Donâ€™t you think skateboards should be banned?"

### Identifying Defective Argument Types:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The argument is generalizing that because some kids fall and get hurt, riding skateboards is extremely dangerous for everyone.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The argument does not consider all possibilities and fails to acknowledge that many kids ride skateboards without injury. It gives a partial view of the situation.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The argument assumes that some instances of injury are enough to classify skateboarding as extremely dangerous, but this reasoning does not conclusively prove that all skateboarding is inherently risky.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The causal relationship implied between riding skateboards and the need for a ban is weak because it does not consider factors such as proper safety gear or responsible usage that could mitigate the risks.

5. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - The argument presumptuously assumes that the listener will agree that skateboards should be banned without providing adequate support for this consensus.

6. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - The language in the argument is not particularly ambiguous. Terms like "extremely dangerous" might be subject to interpretation, but overall, the language is direct in conveying the concern.

### Conclusion:
The argument employs several defective argument types:

- **<G> Generalization**: The argument generalizes from specific instances of injury.
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: It presents a partial view and does not consider all scenarios.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The conclusion about the danger of skateboards is not definitively supported by the premises.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: The implied causal link between riding skateboards and the necessity of a ban is weakly established.
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: Assumes agreement on banning skateboards without sufficient justification.

Thus, the argument about banning skateboards can be dissected through several identified defective argument types as specified.
