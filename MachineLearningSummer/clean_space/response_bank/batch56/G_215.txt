For 
<IDAA> refers to the defective argument type known as an "Inflated Domino Analogy Argument," sometimes more commonly referred to as a "slippery slope" argument. This type of argument asserts that a relatively small first step leads to a chain of related events, culminating in some significant (usually negative) effect, without any solid evidence that such a progression is inevitable.

Applying <IDAA> to the given statement:

"If you don't study, you'll fail your test. Then you will do poorly in the class and your GPA will fall. You won't get into a good college, so you'll never get a decent job and you'll end up homeless." 

Analysis:
This statement suggests a series of linked consequences that are dependent on the initial action of not studying. It argues that not studying will lead one to fail a test, which will then cascade into doing poorly in the class, which will lower the GPA, which will prevent entry into a good college, leading to an inability to secure a decent job, and ultimately resulting in homelessness. 

This is a classic example of an <IDAA> because:
1. It assumes an inevitable progression from a single missed study session to homelessness, without considering other possible interventions or factors that might alter this course.
2. Each step in the chain makes a consequential leap that isn't substantiated with evidence, but rather relies on fear and dramatic escalation to make its point.
3. It oversimplifies the complexities of academic performance, college admissions, and career success, reducing them to a direct and unavoidable sequence of events. 

In summary, this argument uses the slippery slope fallacy to assert that not studying will inevitably result in homelessness, without providing sufficient evidence to demonstrate that such a chain of events is certain or even likely.
