In analyzing the argument "My father smoked four packs of cigarettes a day since age fourteen and lived until age sixty-nine. Therefore, smoking really canâ€™t be that bad for you," we can identify the defective argument types (IDAA) as follows:

- <G> Generalization: The argument makes a sweeping generalization based on a single instance, the father's experience.
- <FE> Incomplete Enumeration: The argument does not consider other cases where individuals who smoked did not live a long life, leading to an incomplete view of the situation.
- <IR> Inconclusive Reason: The conclusion that smoking isn't harmful is weakly supported, as the argument does not involve a statistically significant sample size or scientific analysis.
- <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis: The argument fails to establish a causal relationship between smoking and longevity, instead relying on anecdotal evidence.
- <FU> Presumptuous Consensus: The argument might presuppose that the father's experience is sufficient to sway public opinion or consensus regarding the dangers of smoking.
- <DEP> Ambiguous Language: Although not prominently present, if the term "bad for you" is considered ambiguous without specifying the aspects of "bad" (e.g., immediate harm, long-term risks), it might fall under ambiguous language.

By parsing the argument through these defective reasoning categories, we highlight its weaknesses and the fallacies present.
