For 
The acronym <IDAA> is not defined in your context, but I can attempt to analyze the argument using the defective argument types you've defined.

The statement "I've only read a couple pages of this book, and I've already found a typo. There's no way I'm reading the rest of this garbage." seems to fit multiple defective argument types:

1. **<G> Generalization**: The person generalizes the quality of the entire book based on a small sample (a couple of pages).
   
2. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: Finding a typo in a couple of pages does not conclusively indicate that the entire book is of poor quality.
   
3. **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: The person has not considered or evaluated the entire content of the book, but concludes its value based on a very limited portion.

Therefore, the argument could be identified as exhibiting *Generalization (<G>)*, *Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)*, and *Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)*.
