Before identifying the defective argument in the given statement, let's understand what the abbreviations stand for:

- <G>: Generalization
- <FE>: Incomplete Enumeration
- <IR>: Inconclusive Reason
- <WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis
- <RR>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition
- <FU>: Presumptuous Consensus
- <DEP>: Ambiguous Language

Now let's analyze the argument: "It’s true that this company hasn’t given raises in the last 5 years, but we work really hard to ensure that we have a quality product and good customer service."

This argument seems to commit the fallacy of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. The premise that the company hasn't given raises in the last five years is countered with the assertion that the company works hard to ensure quality products and customer service. However, the latter point does not address the issue of raises; it is an irrelevant reason that does not conclusively explain or justify the lack of raises.

Therefore, the defective argument type fitting best here according to the given definitions is <IR> - Inconclusive Reason.
