For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Arguments in Action. Let's apply <IDAA> to the provided statement: "While jogging around the neighborhood, you are more likely to get bitten by someoneâ€™s pet dog, than by any member of the canine species."

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   The statement might be considered a generalization since it assumes that pet dogs are the primary risk of biting when jogging around any neighborhood without substantial evidence or consideration for other contexts or regions.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   This argument could be classified as an Incomplete Enumeration if it does not consider all the different potential sources of bites beyond just pets and other canines, such as wild animals or strays.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   The reasoning that one is more likely to be bitten by a pet dog than any other member of the canine species may be inconclusive. The supporting evidence or data, like specific bite statistics or details about the conditions in the particular neighborhood, is missing.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   There's an implied causal link suggesting pet dogs are inherently more likely to bite joggers compared to other canines, which may lack sufficient basis unless supported by comprehensive research on bite incidents.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   There's no immediate indication that this statement is a repetition of a previously unproven claim within the provided text, so this defective argument type might not apply directly here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   The statement might assume a consensus or widespread agreement that pet dogs are the main risk, without citing any evidence of such consensus or considering dissenting viewpoints.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   The term "any member of the canine species" is more general than "someone's pet dog," which introduces ambiguity. "Canine species" could include wild or stray animals, which might impact the perceived risk inaccurately.

By applying <IDAA>, the primary defective argument types relevant to this statement appear to be Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), and potentially Ambiguous Language (DEP).
