<I> Identify Defective Argument Application <IDAA>

The statement provided can be analyzed for defective arguments as follows:

"Mr. Equalminded's idea for implementing affirmative action in the university's admission process is complete folly. He says he wants the student body to represent diversity in the community. But that's ridiculous. I suppose this means we'll have to throw out our academic standards while we're at it. After all, if we're going to let students into our prestigious institution just because of their gender or the color of their skin, then what's going to happen to our reputation?"

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The assertion that implementing affirmative action means throwing out academic standards is a sweeping generalization. It assumes that diversity and academic standards cannot coexist without providing specific evidence to support this claim.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The argument jumps to a conclusion that admitting students based on diversity will ruin the institution's reputation, without providing evidence that this will indeed happen. The reasoning is inconclusive as it does not take into account the success stories of other institutions that have implemented similar policies successfully.

3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This argument lacks a sufficient causal basis. It assumes a direct cause-and-effect relationship between affirmative action and the institution's declining reputation, which is speculative and not supported by concrete evidence.

4. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The phrase "just because of their gender or the color of their skin" is ambiguous and emotionally charged. It simplifies the complex criteria that often go into affirmative action policies, which typically consider a wide range of factors.

Thus, the argument can be identified as having multiple defective elements: <G>, <IR>, <WCB>, and <DEP>.
