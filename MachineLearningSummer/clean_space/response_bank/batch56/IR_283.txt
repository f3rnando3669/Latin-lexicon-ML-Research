For 
<IDAA>, or Identify Defective Argument Application, involves recognizing and labeling the type of defective argument present in a statement. In the provided statement:

"I believe that when we die, we are all given new, young, perfect bodies, and we spend eternity with those whom we love. I can’t imagine the point of life if it all just ends when we die!"

The defective argument types that can be applied here are:

1. **<IR>: Inconclusive Reason** - The statement "I can’t imagine the point of life if it all just ends when we die!" is an inconclusive reason. The inability to imagine an alternative does not serve as solid evidence for the claim about life after death.

2. **<DEP>: Ambiguous Language** - The term "new, young, perfect bodies" can be considered ambiguous. What qualifies as "perfect" can vary greatly among different individuals and is not clearly defined.

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the statement results in:

- **<IR>: Inconclusive Reason** - The personal inability to see the point of life without an afterlife is not strong evidence for the claim about what happens after death.
- **<DEP>: Ambiguous Language** - The description of the afterlife includes terms that are open to interpretation and not clearly defined, resulting in potential ambiguity.
