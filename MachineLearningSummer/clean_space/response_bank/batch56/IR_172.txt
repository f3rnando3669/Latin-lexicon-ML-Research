For 
<IDAA> stands for Identify, Describe, Analyze, and Assess, steps used to evaluate an argument for its defects or strengths. Applying <IDAA> to the given dialogue:

**Identify:**
- **Person 1's Statement:** “I am for raising the minimum wage in our state.”
- **Person 2's Response:** “She is for raising the minimum wage, but she is not even smart enough to run a business."

**Describe:**
- **Person 1’s Statement:** A clear position is taken on raising the minimum wage in the state, advocating for a policy change.
- **Person 2’s Response:** Instead of addressing the merits of Person 1’s position, Person 2 attacks Person 1's intelligence and capability to run a business.

**Analyze:**
- **Nature of Person 2's Argument:**
  - **Ad Hominem Attack:** Person 2 shifts the focus from the argument about raising the minimum wage to an attack on Person 1's capability and intelligence, questioning their ability to judge or engage in business matters.
  - **Non-Related Critique:** The critique of Person 1's intelligence and business skills does not relate directly to the argument about whether raising the minimum wage is a beneficial policy or not.

**Assess:**
- **Effectiveness and Relevance:**
  - **Relevance:** Person 2's response is irrelevant to the actual discussion about the minimum wage policy. It does not provide any reasons or evidence related to the policy’s impact or efficacy.
  - **Effectiveness:** The argument is ineffective in terms of constructive debate as it does not challenge the policy position with factual or logical reasoning but rather tries to discredit Person 1 personally.
  - **Defective Argument Type:** Person 2’s argument can be classified under <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) because it fails to provide a relevant or convincing reason concerning the topic debated (raising the minimum wage).

In summary, Person 2's response constitutes an ad hominem attack and is thus a defective argument, as it relies on an Inconclusive Reason <IR> not relating to the substance of the debate on the minimum wage policy.
