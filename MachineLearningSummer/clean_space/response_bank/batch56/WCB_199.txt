For 
<IDAA>: **Identifying Defective Arguments Analysis**

1. **Identify the Argument**:
   The argument states: "I knew I should have helped that old lady across the road. Because I didnâ€™t, I have been having bad Karma all day."

2. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types**:
   
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This argument appears to be making a causal claim that a specific action (not helping the old lady) directly caused an outcome (experiencing bad Karma). The cause and effect relationship is not established, and there could be many unrelated factors that contributed to the "bad Karma."

3. **Explanation**:
   The assumption that not helping the old lady is directly responsible for having a bad day is a classical example of <WCB>. There is no sufficient causal basis to conclude that one specific action directly resulted in all the negative experiences of the day. Many other reasons or random occurrences could account for the "bad Karma."

4. **Implications**:
   - Without sufficient evidence linking the action (not helping the lady) and the outcome (bad Karma), the argument fails to hold.
   - This kind of reasoning might lead to faulty conclusions and can be misleading if applied in other contexts.

**Conclusion**:
The argument in question suffers from **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** as it presumes a causal relationship without adequate evidence to support the claim.
