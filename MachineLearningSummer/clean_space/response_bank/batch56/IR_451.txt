For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application. In this context, we are tasked with identifying the type of defective argument used in the given statement:

"We should abolish the death penalty. Many respected people, such as actor, Chewbacca, have publicly stated their opposition to it."

Breaking down this argument:

1. **Claim:** We should abolish the death penalty.
2. **Supporting Reason:** Many respected people, such as actor, Chewbacca, have publicly stated their opposition to it.

Let's categorize this argument using the defective argument types defined:

- **Generalization (G):** Making a broad claim based on limited evidence.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Presenting a claim based on an incomplete list of instances or examples.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Using a reason that doesn't necessarily lead to the stated conclusion.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Suggesting a causal relationship without sufficient evidence.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Repeating a claim without adding new support or information.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Assuming that because some people agree, the conclusion is valid.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** Using vague or unclear language to make a point.

The given argument primarily appeals to authority by citing respected people who oppose the death penalty. Since it specifically mentions actor Chewbacca (a fictional character), it undermines the validity of the appeal to authority. However, the main issue is:

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument assumes that because "many respected people" oppose the death penalty, the conclusion that it should be abolished is valid. This is a form of appeal to popularity or authority without substantive reasoning directly addressing the merits of the death penalty itself.

Therefore, the defective argument type in this application is **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**.
