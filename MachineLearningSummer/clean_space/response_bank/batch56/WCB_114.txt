For 
<IDAA> refers to the application of identifying defective argument types to an argument or reasoning presented.

In the scenario given, Anthony commits the fallacy of having an "Insufficient Causal Basis" (<WCB>).

Here's the reasoning:

Anthony believes that his comment during the fight caused Marie to get hit by a bus. However, he does not have sufficient evidence to establish a direct causal relationship between his words and the subsequent accident. Correlation does not imply causation. Just because two events are temporally related (his comment and the accident happening later), it does not mean that one caused the other. His reasoning lacks a sufficient causal basis to support his conclusion that his comment caused the accident.
