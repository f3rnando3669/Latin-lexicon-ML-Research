For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying, Describing, and Analyzing Arguments. Using this framework to analyze the argument in the statement:

1. **Identifying**:
   - **Claim**: Night air was assumed to be the cause of malaria.
   - **Evidence**: It was observed that persons who went out at night often developed the malady.
   - **Conclusion**: Elaborate precautions were taken to shut out night air from sleeping quarters.

2. **Describing**:
   - **Nature of the Argument**: This is an argument where causation is inferred from correlation (i.e., Observing that people who went out at night developed malaria led to the conclusion that night air caused the disease).

3. **Analyzing**:
   - **Generalization <G>**: The argument generalizes that because some people developed malaria after going out at night, night air must be the cause. This doesn't consider other factors that might be involved.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>**: The argument doesn't comprehensively consider all possible causes of malaria. It assumes a single factor (night air) without evaluating other potential causes (such as the presence of mosquitoes, which are actually the carriers of malaria).
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>**: The causal link between night air and malaria is weak and unsubstantiated. There’s no sufficient evidence to robustly support this cause-effect relationship.
   - **Inconclusive Reason <IR>**: The reasoning provided is inconclusive. Observing people developing malaria after being out at night doesn’t conclusively prove that night air is the cause, especially without ruling out other more plausible causes.

By employing the <IDAA> framework, we can see that the argument is fundamentally flawed due to the presence of defective argument types such as Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Insufficient Causal Basis, and Inconclusive Reason. The precautions taken (shutting out night air from sleeping quarters) were based on an erroneous assumption about the cause of malaria, leading to ineffective or misguided prevention strategies.
