Based on the definitions provided for defective argument types, we'll identify and apply each type (IDAA - Identify Defective Argument Application) to analyze the given statement: "Before women got the vote, there were no nuclear weapons."

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument may be making an overly broad generalization by implying a causal relationship between women getting the vote and the development of nuclear weapons, without sufficient evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement does not consider other factors that could have contributed to the development of nuclear weapons, ignoring a multitude of potential influences.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument provides an inconclusive reason for the occurrence of nuclear weapons, as it suggests a correlation without any supporting evidence of causation.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument fails to provide a sufficient causal basis for the claim, as there is no logical connection established between women's suffrage and the creation of nuclear weapons.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: If the argument is repetitively suggesting that women's suffrage somehow led to nuclear weapons without new evidence or reasoning, it could be considered a faulty repetition of proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument may imply a consensus or common belief about the relationship between women's suffrage and nuclear weapons without any actual consensus or evidence to support it.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The argument could be considered ambiguous if it is not clear what it means by making a connection between two unrelated historical events, potentially causing confusion in interpretation.

**IDAA Application:**

The statement "Before women got the vote, there were no nuclear weapons" demonstrates several defective argument types:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This is the primary defective argument type here, as it presents an insufficient causal basis suggesting a connection between women getting the vote and the development of nuclear weapons without any logical evidence.
- **Generalization (G)**: The statement implies a broad and unsupported generalization that two unrelated events are causally connected.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: It offers an inconclusive reason, indicating correlation rather than any substantiated causation.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The connection between women's suffrage and nuclear weapons is ambiguous and can be easily misinterpreted.

Thus, the primary defective argument here would be **WCB**, with supporting defective argument types **G**, **IR**, and **DEP** contributing to its overall logical fallacy.
