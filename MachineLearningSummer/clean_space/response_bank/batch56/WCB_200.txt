For 
The argument in question is: "Almadina school of Richmond does not have many students, so that must mean that the school has a very selective admissions process."

Based on the provided definitions of defective argument types, we can identify the following defective argument:

**<IR> Inconclusive Reason:**
This argument type occurs when the reason provided does not adequately support the conclusion.

In this case, the fact that Almadina school of Richmond does not have many students is used to conclude that the school must have a very selective admissions process. However, there could be many other reasons for the low number of students, such as the school being new, not well-known, having limited resources, or not being in high demand. Therefore, the argument’s reasoning is inconclusive as it doesn’t adequately support the conclusion.

The properly labeled defective argument would be:
**<IR> Almadina school of Richmond does not have many students, so that must mean that the school has a very selective admissions process.**
