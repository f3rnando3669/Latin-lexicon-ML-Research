For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Types Applied. Let's apply it to the argument "Every severe recession follows a Republican Presidency; therefore Republicans are the cause of recessions."

To identify the defective argument types in this statement, we must analyze the structure and logic:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument is a generalization because it assumes a trend (severe recessions following Republican presidencies) to make a sweeping conclusion about all Republicans causing recessions. It does not take other possible factors into account.

2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: There is an assumption of causation without sufficient evidence. Just because two events occur consecutively does not mean one causes the other. There might be other contributing factors to the recessions that the argument ignores.

3. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument doesn't consider potential recessions following non-Republican presidencies or any counterexamples that might challenge the assertion. It selects information that supports the conclusion and omits other relevant data.

Thus, the statement "Every severe recession follows a Republican Presidency; therefore Republicans are the cause of recessions" displays the following defective argument types: <G> (Generalization), <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis), and <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration).
