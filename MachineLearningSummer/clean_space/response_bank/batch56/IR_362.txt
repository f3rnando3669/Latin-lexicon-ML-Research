For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application.

In the provided scenario, Justin's redirection of the conversation from his phone bill to his math class and test performance is an example of an attempt to distract or divert attention from the primary issue. This is commonly known as a **red herring**.

Here's how <IDAA> applies to this example:

**Scenario**: "Justin's mom gets his phone bill and he has gone over the limit. He begins talking to her about how hard his math class is and how well he did on a test today."

The defective argument type in this context is a distraction from the issue at hand:

1. **Primary Issue**: The phone bill and Justin going over the limit.
2. **Distraction**: Justin talks about his math class and test performance.
3. **Defective Argument Type**: This could fall under several types, but the most fitting type in the context provided might be:
   
   - **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language)**: While Justin's new topic isn't ambiguous, the shift creates ambiguity around the focus of the conversation.
   - **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: His academic performance has no bearing on the phone bill situation and doesn't address the problem directly, making this an inconclusive reason to justify or mitigate the phone bill issue.

Using these defined defective argument types, we would classify this as **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** because Justin's attempt to change the subject to his academic performance fails to address the actual issue of the phone bill, making it an argument that draws an inconclusive or irrelevant connection.
