For 
"Did John ever give up his bad habits?"

Let's apply the defective argument types to analyze this question:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This question makes a broad assumption about "bad habits" without specifying which habits are being referenced. It generalizes John's behaviors without context.
  
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: It assumes that there is a complete list of "bad habits" John might have had and that he must either give up all or none. It doesn't enumerate which habits could be given up or maintained.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The question doesn't provide any basis or reasoning to conclude whether John did or did not give up his bad habits, making it inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The question lacks sufficient details about the causes or reasons behind Johnâ€™s habits or any attempts to give them up, which would be necessary to discuss his success or failure.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: There seems to be no direct faulty repetition of a proposition within this question alone.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The question might imply that it is commonly known or accepted that John had bad habits, presuming a consensus without evidence.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The term "bad habits" is ambiguous; different people might interpret what constitutes a "bad habit" differently. The question does not define or specify what these habits are.

Thus, the analysis of the question "Did John ever give up his bad habits?" reveals multiple potential defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.
