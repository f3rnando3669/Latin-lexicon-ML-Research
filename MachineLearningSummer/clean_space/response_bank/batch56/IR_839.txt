For 
The argument type described as "attacking a person's character" is known as an ad hominem fallacy. This occurs when someone attempts to discredit the opponentâ€™s argument by attacking their character rather than addressing the substance of the argument itself. In the context of your defined defective argument types, this does not directly map to <G> Generalization, <FE> Incomplete Enumeration, <IR> Inconclusive Reason, <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis, <RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition, <FU> Presumptuous Consensus, or <DEP> Ambiguous Language, as an ad hominem fallacy is a distinct type of logical fallacy focused specifically on character attacks.

So, applying <IDAA> to the question "Which fallacy is used to attack a person's character?" leads to identifying "ad hominem" as the answer, although it is not listed among the defective argument types you've defined.
