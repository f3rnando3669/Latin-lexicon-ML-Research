For 
The argument "Everyone does it. You should too." can be analyzed for its rhetorical and logical defects by identifying the appropriate defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: The argument leverages a broad assumption that because "everyone" does it, it must inherently be the right or best thing to do. It generalizes from the supposed behavior of a broad group without providing concrete evidence or considering exceptions.

2. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This argument presumes a consensus (that everyone does it) and uses that consensus as a definitive justification for action without providing supporting evidence. This appeals to a bandwagon mentality, which is not logically justified.

Combining these, we apply the categories as follows:

```plaintext
<IDAA> = <FU> and <G>
```

By identifying both the defective types "Generalization" and "Presumptuous Consensus," we understand that the argument suggests action based on unverified general behavior and assumes consensus as an unassailable basis for making decisions.
