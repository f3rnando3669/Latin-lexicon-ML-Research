For 
It seems that <IDAA> was not explicitly defined in your list of defective arguments. However, considering the provided context, it is likely that you want to analyze the argument using the provided types. We can look at "Dad drank at parties, too" and attempt to classify it under the defective argument types you defined.

Here is a likely classification: 

Argument: "Dad drank at parties, too."

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This statement could be seen as a generalization if one uses it to imply a broader conclusion, such as "It's okay for anyone to drink at parties because Dad did it."

2. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This might be an inconclusive reason if one uses the fact that "Dad drank at parties" to justify or excuse another personâ€™s drinking at parties, without considering other relevant factors or consequences.

In context, "Dad drank at parties, too" seems to lean towards <IR> - Inconclusive Reason, because it attempts to draw a conclusion or justification based on insufficient reasoning. The fact that Dad drank at parties doesn't necessarily make it a valid or acceptable action for someone else, failing to consider other necessary factors for a solid argument.
