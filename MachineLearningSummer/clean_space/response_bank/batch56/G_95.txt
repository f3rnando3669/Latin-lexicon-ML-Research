The statement "one thing leads to another and another and another... creates a 'snowball' effect" can be labeled as a type of defective argument. Based on the descriptions provided, it appears to fit the category of <IR>, Inconclusive Reason. This is because it suggests a chain reaction or cumulative effect without providing a concrete causal explanation or sufficient evidence to support how one event inevitably leads to another in a 'snowball' manner. The argument relies on the assumption that such a sequence is natural and inevitable, which lacks specificity and conclusiveness.
