For 
Let's analyze the argument, "Utah passed a strict gun-control law, and crime there decreased. Therefore, gun-control laws decrease crime," using the defective argument types defined.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument could be classified as a generalization because it takes a specific instance (Utah) and generalizes the outcome (decreased crime) to imply that all gun-control laws will have the same effect. The conclusion might not hold true for different circumstances or states.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not consider other factors or other cases where gun-control laws were passed. It is based on a single instance and does not provide a comprehensive list of examples to support the general claim.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasoning is incomplete or should be further substantiated. Crime rates can be influenced by a variety of factors, not just gun-control laws. The claim that "gun-control laws decrease crime" might need more evidence and analysis to establish a conclusive causal relationship.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This argument suggests a causal link between gun-control laws and crime rates without sufficient evidence. The decrease in crime might be due to other unrelated factors, and attributing it solely to the gun-control law lacks a strong causal basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: There is no repetition of the proposition itself or an affirmation through repetition, so this defective argument type does not apply here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument does not appeal to a presumed consensus, so this defective argument type is not relevant in this case.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The language in the statement is fairly clear and unambiguous, so this defective argument type does not apply here either.

Thus, the argument can be primarily categorized under Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), and Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).
