Sure, let's apply the established defective argument types to the statement provided:

**Statement:** "I had a real bad headache, then saw my doctor. Just by talking with him, my headache started to subside, and I was all better the next day. It was well worth the $200 visit fee."

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
    - The argument assumes that talking with the doctor caused the headache to subside and led to improvement the next day. However, without more evidence, this is an insufficient basis to establish a causal relationship. Other factors, such as the natural course of the headache or placebo effect, could have contributed to the relief.

2. **Generalization (G):**
    - The argument is based on a single personal experience (one visit to the doctor resulting in headache relief). Generalizing from one instance is risky and doesn't provide robust evidence that spending $200 on a doctor visit is universally worthwhile for headaches.

3. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
    - The statement assumes that the value of the $200 visit is evident without considering different perspectives. While it was worth it for the speaker, this consensus cannot be presumed to hold true universally for all individuals experiencing headaches.

By examining the statement through these defective argument types, we can identify weaknesses and understand where the argument may fall short in terms of logic and evidence.
