For 
To apply the technique <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Aspects) to the given statement, we will dissect the argument and identify any instances of defective argument types as defined:

**Statement:** “My wife wants to talk about cleaning out the garage, so I asked her what she wants to do with our patio furniture. Now she’s shopping for new patio furniture and not asking me about the garage.”

1. **Generalization (G):** This does not involve making a broad generalization from limited instances, so <G> does not apply here.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The statement does not list multiple causes or effects incompletely, so <FE> does not apply here.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This appears to apply. The reasoning in the argument is inconclusive as it does not provide a clear causal link between the wife's initial desire to talk about cleaning out the garage and her end behavior of shopping for new patio furniture. The intervening steps are missing or ambiguous.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This overly simplified reasoning could involve insufficient causal basis because it lacks a detailed explanation of how asking about patio furniture directly resulted in the wife shopping for new ones instead of addressing the garage.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** There is no apparent repetition of a faulty proposition in the statement, so <RR> does not apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There is no appeal to a presumed consensus or general agreement on a matter, so <FU> does not apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The statement does not seem to use ambiguous language or terms that could have multiple meanings, so <DEP> does not apply.

**Conclusion:**
The defective argument aspects identified in the statement are:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

Thus, the argument suffers from an inconclusive reason as it does not clearly link the wife's subsequent actions to the initial topic, and it has an insufficient causal basis for why one topic led to the other's avoidance.
