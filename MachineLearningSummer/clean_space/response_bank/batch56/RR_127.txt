For 
Let's break down the statement "something that kills is deadly" using the provided defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This statement could be seen as a generalization because it takes a broad concept ("something that kills") and assigns it a specific attribute ("is deadly"). While the statement is tautologically true (since "deadly" is generally understood to mean "capable of causing death"), generalization may miss important specifics or contexts in real-world situations.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This statement doesn't necessarily suffer from incomplete enumeration because it doesn't list out different scenarios or cases. However, it is worth noting that it simplifies the concept of what it means to be "deadly" by not considering factors like intent, circumstances, or different forms of "killing."

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This statement might present an inconclusive reason if it is used to argue broader points without further context. For instance, if someone says "Guns are deadly because something that kills is deadly," the reasoning remains incomplete without contextual support.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The statement does not explicitly establish a causal relationship but inherently depends on the definition that something capable of causing death (kills) naturally has a deadly aspect. The argument here lacks a robust causal analysis but rather hinges on definitional truths.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The statement effectively repeats its core premise within its terms. "Something that kills (cause death) is deadly (leads to death)" is tautological and self-reinforcing without providing new information.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The statement does not directly imply consensus. However, it assumes a general agreement on the definition of "deadly" without considering whether everyone shares the same understanding or if the term covers all nuances.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The term "deadly" is indeed a bit ambiguous and can be interpreted in various ways depending on context. "Deadly" might straightforwardly indicate a capacity to kill, but it can also imply something more nuanced about danger or potential for causing death.

Thus, applying the general form of **Defective Argument Analysis (<IDAA>)**, we could observe that the statement "something that kills is deadly" fundamentally suffers from <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition) as its core issue, and to a lesser extent, it exhibits ambiguities and potential pitfalls fitting <DEP> and an implicit <G>.
