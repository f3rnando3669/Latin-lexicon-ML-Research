For 
Certainly! "Apply <IDAA> to" seems intended to mean "Identify Defective Argument types in". Based on the types you've defined, let's analyze the statement.

Statement: "We know God exists because we can see the perfect order of His Creation, an order which demonstrates supernatural intelligence in its design."

1. **Inconclusive Reason <IR>**: 
   - The claim that "we know God exists" is concluded from observing the "perfect order of His Creation." This reason is not conclusive since the existence of order does not necessarily imply a supernatural being. Other explanations, such as natural processes, could account for the perceived order.

2. **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>**:
   - There is an implicit assumption that the conclusion ("God exists") is largely accepted based on the observation ("perfect order of His Creation"), suggesting a consensus without providing a robust argument or evidence.

3. **Ambiguous Language <DEP>**:
   - Phrases like "perfect order" and "supernatural intelligence" are quite ambiguous and open to interpretation. What constitutes "perfect order"? How do we measure "supernatural intelligence"? These terms need clearer definitions to avoid ambiguous reasoning.

Therefore, the identified defective argument types in the statement are:

1. <IR>: Inconclusive Reason
2. <FU>: Presumptuous Consensus
3. <DEP>: Ambiguous Language
