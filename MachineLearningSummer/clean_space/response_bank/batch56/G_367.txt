For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Attributes. Applying IDAA to the given argument:

"Your honor, if we let Pinocchio get away with lying, what's next? Stealing? Murder? ..."

Hereâ€™s an analysis of defective argument attributes present in the statement:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument makes a slippery slope assumption without sufficient evidence to suggest that letting Pinocchio get away with lying will inevitably lead to more severe crimes like stealing and murder. There's no established causal link between lying and committing these future crimes.

2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument assumes an unwarranted progression from lying to stealing to murder, without showing a strong causal connection between these actions. Just because one action is permitted does not necessarily lead to extreme outcomes without additional context or evidence.

3. **Generalization (G)**: There's an overgeneralization in assuming that allowing one instance of lying will lead to a series of more extreme criminal behaviors. It doesn't take into account the complexity and multiple factors that might influence someone's moral and legal decisions.

Therefore, the statement "Your honor, if we let Pinocchio get away with lying, what's next? Stealing? Murder? ..." primarily displays the defective argument types **IR**, **WCB**, and **G**.
