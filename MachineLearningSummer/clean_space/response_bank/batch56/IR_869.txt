For 
<IDAA> refers to an Irrelevant Detail or Argument Association. It highlights that a point being made is not relevant to the main argument or issue at hand, thus creating a diversion or distraction.

In the example provided:

"Sure, we haven't given raises to our employees in more than ten years. However, we do pride ourselves on providing customer service in over seven different languages."

The main issue is the fact that employees haven't been given raises in over a decade. The mention of providing customer service in multiple languages does not address this concern. It is an irrelevant detail meant to distract or shift focus from the original problem.

Therefore, the example employs an <IDAA> (Irrelevant Detail or Argument Association) because it introduces an unrelated point to the discussion about not giving employee raises.
