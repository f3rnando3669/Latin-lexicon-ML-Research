For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Attributes) to the statement "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far," we need to evaluate the argument for the presence of any defective argument types defined previously. Let's dissect the statement in context with our defective arguments:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument makes a broad and sweeping statement about liberals and political correctness being the sole reason for Trump's election. It generalizes the behavior of a diverse group and the effects of political correctness without considering other factors that may have contributed to the election outcome.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement suggests a single reason ("liberals took political correctness too far") as the complete explanation for an event as complex as a political election. It fails to enumerate other possible contributing factors such as economic issues, media influence, campaign strategies, voter demographics, etc.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The argument does not provide conclusive evidence or a well-supported reason that directly links the behavior of liberals regarding political correctness to the election result. The causative correlation is asserted without substantial backing.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Similar to <IR>, the argument presents an insufficient causal basis. It simplistically attributes a wide-ranging societal event to a singular cause without providing a comprehensive causal analysis that would require empirical data and multiple influencing variables.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This fallacy typically involves repeatedly asserting the same proposition as truth without adequate supporting evidence. In this case, it's not clear if the statement has been repeated verbatim, but if the argument about political correctness is frequently put forth in similar terms without substantial evidence, it can fall into this category.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The statement presumes a consensus that "liberals took political correctness too far" was a widespread and recognized reason for Trump's election. Without extensive survey data or research to confirm that this view is held by a significant majority, this presumption is unjustified.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: Terms like "political correctness," "liberals," and "too far" are inherently subjective and can be interpreted in various ways. This ambiguity can lead to misunderstandings and differing interpretations of the argument.

Based on the breakdown above, the statement "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far" exhibits multiple defective argument types. Specifically, it involves:
- Generalization (<G>)
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
- Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)

Thus, the application of <IDAA> reveals several defects in the argument, making it a weak and unsupported assertion.
