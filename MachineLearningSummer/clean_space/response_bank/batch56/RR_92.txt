Let's first contextualize the argument:

**Argument:** "You can't give me a D because I'm an A student!"

This statement seems to make an inference about the current situation based on a prior reputation or status as an "A student". The argument implies that past performance should exempt the speaker from receiving a lower grade, regardless of the present circumstances.

Now, let's apply the defective argument definitions.

1. **Generalization (<G>):** The argument may imply a hasty generalization by assuming that because the speaker has performed well in the past, they must always perform well.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument does not consider any specific reasons or evidence of why the grade might be a D, thus not providing a complete enumeration of the relevant facts.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason given—being an "A student"—does not conclusively support the assertion that they cannot receive a D. Past performance does not necessarily dictate current performance.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The argument fails to establish a causal link between being an "A student" and the current grade. It assumes a continuous performance without establishing a causal relationship between past and current grades.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This is not quite applicable here as the argument isn't just repeating the same proposition without adding supporting information.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This fallacy is not really found in this argument, as it doesn't seem to rest on a presumptuous belief about others' agreement or consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** The term "A student" may be ambiguous, implying consistency without addressing any specific performance issues or criteria at present.

Given these considerations, the argument seems to fit most strongly with **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** and **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**.

**Conclusion:**

Applying <IDAA>:

"The argument 'You can't give me a D because I'm an A student!' demonstrates <FE>, as it incompletely enumerates the reasons for the grade, and <IR>, since being an 'A student' is not a conclusive reason to negate the possibility of receiving a D."

Does that capture the essence of what you were looking for?
