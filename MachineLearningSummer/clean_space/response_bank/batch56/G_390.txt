For 
Applying <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Type and Annotation) to the argument "Three congressional representatives have had affairs. Members of Congress are adulterers.":

This argument can be classified as a <G> (Generalization). Here's the detailed annotation:

**Identification:**
- Argument Type: Generalization <G>

**Annotation:**
- The argument takes the actions of three individuals (congressional representatives) and generalizes it to an entire group (Members of Congress). This is a classic case of an **unwarranted generalization** where a limited number of instances are used to draw a broad and sweeping conclusion about a whole group.

**Examples for illustration:**
- "Three congressional representatives have had affairs" is a specific observation.
- "Members of Congress are adulterers" is a broad generalization based on the specific observation.

This argument is defective because the small sample size does not provide a sufficient basis to generalize about the moral behavior of all members of Congress.
