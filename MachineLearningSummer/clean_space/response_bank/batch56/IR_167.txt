For 
The argument you provided can be categorized using the defective argument types given. Let's analyze it:

"I think that we should reject what Father Jones has to say about the ethical issues of abortion because he is a Catholic priest. After all, Father Jones is required to hold such views."

This argument can be dissected as follows:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - The argument makes a broad generalization that all opinions of Catholic priests on ethical issues should be dismissed solely based on their religious affiliation.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - The argument fails to consider other relevant factors or viewpoints that may contribute to Father Jones's position, instead focusing solely on his religious background.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The reasoning that Father Jones's views should be dismissed because he is required to hold them does not adequately address the merit or validity of the views themselves.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - There is an insufficient causal basis to conclude that Father Jones's views are invalid purely because they align with his religious obligations.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - The argument doesn't necessarily involve repetition of a proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - This term is not directly applicable here since the argument does not seem to involve presuming a consensus without evidence.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - The language in the argument is not particularly ambiguous.

Given this assessment, the most relevant defective argument types that apply to the provided statement are:

- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

So, <IDAA> identifies the argument as:

"I think that we should reject what Father Jones has to say about the ethical issues of abortion because he is a Catholic priest. After all, Father Jones is required to hold such views." can be identified as having defects of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, and <WCB>.
