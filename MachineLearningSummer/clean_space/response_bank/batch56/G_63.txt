To apply the concept of Identifying Defective Arguments and Analyzing Appropriately (IDAA) to the given statement, "This guy in my class with glasses always talks in class so all guys with glasses are talkative," let's break it down and identify the defective argument type.

1. **Identify the Specifics of the Statement**:
   - The statement makes an observation about a specific individual.
   - It then generalizes this observation to a larger group based on a single characteristic (wearing glasses).

2. **Determine the Defective Argument Type**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: This defective argument type involves making a broad statement based on limited evidence. Here, the conclusion about "all guys with glasses" is drawn from the behavior of just one guy in the class.

Given the statement:
   - "This guy in my class with glasses always talks in class so all guys with glasses are talkative."

**Analysis**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: The argument takes the behavior of one individual as evidence to support a sweeping generalization about an entire group. 

This fits the definition of a Generalization, as it extrapolates the characteristic (talkativeness) of a single individual to all individuals who share a single common trait (wearing glasses).

**Appropriate IDAA Label**:
   - The statement should be labeled as <G> for Generalization.

**Conclusion**:
The argument "This guy in my class with glasses always talks in class so all guys with glasses are talkative" is an example of <G>, a Generalization.
