For 
To assess the argument "If my years as a Marine taught me anything, it's that caution is the best policy in this sort of situation." as a defective argument, we will identify any specified defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>) it may represent:

### Analysis:

1. **Generalization <G>**:
   - This type of defective argument involves making a broad claim based on limited evidence.
   - The statement could be seen as a generalization because it uses personal experience as a Marine to assert that caution is universally the best policy. It doesn't consider other factors or professional perspectives in different contexts.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>**:
   - This involves listing only a few instances to conclude something about the whole.
   - The statement does not enumerate different situations where caution might not be the best policy, hence it’s incomplete.

3. **Inconclusive Reason <IR>**:
   - This occurs when the reasoning provided does not conclusively support the conclusion.
   - The statement might fall under this category if being a Marine doesn’t conclusively mean caution is universally the best policy in all situations.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>**:
   - This happens when an arguer asserts a cause without sufficient evidence.
   - The statement implies that Marine experience (cause) leads to the conclusion about caution. However, there is no detailed explanation on why Marine experiences provide sufficient causal basis for this conclusion.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>**:
   - This type of argument repeats a proposition without adding new evidence.
   - The argument does not exhibit faulty repetition as it's making a single claim based on an experience.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>**:
   - This involves assuming consensus without evidence of such agreement.
   - The argument does not necessarily presume consensus; it's rooted in personal experience rather than a claimed shared opinion.

7. **Ambiguous Language <DEP>**:
   - This includes using ambiguous terms that can lead to multiple interpretations.
   - The language used in the argument is straightforward, without ambiguous terms.

### Conclusion:

The primary issue with the given argument seems to be an **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>** and **Generalization <G>**. The statement generalizes based on personal experience and doesn’t consider other varying situations or enumerates instances where caution may not be the best policy.

Hence, applying <IDAA>:
- **Defective Argument Type: Generalization (G)** and **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**.
