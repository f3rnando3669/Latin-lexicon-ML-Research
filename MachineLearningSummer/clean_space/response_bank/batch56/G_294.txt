For 
To apply the defined defective argument types (Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Presumptuous Consensus, and Ambiguous Language) to the statement "No one stops to process... No one appreciates the value," we need to analyze which defective argument best fits this example.

From the provided statement, we can observe that it makes broad, sweeping assertions about people without sufficient evidence or specific examples. This kind of argument often falls under the category of Generalization.

- **Generalization (G)**: This argument type involves making an overgeneral statement based on limited or incomplete evidence.

Therefore, the statement "No one stops to process... No one appreciates the value" can be classified as a **Generalization (G)** because it asserts a universal claim about people's behavior and appreciation without sufficient support or evidence.
