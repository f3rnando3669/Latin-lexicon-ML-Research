For 
<IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Types Applied) in the given scenario:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Jane's conclusion that the potato and full moon ritual caused her wart to disappear lacks a sufficient causal basis. There is no scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of such a remedy. The wart may have naturally resolved on its own or due to other factors not considered in the conclusion.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Jane fails to consider other possible reasons for the disappearance of her wart, such as healing over time, natural body processes, or other treatments she may have used concurrently. By only focusing on the ritual her father told her about, she overlooks a complete list of potential causes.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning behind the ritual's success is inconclusive because the evidence provided (the anecdote from her father) is not sufficient to establish a reliable cause-effect relationship. Anecdotal evidence alone is not enough to draw a solid conclusion.

The application of <IDAA> reveals that the argument in Jane's scenario suffers from multiple defective argument types: **WCB** (Insufficient Causal Basis), **FE** (Incomplete Enumeration), and **IR** (Inconclusive Reason).
