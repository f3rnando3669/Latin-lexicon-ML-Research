For 
In your request, you mention several types of defective arguments and then ask to apply <IDAA> to a specific statement. However, you haven't defined what "IDAA" stands for. Based on the context, it seems you might be asking to identify whether the given statement fits any of the defective argument types provided. I will proceed under the assumption that <IDAA> means "Identify Defective Argument Application."

Let's analyze the statement "Aliens must exist because there is no evidence that they don't exist."

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This does not fit the definition of generalization, which typically involves making a broad statement based on limited observations or evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This refers to an argument that fails to consider all possible scenarios or options. The given statement doesn't list alternatives or scenarios in a manner which would make this fit.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This type applies to arguments where the evidence provided is insufficient to support the conclusion. The statement presented could fit here because the absence of evidence against the existence of aliens does not sufficiently support the conclusion that aliens must exist.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This involves drawing a causal conclusion from insufficient evidence. The given statement does not make a causal claim, so this type does not apply.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This involves repeating a proposition in such a way that the repetition itself is used as the proof. The statement does not repeat itself for validation, so it does not fit this type.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This type involves assuming that something is true because many people believe it to be true. The given statement doesn't reference a consensus or majority opinion, so this type does not apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This applies to arguments that use ambiguous language to confuse or mislead. The language in the statement is clear and direct, so this type does not apply.

Based on this analysis, the given statement "Aliens must exist because there is no evidence that they don't exist" fits the defective argument type **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**.
