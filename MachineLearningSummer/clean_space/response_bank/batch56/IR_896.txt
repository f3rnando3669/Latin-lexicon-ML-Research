For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Assignment. Applying <IDAA> to the statement:

"Her arguments against the protest were weak. After all, she can't be fair; she works for the government."

We need to analyze this statement to identify which defective argument type(s) it represents. In this case:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** This argument makes a broad generalization by implying that anyone who works for the government cannot be fair.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The statement does not address specific arguments made against the protest, just dismisses them based on her being a government employee, failing to consider other reasons she might have presented.

Therefore, applying <IDAA> to this specific argument, we identify at least two defective argument types:

- Generalization (<G>)
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)

Thus, the statement "Her arguments against the protest were weak. After all, she can't be fair; she works for the government." represents a **Generalization (G)** and **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** defective argument.
