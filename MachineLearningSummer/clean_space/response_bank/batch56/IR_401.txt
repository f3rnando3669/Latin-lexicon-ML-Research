**Defective Argument Analysis Application (IDAA):**

Argument: "You can hardly blame President Clinton for having extramarital affairs. Many presidents, when faced with similar situations, have yielded to the same temptations."

1. **Generalization (<G>):** This argument commits the error of generalization by suggesting that because many presidents have had extramarital affairs, it is acceptable or understandable that Clinton did as well. This broad generalization ignores the specifics of individual moral responsibility.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** By stating that "many presidents" have had extramarital affairs without specifying who they are or how many constitute "many," the argument provides an incomplete enumeration. This lack of specificity weakens the overall claim.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The argument relies on the conclusion that because others have done it, it excuses Clinton's behavior. However, this is an inconclusive reason as it does not directly address the ethical issue of Clintonâ€™s actions or provide a solid justification for them.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** There is an implicit suggestion that there is a causal relationship between being a president and engaging in extramarital affairs due to the pressures of the presidency. However, this is insufficiently substantiated and does not justify the behavior.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The argument does not clearly fall under faulty repetition as it does not repeat a proposition ineffectively to bolster its point.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** By suggesting that it is a common occurrence for presidents to engage in such behavior and implying a form of consensus or social acceptance, the argument presumes an agreement that is not necessarily substantiated.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** The phrase "when faced with similar situations" is ambiguous and vague, lacking clear definition of what these situations are, contributing to the overall insufficiency and ambiguity in the argument.

Applying the defect analysis categories, this argument exhibits significant weaknesses that render it ineffective and unconvincing.
