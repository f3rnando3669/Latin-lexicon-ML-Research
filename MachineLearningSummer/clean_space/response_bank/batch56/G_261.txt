For 
In the context of defective arguments, the type of argument you have provided is known as a **fallacy of division**. This fallacy occurs when someone assumes that what is true for the whole must also be true for its parts. 

For example:

- If someone argues, "The university is a renowned institution for research, so every department at the university must be excellent in research," they are committing the fallacy of division.

To categorize this fallacy using the provided defective argument types, none of the defined argument types, like Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), or others, precisely fit the description of the fallacy of division.

However, creating a specific code for this type of defective argument would enhance clarity. Since no predefined code matches, we could introduce <FD> for "Fallacy of Division":

**<FD>: Fallacy of Division.**

Thus, the argument "When someone says that what is true of something as a whole must also be true of each of its parts" applies <FD>.
