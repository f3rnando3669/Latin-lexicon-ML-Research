For 
The defeasible argument type <IDAA>, which stands for Defective Argument Analysis Application, helps identify and categorize faulty reasoning within arguments. Let's break down the argument: "Royal's promoting their team for the next season by telling people to come join the team because everyone else has." 

This statement can be analyzed for defective argument types as follows:

1. <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration): The argument does not provide a complete consideration of why someone should join the team. It only mentions that others are joining, which is not a sufficient reason.

2. <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus): The argument assumes that because others are joining, it must be the correct or best action to take, without offering further justification or evidence that everyone has actually done so for good reasons.

So, when applying <IDAA>:

- The argument commits the fallacy of <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus) by implying that the action is good because others are doing it.
- The argument also reflects <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration) as it does not exhaustively or adequately enumerate the reasons for joining the team.

Therefore, the defective arguments identified within the statement are <FE> and <FU>.
