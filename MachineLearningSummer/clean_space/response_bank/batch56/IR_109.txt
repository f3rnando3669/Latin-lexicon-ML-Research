For 
In the context you've provided, <IDAA> seems to be a shorthand notation for identifying defective or faulty arguments in a given statement. By analyzing the statement "A book argues that global warming is not actually happening, and cites the research of one environmental scientist who has been studying climate change for several years," we can identify defective arguments based on the definitions given:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument relies on the research of just one environmental scientist without addressing the broader consensus or the multitude of studies conducted in the field of climate science. By failing to consider the full range of data and opinions, the argument is incomplete.

2. **Generalization (<G>)**: The book generalizes a broad conclusion about global warming from the research of a single scientist. This form of generalization is defective because it does not account for the broad spectrum of scientific research on the subject.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The citation of one scientist's research is not adequate to definitively prove that global warming is not happening. This singular source does not provide a conclusive reason to deny the phenomenon, especially given the substantial evidence supporting global warming.

Thus, applying <IDAA>:
- <FE>: The argument employs incomplete enumeration by relying on the findings of only one scientist.
- <G>: The argument generalizes the findings of one scientist to the broader phenomena of global warming.
- <IR>: The argument provides an inconclusive reason by basing its conclusion on a limited scope of evidence.
