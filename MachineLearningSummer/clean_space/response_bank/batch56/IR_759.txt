For 
The argument "You use support from someone who is a trustworthy expert" can be classified as an appeal to authority, which is generally considered a valid form of argument when the authority in question is indeed an expert on the topic. Therefore, it would not typically fall under one of the defective argument types defined:

1. Generalization (G)
2. Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
3. Inconclusive Reason (IR)
4. Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
5. Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
6. Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
7. Ambiguous Language (DEP)

Since none of these defective argument types quite fit the context of using an expert's support, we would label it appropriately as a valid appeal to authority when the authority is relevant and credible.

However, if the expert were not relevant or credible, or if the argument relied on the appeal to authority without providing additional evidence or context where necessary, it might then be defective. In that case, potential classifications might include:

- **Generalization (G)** if the argument assumes any expert's opinion is always valid in all contexts without specific focus.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** if it suggests that because one expert agrees, it implies general consensus without substantial backing.

But without additional context to undermine the credibility of the expert or relevance of their expertise, this specific argument defends itself well under valid argumentation practices.
