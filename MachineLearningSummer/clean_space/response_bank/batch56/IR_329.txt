For 
The argument "You are clearly just too young to understand this issue!" can be categorized as an **invalid defective argument type** based on the predefined categories. Here's how:

This argument dismisses someone's viewpoint based solely on their age without addressing the actual content of their argument or providing evidence. It falls under the category of **Ad Hominem** fallacies, where the argument is directed against the person rather than the position they are maintaining. Although there isnâ€™t an **IDAA** (Invalid Defective Argument Analysis) explicitly defined in your list, this statement can be seen to have qualities of **Generalization (G)** since it generalizes the capability to understand an issue based on age without specific evidence.

Therefore, we can state this argument displays Generalization:

- The argument assumes without evidence that age determines the ability to understand the issue, which is a type of <G> (Generalization). However, it also somewhat fits criteria of a more typical ad hominem argument which isn't specifically accounted for in the predefined list.
