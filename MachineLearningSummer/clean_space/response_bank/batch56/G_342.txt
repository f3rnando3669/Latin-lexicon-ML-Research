For 
The given statement "My job interview did not go well. I'll never get a job." can be analyzed for defective arguments as follows:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument is a hasty generalization, taking one specific instance of a job interview not going well and concluding that it will always be the case without sufficient evidence to support such a sweeping statement.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This argument overlooks other possibilities and alternative outcomes. It fails to consider the vast number of potential job opportunities and other factors that can influence job prospects.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasoning here is also inconclusive. Just because one job interview went poorly does not provide sufficient reason to believe that all future job interviews will result in not getting a job.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The statement assumes a causal relationship between the outcome of one job interview and the inability to get any job, which is not supported by enough evidence. One poor interview does not sufficiently cause a lifetime of joblessness.

By applying the defective argument analysis (IDAA):

"My job interview did not go well. **I'll never get a job**."

- **This is primarily a case of <G> (Generalization)**: The conclusion "I'll never get a job" is a generalization based on a single instance of an unsuccessful interview.
- **It also represents <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: It does not take into account other potential job interviews or opportunities.
- **Additionally, it includes <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: The specific event of one bad interview insufficiently supports the broad conclusion about all future job prospects.
- **Lastly, there is an element of <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The statement does not have enough causal basis to link one bad interview to never getting any job.

Thus, the primary defective argument type in this statement is <G>, followed by <FE>, <IR>, and <WCB>.
