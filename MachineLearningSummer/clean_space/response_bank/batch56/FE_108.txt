For 
Applying <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Type(s) and Analyze) to the statement "Either you recycle or you don't care about human life":

1. **Identify Defective Argument Type(s)**:
   - The statement "Either you recycle or you don't care about human life" presents a false dilemma or false dichotomy, which oversimplifies the situation into two extreme positions and ignores other possibilities.

2. **Analyze**:
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This may not fit perfectly here, but if this type of argument is repeatedly applied in similar contexts, it could lead to a faulty repetition.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument assumes only two possible choices – recycling or not caring about human life – without considering other options or the complexity of individuals' motivations and circumstances. This is a form of incomplete enumeration as it fails to exhaustively list all possible scenarios or reasons a person might have regarding recycling.
   
By focusing primarily on the false dichotomy presented, the primary defective argument type is **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**. The statement excludes the possibility that someone might care about human life but not recycle due to various potential reasons, such as lack of access to recycling facilities, different priorities, unawareness, or conflicting beliefs about the effectiveness of recycling.
