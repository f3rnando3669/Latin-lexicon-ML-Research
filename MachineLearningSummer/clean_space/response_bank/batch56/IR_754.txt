Based on your instruction to identify defective argument types, we can analyze the statement, "I saw Ashton Kutcher in a prescription drug commercial, therefore it has to be an effective drug," to determine which type of defective argument applies. Considering the context of this statement, it appears to involve an appeal to celebrity authority without addressing any scientific or empirical evidence regarding the drug's effectiveness.

This statement commits the fallacy of using insufficient or irrelevant authority to infer the effectiveness of the drug. Because Ashton Kutcher's presence in the commercial does not logically support the drugâ€™s effectiveness, the defective argument type applicable here is Inconclusive Reason <IR>.

Thus, the defective argument applied to this statement is:

<IDAA: IR> Inconclusive Reason - "I saw Ashton Kutcher in a prescription drug commercial, therefore it has to be an effective drug."

This labels the argument as defective due to its reliance on inconclusive reasoning.
