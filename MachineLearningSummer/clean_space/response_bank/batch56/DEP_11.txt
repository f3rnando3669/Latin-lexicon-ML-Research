For 
<IDAA>: Incorrect Disambiguation/Analogous Argumentation.

Board Member: “If this company is going to maximize its profits in the coming year, we need to fully exploit all of our available resources.”
Human Resources Director: “Not so fast. Our employees are one of our most valued resources, and we have a strict policy against exploiting our workers.”

Here, the term "exploit" is being used in two different senses. The Board Member is using "exploit" to mean "make full use of" or "take full advantage of." The Human Resources Director, however, interprets "exploit" to mean "unfair utilization" or "taking advantage without proper regard for well-being."

This misalignment in understanding the term leads to the fallacy known as Incorrect Disambiguation/Analogous Argumentation. The inconsistency in the interpretation of "exploit" forms the cornerstone of the defective argument in this exchange.
