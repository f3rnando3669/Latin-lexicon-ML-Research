For 
The fallacy you're describing is commonly known as the **Bandwagon Fallacy** or **Appeal to Popularity**. This fallacy suggests that if the majority believes or does something, then it must be valid, accurate, or effective. Using the defective argument types defined previously, you could categorize this fallacy under:

**<FU>: Presumptuous Consensus**

**Explanation:**
The argument presumes that a consensus implies validity or correctness without providing sufficient evidence or reasoning to support the claim. It relies on the notion that popularity equates to truth, which is a flawed assumption.

In this way, you have applied **<IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Application)** to determine that the described fallacy falls under **<FU>: Presumptuous Consensus**.
