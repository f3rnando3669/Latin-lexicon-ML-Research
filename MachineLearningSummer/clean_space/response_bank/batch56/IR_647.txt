For 
The argument "The CEO of that company hates the environment, so I hate him and wonâ€™t buy their products." can be categorized under several defective argument types. Here's an analysis:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument does not consider all possible reasons why one might decide to buy or not buy products from the company. It focuses solely on the CEO's attitude towards the environment without considering other factors that could be relevant.

2. **Generalization (G):** The argument assumes that the CEO's attitude towards the environment is sufficient to make a judgment about the company's overall products and practices, which may not necessarily be true. The company might still have environmentally friendly products or policies despite the CEO's personal views.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reasoning given (hatred for the CEO) does not logically lead to the conclusion that one should not buy the products. The CEO's personal beliefs do not necessarily have a direct impact on the quality or environmental impact of the products themselves.

By these analyses, we find that the argument could be classified mainly under **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** and **Generalization (G)** due to its failure to consider other relevant factors and its broad assumptions.

Therefore, applying the defective argument identifiers, the given statement can be classified under <FE> and <G>.
