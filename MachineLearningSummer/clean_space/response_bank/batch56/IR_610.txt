For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Attributes.

Here's the analysis of the conversation using <IDAA>:
 
---

**Mother**: You should stop smoking. It's harmful to your health.

**Daughter**: Why should I listen to you? You started smoking when you were 16!

**Analysis**:

1. **Mother's Argument**: 
   - **Claim**: The daughter should stop smoking.
   - **Reason**: Smoking is harmful to health.

2. **Daughter's Response**:
   - **Claim**: The mother's advice should be disregarded.
   - **Reason**: The mother is not credible because she started smoking at 16.

The daughter's response commits several defective argument types:

- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The daughter's response does not directly address the mother's claim that smoking is harmful. Instead, it shifts focus to the mother's past behavior without providing evidence that smoking is not harmful.

- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**: The daughter might be implying that because the mother smoked at a young age, her advice is hypocritical or invalid. This does not directly refute the health risks associated with smoking, which is the central point of the mother's argument.

- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: The daughter presumes that because the mother smoked at 16, her argument about the health risks of smoking is invalid. This assumes a consensus that someone's past behavior invalidates their present advice, which is not necessarily true.

Identifying the defective argument attributes in the daughter's response helps highlight the flaws and improve the focus on the actual discussion about the health risks of smoking.
