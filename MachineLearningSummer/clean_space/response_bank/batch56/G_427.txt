For 
To apply the method <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Analyzing Approach) to the statement "If you don’t expose your child to germs, he will never get sick. Therefore, he will never build up his immune system to fight illness. He will grow up to be a sickly adult," we need to dissect the argument for any potential defective reasoning. Let's break it down:

1. **Identification of Argument Parts:**
   - Premise 1: "If you don’t expose your child to germs, he will never get sick."
   - Premise 2: "He will never build up his immune system to fight illness."
   - Conclusion: "He will grow up to be a sickly adult."

2. **Analysis of the Defective Arguments:**
   - **Generalization (G):** There's an assumption that failure to expose a child to germs will always prevent illness and that this will always result in a weak immune system. This is a broad generalization that may not account for the complexity of immune system development.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument does not consider other factors that contribute to the immune system development such as vaccinations, genetics, nutrition, etc. It only enumerates germ exposure.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The argument assumes a direct causal relationship between not getting sick as a child and being a sickly adult without sufficient evidence or consideration of other factors that influence health.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** There is an implied causation between lack of germ exposure and poor adult health that is not fully substantiated. The causal relationship isn't robustly supported by evidence.
   - **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The term "grow up to be a sickly adult" is vague. What constitutes "sickly" is not defined; it could mean different things to different people.

Given these observations, we find that the argument contains elements of:

- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**

Therefore, this argument suffers from multiple defects as per the specified defective argument types.
