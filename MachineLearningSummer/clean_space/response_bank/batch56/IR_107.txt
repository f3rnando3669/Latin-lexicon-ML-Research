For 
<IDAA>: When dissecting the argument provided, "Leonardo DiCaprio is just a dumb actor. What does he really know about climate change?", we can identify the following defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument falls into the category of generalization because it assumes that since Leonardo DiCaprio is an actor, he must be "dumb" and therefore incapable of knowing anything substantive about climate change. This generalizes the abilities or intelligence of actors as a whole.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The argument is also an example of an inconclusive reason, as it does not provide any evidence related to Leonardo DiCaprio's knowledge or expertise in climate change, other than stating his profession. This does not conclusively undermine his ability to comment on the topic.

3. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The statement presumes that agreeing with the notion that an actor cannot have valid opinions on climate change is a widely accepted consensus without providing any supporting evidence or justification.

In summary, the argument has issues of Generalization, Inconclusive Reason, and Presumptuous Consensus, making it a defective line of reasoning.
