For 
The argument provided is: "This is how most schools evaluate their students, so it must be effective."

When examining this argument for defective argument types, we can apply the definitions of the faulty arguments you've provided. 

- Generalization (G) refers to making broad generalizations from specific instances.
- Incomplete Enumeration (FE) suggests that an argument is based on an incomplete list of instances.
- Inconclusive Reason (IR) relates to reasoning that does not conclusively support the conclusion.
- Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB) revolves around insufficient evidence to establish a causal relationship.
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR) describes the repetition of a proposition without additional supporting arguments.
- Presumptuous Consensus (FU) implies assuming that consensus automatically implies correctness.
- Ambiguous Language (DEP) involves using unclear or vague language.

In this case, the statement "This is how most schools evaluate their students, so it must be effective" can be analyzed as follows:

1. The speaker is assuming that because most schools use a specific method to evaluate students, the method must be effective. This assumption is based on the idea that a majority's practice implies correctness.
   
2. There is no deeper reasoning or evidence provided to support that the method is indeed effective, beyond its widespread use.

Given these elements, the defective argument type that applies most directly is Presumptuous Consensus (FU). The argument makes an unwarranted assumption that consensus (most schools doing it this way) equates to effectiveness without providing further evidence.
