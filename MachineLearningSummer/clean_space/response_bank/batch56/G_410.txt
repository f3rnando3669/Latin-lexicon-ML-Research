For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argumentation and Analyzing its Application. To apply this to the statement "Using the Second Amendment as justification to allow civilians to own nuclear submarines," we should determine which defective argument types (defined above) apply to this reasoning. 

Let's break it down:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The Second Amendment concerns the right to keep and bear arms, which traditionally refers to personal firearms. Extending this to include nuclear submarines is a broad and inappropriate generalization. 
   - Application: Yes, this argument can be seen as an overgeneralization of the Second Amendment's intent.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The argument presents the Second Amendment as the sole basis for allowing the ownership of nuclear submarines without considering other legal, ethical, or practical perspectives.
   - Application: Yes, it could be seen as incomplete because it does not account for additional crucial factors.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The Second Amendment does not specify or imply that "arms" include extremely large and complex weapons systems like nuclear submarines. The basis of this argument is weak and unconvincing.
   - Application: Yes, the reasoning used is inconclusive as it misinterprets the scope of the Second Amendment.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - There is no clear, sufficient causal connection between the Second Amendment and the need or justification for owning nuclear submarines. Armament intended for personal defense is qualitatively different from sophisticated military technology.
   - Application: Yes, there is an insufficient causal basis to link personal firearm rights to nuclear submarines.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - This type doesn’t seem to directly apply unless the argument continually repeats the unjustified link between the Second Amendment and ownership of nuclear submarines without any new justification.
   - Application: Not specifically applicable without more context of repetitive claims.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - The statement does not claim a consensus and thus doesn’t imply that many people agree with the interpretation of the Second Amendment as justifying the ownership of nuclear submarines.
   - Application: Not applicable as there is no appeal to an alleged consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - While the term "arms" in the Second Amendment could be considered ambiguous, the context and historical understanding make it clear it was intended to refer to personal firearms, not to extensive military assets.
   - Application: Yes, there is potential ambiguity in the interpretation of "arms," but historical context should clarify it isn't intended to cover nuclear submarines.

Therefore, the defective argument types that apply to this reasoning are **Generalization (<G>)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**, **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**, and **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**.
