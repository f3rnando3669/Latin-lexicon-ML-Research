For 
Defective Arguments Analysis Applied (<IDAA>):

Argument: "So many people are speaking up about animal rights, but what they should first focus on is human rights."

1. **Identify the Argument:**
   - The core argument here is that people who are advocating for animal rights should instead be focusing on human rights.

2. **Determine if the Argument is Defective:**
   - To determine if this argument is defective, we will apply the predefined defective argument types.

3. **Attribute the Defective Argument Type(s):**
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The argument assumes that the need to focus on human rights negates the effort to advocate for animal rights without providing a reason why both cannot be pursued simultaneously.
   - **False Dichotomy (Potential Additional Defective Argument):** The argument falsely presents a choice between advocating for human rights and animal rights, suggesting that prioritizing one necessarily means neglecting the other.

4. **Analyze and Conclude:**
   - The argument "So many people are speaking up about animal rights, but what they should first focus on is human rights" is an inconclusive reason (<IR>) because it lacks sufficient evidence to prove that advocating for animal rights means neglecting human rights. It also presents a false dichotomy, assuming that one cannot pursue both causes simultaneously.

By applying <IDAA>, we have identified the defect in the argument, making it clear why the reasoning presented is not sufficient.
