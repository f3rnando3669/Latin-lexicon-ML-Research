For 
The argument you provided can indeed be scrutinized for defects using the given types of defective arguments. Here, the argument states: "The ideas from that member of the club are wrong, but he isn’t actually a true member of the club so his ideas do not matter."

Let's apply <IDAA> or Identify Defective Argument Application:

1. **Faulty Premise**: The initial premise attacks the person’s membership status rather than directly addressing the ideas. This suggests a potential **ad hominem** fallacy, but not necessarily by the types defined here unless one fits indirectly.

2. **Generalization (<G>)**: This doesn't qualify as a generalization because it attacks a specific individual rather than generalizing a broader group.

3. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This argument doesn’t list examples to support its conclusion.

4. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasoning is inconclusive because it dismisses the ideas based on the person's membership, which isn't logically relevant to the validity of his ideas. However, by the defined types, this might not fit 'Inconclusive Reason' directly.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reasoning inadequately supports its conclusion, which is more about causality, but we could stretch this to see it fits as it doesn’t causally relate the membership with the ideological correctness.

6. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This does not repeat the proposition in an invalid attempt to support it.

7. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument doesn’t assume false consensus validity.

8. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: There is ambiguity in the status of true vs. not a true member but isn’t the core flaw here.

Based on these evaluations, the identified classification would closely match is:
**Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, because it dismisses the ideas based on unrelated personal qualifications, presenting an irrelevant and inconclusive connection overall. Though <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) might have a minor stake, <IR> is a more accurate representation here for critical assessment.
