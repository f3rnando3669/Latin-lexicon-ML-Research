For 
To analyze the argument under the label <IDAA> based on the defective argument types defined, let's break down the given statement:

"Some people say that the coronavirus is dangerous. Others say that it is not dangerous. That must mean that some coronavirus vaccinations are fine while others are not."

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument type involves drawing a broad conclusion based on insufficient or limited evidence. However, this argument doesn't directly generalize; it rather pivots from opinions about the virus to conclusions about vaccinations, making this type not a perfect fit.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This is when an argument lists some possibilities or evidence but does not acknowledge all relevant factors. The given argument does mention different opinions (that the virus is dangerous and not dangerous) but does not enumerate or evaluate the full spectrum of evidence for each side. This type makes sense here because the argument fails to consider all evidence regarding the effectiveness of vaccinations based on the mixed opinions about the virus.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This type involves reasoning that does not sufficiently support the conclusion. The argument here jumps from people's opinions about the virus to a conclusion about vaccines without a logical link. This is a fit as the given reasons do not conclusively lead to the conclusion about vaccines.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This involves asserting a causal relationship without enough evidence. While the argument implies a relationship between opinions on the virus and the quality of vaccines, it doesnâ€™t quite assert causality directly, so this type is not an exact match.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This entails reiterating a proposition without furnishing new supportive evidence. The argument does not seem to simply repeat a proposition but makes a leap in reasoning.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This is when a consensus is presumed without adequate evidence. The argument implicitly assumes a consensus (some people think X and others think not-X) and draws a conclusion based on this presumed balance, which resembles this type.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This involves using terms that are vague or have multiple meanings. The argument uses "fine" and "dangerous" without clear specifications or definitions, which fits this defective argument type as well.

Based on the analysis, the defective argument types that best apply to "Some people say that the coronavirus is dangerous. Others say that it is not dangerous. That must mean that some coronavirus vaccinations are fine while others are not." are:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**

This argument jumps to conclusions without considering all relevant information, lacks a logical basis for its conclusion, assumes a consensus misleadingly, and employs vague terms.
