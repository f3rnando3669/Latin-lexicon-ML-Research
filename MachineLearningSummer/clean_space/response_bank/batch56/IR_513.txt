To analyze the argument "Don't make me angry; you won't like me when I'm angry." using the defined defective argument types, let us break it down:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This occurs when a conclusion is drawn about a whole group based on an insufficient sample. In this case, the statement isn't generalizing about a group based on a sample, so it doesn't fit Generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This problem arises from not considering all possible options or outcomes. The statement doesn't seem to suggest multiple outcomes were considered or overlooked, so it doesn't fit Incomplete Enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This occurs when the reason given does not conclusively lead to the conclusion. The premise here ("Don't make me angry") is tied directly to a personal outcome ("you won't like me when I'm angry"), so the statement is attempting to make a direct causal link. However, the reason behind why being angry would cause such a disliking is not elaborated upon, which can be seen as inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This happens when the causal link between the premise and conclusion is not adequately justified. The statement implies that the anger of the speaker has a direct and unavoidable negative consequence, but it doesn't provide sufficient causal justification for why being angry makes the speaker unlikeable. It operates on a presumption that anger equates to behaving in an unlikable manner, without evidence or explanation.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This involves repeating a statement or proposition without providing additional evidence. The statement does not contain a repetition of the initial proposition, so it doesn't fit this category.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This fallacy occurs when it is assumed that something is true because many people believe it to be so. The statement does not assume any consensus on the reaction to the speaker's anger, so this does not apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This involves using language that can be interpreted in multiple ways. In this statement, "angry" could potentially be ambiguous depending on what the speaker means by it (e.g., verbally aggressive, physically threatening). However, this ambiguity does not appear central to the argument's defectiveness.

Based on the above analysis, two primary defective argument types can be applied:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: There is no sufficient explanation or reason provided for why one would not like the speaker when they are angry.

2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument does not give enough causal justification for why making the speaker angry will result in a situation where the listener won't like them. It simply assumes a direct correlation without evidence.

Thus, applying defective argument analysis, we could label the statement as defective due to **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
