Sure, let's analyze the statement "McDonald's Hamburgers, over 99 billion served" in the context of the defined defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument may suggest that because McDonald's has served over 99 billion hamburgers, their hamburgers must be of high quality. This could be seen as a generalization, as it assumes quality based on quantity.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The claim could imply that all hamburgers served by McDonald's are good or popular without providing complete evidence of every customer's satisfaction. It overlooks the possibility that not all experiences were positive.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The statement "over 99 billion served" does not necessarily provide a reason why McDonald's hamburgers are good or popular. Itâ€™s a fact about quantity but doesn't address quality, taste, or satisfaction directly.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is no clear causal link presented in the statement between serving 99 billion hamburgers and any specific attribute such as taste or quality.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This statement does not repeatedly present the same proposition, so it does not apply here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: By stating "over 99 billion served," it may imply that everyone else is eating it, so you should too, which assumes a consensus without actual evidence of a general consensus on quality.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The phrase "99 billion served" is a clear and specific number, and doesn't exhibit ambiguous language. However, it remains vague on what this number signifies in terms of quality or satisfaction.

Given the defective argument types defined, we can apply <IDAA> (Identification and Description of Argument Aberrations) to state:

"McDonald's Hamburgers, over 99 billion served" is potentially defective due to:
- **Generalization (G)**: It generalizes positive qualities about McDonald's hamburgers based on the large number served.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: It incompletely enumerates consumer experiences, implying satisfaction or quality without comprehensive evidence.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: It provides an inconclusive reason by associating high sales with positive attributes without supporting evidence.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is an insufficient causal basis to draw conclusions about quality from the quantity served.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: It implies a presumptuous consensus by suggesting widespread consumption equates to universal approval.
