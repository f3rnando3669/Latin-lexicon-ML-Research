For 
<IDAA> stands for Identify and Define Argumentative Anomalies. Let's analyze the given statement "President Clinton being a moral man, being married and loving his daughter; talking about the Bible; going to church" for any defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: There's an implicit broad assumption being made here that behaviors such as being married, loving one's daughter, talking about the Bible, and going to church inherently make someone a moral person. This is an overgeneralization because these actions alone are insufficient to comprehensively define someone's morality.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument lists specific actions (being married, loving his daughter, talking about the Bible, going to church) as evidence of morality but does not consider other relevant actions that could contribute to or detract from a moral assessment. It presents an incomplete enumeration of factors relevant to judging Clinton's morality.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasons provided (marriage, love for daughter, religious activities) do not conclusively establish Clinton's morality. These factors might be necessary but not sufficient on their own to definitively conclude his overall moral character.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There's an implied causation that doing activities such as going to church and talking about the Bible causes one to be moral. However, this is insufficient as causality is not firmly established; others who engage in these activities may not necessarily be moral.

5. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: By mentioning these specific actions, the argument presumes that there is a consensus that these actions are indicators of moral behavior. However, this consensus might not actually exist or might be contended.

6. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Phrases like “being a moral man” can be somewhat ambiguous as morality is a subjective measure and might mean different things to different people. Similarly, actions like “talking about the Bible” or “going to church” can be ambiguously interpreted in terms of their significance to morality.

After identifying and analyzing these defective argument types, it is clear that the statement relies on multiple argumentative anomalies to assert President Clinton’s morality without robust, conclusive evidence.
