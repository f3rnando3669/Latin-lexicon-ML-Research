For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Aspects) to the argument "The presence of police at protests cause an escalation of violence. It was the case that at the protest last night attended by uniformed police, there was an escalation of violence. Therefore, police should not be at protests," we can evaluate the argument according to the defective argument types defined:

1. **Generalization** (<G>):
   - The argument takes one specific instance (last night's protest) and generalizes it to all protests. This is a classic form of a generalization fallacy, where a conclusion about all members of a group is drawn from a sample that is not necessarily representative.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration** (<FE>):
   - The argument does not consider all possible factors or scenarios. It assumes that the presence of police is the only cause of escalation of violence, without acknowledging other potential causes or contexts in which police presence might not lead to violence.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason** (<IR>):
   - The argument presents a cause (police presence) and effect (escalation of violence) based on limited evidence from a single event, which is not enough to conclusively establish a broad causal relationship applicable to all protests.
   
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis** (<WCB>):
   - The argument assumes a direct causal relationship between police presence and escalation of violence without sufficient evidence or exploration of other relevant factors that could contribute to the escalation.
   
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition** (<RR>):
   - This does not seem to be applicable here as the argument does not hinge on repeating the same proposition for emphasis or validity.
   
6. **Presumptuous Consensus** (<FU>):
   - The argument does not explicitly rely on a presumed consensus; rather, it makes a causal claim based on an anecdotal event.
   
7. **Ambiguous Language** (<DEP>):
   - The argument does not necessarily suffer from ambiguous language. The terms used are quite clear in conveying the intended cause-and-effect relationship, even if the reasoning is flawed.

Given the above evaluation, the argument primarily falls into the defective argument types of **Generalization** (<G>), **Incomplete Enumeration** (<FE>), **Inconclusive Reason** (<IR>), and **Insufficient Causal Basis** (<WCB>).

### Summary of the Defective Argument Aspects Identified:
1. **Generalization** (<G>): The argument generalizes one instance to all protests.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration** (<FE>): It fails to consider other factors and scenarios affecting protest violence.
3. **Inconclusive Reason** (<IR>): The presented evidence is insufficient to conclusively prove the causal relationship.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis** (<WCB>): There is not enough evidence to support the claimed causal relationship comprehensively.

These defects highlight the need for a more rigorous analysis and broader evidence base to substantiate the conclusion that police should not be present at protests.
