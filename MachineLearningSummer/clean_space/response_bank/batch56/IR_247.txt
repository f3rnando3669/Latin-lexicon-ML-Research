For 
The argument Lily provided ("the sun is fully risen at 5:00am") is being critiqued with a form of reasoning that questions her credibility due to her sleeping habits. This can be seen as an Ad Hominem attack, specifically targeting Lily's knowledge based on her personal habits rather than addressing the actual claim about the sun rising.

Here's the breakdown:

<Lily says the sun is fully risen at 5:00am, but how would she know she sleeps in until noon.>

**Ad Hominem** is a type of defective reasoning where the argument attacks the person making the statement rather than addressing the statement itself. In this case, questioning Lily's knowledge due to her sleep pattern is an indirect way of dismissing her claim without engaging with the actual astronomical fact she is asserting.

Here's how it fits:

- **Lily's Proposition**: The sun is fully risen at 5:00am.
- **Counter-Argument**: Lily's claim is questionable because she sleeps in until noon (suggesting she cannot know when the sun rises).

Therefore, applying *<IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Application)* would highlight the following:

1. The counter-argument is irrelevant to the truth of the statement about the sun rising at 5:00am.
2. It does not actually disprove or address Lily's factual claim but rather attacks her personal habits.

Thus, in summary, the critique falls under an *Ad Hominem* category due to its focus on Lily's personal habit (sleeping until noon) rather than the actual point she is making.
