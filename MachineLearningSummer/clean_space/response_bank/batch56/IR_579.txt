In analyzing the given argument, we can break it down into its components and apply the defective argument types to evaluate its flaws:

### Argument Breakdown
1. Premise: Many people criticize Thomas Jefferson for being an owner of slaves.
2. Counter-premise: Jefferson was one of our greatest presidents.
3. Counter-premise: His Declaration of Independence is one of the most eloquent pleas for freedom and democracy ever written.
4. Conclusion: Clearly these criticisms are unwarranted.

### Identification of Defective Argument Types <IDAA>
**<IR> Inconclusive Reason:**
The argument presents Jefferson's achievements and the eloquence of the Declaration of Independence as reasons to dismiss criticisms of his slave ownership. However, these reasons are inconclusive because they do not directly address the moral issue raised by the criticism. The commendable nature of his achievements does not negate or justify the fact of his slave ownership. This makes the argument logically flawed by trying to sidestep the core issue.

**<DEP> Ambiguous Language:**
The term "greatest presidents" can be seen as ambiguous because it amalgamates various attributes (political, moral, intellectual) without clearly addressing the moral criticism being discussed. Using such a term allows the argument to obscure the specific moral failing that is being criticized.

Given these points, the most prominent defective argument types in this case are **<IR> Inconclusive Reason** and **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**. The counter-premises presented do not conclusively address the specific ethical criticism and use ambiguous terms to divert the argument from the core issue.
