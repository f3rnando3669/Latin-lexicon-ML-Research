For 
The acronym <IDAA> in this context might denote a type of defective argument, for instance, "Invalid Delegated Authority Appeal." Using this faulty argument type, we can define:

<**IDAA**> (Invalid Delegated Authority Appeal): This type of defective argument occurs when an argument refers to the opinion or statement of an authority that lacks relevant expertise or credentials concerning the subject at hand, in attempt to bolster the argument's validity.

Applying <IDAA> to "Appeals to an authority that has little to nothing to do with the argument":

When someone uses an Invalid Delegated Authority Appeal (IDAA), they attempt to support their argument by citing an authority figure who does not have the necessary expertise or background related to the topic. For example, using a famous actor's opinion on complex medical issues to argue about healthcare policies would be an <<IDAA>>, because the actor, despite their fame, lacks relevant medical or policy-making credentials.
