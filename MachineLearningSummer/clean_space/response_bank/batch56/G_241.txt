For 
<IDAA> appears not to be defined in the context you provided. However, based on the existing definitions of defective arguments, it's possible that <IDAA> stands for a specific type of defective argument that you might want to define. Without the precise definition of <IDAA>, it's challenging to apply it correctly.

For the statement "If you're going to add that much salt to the soup, you might as well pour the whole box in!", we can consider it in the context of the defined defective arguments:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument might be an example of overgeneralization because it suggests that adding a significant amount of salt inherently leads to the extreme conclusion of adding the entire box, without sufficient evidence that this smaller step necessarily leads to the extreme.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This argument doesn't fall under Incomplete Enumeration, as it is not listing examples or possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning given is somewhat hyperbolic and might be considered inconclusive if the amount of salt being added is not specified or justified as leading to the extreme outcome presented.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: It might have an insufficient causal basis if the argument implies causation (adding some salt causes the addition of the entire box) without clear evidence for this causal link.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The statement doesnâ€™t repeat propositions, so this doesn't fit here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This argument does not rely on assumed consensus, so this type of defect doesn't apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: There is a form of exaggeration but not necessarily ambiguity, so this defect is not fitting either.

If trying to associate this argument more specifically with <IDAA> is required, you would need to define what <IDAA> stands for. In its absence, the closest fitting defective argument type based on the provided definitions is **Generalization (G)** due to the exaggeration from adding some salt to adding the whole box.
