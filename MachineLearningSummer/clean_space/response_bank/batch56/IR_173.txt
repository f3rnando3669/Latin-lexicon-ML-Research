The text "You want me to clean my locker? I think I left my homework in Science class. I need to keep up with my homework to get good grades." can be broken down and analyzed for defective arguments as follows:

1. **Redirection (Inconclusive Reason <IR>)**: The speaker diverts the focus from the request to clean the locker by introducing the topic of forgetting homework in Science class. This doesn't address the original request, making it an inconclusive reason.

   - "You want me to clean my locker? I think I left my homework in Science class."

2. **Valid Argument**: The speaker presents a valid reason for maintaining focus on their homework to achieve good grades. This is not a defective argument, as it logically follows that one needs to keep up with their homework to get good grades.

   - "I need to keep up with my homework to get good grades."

However, since the conclusion about needing to keep up with homework doesn't directly address the initial request to clean the locker, it feels incomplete and unresolving in the context of the original query.

Thus, the argument primarily uses **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** to redirect focus from the original topic.
