For 
<IDAA> appears to be a label for identifying and diagnosing argumentative defects. In applying <IDAA> to the given argument, we can break down and analyze it to identify any defective argument types that might be present.

Argument: "If I don't get this 5-point assignment done then I will fall behind in my grade and will get backed up so I can't get my other assignment done. Then I will fail the class and turn to a life of crime."

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - This argument could involve a generalization because it takes a single instance (not completing a 5-point assignment) and extrapolates it to a very broad and severe consequence (turning to a life of crime).
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The argument does not consider other possible outcomes or factors that could affect one's grade and subsequent life choices, such as extra credit opportunities, assistance from teachers, or personal resilience. It's an incomplete enumeration of potential consequences.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The reasoning that not completing one small assignment will directly lead to failing the class and then to a life of crime is inconclusive. There are many steps and variables that are not addressed or accounted for.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - This argument also shows insufficient causal basis because there is no clear or strong causal relationship established between not completing a single assignment and the extreme outcome of resorting to a life of crime. The causal links are speculative at best.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - There is no clear repetition of a proposition in this specific argument, so <RR> does not apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - This argument does not rely on a consensus, presumed or otherwise, so <FU> does not apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - The language used in the argument is quite straightforward and does not contain ambiguity, so <DEP> does not apply either.

Therefore, the defective argument types identified in this example are:

- Generalization (<G>)
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
