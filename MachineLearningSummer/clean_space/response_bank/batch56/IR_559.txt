For 
To apply an "Identifying Defective Argument Analysis" (IDAA) to the statement "The car was built with cheap parts, so it only goes to show that the car will fall apart," let's identify if this argument fits any of the defective argument types defined.

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - Generalization occurs when a conclusion is drawn from insufficient or non-representative evidence.
   - The statement does not seem to generalize beyond the specific instance of the car in question.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - Incomplete Enumeration happens when only some possibilities are considered without considering others.
   - The statement does not enumerate incomplete possibilities; it makes a causal assertion.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - Inconclusive Reason refers to an argument where the reasons given do not sufficiently support the conclusion.
   - This type might apply here if the reasons (cheap parts) are not sufficient to conclude that the car will certainly fall apart.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - Insufficient Causal Basis occurs when a cause is claimed to result in an effect without sufficient evidence for the causal relationship.
   - This argument fits well into this category because while cheap parts might imply a higher risk of failure, it is not sufficiently proven that it will inevitably fall apart solely on this basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition involves repeating a proposition without additional evidence.
   - The argument in question is not repeating the proposition but rather concluding something based on a premise.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - Presumptuous Consensus involves assuming that something is true because many people believe it to be true. 
   - The statement does not rely on the consensus of others.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - Ambiguous Language involves using vague or ambiguous terms that could mislead the argument.
   - This statement is quite clear in its wording and does not seem to be using ambiguous language.

Given the analyses above, the defective argument type that seems most applicable to the given statement is:

**Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

The argument is asserting that because the car was built with cheap parts, it will fall apart, without sufficiently demonstrating that cheap parts necessarily or certainly lead to the car falling apart. Therefore, it's relying on an insufficient causal basis to make the conclusion.
