Certainly! Let's assess the argument: "We cannot support immigrants because we have too many homeless and poor Americans."

To apply the defined defective argument types, we first need to break down and understand the given statement. Here's a breakdown of potential defective argument types present in the statement:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This type of argument makes broad statements based on limited evidence. The statement "We cannot support immigrants" based on the condition of having "too many homeless and poor Americans" may be seen as a generalization. It assumes that supporting immigrants will inherently worsen the situation for homeless and poor Americans without presenting specific evidence or considering other potential benefits of immigration.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This type involves making a conclusion based on an incomplete list of possibilities. The argument does not consider other factors or options, such as effective policies that could simultaneously assist both immigrants and homeless or poor Americans. It presents a binary problem without addressing complexities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This defective argument arises when the reasoning provided is not sufficient to conclusively support the claim. The presence of homeless and poor Americans does not logically preclude the ability to support immigrants, as these are multifaceted issues that require consideration of various resources and policies.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This type of argument assumes causation without sufficient evidence. The statement presumes that supporting immigrants will directly take resources away from homeless and poor Americans without proof of this causation. There isn't sufficient causal analysis to establish a direct link between supporting immigrants and neglecting the needs of existing disadvantaged citizens.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The argument does not fall under this category, as it does not repetitively assert the same proposition without new evidence.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This type involves assuming that a viewpoint is widely accepted without confirmation. The statement does not explicitly appeal to a consensus, so this may not directly apply here.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The argument uses terms like "support" and "too many," which can be considered ambiguous. "Support" can encompass various forms of aid or policy support, and "too many" is subjective and not quantified, leading to potential ambiguity in understanding the context and extent of the issue.

Therefore, the argument: "We cannot support immigrants because we have too many homeless and poor Americans" appears to primarily involve the following defective arguments:

- **Generalization (<G>)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**

By examining the statement through these lenses, we can identify its potential weaknesses and highlight the importance of more detailed and evidence-based reasoning when discussing complex social issues.
