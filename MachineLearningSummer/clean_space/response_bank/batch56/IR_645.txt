Certainly! Let's analyze the argument in your statement for potential defective argument types.

The statement provided is: 
"Despite the fact that our Q4 numbers are much lower than usual, we should push forward using the same strategy because our CEO Barbara says this is the best approach."

1. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The argument relies heavily on the authority of the CEO (Barbara) without providing additional evidence or analysis that supports why the same strategy would be effective despite lower Q4 numbers.

2. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The statement essentially repeats the notion that the strategy is best without providing new reasoning or evidence. It relies on the CEO's assertion as a reinforcement of the proposition without new substance.

By applying IDAA (Identify Defective Argument Types Applied):

**1. Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reasoning given—Barbara's authority—is not sufficiently conclusive to justify the strategy. It lacks a rationale that connects the lower Q4 numbers to the asserted effectiveness of continuing the same strategy.

**2. Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The statement echoes the logic that the strategy should continue because it is said to be the best by the CEO, effectively repeating the proposition without introducing new supportive evidence.

So, the applied IDAA identifies <IR> and <RR> in the given argument.
