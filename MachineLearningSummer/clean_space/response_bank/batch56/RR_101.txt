You've asked about identifying and classifying defective arguments and then requested to apply the definition of a specific argument type (IDAA) to a given statement. However, you haven't defined what "IDAA" means in your context.

Assuming "IDAA" is intended to identify a specific kind of defective argument from the ones provided (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>), here's a breakdown of the rationale behind each classification to understand which might apply to the statement:

- **<G> Generalization:** Making a broad generalization based on a small sample size or insufficient evidence.
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:** Presenting an incomplete list of possibilities and claiming it as all-inclusive.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** Presenting a reason that doesn't sufficiently justify the conclusion.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** Asserting a causal relationship without sufficient evidence.
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** Repeating a statement in an attempt to prove it without providing any additional evidence.
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** Assuming that something is true because many people believe it or agree on it.
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language:** Using language that is unclear or has multiple interpretations.

Now, let's analyze the statement:

“You can’t give me a C. I’m an A student!”

This statement implies that because the speaker identifies themselves as an "A student" (suggesting a consistent pattern of receiving A grades or viewing oneself as deserving of an A), they should not be given a C on a particular assignment or course. This argument is flawed for the following reasons:

1. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** The reasoning is inconclusive because being generally an "A student" does not inherently justify receiving an A on every single assignment. Factors specific to this particular assignment or the performance on it are not addressed.
2. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** The student may assume their identity as an "A student" should causally lead to receiving an A in every situation, but that isn't supported with sufficient evidence about the assignment in question.

The most appropriate classification seems to be **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**. This is because the student's status as an "A student" does not logically or necessarily justify the conclusion that they should receive an A on this specific assignment. There is a missing link between the reason ("I'm an A student") and the conclusion ("You can't give me a C").

Therefore, applying **<IR> Inconclusive Reason** to the provided statement would be the most accurate classification.
