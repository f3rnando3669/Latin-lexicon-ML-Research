Given the definitions of defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, and <DEP>, let's analyze the argument in the statement:

"The picture on Jim's old TV set goes out of focus. Jim goes over and strikes the TV soundly on the side and the picture goes back into focus. Jim tells his friend that hitting the TV fixed it."

We need to identify which type of defective argument (if any) is present in Jim's reasoning that hitting the TV fixed the picture.

**Argument Analysis:**
Jim observes that the TV picture goes out of focus, he hits the TV, and then the picture goes back into focus. He concludes that hitting the TV fixed the problem.

This is a classic example of attributing causality based on a sequence of events, rather than established evidence that one action directly caused the other. This is:

**Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** 
- Jim assumes that his action of hitting the TV caused the picture to come back into focus. However, he does not provide sufficient evidence that this action was indeed the reason for the fix. This could have been coincidental or an entirely unrelated factor might be responsible for the picture coming back into focus.

Thus, the argument "Jim tells his friend that hitting the TV fixed it" can be classified as possessing an **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

In conclusion, applying <IDAA>, the specified type of defective argument to Jim's reasoning is:
**WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
