For 
<IDAA> stands for "Identify Defective Argument Types and Apply Annotations." Let's analyze the given statement and identify any of the defective argument types defined earlier:

"Because the last words spoken by either the pilot or co-pilot were 'Good night, Malaysia Three-Seven-Zero,' the pilot fell asleep and accidentally crashed the plane into the ocean."

1. **Generalization (G)**: The argument cannot be classified as a generalization as it focuses on a specific incident rather than making a broad statement from limited data.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument jumps to the conclusion that the pilot fell asleep based on the phrase "Good night." This does not account for other possible explanations for the crash, such as technical malfunctions, hijacking, medical emergencies, or deliberate actions by the pilot or co-pilot.
   
   Annotation: [FE]

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The statement assumes that saying "Good night" implies that the pilot fell asleep, which is not a sufficient or conclusive reason to support the claim of the crash being an accident due to falling asleep.

   Annotation: [IR]

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is an insufficient causal basis linking the phrase "Good night" to the pilot's sleepiness and the subsequent crash. There are no additional facts or evidence to support this causal link.

   Annotation: [WCB]

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This type is not relevant as there is no repetition of a proposition in the argument.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument doesn't rely on an assumed consensus or common opinion, so this type is not applicable.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language in the statement is not ambiguous; it is quite direct in claiming the pilot fell asleep and crashed the plane.

Based on the analysis, the defective arguments present in the given statement are:

- Incomplete Enumeration [FE]
- Inconclusive Reason [IR]
- Insufficient Causal Basis [WCB]

Annotated Statement:
"Because the last words spoken by either the pilot or co-pilot were 'Good night, Malaysia Three-Seven-Zero,' the pilot fell asleep and accidentally crashed the plane into the ocean." [FE][IR][WCB]
