For 
The argument you've provided appears to be circular reasoning, where the conclusion is used as a premise without proper justification. This type of defective argument is often referred to as *begging the question* or *petitio principii* in classical terms. However, based on the defective argument types you listed, the most fitting category for this particular argument is:

<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)

This is because the argument essentially repeats the proposition in a different form without providing any external evidence or reasoning to support the initial claim. The reasoning fails to advance beyond the original assertion, thus it is a repetition of the proposition in a different guise.

So, the classified argument would be:

"Smoking pot is against the law because it is wrong; I know it is wrong because it is against the law." <RR>
