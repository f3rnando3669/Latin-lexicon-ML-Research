For 
Applying <IDAA> to the argument "A person hanging out in a bar will be an alcoholic" involves identifying defective argument types present in the statement. Let's break down the argument and identify which defective argument types apply:

1. **Generalization (G)**: The argument assumes that everyone who hangs out in a bar must be an alcoholic. This overgeneralizes without considering that people can spend time in bars for various reasons other than alcoholism.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not consider all possible reasons someone might be in a bar. There are many other possibilities, such as socializing, eating, playing games, or even working.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument does not provide conclusive evidence that being in a bar causes alcoholism. It's an assumption without a well-supported cause-effect relationship.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument fails to establish a sufficient causal link between hanging out in a bar and being an alcoholic. Being in a bar does not directly cause one to be an alcoholic.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This might not directly apply unless the argument is frequently repeated without additional evidence to support it.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: If the argument assumes that there is a universal agreement on this point without sufficient evidence, it could be seen as presumptuous.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The term "hanging out in a bar" is fairly clear, but with some imagination, if the premise were more ambiguous about what "hanging out" entails, it might apply.

In summary, the most evident defective argument types for the given statement are:

- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

These labels indicate the problematic nature of the argument and highlight the areas where it fails to be logically sound.
