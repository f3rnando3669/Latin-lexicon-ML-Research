For 
The argument "Over 5 million Filipinos use our products. It’s time to switch to our brand now!" can involve several defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: The argument may be making a broad generalization by assuming that because over 5 million Filipinos use the product, it must be suitable for everyone else. This overlooks other factors that potential users might consider.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This is evident because it lists one fact—over 5 million users—as sufficient reason for everyone to switch, without considering other important factors such as product quality, suitability for different needs, or competition.

3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument implies a causal link between the number of current users and the necessity or advisability of switching to the brand, without providing sufficient evidence to support why this number should dictate others' choices.

Applying **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** also fits as the provided reason (over 5 million users) is not a conclusive reason for the action suggested (switching to the brand). It does not conclusively address why someone should switch other than indicating popularity, which may not be sufficient grounds.

Let's analyze this systematically:

1. **Generalization (G)**: Yes, assuming that the behavior of a large group is determinative for all.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Yes, providing limited information to make a broader claim.
3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Yes, implying causation without adequate support.
4. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Yes, the reason is not thoroughly convincing on its own.

Therefore, the initial argument "Over 5 million Filipinos use our products. It’s time to switch to our brand now!" can be identified with the following defective arguments:

- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**

Applying the **IDAA** (Identification of Defective Argument Application), these tags help in recognizing and classifying the logical shortcomings in the argument provided.
