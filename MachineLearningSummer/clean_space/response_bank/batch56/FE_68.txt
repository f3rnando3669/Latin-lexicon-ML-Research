For 
To analyze the given statement "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t at church today." using the definitions of defective arguments provided, we can apply <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Applied).

Here are the steps for <IDAA>:

1. **Identify the components of the statement:**
   - Premise: "You weren’t at church today."
   - Conclusion: "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t at church today."

2. **Determine the underlying argument:**
   - The statement seems to imply that being a "good person" is directly related to attending church.

3. **Match the argument with one or more defective argument types:**

   - **Generalization (G)**: This defective argument applies because the statement generalizes that a single instance of not attending church means one is not a good person. It overly simplifies the complex notion of what it means to be a "good person" based on attendance at one event.
   
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This statement erroneously limits the criteria for being a good person to church attendance, ignoring other behaviors and actions that contribute to being considered good.
   
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning provided ("you weren’t at church today") is insufficient to draw the conclusion about one's overall character ("not a good person"). The evidence is not strong enough to support the conclusion.
   
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This statement assumes a causal relationship between attending church and being a good person without sufficient evidence to support this causal link.
   
   - **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The term "good person" is ambiguous and subjective, leading to potential misunderstandings about what criteria are being used to judge someone's character.

Given these defective argument types, we can say that the statement "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t at church today." primarily suffers from:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**

Therefore, the statement can be classified under multiple defective arguments. Specifically, it mainly falls under FE, IR, WCB, and DEP due to the reasons outlined above.
