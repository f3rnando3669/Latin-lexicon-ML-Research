For 
<IDAA> or Identify Defective Argument Application involves recognizing and categorizing the defective argument in the given statement.

The statement provided is: “Gay marriages are just immoral. 70% of Americans think so!”

Let's analyze this statement for any defective argument types defined:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - This isn't really a case of overextending a conclusion based on limited or insufficient data.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - This argument doesn't necessarily claim to enumerate all possible reasons or facts.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The reason given for the conclusion that "gay marriages are immoral" is that "70% of Americans think so." This reasoning is inconclusive because the morality of a practice is not objectively determined by majority opinion.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - Not applicable here since the argument is not primarily making a causal claim.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - This isn't a case of repeating the same flawed point in different forms.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - This argument falls under this category because it assumes that the majority opinion (70% of Americans think so) is a valid and sufficient basis for the morality of gay marriages, which is not necessarily true.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - The language in the argument is relatively clear, so ambiguity isn't an issue here.

In conclusion, the defective argument types that apply to the statement “Gay marriages are just immoral. 70% of Americans think so!” are:

- <IR> Inconclusive Reason: Assuming that majority opinion determines morality is not a conclusive argument.
- <FU> Presumptuous Consensus: Relying on the majority's view as a definitive measure of morality without further reasoning.
