In this scenario, the argument falls under the defective argument type "Indefinite Definite Argument Analysis" <IDAA> due to a specific reasoning error.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Question**:
   - "Why does the law state that you have to be 21 years old to drink? Does it really make any difference if you are 20 years and 364 days old? That is absurd."
   - Here, the argument touches on the arbitrary nature of selecting an exact day.

2. **Use of Sorites Paradox (also known as a Heap Argument)**:
   - "Therefore, if a single day makes no difference, then a collection of 1095 single days wonâ€™t make any difference."
   - This is a defective argument because it employs a form of the Sorites Paradox, assuming that small, seemingly inconsequential differences cannot aggregate to a meaningful threshold.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - "Therefore, changing the drinking age to 18 will not make any difference."
   - This conclusion is based on a faulty application of the Sorites Paradox.

The argument is defective because it incorrectly uses the idea that if no single day makes a difference, then a substantial number of days won't either. This is faulty reasoning because the law must draw a clear line somewhere, and while any specific age threshold may seem arbitrary on finer scales, the broader context provides robust rationale for such distinctions based on factors like maturity, responsibility, and societal norms.

**Classification**:
The argument can be classified primarily as <IR> (Inconclusive Reason); the reason provided (no single day makes a difference) doesn't logically support the broader conclusion that a span of three years doesn't make a difference. It also contains aspects of <G> (Generalization) due to overgeneralizing the impact of small changes, but <IR> is the primary flaw.

So, applying <IDAA>, we identify the defective argument type for this reasoning as primarily <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
