For 
<IDAA> stands for identifying and analyzing defective arguments. In this case, let's apply <IDAA> to the given argument about animal experimentation.

The argument presented is:
“Animal experimentation reduces our respect for life. If we don’t respect life, we are likely to be more and more tolerant of violent acts like war and murder. Soon our society will become a battlefield in which everyone constantly fears for their lives. It will be the end of civilization. To prevent this terrible consequence, we should make animal experimentation illegal right now.”

We will break down and analyze the argument to identify any defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - **Identification**: The claim that "Animal experimentation reduces our respect for life" can be too broad, implying that all forms of animal experimentation have this effect on everyone.
   - **Analysis**: Not all animal experimentation necessarily reduces respect for life. The impact might vary depending on the context, how the experiments are carried out, and who is involved. This is a generalization because it does not consider these nuances.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - **Identification**: The argument assumes that not respecting life will directly lead to violent acts like war and murder.
   - **Analysis**: There could be several other factors contributing to violent acts, and focusing only on animal experimentation as the cause is an incomplete enumeration of the root causes of violence. This is an oversimplified cause and effect chain, ignoring other contributing variables.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - **Identification**: “Soon our society will become a battlefield in which everyone constantly fears for their lives."
   - **Analysis**: This is a slippery slope argument that suggests a direct and inevitable progression from tolerance of animal experimentation to a completely chaotic society. However, it lacks strong evidence to support each step in this sequence, making the reason inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - **Identification**: “If we don’t respect life, we are likely to be more and more tolerant of violent acts like war and murder."
   - **Analysis**: The causal relationship between the lack of respect for life due to animal experimentation and increased tolerance for violent acts is not sufficiently established. There are likely numerous socio-economic and cultural factors that contribute to violence, making this an insufficient causal basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - **Identification**: The argument does not necessarily repeat a proposition faultily, so this defective argument type may not apply directly in this context.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - **Identification**: The argument does not claim consensus directly, though it implies an urgent need for legislative action.
   - **Analysis**: While it doesn't overtly presume consensus, it relies on a sense of urgency without discussing counterarguments or other possible views on the issue, thus not exemplifying presumptuous consensus directly.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - **Identification**: Terms like "respect for life" and "violent acts" are used without clear definitions.
   - **Analysis**: The argument uses ambiguous language, such as "respect for life," "violent acts," and "end of civilization," without clarifying what specifically is meant by these terms or how these concepts are measured.

By applying <IDAA> to the argument, we can see that it contains several defective argument types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), and Ambiguous Language (<DEP>). Identifying these flaws helps to critically evaluate and understand the weaknesses in the given argument.
