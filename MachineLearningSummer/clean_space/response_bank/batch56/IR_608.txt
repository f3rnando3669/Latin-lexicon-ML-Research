For 
<IDAA> stands for Irrelevant Distraction Ad Hominem Argument. 

The given argument:
"Before I refute my opponent's argument, I would like to draw attention to the fact that he is sweating and clearly does not have much experience on the debate team."

This is an example of <IDAA> because it attacks the opponent's personal characteristics (sweating and lack of experience) rather than addressing the opponent's actual argument. These characteristics are irrelevant to the validity of the argument being presented, serving merely as a distraction.
