For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Types) to the statement by Farmer McDonald:

**Statement Breakdown:**

1. "Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain."
   - This part of the statement suggests a cause-and-effect relationship between the construction of the power plant and the lack of rain.

2. "I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature."
   - This part of the statement expresses a general disapproval of human interference with nature.

**Identified Defective Argument Types:**

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The claim that the new power plant is responsible for the lack of rain is an example of insufficient causal basis. There is an implied causal link without adequate evidence to support it.
   
   Example: "Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain" suggests causation without sufficient evidence.

2. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The statement "mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature" is a broad generalization based on a single observation.
   
   Example: "mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature" generalizes human actions in relation to nature based on the specific case of the power plant.

**Final Analysis:**
- Farmer McDonald's statement contains two primary defective argument types: <WCB> for suggesting a tenuous causal relationship between the power plant and the lack of rain, and <G> for generalizing human interference with nature based on this single event.
