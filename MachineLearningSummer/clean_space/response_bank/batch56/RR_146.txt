To evaluate the argument in the given statement using the defective argument types defined, we need to analyze the reasoning and identify any fallacies present.

Here's the statement again:
"The BP Oil rig exploded causing many marine mammals to die. This illustrates that the BP oil rig was bad and caused animals to die."

Now let's break it down:

1. **"The BP Oil rig exploded causing many marine mammals to die."** 
   - This is the factual premise provided in the statement.

2. **"This illustrates that the BP oil rig was bad and caused animals to die."**
   - This is the conclusion being drawn.

Next, let's identify the potential defects:

### Steps to Identify Defective Argument Types:

1. **Generalization (G)**
   - Determining if the conclusion is drawn too hastily from specific cases.
   - Potential Issue: The statement generalizes the explosion to the entire BP Oil rig's moral or ethical status without considering other factors or incidents.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
   - Examining if all relevant cases or examples have been considered.
   - Potential Issue: The statement only mentions the explosion and its effect without acknowledging other incidents or safety measures that BP may have implemented.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
   - Checking if the reason provided is insufficient to fully support the conclusion.
   - Potential Issue: Simply stating an explosion caused harm may not necessarily conclude that the entire BP oil rig was inherently bad or solely responsible for the harm.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
   - Analyzing if the causal relationship is adequately established.
   - Potential Issue: The statement assumes that the explosion directly indicates the BP oil rig's overall negative impact without sufficient causal linkage.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
   - Reviewing if the proposition is restated in a faulty or redundant manner.
   - Potential Issue: The statement does not seem to exhibit faulty repetition in this context.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
   - Assessing if the conclusion is presumptuously attributed to a supposed common agreement without evidence.
   - Potential Issue: The statement might assume that the conclusion about the BP oil rig being bad is universally accepted without substantiating this consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**
   - Evaluating if ambiguous or vague terms are used to mislead or confuse.
   - Potential Issue: The term "bad" is subjective and ambiguous, making the argument less clear and potentially misleading.

### Applied Defective Argument Analysis (IDAA):

1. **Generalization (G)**
   - The conclusion generalizes the negative impact of one incident (the explosion) to the entire entity (BP oil rig), which is a classic case of a hasty generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
   - The statement does not consider the entire context or other incidents, focusing solely on one event to conclude the overall nature of the BP oil rig.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
   - The reason provided (the explosion) is not sufficient by itself to wholly conclude that the BP oil rig is categorically "bad."

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
   - The causal link between the explosion and the overall judgment of the BP oil rig being bad is inadequately established.

5. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**
   - The use of the word "bad" is ambiguous and subjective, leading to potential misinterpretation or oversimplification of the argument.

### Conclusion:

The statement "The BP Oil rig exploded causing many marine mammals to die. This illustrates that the BP oil rig was bad and caused animals to die." is defective primarily due to the following identified argument defects:

- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**

These flaws collectively render the argument invalid or defective under the scrutiny of the defined defective argument types.
