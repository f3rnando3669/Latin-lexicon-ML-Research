The argument in question appears to suggest that a new informed consent procedure is effective in reducing dropout rates among therapy patients. Let's analyze the defective arguments present in the statement using the given types:

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - The argument might be making an unwarranted generalization based on a small and non-representative sample of just three therapists.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - The argument does not provide information on other potential influencing factors or the dropout rates of other therapists who did not use the new procedure. The enumeration of factors is incomplete.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - The argument suggests that the new informed consent procedure caused the reduction in dropout rates, but the provided evidence does not conclusively rule out other causes or factors, making the reasoning inconclusive.
   
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - There is an insufficient causal basis to claim that the new procedure directly led to the reduction in dropout rates. There might be other variables at play that were not accounted for.
   
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - The argument does not necessarily involve a repetition of a faulty proposition, so this defective argument type might not apply here.
   
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - The argument may presume that the success seen with the three therapists will be universally applicable to all therapists without sufficient evidence.
   
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - The language used does not seem particularly ambiguous, so this type of defective argument might not apply here.

Combining these insights, the argument primarily exhibits <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis), as it relies on a limited set of data points and does not establish a definitive causal link between the new informed consent procedure and the reduced dropout rates, leaving room for alternative explanations.

Rephrasing the problem and labeling it with these defective argument types:
"My new way of obtaining informed consent helps prevent dropouts. I chose the three therapists in our clinic who had the highest dropout rates and taught them my new informed consent procedure. The first month that they started using it, all three had significantly lower dropout rates." 
This statement demonstrates <FE> (<Incomplete Enumeration>) and <WCB> (<Insufficient Causal Basis>).
