For 
<IDAA> stands for Identification of Defective Argument Application. Based on the argumentative structure of the statement "Even though people say we are going to behave; we know they won't behave well," let's analyze which defective argument types apply:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The statement claims to know people won't behave well based on an unstated reason. It assumes prior knowledge without providing concrete evidence, which makes the reasoning inconclusive.
   
2. **Generalization (G)**: The word "people" suggests a broad, sweeping statement about all people, which is a form of overgeneralization without specifying a particular group or providing evidence for such a claim.

3. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The phrase "we know" implies that there is a consensus among the speaker and others about peopleâ€™s behavior, but this consensus is not substantiated with evidence, making it presumptuous.

Thus, the application of <IDAA> would identify the defective arguments in the statement as follows:

- <IR>
- <G>
- <FU>

Therefore, the statement "Even though people say we are going to behave; we know they won't behave well" contains elements of **Inconclusive Reason**, **Generalization**, and **Presumptuous Consensus**.
