For 
To analyze the defective argument in the sentence "My mom said that Colgate is the best toothpaste because almost 90% of dentists approve of this," we need to determine which of the defined defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP) is being committed.

- Generalization (G)
- Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
- Inconclusive Reason (IR)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
- Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
- Ambiguous Language (DEP)

Based on the sentence provided, the argument seems to be an appeal to consensus, specifically the consensus of dentists, to establish Colgate as the best toothpaste. This aligns closely with the concept of a Presumptuous Consensus (FU), which is a defective argument based on assuming a general agreement without sufficient justification.

Therefore, the fallacy that is being committed in the argument is **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.
