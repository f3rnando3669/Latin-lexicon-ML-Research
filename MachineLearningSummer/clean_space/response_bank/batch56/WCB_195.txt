For 
<IDAA> refers to the application of a defective argument type to a statement or claim.

For the statement "Attributing the cause of World War II to only Adolf Hitler's hatred of the Jews," we can identify the defective argument types that may apply:

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This argument overlooks the complex and multifaceted causes of World War II, including economic, political, social, and strategic factors. Pinning the cause solely on Hitler's hatred of the Jews does not provide a sufficient causal basis.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument fails to take into account the many other contributing factors and actors involved in the onset of World War II, such as geopolitical tensions, previous treaties, and international conflicts.

Therefore, the statement can be criticized using <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis and <FE> Incomplete Enumeration.
