For 
The question "Have you stopped beating your wife?" is an example of what is often referred to as a complex question fallacy, also known as a loaded question. This type of question presupposes something that may not necessarily be true; in this case, it presupposes that the person being asked has been beating their wife.

Given your defined defective argument types, I will apply <IDAA> (that you've asked for):
  
**Identify Defective Argument Type (<IDAA>)**: 

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The question itself doesn't generalize but locks into a specific presupposition.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The question assumes a limited set of answers (yes or no) without considering other possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The question is based on an assumed conclusion without sufficient reason.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The question posits a cause (beating one's wife) without sufficient basis.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: It doesn't really fit the definition of faulty repetition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: It assumes a consensus or common understanding that beating occurred.
7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The language is not particularly ambiguous but rather misleading due to the presumption baked into the question.

Since the core issue with "Have you stopped beating your wife?" is the unwarranted assumption about the behavior it implies, the most accurate tags from your list would be:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Because it presumes only a yes/no answer and doesn't allow for the possibility that the premise of the question might be false.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: It assumes that the person has been beating their wife, as if this question reflects a known reality.

Thus, applying <IDAA>, the defective argument types would be:

<FE>, <FU>
