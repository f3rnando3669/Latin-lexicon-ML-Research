For 
The argument “X has been around for years now. Y is new. Therefore, Y is better than X.” appears to be resting on a potentially faulty assumption because it implies that the age of something (in this case, being new or old) directly correlates with its quality or superiority. To classify this argument using the defined defective argument types:

- **Generalization (G):** This argument does not really involve a sweeping statement made based on limited examples, so it doesn't fit this type.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This argument does not seem to be incomplete or ignoring relevant alternatives.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This argument seems to fit this category well. It presents the age of an item as the sole reason for its superiority, which is not a conclusive reason.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This argument also fits this category. It attempts to establish a causal relationship between being new and being better without sufficient evidence.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This argument is not repeating a proposition, so it doesn’t fit this type.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There doesn’t appear to be an appeal to a presumed consensus here.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** This argument does not hinge on ambiguous language.

Given the nature of the argument, it can be primarily classified under the following defective argument types:

**<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** The reasoning presented is not sufficient to conclude that Y is better than X merely because it is new.
**<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** There is an insufficient basis to establish a causal relationship between the newness of Y and its superiority over X.

Thus, applying the label **<IR> <WCB>** to the argument "X has been around for years now. Y is new. Therefore, Y is better than X." would be appropriate.
