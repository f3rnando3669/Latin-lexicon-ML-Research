For 
To apply <IDAA> (identification and description of argumentative anomalies) to the provided argument, we will identify and describe which of the defined defective argument types are present in the statement:

**Argument:**
"Every day, I eat cereal for breakfast. One time, I had a muffin instead, and there was a major earthquake in my city. I've eaten cereal ever since."

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - The argument implies a causal connection between eating a muffin and the occurrence of a major earthquake. This is a classic example of a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy, where a temporal sequence is mistaken for a causal relationship. The argument assumes that eating a muffin caused the earthquake without providing any evidence that the two events are related. 

2. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - The argument essentially repeats the same proposition about eating cereal and connects it to the avoidance of earthquakes without any additional evidence or justification. Repetition is used here to strengthen the implied causality without actually supporting it. 

3. **Generalization (G):**
   - The argument generalizes from a single instance (eating a muffin and an earthquake occurring) to a habitual behavior (always eating cereal for breakfast to avoid earthquakes). This overgeneralization from one occurrence is a weak basis for establishing a general rule.

In summary, the primary defective arguments in this statement are **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**, and **Generalization (G)**:

- **WCB:** Assumes a causal relationship without evidence.
- **RR:** Repeats the same proposition without additional support.
- **G:** Generalizes from a single instance to a broader rule.
