For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Analysis. To apply <IDAA> to the given argument, we need to examine the reasoning and logic behind the premises and the conclusion to identify any potential logical fallacies or defective argument types that might be present. Let's break down the argument step-by-step:

Argument: 
- "If you don’t go to the party, then your friends will have fun without you."
- "If your friends have fun without you, then they will stop inviting you to fun things."
- "If your friends stop inviting you to fun things, you will have no social life."
- Conclusion: "Therefore, if you don’t go to this party, then you will have no social life."

First, we can assess each premise individually and then evaluate the overall argument.

1. **First Premise: "If you don’t go to the party, then your friends will have fun without you."**
    - This is a conditional statement that might be dubious. It assumes that your friends' enjoyment depends solely on your absence, which might not necessarily be the case. This premise could be considered an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, since there isn't sufficient evidence to support that your friends' fun is directly correlated to your attendance.

2. **Second Premise: "If your friends have fun without you, then they will stop inviting you to fun things."**
    - This is a generalization that suggests a single instance of enjoyment without you will lead to a broader change in behavior. This fits the criteria for **Generalization (G)** because it makes a broad assumption based on limited information.

3. **Third Premise: "If your friends stop inviting you to fun things, you will have no social life."**
    - This is another conditional statement that assumes your entire social life depends solely on your friends' invitations to "fun things." This could be an **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, since it ignores other possible avenues for developing and maintaining a social life.

4. **Conclusion: "Therefore, if you don’t go to this party, then you will have no social life."**
    - The conclusion draws a definitive outcome based on the flawed premises. Given the premises suffer from **Generalization (G)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, and **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, we can identify these defects in the overall argument.

Overall, this argument suffers from multiple defective argument types:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** in the first and third premises.
- **Generalization (G)** in the second premise.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** in the third premise and the logic leading to the conclusion.

Thus, the argument as a whole is not logically sound and relies on several flawed premises that fail to convincingly support the conclusion.
