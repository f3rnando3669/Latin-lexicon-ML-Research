For 
<IDAA> stands for Identification and Analysis of Defective Arguments. Let's apply it to the given argument.

The argument is as follows:
1. William Dembski argues that modern biology supports the idea that there is an intelligent designer who created life.
2. Dembski would say that because he’s religious.
Therefore:
3. Modern biology doesn’t support intelligent design.

Let's break this down step by step and identify the defective argument types present.

1. **William Dembski argues that modern biology supports the idea that there is an intelligent designer who created life.**
   - This is a statement presenting Dembski's position.

2. **Dembski would say that because he’s religious.**
   - This statement suggests that Dembski's argument is biased due to his religious beliefs. This is a form of an ad hominem argument, where the person's character or motives are attacked instead of addressing the actual argument.

Therefore:
3. **Modern biology doesn’t support intelligent design.**
   - The conclusion is that modern biology does not support intelligent design, based on the premise that Dembski's argument is religiously motivated.

The defective argument types we can identify here are:

1. **Ad Hominem Attack:**
   - The argument dismisses Dembski's claim by attacking his character and motives rather than addressing the evidence or reasoning behind his argument. This is a fallacy because the validity of an argument should be judged on its own merits, not the character of the person making it.

However, given the defective argument types you've defined, we can also fit the reasoning into some of these categories:

2. **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):**
   - The reason given (Dembski's religious motives) does not conclusively lead to the conclusion that modern biology doesn’t support intelligent design. The reasoning is insufficient to draw a definitive conclusion.

3. **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language):**
   - Though less directly applicable, one might argue there is a level of ambiguity in linking religious belief directly to the invalidation of a scientific claim without examining the claim itself.

Therefore, the main defective argument type here is:
- <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)

The argument fails because the personal motive of Dembski being religious does not provide a conclusive reason to dismiss his scientific claims regarding intelligent design.
