To analyze the given argument using the defined defective argument types, let's first break down the argument:

**Argument:**
"There are more laws on the books than ever before, and more crimes are being committed than ever before. Therefore, to reduce crime, we must eliminate the laws."

**Possible Identified Defective Argument Types (<IDAA>):**

1. **<G> Generalization**
   - The argument might suggest a faulty generalization that more laws lead to more crimes without providing sufficient evidence.

2. **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**
   - The argument does not consider other factors that might contribute to the increase in crime, just focusing on the number of laws.

3. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**
   - The given reasons (more laws and more crimes) do not logically and conclusively support the conclusion (eliminating laws will reduce crime).

4. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**
   - The argument posits a causal relationship between the number of laws and the amount of crime without presenting a valid causal link.

To saturate the analysis with these types:

**Generalization (<G>):**
The argument generalizes that the presence of more laws is linked to the increase in crime rates. This is a broad and unsupported generalization because it overlooks numerous other factors that could influence crime rates, such as socioeconomic conditions, law enforcement effectiveness, and cultural shifts.

**Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
This argument omits other possible explanations for the rise in crime rates. It fails to consider other variables that might be at play, such as economic factors, changes in demographics, or advancements in crime reporting systems.

**Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
The argument's reasoning is inconclusive because the increase in laws and the increase in crimes does not necessarily imply that the laws are causing the crimes. The conclusion drawn (that eliminating laws will reduce crime) does not logically follow from the premises.

**Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
The argument lacks a sufficient basis to claim that more laws cause more crime. It assumes a direct causal link without providing empirical evidence to support such a claim. Just because two events are correlated does not mean that one causes the other.

Therefore, the argument is primarily faulty due to:

1. **Generalization (<G>)** - Assuming a broad and unsupported link between laws and crime.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** - Ignoring other potential factors influencing crime rates.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** - Drawing a conclusion that does not logically follow from the provided premises.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** - Failing to establish a valid causal connection between the number of laws and the increase in crime.

This concludes the application of the identified defective argument types to the given argument.
