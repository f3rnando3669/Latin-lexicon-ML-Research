For 
The fallacy being committed in the statement "You got a cold two nights ago but last night you stayed up really late and now you are no longer sick, so it must be because you stayed up really late last night." is best categorized under <WCB> - Insufficient Causal Basis.

The reason for this is that the argument is making an unwarranted causal connection between staying up late and recovering from the cold. Without further evidence to support that staying up late caused the recovery, this conclusion does not have a sufficient causal basis.
