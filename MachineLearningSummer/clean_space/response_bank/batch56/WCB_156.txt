When analyzing the statement "Since Lucy Sutton became vice president of the parent-teacher association, student performance has declined and teacher morale is down. We on the school board believe that Sutton bears sole responsibility for the downtrend," we need to examine whether any defective argument types can be applied. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This doesn't seem to apply as the statement isn't generalizing about a group based on limited cases.
  
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement mentions a decline in student performance and teacher morale since Lucy Sutton took office but does not consider other potential factors that could have contributed to these issues. This represents an incomplete enumeration because it singles out Sutton without evidence of other contributing causes being examined.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning is inconclusive because it does not provide concrete evidence linking Sutton's role directly to the decline in performance and morale. Correlation does not imply causation, and the statement lacks a direct link.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This applies because the argument claims Sutton is solely responsible for the decline without sufficient evidence to establish a direct causal relationship. Just because two events occurred simultaneously does not mean one caused the other.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: There is no example of repeating a proposition within this argument, so this does not apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument makes an assumption that the school board's belief (implying a consensus) is sufficient to conclude that Sutton is responsible. This fits as the statement relies on authority without additional support.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language in the statement is fairly clear, so ambiguous language doesn't seem to be a primary issue here.

Given the definitions and the analysis:

- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)** is applicable because the argument fails to consider other factors that may have contributed.
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** is applicable as there's no conclusive evidence provided.
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)** is applicable due to the lack of a clear causal relationship.
- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)** can also be reasonably applied since the argument rests on the authority of the school board's belief.
