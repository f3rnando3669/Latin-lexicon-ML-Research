The argument "I can't understand why people are complaining that it's difficult to find a job in this job market. My daughter and I got jobs without any trouble." can be analyzed using the defective argument types you defined.

This argument falls into the category of <G> (Generalization) and <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):

1. **<G> (Generalization)**: The speaker is making a broad conclusion about the job market based on a limited number of cases (the speaker and the speaker's daughter). Just because two individuals found jobs easily does not mean that the job market as a whole is easy for everyone.

2. **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: The speaker is considering the experiences of only two people and using this as proof that the job market is not challenging. They fail to account for the experiences of a larger, more diverse group of job seekers who may be struggling.

This analysis shows that the argument is defective because it makes a sweeping generalization from an incomplete and potentially unrepresentative sample.
