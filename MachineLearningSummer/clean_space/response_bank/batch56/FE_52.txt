For 
Thank you for providing the definitions of the defective argument types. However, you mentioned applying <IDAA> to the statement, but <IDAA> was not defined among the list of defective argument types you gave. It seems like this might be a typographical error.

I will proceed to analyze the provided statement using the defective arguments you defined:

- **Statement**: "If you really loved me, you would buy me everything I ever wanted!"

Let's break it down to see which defective argument types apply:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument suggests a sweeping generalization, implying that love can only be proven or exists if one buys everything the other person wants. Love is a complex emotion that cannot be reduced to material possessions.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument ignores many other ways to show love and bases the assessment merely on buying things. There are numerous alternative ways to express love that are not considered.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The premise that buying everything one wants is a sufficient proof of love is not logically conclusive. There are many external factors and personal values that determine demonstrations of love, so the reason provided is insufficient.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal connection between buying everything and love is not sufficiently established. Love cannot simply be equated with material giving; this overlooks the emotional, psychological, and relational facets of love.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This argument type does not seem to apply directly here as there's no repetition of a proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument assumes that everyone would agree with the claim without providing evidence that this is a commonly accepted truth.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: There might be some ambiguity regarding what "everything I ever wanted" encompasses, but this doesnâ€™t seem to be the primary source of the defect.

Based on the provided defective argument types and the nature of the statement, it appears that the argument in the statement is primarily a **Generalization (<G>)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**, **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, and it might also exhibit characteristics of **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
