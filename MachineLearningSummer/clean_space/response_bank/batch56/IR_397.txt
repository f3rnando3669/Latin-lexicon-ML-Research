For 
<IDAA> refers to the Identification, Definition, Analysis, and Addressing of Arguments.

Identification: 
Identify the statement and the context in which it is given. In this case, the statement is made by a candidate under questioning in a debate about their plans to address an economic crisis.

Definition:
Define the nature of the argument used in the candidate's response. The candidate's answer seems to deflect from the direct question of how they would fix the economic crisis by referring to the causes of the crisis and implicating their opponent.

Analysis:
Analyze why the argument is considered defective. The candidate does not answer the moderator's question directly but instead redirects the conversation to discussions about the causes of the crisis and criticizes their opponent. This can create confusion and avoid a substantive response about the candidate's own solutions.

Addressing:
Determine which type of defective argument the candidate's response falls into based on the defined categories. There could be multiple possibilities here:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The candidate does not enumerate the plans or solutions they would implement to address the economic crisis, leaving the question unanswered.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** By focusing on the causes and attributing blame to the opponent, the candidate avoids providing a concrete reason or plan for how they would fix the crisis, making the argument inconclusive in addressing the question asked.

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the candidateâ€™s response, we can label the argument as <FE> due to lack of enumeration of solutions and <IR> due to avoiding a direct, conclusive answer.
