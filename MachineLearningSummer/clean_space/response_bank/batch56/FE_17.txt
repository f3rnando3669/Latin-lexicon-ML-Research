For 
<IDAA> stands for Identify Defective Argument Application. Let's examine the argument presented:

"I'm raising funds to help cure XYZ disease. If you don't donate, then you're part of the problem."

Upon analyzing this statement, we can identify several potential defective arguments within it.

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   This argument presents a false dichotomy by suggesting that there are only two options: either donating or being part of the problem. In reality, there may be numerous other ways to help address XYZ disease.

2. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   The proposition implies that thereâ€™s a direct and exclusive link between donating and not being part of the problem, without properly substantiating why not donating inherently makes someone part of the problem.

3. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   The term "part of the problem" is ambiguous and can encompass a wide range of actions or inactions. It does not clearly define what "the problem" is or how not donating inherently contributes to it.

Given these defects, the argument fails to provide a definitive, well-supported reasoning for its conclusion. Thus, we have successfully applied <IDAA> to identify the defective arguments present in the statement:
- <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)
- <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)
- <DEP> (Ambiguous Language)
