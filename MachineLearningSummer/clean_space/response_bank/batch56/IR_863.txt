For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application. To apply <IDAA> to the conversation provided, we'll identify which, if any, defective argument types (from the given definitions) are present.

In the dialogue:
- **Speaker 1**: “No fault divorce is really harmful to the family and the larger society.”
- **Speaker 2**: “Well, you must not really think that since you’re divorced yourself.”

Speaker 2's response seems to attack Speaker 1's character or situation (being divorced) rather than addressing the argument presented by Speaker 1. This is known as an ad hominem fallacy, which is not explicitly listed in the defective argument types provided. However, focusing on the argument types:

- **Generalization (G)**: There's no evidence of a broad, faulty generalization here.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: There's no claim implying an incomplete listing of possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning is not directed at the initial claim but attacks the person, thus avoiding the argument’s validity.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument doesn't discuss causality directly here.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: There's no repetition of the proposition seen.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: No consensus, assumed or otherwise, is addressed.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: No ambiguous language is used; the language is straightforward.

Speaker 2 is sidestepping the actual argument rather than addressing its merits. This behavior aligns most closely with attacking the arguer personally (ad hominem), which pivots away from the original discussion rather than an inherent defect in the argument based on the provided definitions. If we were to loosely categorize it within your defined types, it might fit as a form of:

- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: Since Speaker 2 provides no substantive reason against Speaker 1's claim, and their statement about Speaker 1 being divorced does not logically counter the argument presented.

Therefore, we could identify Speaker 2's statement as an **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** because it fails to engage with the actual argument's validity.
