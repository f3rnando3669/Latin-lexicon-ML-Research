To analyze the argument using the defined defective argument types:

**IDAA** refers to identifying the defective argument types applied.

In this exchange:

**Eric:** "For my lottery numbers, I chose 6, 14, 22, 35, 38, 40. What did you choose?"  
**Steve:** "I chose 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6."  
**Eric:** "You idiot! Those numbers will never come up!"

1. **Generalization (G):** Eric's claim that Steve's chosen numbers will never come up can be seen as a generalization since he's implying that some numbers are less likely to be drawn than others without any valid evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Eric does not provide a complete list or examination of possibilities. He dismisses a particular set of numbers without considering all possible outcomes in the lottery, where each combination has an equal chance of being drawn.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Eric's statement is based on the assumption that certain numbers are inherently less likely to come up without any statistical reasoning. His reasoning is inconclusive and lacks empirical support.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This defect does not directly apply in this context as Eric does not repeat a proposition.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Eric assumes that the numbers Steve chose have a causal relationship with the likelihood of winning the lottery, which is unfounded because all number combinations have equal probability.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This defect does not directly apply in this context as there isn't any appeal to a consensus or general agreement among others.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** This defect does not directly apply either, as the language in the argument is clear and specific about the numbers chosen and the assertion.

**Conclusion:**

Eric's argument contains the following defective argument types:
- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

These defects indicate that Eric's dismissal of Steve's lottery number choice is not well-founded and relies on faulty reasoning.
