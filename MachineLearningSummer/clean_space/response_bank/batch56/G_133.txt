For 
The argument "Four out of five dentists recommend Happy Glossy Smiley toothpaste brand. Therefore, it must be great." contains a couple of defects based on the input defective argument types you've defined. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument only provides a percentage (80%) of dentists who recommend the toothpaste, but it doesn't enumerate the dentists' credentials, the size or demographic of the survey, or whether there was any particular bias or selection in choosing these dentists. It assumes that a majority of dentists recommending the toothpaste is sufficient evidence of its greatness, which is not necessarily true.

2. **Generalization (G):** The conclusion that the toothpaste must be great is a broad generalization based on the opinion of a subset of dentists. It assumes that the opinion of a sample automatically applies universally, without sufficient supporting evidence.

In conclusion, the argument can be classified primarily under **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** and **Generalization (G)**.
