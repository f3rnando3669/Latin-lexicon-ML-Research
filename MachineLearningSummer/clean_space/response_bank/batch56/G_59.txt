Applying the defective argument identification based on the defined types to the given statement:

"If you break your diet and have one cookie tonight, you will just want to eat 10 cookies tomorrow, and before you know it, you will have gained back the 15 pounds you lost."

This argument seems to display certain problematic reasoning patterns:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument might be seen as a generalization because it assumes a slippery slope where one instance of a minor dietary indiscretion (one cookie) will inevitably lead to a major consequence (gaining back 15 pounds). The argument implies a direct, inevitable progression without considering other factors such as self-control, exercise, or the possibility that one cookie might not lead to any further dietary lapses.

2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument lacks a solid causal basis to definitively claim that one cookie will lead directly to eating ten cookies the next day and then gaining 15 pounds. It oversimplifies weight gain, which is affected by various factors like total caloric intake, metabolism, physical activity, and even psychological factors, rather than just a single cookie consumed one time.

To summarize, the statement primarily aligns with:
- **Generalization (<G>)**: It generalizes a single action (eating one cookie) to a broader, inevitable negative consequence (regaining significant weight).
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: It assumes a direct causal link without sufficient evidence or consideration of other influencing factors.
