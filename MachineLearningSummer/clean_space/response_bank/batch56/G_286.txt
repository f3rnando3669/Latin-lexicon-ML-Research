For 
<IDAA> stands for identifying defective argument types and analyzing them accordingly. Let's apply this to the argument: "We canâ€™t legalize marijuana; if we do, then the next thing you know people will be strung out on heroin."

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The argument generalizes the effect of legalizing marijuana by assuming it will lead to people using much harder drugs like heroin. It does not consider the complexities or provide evidence for this progression.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The argument presents an incomplete enumeration of possible outcomes. It suggests only the extreme consequence (heroin use) without considering other possible scenarios or providing a balanced view of the situation.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The argument relies on an inconclusive reason. The causal link between legalizing marijuana and subsequent heroin use is not substantiated with sufficient evidence. The reasoning's logical foundation is weak.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - The argument has an insufficient causal basis. There is no clear evidence presented that shows legalizing marijuana will directly cause increased heroin use. The premise and conclusion are not sufficiently connected causally.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - This defective argument type does not seem particularly applicable here, as the argument does not rely on repeating a proposition without adding proof.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - This argument could be seen as suggesting a presumptuous consensus by implying that it is commonly understood or accepted that marijuana legalization leads to harder drug use without providing evidence of such a consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - The argument uses language that could be considered ambiguous in terms of what "legalizing marijuana" and being "strung out on heroin" encompass. Without clear definitions or contextual explanations, the argument remains vague and open to misinterpretation.

Thus, the defective argument types that can be applied are **Generalization (<G>)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**, **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**, and potentially **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**.
