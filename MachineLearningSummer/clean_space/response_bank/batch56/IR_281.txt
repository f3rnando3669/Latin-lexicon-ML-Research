The argument in the statement "Leonardo DiCaprio is just a dumb actor! What does he really know about climate change?!" can be identified and analyzed as follows:

<IDAA>: Identify Defective Argumentation Aspects.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**
   - The statement makes a sweeping generalization that actors are dumb and, by extension, that Leonardo DiCaprio must be dumb because he is an actor. This is a flawed generalization that does not take into account individual differences.
  
2. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
   - The argument assumes that because DiCaprio is an actor, his knowledge of climate change is inherently invalid or insufficient. This does not provide a conclusive reason to dismiss his viewpoints on climate change without considering his actual understanding or expertise on the topic.
  
3. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**
   - There is an underlying faulty repetition in the notion that an occupation (being an actor) equates to a lack of knowledge in other areas (climate change), which is not necessarily true. Repeating this flawed association does not substantiate the argument.

4. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**
   - The term "dumb actor" is ambiguous and subjective. It presents a vague and emotionally charged label that does not contribute to a clear, rational discussion about DiCaprio's actual knowledge or capabilities concerning climate change.

Thus, by applying <IDAA>, we can see that this argument exhibits several defective aspects, including Generalization, Inconclusive Reason, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, and Ambiguous Language.
