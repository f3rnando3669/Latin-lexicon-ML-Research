Applying the Identification, Diagnosis, Analysis, and Assessment (IDAA) framework to the statement "At a party you overhear a friend tell her spouse, 'I had high blood pressure at the doctor’s office today; I really need to reduce the stress in my job.'":

1. **Identification**: The first part of the framework involves identifying the argument's structure, premises, and conclusion.

   - **Premises**: The speaker had high blood pressure at the doctor’s office today.
   - **Conclusion**: The speaker needs to reduce the stress in their job.

2. **Diagnosis**: This step involves identifying any defective reasoning in the argument presented.

   The statement seems to assume that the high blood pressure is directly caused by stress from the job without considering other possible factors. This can be classified as a defective argument type:

   - **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The argument assumes a direct causation between job stress and high blood pressure without sufficient evidence to support this claim. There could be multiple other factors (such as diet, genetics, or situational anxiety) contributing to the high blood pressure that are not considered.

3. **Analysis**: Here, we analyze further why this constitutes a problem in the reasoning.

   - **Analysis of <WCB>**: The conclusion that job stress is the cause of high blood pressure is drawn without exploring or ruling out other potential causes. High blood pressure can result from various factors, including but not limited to lifestyle choices, genetic predispositions, or even the stress of simply being at the doctor’s office itself. Without proper medical examination and consideration of these factors, attributing the cause solely to job stress is problematic.

4. **Assessment**: Finally, we assess the overall cogency and reliability of the argument considering the defective reasoning identified.

   - **Assessment of Cogency and Reliability**: Given the identification of an <WCB> defect, the argument is not fully cogent or reliable. While job stress may indeed be a factor, the conclusion is not sufficiently supported by the evidence provided in the statement. For the argument to be more robust, the friend would need additional evidence or a broader consideration of potential causes for the high blood pressure before attributing it solely to job stress.

By applying the IDAA framework, we can see that the argument lacks sufficient causal basis for its conclusion and is thus not entirely reliable.
