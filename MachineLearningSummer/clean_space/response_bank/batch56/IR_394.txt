For 
Applying the idea of Identifying Defective Arguments and Analyzing them (<IDAA>) to the given statement:

**Statement to Analyze:**
"If you write to Mrs. Roth and tell her: 'Mrs. Roth, I know I haven't done any of the assignments, but I need a C anyway because I'm asking nicely and I'm a good person, and I'm going to get in trouble if you don't.'"

**Analysis:**

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - This argument does not fall under Generalization because it does not infer a general conclusion about a group from insufficient evidence. It is more about the individual situation of the speaker.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - This argument does not list all the possible reasons or considerations for receiving a grade. It only mentions the individual's needs and certain personal qualities, ignoring broader academic criteria. However, this is a common feature of appeals for exceptions, rather than an enumeration error.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The reasons provided (“asking nicely,” “I'm a good person,” and “I'm going to get in trouble”) do not robustly support the conclusion that the speaker deserves a “C” grade. They lack direct relevance to academic performance and thus do not provide a solid basis for the requested outcome.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The argument implies that personal traits and consequences should causally lead to a grade change, which is a flawed causation. Providing a grade based solely on these claims without academic merit lacks a sufficient causal basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - This argument does not repeatedly state a faulty proposition; rather, it provides multiple reasons in a single statement, which are unrelated to the performance metrics typically used in educational grading systems.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - This argument does not claim that the consensus of others supports the idea that the speaker should receive a “C”; it relies only on the personal appeal and situational pressure.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - The language in the argument is clear and specific about the individual’s situation, personal qualities, and the consequences of not receiving a “C.” There is no ambiguity in the terms used.

**Conclusion:**
Thus, the main defective arguments present in this statement are:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The argument's reasons are not relevant or strong enough to substantiate the requested conclusion of receiving a “C.”
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Assigning a grade based on personal appeals and potential trouble faced lacks an appropriate causal connection to the academic performance that grades typically reflect.

By analyzing the argument, we identified that it fails primarily due to inconclusive reasoning and an insufficient causal basis.
