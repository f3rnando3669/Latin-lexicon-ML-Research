To apply the identification of defective argument types to the example "Our competitors use unhealthy sugar substitutes and artificial sweeteners. But Rev-Up Energy Drink contains one hundred percent real cane sugar to fuel your body better," we will analyze the argument presented and identify any fallacies or defects according to the list provided:

1. **Generalization (G)**: The statement makes a broad claim about "our competitors" using unhealthy sugar substitutes and artificial sweeteners. This could be a defective argument if it overgeneralizes the practices of all competitors without sufficient evidence.
    - Defective Argument Type: **(G)** Generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument doesn't provide a thorough comparison or exhaustive list; it merely contrasts one characteristic of Rev-Up Energy Drink with a generalized characteristic of competitors.
    - Defective Argument Type: **(FE)** Incomplete Enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The conclusion that cane sugar fuels the body better is not supported by solid evidence within the statement. It assumes that cane sugar is unequivocally better without proper substantiation.
    - Defective Argument Type: **(IR)** Inconclusive Reason.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is an implicit causal claim that using cane sugar instead of artificial sweeteners is healthier or better for fueling the body, but this claim lacks a clear causal link based on evidence within the argument provided.
    - Defective Argument Type: **(WCB)** Insufficient Causal Basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: If the argument repeatedly restates the same proposition without adding new information or evidence, it would be considered faulty repetition.
    - In this instance, **RR** is not clearly applicable as the argument doesn't seem repetitive.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument may imply that because it states an apparent industry-wide issue (unhealthy substitutes), the consensus must be that Rev-Up's approach is better. However, this is not clearly a consensus, it is more an internal claim.
    - **FU** does not strongly apply here.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The term "fuel your body better" and "real cane sugar" might be considered ambiguous. "Better" is subjective, and "real cane sugar" versus other types of sugar might warrant more clarity.
    - Defective Argument Type: **(DEP)** Ambiguous Language.

Summarizing, the defective argument types applied to the provided statement are:

- **(G)** Generalization
- **(FE)** Incomplete Enumeration
- **(IR)** Inconclusive Reason
- **(WCB)** Insufficient Causal Basis
- **(DEP)** Ambiguous Language

These types highlight the primary issues in the structure and substantiation of the argument.
