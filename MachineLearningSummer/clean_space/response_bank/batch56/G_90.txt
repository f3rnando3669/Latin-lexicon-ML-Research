For 
Applying <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Attributes) to the statement:

"If we get rid of assault weapons for citizens then we will also soon lose freedom of speech and all freedoms as other countries rush in to conquer us (if the zombies donâ€™t exterminate us first!)"

1. **<G> Generalization:** The statement makes a broad and sweeping claim that getting rid of assault weapons will lead to the loss of all freedoms without providing specific evidence or context to support this generalization.
   
2. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** The linkage between getting rid of assault weapons and losing freedom of speech and other freedoms is not substantiated with a solid causal connection. The argument jumps to extreme conclusions without firm grounding.

3. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** The prediction that other countries will conquer the U.S. if assault weapons are banned is speculative and lacks a sufficient causal basis. There is no evidence provided that connects the ban on assault weapons to this dystopian outcome.

4. **<DEP> Ambiguous Language:** The statement includes ambiguous or hyperbolic language, especially with the inclusion of "zombies exterminate us first," which introduces an unrealistic and ambiguous element that weakens the argument's seriousness.

To summarize, the statement contains defective argument attributes such as Generalization, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, and Ambiguous Language.
