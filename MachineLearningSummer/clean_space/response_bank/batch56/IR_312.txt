For 
The acronym <IDAA> is not defined in the context of your request, so it isn't clear how to apply it. However, I can analyze the statement "A recent study found that there are plenty of scientists who disagree with the consensus position on this phenomenon" using the defective argument types provided:

1. **Generalization (G)**: The argument may be attempting to generalize the opinions of a "plenty of scientists" to imply a significant dissent without specifying how many scientists or the methodological rigor behind their disagreement.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This could be an instance of <FE> if the statement omits important details, such as the proportion of scientists who disagree compared to those who agree with the consensus, or the qualifications and relevance of these scientists to the specific phenomenon.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: <IR> might apply if the referencing of a "recent study" is used to conclude that the consensus is invalid or weak without adequately addressing the strength, design, and broader context of the study itself.
   
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This statement may not directly apply to <WCB> unless it is later used to suggest a causation that hasn't been sufficiently backed by evidence.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This might be <RR> if someone repeatedly uses the single study's findings to argue against the consensus without new evidence or additional supporting studies.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This could be <FU> only if the argument implies that the existence of disagreement is evidence that the consensus itself is based on presumption rather than thorough analysis. But this seems less directly applicable here.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This statement could be <DEP> if terms like "plenty" and "disagree" are used ambiguously, perhaps suggesting more weight to the dissent than is warranted or leaving unclear what precisely is being disagreed with.

In summary, the given statement could be most effectively classified under <G>, <FE>, <IR>, and potentially <DEP>, depending on how the argument is structured and presented in broader context.
