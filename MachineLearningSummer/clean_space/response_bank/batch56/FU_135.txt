For 
To apply the Identifying Defective Argument Analysis (IDAA) process to the statement "Everyone is wearing the new skinny jeans from American Eagle. Are you?", we need to identify if any of the defined defective arguments are present in this statement. Let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The statement "Everyone is wearing the new skinny jeans from American Eagle" suggests that the entire population is engaged in this behavior. This is a broad generalization that is unlikely to be accurate for every person.
   - **Presence**: Yes, this is an example of <G>.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - This involves drawing a conclusion based on an incomplete list of possibilities. The statement doesn't list all possibilities but implies that everyone is wearing skinny jeans.
   - **Presence**: This could be considered under <FE> if the statement is taken to mean that no one else could be wearing something different. 

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - This involves presenting reasons that do not adequately support the conclusion. The statement appeals to popularity rather than providing a direct reason for why one should wear skinny jeans.
   - **Presence**: Yes, this is an example of <IR>.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - This involves assuming a causal relationship without sufficient evidence. The statement does not present a causal claim but rather an appeal to a trend.
   - **Presence**: No, this does not apply here.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - This involves repeatedly asserting a proposition without evidence. The statement makes a single assertion rather than repeating it.
   - **Presence**: No, this does not apply here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - This involves assuming a consensus that might not exist. The statement assumes everyone is engaged in the behavior.
   - **Presence**: Yes, this applies as <FU>.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - This involves using language that can have multiple interpretations. The phrase "everyone" could be ambiguous if not strictly defined.
   - **Presence**: While "everyone" can be considered ambiguous, it more directly falls under generalization.

### Conclusion:
The statement "Everyone is wearing the new skinny jeans from American Eagle. Are you?" contains the following defective argument types:
- **Generalization (<G>)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**

Thus, the statement employs multiple defective argument types, making it fallacious and potentially misleading.
