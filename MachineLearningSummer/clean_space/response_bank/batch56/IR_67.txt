The argument provided is an example of an <IDAA>: Irrelevant Distracting Auxiliary Argument. This type of argument involves introducing irrelevant information to distract from the main issue in question, diverting attention away from the original point to something somewhat related but not pertaining directly to the topic at hand.

In this instance, the core issue is the lack of raises for employees over the past five years. However, the argument shifts focus to the hard work on making a good product and ensuring customer service quality, which are irrelevant to the issue of employee raises. This distracting auxiliary information does not address or justify why raises have not been given.
