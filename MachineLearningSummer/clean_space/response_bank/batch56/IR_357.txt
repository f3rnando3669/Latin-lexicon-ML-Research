For 
<IDAA> refers to Identifying Defective Argument Types in a given Argument.

Let's analyze the argument provided:

1. **Claim**: Edward Johns claimed to be psychic.
2. **Observation**: When his 'abilities' were tested under proper scientific conditions, they magically disappeared.
3. **Explanation**: Edward explained this by saying that one had to have faith in his abilities for them to work.

We can now identify the defective argument types involved:

1. **Repetition of Claim Without Proof**:
   - **Defective Argument Type**: <RR>
   - **Explanation**: Edward's explanation relies on the assertion that faith is required. This repeats the proposition that his abilities exist without additional evidence or proof. Repeating the claim in a different form ("faith is required") doesn't add validity.

2. **Inconclusive Reason**:
   - **Defective Argument Type**: <IR>
   - **Explanation**: Edward's explanation that his abilities require faith is not a scientifically testable or conclusive reason. It does not provide a testable mechanism that could be evaluated within the scientific conditions.

3. **Ambiguous Language**:
   - **Defective Argument Type**: <DEP>
   - **Explanation**: The need for "faith" can be considered ambiguous and subjective. Faith is a variable term with many interpretations, making the argument susceptible to misinterpretation and lack of clarity.

Therefore, the application of <IDAA> to the argument provided identifies the following defective argument types:

- **<RR>**: Faulty Repetition of Proposition
- **<IR>**: Inconclusive Reason
- **<DEP>**: Ambiguous Language

These defects highlight how the argument fails to provide clear, testable, and valid support for Edward Johns' claim of being psychic.
