For 
To analyze the sentence "In March, 5G was introduced and then we all got COVID" using the defective argument types defined:

**IDAA: Identify Defective Argument Application**

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The statement does not seem to generalize from a few instances to a broader claim, so this doesn't fit.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - It doesn't list possibilities or alternatives incompletely, so this doesn't fit either.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - This could apply because the statement provides a sequence of events without a conclusive reason connecting them. The mere introduction of 5G and the onset of COVID does not establish a causal relationship.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - This argument type is very relevant here. The statement suggests a causal relationship between the introduction of 5G and the onset of COVID without sufficient evidence to support such a claim.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - The statement does not seem to repeatedly assert the proposition, so this doesn't fit.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - The statement does not assert that a consensus exists or presume one, so this doesn't fit.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - The language is not inherently ambiguous, but it can be misleading. However, this is not the primary defect here.

Based on the above analysis, the most fitting defective argument types for the given statement are:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**

Thus, the statement "In March, 5G was introduced and then we all got COVID" is an example of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
