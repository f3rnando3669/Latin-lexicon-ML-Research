For 
"Either you love me, or you hate me." is an example of a type of defective argument known as a False Dilemma or False Dichotomy.

False Dilemma (or False Dichotomy) is a logical fallacy that occurs when only two choices are presented, yet more exist. These choices are usually mutually exclusive and lead the audience to believe that no middle ground is possible.

In your provided notation system, there isn't a direct match for False Dilemma among the defective argument types listed. However, if we extend the idea of how these defective arguments might indirectly fit, we might argue that it involves elements of:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: because it fails to consider other possible options (such as neutrality, ambivalence, or other nuanced feelings). This fallacy does not enumerate all possible outcomes.

Therefore, applying **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)** to "Either you love me, or you hate me." could be appropriate to indicate that the statement does not account for the complete range of possible emotions or reactions one could have.
