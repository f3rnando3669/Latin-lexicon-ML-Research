For 
<Statement>: "Jose, join us because everybody will come to the party and only you will be left behind."

### Analysis and Identification of Defective Argument Attributes (IDAA):

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - The argument assumes that everyone will attend the party, which may not be true. 
   - This is a classic case of overgeneralization without concrete evidence to support the claim.
   - **Application: (G)**

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - The argument fails to consider exceptions or other possibilities. Not every person is necessarily going to the party.
   - **Application: (FE)**

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - The reason given is based on the claim that everyone will come. It does not account for individual preferences or circumstances Jose might have.
   - **Application: (IR)**

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - The causal link between everyone attending and Jose being left behind is weak. There could be myriad other reasons why Jose might choose not to attend, and this doesn't guarantee isolation.
   - **Application: (WCB)**

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - The argument repeats the proposition that everyone will attend without providing additional evidence or reasoning.
   - **Application: (RR)**

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - It presumes that consensus (everyone attending) is a valid or compelling reason for Jose to attend without considering his individual situation or desires.
   - **Application: (FU)**

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - The statement "everybody will come" is ambiguous. It doesn't clearly define who "everybody" is or account for any specifics.
   - **Application: (DEP)**

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
