For 
<IDAA> stands for identifying defective argument applications. 

In the dialogue:

**Pvt. Joe Bowers:** What are these electrolytes? Do you even know?
**Secretary of State:** They're... what they use to make Brawndo!
**Pvt. Joe Bowers:** But why do they use them to make Brawndo?
**Secretary of Defense:** [raises hand after a pause] Because Brawndo's got electrolytes.

Let's apply the defective arguments defined:

1. **Secretary of State:** "They're... what they use to make Brawndo!"
   - This response doesn't really address the question of what electrolytes are but instead just states that they are used in Brawndo. This could be seen as an **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** because it provides an incomplete answer that doesnâ€™t fully explain what electrolytes are.

2. **Secretary of Defense:** "Because Brawndo's got electrolytes."
   - This statement is circular and doesn't provide any new information; it merely repeats the proposition that Brawndo has electrolytes without explaining why. This can be categorized as a **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**.

So, identifying the defects:

- **Secretary of State's** response: <FE>
- **Secretary of Defense's** response: <RR>
