For 
The argument provided can be analyzed to identify if it falls under any of the defective argument types defined (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>):

**Argument:** "He was born to Catholic parents and raised as a Catholic until his confirmation in 8th grade. Therefore, he is bound to want to defend some Catholic traditions and, therefore, cannot be taken seriously."

**Identification and Analysis of Argument Type (IDAA):**

1. **Generalization (<G>):** 
   - The argument might be seen as a generalization because it suggests that due to his upbringing, he will want to defend Catholic traditions. This implies a broad assumption about behavior based on limited information.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** 
   - This argument doesn't enumerate all the possible outcomes of being raised Catholic but jumps to a specific conclusion. However, this defect is less prominent than generalization.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The reason provided (his upbringing) does not strongly or conclusively support the conclusion that he cannot be taken seriously. The link between upbringing and current incapability to be serious is not strongly established.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The argument implies a cause (Catholic upbringing) leads to the effect (defending Catholic traditions) without providing sufficient causal evidence.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - This type of argument defect does not seem to be present here as the proposition is not reiterated faultily.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - This does not seem to rely on a presumptuous consensus. Itâ€™s based on presumed characteristics due to upbringing rather than assumed agreement of others.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - The language used in the argument is quite straightforward without notable ambiguity.

After analyzing the argument, the most fitting defective argument type seems to be **Generalization (<G>)**:

**Tagging:**

**<G> "He was born to Catholic parents and raised as a Catholic until his confirmation in 8th grade. Therefore, he is bound to want to defend some Catholic traditions and, therefore, cannot be taken seriously."**

This analysis points out that the argument makes an unjustified generalization about the individual's beliefs and behaviors based on their upbringing.
