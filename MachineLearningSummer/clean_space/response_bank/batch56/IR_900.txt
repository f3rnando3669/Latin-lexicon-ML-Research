Alright, let's analyze the provided argument using the defective argument types you defined:

**Argument Breakdown:**

1. **Mob of people:** "Lower taxes! Lower taxes!"
2. **Politician:** "People, your taxes are high because of illegal immigrants. That's right—illegal immigrants. We need to get rid of them."
3. **Mob of people:** (murmuring amongst themselves) "Hmmm... immigrants. Let's get rid of them!"

**Defective Arguments Analysis:**

1. **Generalization (G):** 
   - The politician generalizes that illegal immigrants are the cause of high taxes without providing sufficient evidence or considering other potential reasons.
   - **Example:** "Your taxes are high because of illegal immigrants."

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** 
   - The politician selectively points to one cause (illegal immigrants) for high taxes, ignoring other possible factors like government spending, economic policies, etc.
   - **Example:** Failing to list other reasons for high taxes and solely blaming immigrants.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** 
   - The connection between illegal immigrants and high taxes is asserted without solid evidence or a conclusive argument.
   - **Example:** "We need to get rid of them" based on the unproven claim that they are the sole cause of high taxes.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - The statement assumes a direct causal link between illegal immigration and higher taxes without demonstrating a clear mechanism or evidence to support this relationship.
   - **Example:** "Your taxes are high because of illegal immigrants."

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** 
   - The politician repeats the claim about illegal immigrants being the cause without logical backing or additional support.
   - **Example:** "...Your taxes are high because of illegal immigrants. That's right—illegal immigrants."

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - The politician attempts to create a consensus by asserting a commonly-held belief (illegal immigrants as the cause) and expecting the mob to agree without proper deliberation.
   - **Example:** "That's right—illegal immigrants" assumes shared agreement without evidence.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - The term "illegal immigrants" is used in a way that may be overly broad and stereotypical, potentially encompassing a wide range of individuals without distinction.
   - **Example:** "Illegal immigrants" can be an ambiguous term, failing to specify which individuals or actions are directly responsible for the issue.

**Summary:**

The argument provided is rife with defective argumentation, most notably Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), and Ambiguous Language (DEP). These fallacies collectively undermine the argument’s validity and robustness. The politician's claim that illegal immigrants are the sole cause of high taxes lacks proper evidence, dismisses other potential factors, and employs ambiguous and repetitive language to form a presumptive consensus.
