The defective argument type in the given example can be identified as <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration).

Here is the reasoning for labeling it as <FE>:

**Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** refers to drawing a conclusion based on a sample that is not representative of the entire population. 

In this case, the argument reaches a conclusion about the beliefs of "most Americans" based on a sample of over 10,000 scientists from colleges and universities. Scientists, especially those in academic settings, might have different belief patterns compared to the general population. Therefore, the sample does not accurately represent the diverse views of all Americans.

So, the application of the defective argument type <FE> is:

**Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** - The argument concludes that most Americans no longer believe in God based on the beliefs of a non-representative sample (over 10,000 scientists at colleges and universities).
