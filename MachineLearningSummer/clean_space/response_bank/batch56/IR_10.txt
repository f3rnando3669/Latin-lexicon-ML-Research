The argument given is as follows:

"This herbal supplement is made from a plant that grows in Zambia. It must be healthier than taking that medication, which is full of chemicals I can't pronounce."

Let's identify and apply the defective argument types to this statement:

1. **Generalization (G):** The argument assumes that because the herbal supplement is made from a plant that grows in Zambia, it must be healthier. This is a generalization that does not take into account the actual effects or scientific evidence regarding the supplement and the medication.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument does not consider all possibilities and assumes that the only options are the herbal supplement or the medication. It does not take into account other medications or treatments that might be healthier.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The argument presents an inconclusive reason, stating that because the medication contains chemicals that are hard to pronounce, it must be less healthy. The difficulty in pronouncing the chemicals has no bearing on their health effects.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The argument lacks a causal basis to connect the origin of the herbal supplement (plant in Zambia) to its health benefits compared to the medication. There is no evidence provided to substantiate this causal relationship.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The argument repeats the notion that natural is better without providing substantial reasoning, relying instead on the repetition of the assertion that chemical names are hard to pronounce as a reason for them being unhealthy.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument presumes a consensus that natural supplements are healthier without providing evidence or acknowledging differing viewpoints within the scientific community.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The term "healthier" is ambiguous and not defined clearly in the context of which specific health benefits are being referred to. It creates ambiguity about what metrics or criteria are being used to judge healthiness.

Thus, applying <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Types) to the statement provides the following analysis:

"This herbal supplement is made from a plant that grows in Zambia. It must be healthier than taking that medication, which is full of chemicals I can't pronounce."
- [Generalization (G)]
- [Incomplete Enumeration (FE)]
- [Inconclusive Reason (IR)]
- [Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)]
- [Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)]
- [Presumptuous Consensus (FU)]
- [Ambiguous Language (DEP)]

This analysis shows that the argument contains multiple defective elements, making it unconvincing and logically unsound.
