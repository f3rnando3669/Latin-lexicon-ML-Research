For 
The argument provided, "If you were a true Catholic, you would never eat meat on Friday even if it was the only food available," appears to contain a type of defective argument that can be analyzed. Let’s consider which among the defined defective arguments it falls under:

1. **Generalization (G):** This involves drawing a broad conclusion from limited evidence.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This happens when all possible options are not considered.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This occurs when the reasons provided do not conclusively support the conclusion.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This involves a lack of sufficient evidence to support a causal relationship.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This happens when a proposition is repeated without significant support or justification.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This occurs when an argument presumes that a consensus exists without evidence that it really does.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** This involves the use of vague or ambiguous terms that can be interpreted in different ways.

The statement "If you were a true Catholic, you would never eat meat on Friday even if it was the only food available,” is making a generalization about what it means to be a “true Catholic.” It implies a sweeping rule without acknowledging the complexities or exceptions that might exist within the Catholic faith or individual circumstances. This fits the definition of a **Generalization (G)**. 

Furthermore, it fails to consider possible exceptions or differing interpretations within the Catholic faith, which can also indicate **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, since not all perspectives or possibilities are being accounted for.

Thus, applying <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument and Analyze), the argument can be classified primarily as:

**<G>: Generalization**
**<FE>: Incomplete Enumeration**

With this understanding, we see that the argument overgeneralizes the concept of being a "true Catholic" and also fails to enumerate or consider all possible views or exceptions within the faith regarding eating meat on Friday.
