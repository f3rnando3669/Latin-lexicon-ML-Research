For 
To determine the defective argument type for the statement "Guys are messy and unclean, but are really hard workers.", we analyze it as follows:

This statement involves a broad generalization about an entire group (guys), which makes sweeping claims about their cleanliness and work ethic.

Given the types of defective arguments:

- <G> Generalization: This applies to arguments that make broad, sweeping statements about a group based on limited evidence.
- <FE> Incomplete Enumeration: This refers to arguments that claim exhaustive enumeration but actually leave out significant items.
- <IR> Inconclusive Reason: Arguments that present premises which do not conclusively support the conclusion.
- <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis: Arguments that claim a causal relationship without adequate evidence.
- <RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition: Arguments that restate the proposition without providing new evidence.
- <FU> Presumptuous Consensus: Arguments that assume a consensus without proper justification.
- <DEP> Ambiguous Language: Arguments that rely on vague or unclear terms.

The statement "Guys are messy and unclean, but are really hard workers." primarily falls under:

<G> Generalization

This is because it makes a general claim about guys being messy and hard workers based on an assumption, without specific supporting evidence.

So, the correct application of the defective argument type to the statement is:

"Guys are messy and unclean, but are really hard workers." is an example of <G> Generalization.
