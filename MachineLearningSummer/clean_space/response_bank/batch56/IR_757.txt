For 
The statement "You can't prove that space aliens don't exist, so they must be real" is an example of a logical fallacy known as **Argument from Ignorance** or **Appeal to Ignorance**. This fallacy occurs when it is asserted that a proposition is true because it has not yet been proven false, or vice versa. In this case, the argument incorrectly concludes that space aliens must exist simply because their non-existence has not been proven.

Given the defective argument types defined:
- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**

The argument from ignorance doesn't neatly fit one of these predefined types, as these focus on different specific issues such as generalizations, incomplete lists, inconclusive reasons, etc. However, it does share some characteristics with a lack of sufficient basis for its conclusion, which could have some parallels to **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, although not perfectly.

Therefore, the argument from ignorance here is a distinct logical fallacy not precisely represented by the defective argument types you have listed.
