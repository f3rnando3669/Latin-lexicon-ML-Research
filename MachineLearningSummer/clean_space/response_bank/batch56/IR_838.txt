Certainly! Let's break down the argument, "How many school shootings should we tolerate before we change the gun laws?", using the defined defective argument types.

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - If the argument assumes that all or most people support changing gun laws based on school shootings, it falls under Generalization. It generalizes a specific occurrence (school shootings) to impose a policy change.
   - However, this specific argument doesn't directly generalize; it instead raises a rhetorical question aimed at addressing policy change.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - If the argument presents a limited set of options without considering other factors or potential solutions, it is an Incomplete Enumeration. 
   - In this case, the argument doesn't enumerate options directly; it implies a demand to change gun laws after a certain number of school shootings, thus can partially be seen as listing incomplete solutions or responses.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - If the argument doesn’t provide conclusive evidence that changing gun laws would reduce school shootings, it falls under Inconclusive Reason.
   - This argument assumes a causal relationship between school shootings and gun laws without presenting evidence that changing the laws would reduce school shootings.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - If the argument suggests a causal relationship without sufficient evidence, it indicates an Insufficient Causal Basis.
   - This argument implies that changing gun laws will directly affect the number of school shootings, but doesn't provide evidence to support this causality.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - If the argument repeats the same proposition without additional support or reasoning, it falls under Faulty Repetition of Proposition.
   - This specific argument does not exhibit repetition of a proposition; it presents a rhetorical question to provoke thought without repeating points.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - If the argument assumes everyone agrees on the need to change gun laws, it is Presumptuous Consensus.
   - This argument implies that there is a widespread agreement or a consensus on changing gun laws due to school shootings without evidence of such universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - If the argument uses vague or ambiguous language, leading to multiple interpretations, it falls under Ambiguous Language.
   - The term "change the gun laws" is somewhat ambiguous as it doesn't specify how the laws should be changed, leaving the specifics open to interpretation.

The argument “How many school shootings should we tolerate before we change the gun laws?” can be dissected into the following defective argument types:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** - The argument implies there are only two options: tolerate school shootings or change the gun laws, without considering other possible solutions.
   
2. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** - There is an implied but unproven assumption that changing gun laws will prevent or reduce school shootings.

3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** - The argument suggests that changing the gun laws will directly impact the frequency of school shootings without providing a causal link or evidence.

4. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)** - There is an implicit assumption that the consensus is to change gun laws in response to school shootings without substantiation of such consensus.

5. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)** - "Change the gun laws" is an ambiguous phrase that doesn't specify how the laws should be changed.

This analysis shows multiple defective argument types within the statement, making it a complex and potentially flawed argument without further clarification and evidence.
