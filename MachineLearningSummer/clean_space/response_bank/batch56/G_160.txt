For 
<IDAA> stands for **Identifying Defective Argument Types** and Application of these types to a given argument. 

Let's apply <IDAA> to the provided statement:

**Statement:** "Passing federal laws to control the amount of violence in music is the first step in a process that will result in absolute government control of the media and total censorship over all forms of artistic expression."

### Analysis:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: 
   - The statement makes a broad generalization that passing any law to control violence in music will inevitably lead to total government control of the media and all artistic expression. This is a slippery slope fallacy that assumes one action will lead directly to a drastic and extreme outcome without sufficient evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The statement ignores other possible outcomes or intermediary steps between regulating violent music and achieving total media control. It presents a false dichotomy where no middle ground exists.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The reasoning is inconclusive because it lacks concrete evidence or logical progression that definitively connects controlling music violence to absolute control and censorship. The causation is asserted without any supporting evidence.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - There is clearly an insufficient causal basis as the statement assumes a direct causal link between controlling music violence and total government control without justification or substantial evidence. The relationship between the initial action and the purported final outcome is not adequately established.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - The argument can be seen as an iteration of a common 'slippery slope' or 'domino theory' fallacy often repeated without solid grounding. This implies the faulty repetition of a proposition where one small change will lead to drastic consequences.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - While it's less evident in this isolated statement, there may be an implicit assumption that people generally agree with the slippery slope argument, thereby assuming consensus without evidence. This consensus might not really exist but is presumed by the speaker to strengthen the argument.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - The statement doesn't deeply rely on ambiguous language; however, terms like "absolute government control" and "total censorship" are extreme and emotionally charged. These terms may be used to evoke fear without clarifying what such control or censorship would practically entail.

### Conclusion:
The provided statement reflects multiple defective argument types. The main types identified are Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), and Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>). These faulty argument types illustrate how the statement lacks logical coherence and credible evidence to support its claims.
