The argument in question appears to be a classic example of the slippery slope fallacy, which suggests that a relatively small first step leads to a chain of related events culminating in some significant impact, often negative and typically improbable.

To analyze this argument in the context of the defective argument types provided:

- **Generalization (G)**: This argument does not make a broad claim based on limited evidence, so it doesn't fit this category.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This argument doesn't fail by listing reasons incompletely, hence not fitting.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument might fall under this, as it leaps to a massive conclusion without solid evidence connecting eating a piece of chocolate directly to a 20 lbs weight gain.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This type precisely fits the argument since there is no sufficient causal basis showing that eating one piece of chocolate will lead to a 20 lbs weight gain.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The argument does not repetitively restate the same proposition in an attempt to validate it.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This does not rely on the assumption that others agree, so it doesn’t apply here.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language used is quite clear about its meaning, so it doesn’t fall under this type.

Therefore, the defective argument type (IDAA) that applies to "No! Don't eat that piece of chocolate. Today, it's one piece of chocolate, but tomorrow, you've gained 20 lbs!” is primarily **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. There is no plausible causal chain that justifies the large jump in consequences based on the initial action described.
