The exchange between Bill and Dave contains a defective argument type usually referred to as an Ad Hominem attack, not previously defined in your list. However, in their discussion, neither Bill’s belief nor his arguments are addressed directly by Dave due to explanation based on Bill's political affiliation. If we are restricted to your specified types, none fit perfectly, though Dave's argument may also display a form of presumptuous consensus (<FU>):

Identifying Defective Argument Type <FU>:
**Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This defective argument involves assuming that what someone believes or argues is inherently flawed because it aligns with a group consensus, without critically evaluating the actual arguments presented.

In the given exchange:
- **Bill says:** "I believe that Obamacare is wrong."
- **Dave responds:** "Of course you would say that, you're a Republican."

Dave dismisses Bill's arguments by presuming that his opinions are automatically invalidated due to his political affiliation, implying that Republicans will uniformly criticize Obamacare regardless of individual reasoning or merit behind their opinions. Thus, Dave’s response overlooks Bill's actual reasons or arguments against Obamacare and instead uses Bill's affiliation as the basis for judgment.

Therefore, the appropriate application in this context can be:

<**FU**>
