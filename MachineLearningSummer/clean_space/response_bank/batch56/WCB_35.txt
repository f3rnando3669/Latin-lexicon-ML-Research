For 
**IDAA (Identify Defective Argument Application):**

The statement: "Someone really should move this ‘deer crossing’ sign. This is a dangerous stretch of highway and the deer really should be crossing somewhere else."

This argument can be identified as an example of:

**<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**

Explanation: The reasoning provided in the statement implies that by moving the deer crossing sign, deer behavior will change, causing them to cross the road at a different, presumably safer, location. This shows an insufficient causal basis because the behavior of wild animals is not influenced by the location of signs placed by humans. Thus, the conclusion that moving the sign will lead the deer to cross somewhere else is not sufficiently supported by the reasoning given.
