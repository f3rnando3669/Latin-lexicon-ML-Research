To apply the defective argument types programmatically under the label "<IDAA>", we need to identify which of the defective argument types apply to the statement "All women are bad drivers."

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The statement "All women are bad drivers" can be classified as a Generalization. It takes a specific characteristic and applies it universally without sufficient evidence. It assumes that all members of a group possess the same attribute.
   - **Application**: <G>

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The statement also fits into Incomplete Enumeration because it implies that there are no exceptions or variations within the group of women drivers, which is an incomplete consideration of the evidence.
   - **Application**: <FE>

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - This can be challenged as an Inconclusive Reason if the argument for women being bad drivers is based on inconclusive or insufficient evidence.
   - **Application**: <IR>

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - If the argument suggests that being a woman is a direct cause of being a bad driver, it lacks a sufficient causal basis. There could be many other factors that contribute to driving ability that are not considered.
   - **Application**: <WCB>

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - If the statement is repeatedly asserted without additional evidence or reasoning, it falls under Faulty Repetition of Proposition.
   - **Application**: **Not fitting** (unless the claim is repetitively being used in different contexts without new evidence).

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - If the statement is being made on the assumption that most people agree with it without evidence of such a consensus, it can be seen as Presumptuous Consensus.
   - **Application**: <FU>

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - While not necessarily ambiguous in wording, we can argue that the terms "bad drivers" might be subjective and open to interpretation, but this is not a strong fitting in comparison to the others.
   - **Application**: **Not fitting** (ambiguity is not the main issue here).

Given these considerations, the <IDAA> applicable to the statement "All women are bad drivers." includes:

**<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <FU>**

So, the complete <IDAA> application can be written as:

**"All women are bad drivers." <IDAA> <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <FU>**
