For 
The argument in the statement "Marie notices that many of her friends have started eating a low-carb diet and drinking protein shakes. Marie decides that this must be the healthy way to eat, so she joins them." can be analyzed as follows in terms of defective argument types:

- **<IDAA> Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Marie is assuming that just because many of her friends are following a low-carb diet and drinking protein shakes, it must be the healthy way to eat. This is presumptive because it relies on the consensus of her friends rather than any scientific evidence or expert opinion on nutrition.

So, applying <IDAA>, we classify the defective argument type in the given statement as <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).
