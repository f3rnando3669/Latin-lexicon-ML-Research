For 
<IDAA> refers to identifying defective argument types within a given statement. Let's apply it to the provided statement:

"I bought new shoes then my head started itching. I must be allergic to the shoes."

This argument can primarily be categorized under several defective argument types:

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The statement makes an assumption of causation from mere correlation. The purchase of new shoes and the head itching are coincidental events, but there's no causal evidence provided to support that the shoes caused the itching.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument is inconclusive because it jumps to a conclusion without sufficient evidence. There could be multiple other reasons for the head itching, but these are not considered.

Therefore, the primary defective argument types for this statement are:

- <WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis
- <IR>: Inconclusive Reason
