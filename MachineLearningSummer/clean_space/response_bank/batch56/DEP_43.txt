For 
<IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Application) can be applied to the given argument as follows:

1. **Stating the Argument:**

   - **Premise 1:** Only man is rational.
   - **Premise 2:** No woman is a man.
   - **Conclusion:** Therefore, no woman is rational.

2. **Analyzing the Argument:**

   - **Premise 1 Analysis (Only man is rational):**
     - The term "man" can be interpreted ambiguously. It could mean "human beings" generically, which includes both men and women, or it could mean "males" specifically. This raises a potential <DEP> (Ambiguous Language) issue.
   
   - **Premise 2 Analysis (No woman is a man):**
     - If "man" in Premise 1 means "males," then this premise holds true. However, suppose "man" means "human beings" in Premise 1 but "males" in Premise 2. In that case, there's a discrepancy in the interpretation which again highlights an ambiguity problem, suggesting <DEP> (Ambiguous Language).

3. **Identifying Defective Argument Types:**
   - **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language):** The key problem here is the ambiguity in the term "man." If "man" means "human beings" in Premise 1, then Premise 1 should be rephrased for clarity to something like "Only human beings are rational." However, if "man" means "males," the argument structure may seem valid but misleading as it relies on the ambiguity to conclude something about women. 
   - **If we assume "man" is used correctly in both premises, then the argument can be seen as a form of <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) as it tries to causally connect unrelated premises (attribute rationality exclusively to men).**
