For 
The argument "Oh please, what do you know about labor laws? You don't even have a job." can be addressed with <IDAA>, which we will define here as an acronym for Identifying Defective Argument As:

This statement seems to be a type of defective argument called an **Ad Hominem** attack. Instead of addressing the validity of the person's knowledge or argument regarding labor laws, it dismisses their point based on their employment status. This fallacy attacks the individual's circumstances rather than the issue at hand.

So, applying <IDAA>:

The statement "Oh please, what do you know about labor laws? You don't even have a job." is a **defective argument type called Ad Hominem**. It dismisses the argument about labor laws by attacking the person's employment status, which is irrelevant to their knowledge of the subject matter.
