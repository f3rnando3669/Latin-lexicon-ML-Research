For 
<IR> - Inconclusive Reason: The argument "Mr. Casal was very tired because he had no energy" is an example of an inconclusive reason. The statement is essentially circular or tautological because it uses the concept of lack of energy to explain why Mr. Casal was tired, without providing an external factor that caused the tiredness. To improve the argument, additional information should be provided to establish a clearer causal chain (e.g., "Mr. Casal was very tired because he had been working late hours every night").
