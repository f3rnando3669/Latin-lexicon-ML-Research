Given the definitions of the defective argument types:

- **Generalization (G)**: Making a broad statement based on limited evidence or a small sample size.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Presenting a list that appears complete but omits relevant evidence or cases.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Using a premise that does not adequately support the conclusion.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Claiming a cause-and-effect relationship without sufficient evidence.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Repeating a statement as a form of evidence without providing additional support.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Claiming something is true because it is believed by a supposed consensus without verifying the consensus.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Using vague, unclear, or equivocal language that leads to confusion or misunderstanding.

Applying **IDAA** (Identification of Defective Argument's Attribute) to the statement:

"**All sports car drivers are too aggressive!**"

This statement represents a type of Generalization (<G>). The assertion makes a broad claim about all sports car drivers based on a likely insufficient sample size or anecdotal evidence, fitting the definition of a generalization.
