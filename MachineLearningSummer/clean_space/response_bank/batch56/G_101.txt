For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application. Given the argument provided, let's apply IDAA to pinpoint which defective argument types are being used:

"If we control Covid-19 with measures that are too draconian, we could wind up with a government that regularly clamps down on its citizens, with bar codes on wrists and cameras in your houses that watch you all the time."

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - This argument suggests that any draconian measures could lead to extreme results without evidence to support such a broad claim. It's over-generalizing the potential consequences.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - This argument fails to consider other possible outcomes of implementing strict measures that do not include extreme government surveillance.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The reasoning here is speculative and lacks concrete evidence to link current measures directly to the dystopian outcome described. The causal connection is not sufficiently established.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - The argument does not provide sufficient evidence to establish the causality between controlling Covid-19 with strict measures and ending up with a totalitarian regime.

5. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - The terms "draconian measures" and "regularly clamps down" are somewhat vague and open to interpretation, leading to ambiguity in understanding the actual risk or extent of the measures.

Based on the analysis, the argument mainly exhibits the following defective argument types: **Generalization (G)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, and **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**.

This covers the major ways in which the argument is potentially defective.
