Given the instruction to apply defective argument types to the statement "men don’t cry," it's useful to identify any logical fallacies or issues with the argument presented by the statement.

1. **Generalization <G>:**
   - "Men don’t cry" is a sweeping generalization that applies a characteristic to all men based on a stereotype. This type of argument overlooks individual differences and exceptions.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>:**
   - The statement "men don’t cry" fails to acknowledge the variety of emotional expressions and experiences among men. It does not consider men who do cry, providing an incomplete picture.

3. **Inconclusive Reason <IR>:**
   - There is no substantial evidence given to support the claim that men don't cry. The assertion lacks a solid basis and relies on cultural stereotypes rather than empirical data.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>:**
   - The statement implies that there is a natural or inherent reason why men do not cry, but it does not provide any causal explanation. It ignores the influence of social and cultural factors that might lead to this behavior.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>:**
   - If the statement is repeated often without evidence, it becomes a faulty repetition. People might start believing it simply because it is repeated frequently, not because it is true.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>:**
   - The statement assumes a consensus that men don’t cry, but this presumption is not necessarily backed by the attitudes and beliefs of all men or all cultures.

7. **Ambiguous Language <DEP>:**
   - The phrase "men don’t cry" is ambiguous. It could mean men generally do not cry often, or that men are not supposed to cry. This ambiguity can lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations of the intended meaning.

By applying these defective argument types, we can see that the statement "men don’t cry" is flawed in several ways and relies on unsupported generalizations and stereotypes rather than factual evidence.
