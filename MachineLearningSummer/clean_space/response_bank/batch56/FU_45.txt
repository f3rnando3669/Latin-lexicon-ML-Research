The argument "Everybody know that staying out in the rain can make you sick" can be evaluated using the defined defective argument types as follows:

- **Defective Argument Type**: <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)

This argument appeals to what "everybody knows" as a presumed consensus without providing evidence or reasoning. It relies on the assumption that widespread belief equates to truth, which can be misleading.

**Logical Fallacy**: Argumentum ad Populum (Appeal to Popularity)
The fallacy here is an Appeal to Popularity, where the argument suggests that because many people believe something, it must be true. This is not a valid logical basis for concluding the truth of the statement.
