For 
To apply the specified defective argument types to the statement "Appealing to popularity or the fact that many people do something as an attempted form of validation," we can analyze it in relation to the definitions provided:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This defective argument type assumes that because something is true in one instance or a small number of instances, it must be true in a broader context. The statement about appealing to popularity doesn't directly fit this type.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This occurs when an argument falsely assumes all possibilities or instances have been considered. The statement about appealing to popularity does not directly fit this type either.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This is when the reason provided does not logically support the conclusion itâ€™s supposed to. The statement suggests that popularity alone validates an action or belief, which does not logically follow because popularity does not necessarily equate to validity.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This occurs when an argument claims a causal relationship without sufficient evidence. Although appealing to popularity involves insufficient evidence for validation, it is more about the consensus rather than causality.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This entails repeating a proposition in a flawed manner without providing additional evidence. The statement is suggesting repetition of consensus as a form of validation but isn't directly a repetition fallacy.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This is when an argument assumes that if many people agree, it must be true. The statement "appealing to popularity" directly fits this type, as it is making the argument that consensus equates to validation.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This refers to the use of language that is vague or has multiple meanings. The statement does not directly involve ambiguous language.

Based on the above analysis, the defective argument type that most accurately applies to "Appealing to popularity or the fact that many people do something as an attempted form of validation" is:

**Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
