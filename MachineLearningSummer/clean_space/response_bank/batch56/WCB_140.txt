For 
When analyzing the argument "Lois and Jan did a 'snow dance' one afternoon, and it snowed that night. They claimed to have brought the snow." we should identify any potential defective argument types, as requested. Let's apply the given argument types to assess the deficiencies:

**<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:**
The claim that Lois and Jan brought the snow through their "snow dance" lacks a sufficient causal basis. There is no scientific or logical evidence connecting their dance to the event of snowfall. The proximity in time between the dance and the snowfall is coincidental and does not establish a causal relationship. The argument assumes causation from mere correlation.

Therefore, the primary defective argument type here is <WCB> due to the insufficient causal basis.
