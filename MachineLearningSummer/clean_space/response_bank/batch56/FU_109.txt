For 
The argument presented is "SM 2: The book being popular because it has been on the best-seller list for months." 

To analyze this argument for potential defects, I'll apply the types of defective arguments defined:

<IDAA> indicates that I need to determine which specific defective argument type(s) apply to the given statement.

1. **Generalization (G)**: This does not seem to be a generalization because it focuses on one specific book and its status, not drawing a broad conclusion from limited data.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This argument does not list instances selectively, attempting to draw a conclusion from a non-exhaustive list, so this type does not seem to apply.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason given ("on the best-seller list for months") could be a factor in determining a book's popularity, but it might not be conclusive evidence by itself. This hints at a possible inconclusive reason.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument assumes a direct causal relationship between being on the best-seller list and being popular. However, there could be other factors contributing to the book's popularity that are not being considered, implying an insufficient causal basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The argument does not appear to involve repeating a proposition to assert its truth, so this type does not seem to apply here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument does not claim or rely on a consensus to support its conclusion. It stays focused on the fact of the book's best-seller status.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language in the argument is quite clear and unambiguous.

Thus, applying <IDAA> to "SM 2: The book being popular because it has been on the best-seller list for months," we identify:
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**

These types describe the argument as potentially defective because simply being on a best-seller list for months may not conclusively or sufficiently account for why the book is popular.
