When analyzing the argument "A parent who says that the teacher doesn't know how to teach because she graduated from a community college," we need to identify the defective argument type or types present using the definitions provided.

The statement in question seems to rely on an assumption regarding the quality of education received at community colleges compared to other institutions. By focusing solely on the teacher's alma mater to judge their teaching ability, this argument might be classified as follows:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument makes a sweeping statement about the teacher's competence based solely on the fact that she graduated from a community college. It generalizes her ability to teach without considering her individual qualifications, experiences, or performance.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasoning that the teacher's ability is inferior solely because of where she graduated is not conclusive. It fails to connect the dots between the teacher's education and their actual teaching proficiency in a reliable way. 

Given these classifications, we can apply both <G> and <IR> to clarify why the argument made by the parent is defective:

- **<G> Generalization**: The argument generalizes all teachers from community colleges as being incompetent, which is an unfair and unsupported assertion.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The argument provides an incomplete and inconclusive reason for the teacher's ability, as it does not account for any other factors that contribute to teaching effectiveness.

Thus, the parentâ€™s argument can be marked with both `<G>` and `<IR>`.
