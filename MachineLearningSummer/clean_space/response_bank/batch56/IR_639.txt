For 
<IDAA> can be defined as a defective argument type called "Improper Dismissal or Approval based on Authority." This type of argument occurs when the acceptance or rejection of concepts is based on the authority or source of the information rather than the merit or evidence supporting the concept.

Example:
Person A: "Climate change is real and supported by scientific evidence."
Person B: "I don't accept climate change because the scientists are just trying to get more funding."

In this example, Person B is engaging in <IDAA> because they are rejecting the concept of climate change based on a perceived ulterior motive of the scientists, rather than evaluating the evidence presented by the scientific community.
