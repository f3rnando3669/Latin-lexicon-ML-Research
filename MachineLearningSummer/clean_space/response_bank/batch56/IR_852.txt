For 
<IDAA> is a code for Identifying Defective Arguments in Assertions. Let's analyze the statement "Warning! Smoking may cause frostbite?" to identify possible defective argument types.

1. **Generalization (G)**: The statement might be seen as a generalization if it implies that smoking generally causes frostbite, which is not a widely supported claim. However, the use of "may" typically weakens the assertion, so this defect might not strictly apply.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This does not apply here as the statement doesn't provide a list or mention enumerating causes.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Smoking leading to frostbite lacks a clear chain of causation and seems to be an inconclusive reason. The connection between smoking and frostbite is not immediately apparent or commonly understood.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is an insufficient causal basis as the statement asserts a cause (smoking) with an effect (frostbite) without providing any supporting evidence. This connection is not typically associated with smoking and lacks a medical or scientific basis, making the assertion weak.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This does not apply as the statement does not involve repeating a proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This does not apply because the statement does not claim that the consensus (or common belief) supports the idea that smoking causes frostbite.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language isnâ€™t particularly ambiguous in this context; it is quite direct in what it is stating.

So, the statement "Warning! Smoking may cause frostbite?" can be identified with the defective arguments:

**<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** and **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
