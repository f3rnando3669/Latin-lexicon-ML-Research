For 
The given argument "Why would you elect a mayor whose wife has been treated for alcohol addiction?" commits the logical fallacy known as "Ad Hominem" or "Guilt by Association." This fallacy occurs when someone attacks a person based on their associations or relationships instead of addressing the actual issue or argument.

In terms of defective argument types previously defined, it could relate to:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument generalizes that because the candidateâ€™s wife had an issue, it impacts the candidate's ability to govern, without evidence to support such a broad claim.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: If the argument repeatedly emphasizes the association to undermine the candidate without providing substantial reasoning.
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The argument uses the socially loaded and ambiguous issue of addiction to create a negative inference without clear connection or evidence.

So, applying <IDAA> to the given argument, you could frame it as an **Ad Hominem Fallacy** primarily, possibly overlapping with **Generalization**.
