For 
<IDAA> (Identification and Description of Argumentative Abuses) applied:

This argument can be dissected to identify multiple types of defective arguments:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument makes an implicit claim that because one boy with cancer lived somewhat near a power line, power lines must cause cancer. This overlooks other potential causes and does not consider a comprehensive set of data.

2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The claim that power lines cause cancer based on a single anecdote lacks sufficient scientific evidence or causal explanation. Correlation does not imply causation, and one example does not establish a causal link.

3. **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument generalizes from a single case (the little boy with cancer) to a broad conclusion about the danger of power lines, without sufficient supporting evidence.

4. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The emotional appeal endpoint ("I urge you to vote for this bill...") presumes that the audience will accept the conclusion based on the emotional impact of the anecdote rather than on logical reasoning and scientific evidence.

5. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The phrase "replace them with monkeys on treadmills" is not clearly defined or explained in terms of feasibility, effectiveness, or practical implications. This could be seen as introducing ambiguity into the argument.

Thus, the argument employs **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**, **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**, **<G> Generalization**, **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**, and **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**.
