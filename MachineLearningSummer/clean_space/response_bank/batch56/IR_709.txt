For 
The given sentence is:

"My dad went to school, so he knows everything about the education system."

To analyze this sentence using the defective argument types defined:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: This sentence may be considered a generalization because it assumes that the experience of one individual (the speaker’s dad) attending school is sufficient to understand the entire education system. This overlooks the complexity and diversity of experiences within educational systems.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument implies that going to school includes all possible experiences and knowledge required to understand the education system. It doesn’t consider other factors like administrative experience, diverse educational environments, or policy knowledge.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The conclusion that the dad knows everything about the education system because he went to school is not logically supported. Attending school doesn’t necessarily provide comprehensive knowledge about the entire education system.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal link between having attended school and knowing everything about the education system is weak. Experience as a student does not equate to an understanding of the complexities involved at all levels of the educational system.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This type might not apply here directly. "Faulty Repetition of Proposition" refers to instances where a claim is repeated as proof of itself.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This argument could imply a presumptuous consensus, assuming that the experience of going to school universally grants comprehensive knowledge of the education system, disregarding the need for broader consensus among different stakeholders and experts.

- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The term "everything about the education system" is extremely broad and ambiguous. It is unclear what aspects of the education system are being referred to, making the argument difficult to evaluate and leading to potential misunderstandings.

Given the definitions and types of defective arguments, multiple types could apply, but the sentence most strongly exhibits characteristics of **Generalization (<G>)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**, and **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**.
