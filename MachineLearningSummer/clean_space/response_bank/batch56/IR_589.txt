For 
The argument "'Our family has always been farmers, so we should always be farmers'" demonstrates a logical fallacy known as an Appeal to Tradition (also known as Argumentum ad Antiquitatem). It assumes that something is better or correct simply because it is older, traditional, or "has always been done." This type of argument is problematic because it relies on a tradition to justify a conclusion without providing a logical basis for why the tradition should continue.

So according to the context of the defective argument types:

- <G> Generalization: Broadly inferring properties or conclusions from a limited set of facts or evidence.
- <FE> Incomplete Enumeration: Drawing conclusions from an incomplete list of possibilities.
- <IR> Inconclusive Reason: Reasoning that does not logically justify the conclusion.
- <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis: Making causative claims without sufficient evidence to support the connection.
- <RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition: Repeating a proposition without providing additional support or evidence.
- <FU> Presumptuous Consensus: Assuming something is true because many (or some) people believe it to be true without sufficient evidence.
- <DEP> Ambiguous Language: Using language that is vague or can have multiple interpretations to support a claim.

The argument doesn't neatly fit into any of these specific defective argument types as defined, but the closest types based on the nature of the statement are likely:

- <IR> as it presents an Inconclusive Reason: The tradition alone does not logically justify why they should continue farming.
- <FU> if interpreted as assuming a consensus over generations without further evidence: Presuming that because it has always been a tradition within the family, it must be the right choice. 

Thus, "'Our family has always been farmers, so we should always be farmers'" is best categorized under <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and possibly <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).
