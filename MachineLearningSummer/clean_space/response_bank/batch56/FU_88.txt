For 
Applying the defined defective argument types (IDAA stands for Identification and Diagnosis of Argumentative Anomalies), we can diagnose the argument "Slavery is accepted by just about everyone in our society, so itâ€™s ethical to keep slaves" as follows:

1. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument claims that because slavery is accepted by everyone in society, it must be ethical. This assumes a consensus where agreement is mistakenly taken as proof of ethical correctness, which neglects the moral and ethical considerations that transcend mere social acceptance.

2. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The argument suggests that general societal acceptance (which itself is a type of proposition) directly proves the ethical standing of slavery. This is a flawed repetition where the acceptability within society is used to reinforce itself without addressing the ethical elements directly.

3. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The term "accepted" is ambiguous. It can mean tolerated, agreed with, or simply not actively opposed, yet each implies a different level of consent and ethical implication. The ambiguity here could lead to confusion about the real moral stance of the society being referenced.

By identifying and diagnosing the argument with these defective argument types, we can understand the argumentative flaws and the reasons why the conclusion is not justifiable.
