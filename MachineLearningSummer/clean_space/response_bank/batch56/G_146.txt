The argument presented by Justin can be identified as a slippery slope fallacy. This type of fallacy occurs when it is assumed that one action will lead to a series of other actions resulting in a significant and usually negative outcome, without sufficient evidence for such a progression.

With the defined defective argument types provided (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, and <DEP>), Justin's claim does not strictly match any one of these categories directly. However, it suggests a combination of elements from these types:

1. <IR> Inconclusive Reason: Justin's argument does not provide concrete evidence that passing a law to control violence in music will necessarily lead to absolute government control and censorship.
  
2. It borders on <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis, as it presumes a causal relation between the initial action and the extreme outcome without solid grounding.

Alternatively, with generalized identification, the most fitting answer using broader fallacy terminology would be identifying it as a slippery slope fallacy.
