For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Arguments Analysis) to the argument "A lion is a cat and cats are good pets so a lion must be a good pet," we need to identify which defective argument types are present.

1. **Generalization (G)** - This could be seen as a faulty generalization. The argument assumes that because some members of a category (cats) are good pets, all members of that category (including lions) are also good pets. However, lions and domestic cats have significant differences that make the generalization inappropriate.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** - This argument might be missing key examples or scenarios that would counter the conclusion. It doesn't consider all sorts of cats (like wild big cats) and their unsuitability as pets.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** - The reasoning that because some cats are good pets, a lion is also a good pet is inconclusive as it does not logically follow given the vast differences between domestic cats and lions.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** - There is an implied causation that being a cat leads to being a good pet, which is not adequately supported because not all cats share the same characteristics, especially between domestic cats and lions.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** - There isnâ€™t repetition in this argument, so <RR> does not apply here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** - The argument presumes a consensus or assumption that all cats are alike regarding suitability as pets, which isn't necessarily agreed upon by all or supported by evidence.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)** - The argument uses "cat" ambiguously, failing to distinguish between significantly different kinds of cats, such as domestic cats and wild lions.

The defective argument types present in this argument could be: 

- Generalization (G)
- Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
- Inconclusive Reason (IR)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
- Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
- Ambiguous Language (DEP)

Thus, we can see that the argument "A lion is a cat and cats are good pets so a lion must be a good pet" suffers from several defective argument types.
