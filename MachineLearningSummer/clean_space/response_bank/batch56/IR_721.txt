For 
The given argument can be broken down as follows:

"We have no evidence that the Illuminati ever existed. They must have been so clever they destroyed all the evidence."

Let’s apply the defined defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This does not seem to fit as the statement does not generalize from a sample to a whole.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This is not applicable because the argument does not present an incomplete list of possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The argument could be considered to fall under this category because it presents a conclusion (the cleverness of the Illuminati) without sufficient justification or convincing evidence. Simply having no evidence does not logically lead to the conclusion that they must be very clever.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This can be applied here because the cause (Illuminati's cleverness) is suggested without adequate support. There is no sufficient causal basis provided to link the absence of evidence specifically to the Illuminati’s clever actions.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This doesn’t fit because there’s no repetition of a proposition within this argument.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Not applicable here as the statement does not assume that since many people believe something, it must be true.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This could be seen as applicable in a nuanced manner as "no evidence" and the supposed cleverness of the Illuminati can be vague and open to multiple interpretations, but it is not the dominant flaw.

Given this analysis, the most applicable designations for the argument would be:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**

Thus, we can summarize as follows:

**<IDAA(IR, WCB)>**
"We have no evidence that the Illuminati ever existed. They must have been so clever they destroyed all the evidence."
