The argument presented is:

"Every time I go to sleep, the sun goes down. Therefore, my going to sleep causes the sun to set."

This argument has a logical flaw where it confuses correlation with causation. This specific type of defective argument would fall under the category you've defined as <WCB>, Insufficient Causal Basis. This means the argument lacks sufficient evidence to support the claimed causal relationship and instead merely observes a correlation.

So, the application of <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Type) to the argument would be:

<IDAA>: <WCB>

Explanation: The argument incorrectly assumes that a correlation (co-occurrence in time) between the two events (going to sleep and the sun setting) implies a causal relationship without providing any evidence for such causation.
