To apply the Identifying Defective Argument Types and Analysis (IDAA) to the statement "It takes faith to believe in God just like it takes faith to believe in the Easter Bunny -- but at least the Easter Bunny is based on a creature that actually exists!" let's break it down:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - The statement makes a broad generalization by equating belief in God with belief in the Easter Bunny. This is a type of over-simplification that doesn't take into account the differing contexts, nature, and evidence associated with both beliefs.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - This argument does not consider other entities or historical beliefs that could also be compared to belief in God. By only listing the Easter Bunny, it unfairly narrows the scope and doesn't present a complete enumeration of possible comparisons.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The reasoning that faith in God is analogous to faith in the Easter Bunny is inconclusive. It assumes that just because faith is required in both cases, the nature of the belief and what is believed are equivalent, which is a flawed reasoning.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - The causal link between belief in God and belief in the Easter Bunny is not sufficiently established. The statement lacks a robust causal explanation to support why these two beliefs should be considered parallel in terms of faith and existence.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - There is no direct repetition of the same proposition in the statement, so this defective argument type doesn't apply here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - The argument presumes that the audience will accept the consensus that believing in God is fundamentally the same as believing in the Easter Bunny, which may not reflect the actual consensus among the audience.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - The term "faith" can be ambiguous as it may mean different things in different contexts. The statement assumes that "faith" in God and "faith" in the Easter Bunny are the same, without clarifying what kind of faith it is referring to.

### Summary of Defective Argument Types (IDAA) present:
- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**

The argument primarily suffers from over-generalization, incomplete enumeration of examples, inconclusive reasoning, insufficient causal basis, presumptuous consensus, and ambiguous language, making it a statement with multiple defective argument types.
