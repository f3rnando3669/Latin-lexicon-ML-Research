For 
The argument provided is:

"One of our clients doubled their conversions after changing all their landing page text to bright red. Therefore, changing all text to red is a proven way to double conversions."

Let's analyze this argument for defective reasoning types defined:

1. **Generalization (\<G\>):** The argument generalizes the experience of one client to all possible scenarios. The fact that one client doubled conversions does not necessarily mean that the same result will hold true universally.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>):** The argument does not consider other possible factors or variables that could have affected the client's conversions. It singles out changing text to red as the sole reason without evaluating alternative causes.
   
3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>):** There is no sufficient causal evidence provided to support the claim that changing text to red alone led to the conversion increase. Other factors could have contributed to the observed outcome.
   
Based on the definitions, the defective argument types present in this argument are:

1. **Generalization (\<G\>)**
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)**
3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**

Therefore, applying the defective argument analysis, we identify this argument as holding the types: 
<G, FE, WCB>.
