For 
The argument provided is: 

"Men score better on math than women do. Jerry is a man. Therefore, Jerry is better at math than Sylvia, who is a woman."

To apply our definitions of defective argument types (<IDAA>) to this statement, we should analyze it to identify which defective argument types, if any, it exhibits.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument assumes that because men, in general, score better on math than women, any individual man (Jerry) will necessarily be better at math than any individual woman (Sylvia). This is an overgeneralization because it ignores individual differences and other contributing factors that might affect math skills.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This argument does not provide a comprehensive overview of all possible factors or instances. It assumes that the comparison between men and women regarding math scores is sufficient to conclude the relative abilities of any two individuals from these groups without considering specific data about Jerry and Sylvia.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasoning is inconclusive because it relies on group averages or general trends rather than specific evidence about Jerry and Sylvia. The conclusion about Jerry being better at math than Sylvia is not supported by the premises provided.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This argument lacks a sufficient causal basis as it jumps from a statistical observation (men scoring better on math) to a definitive causal statement regarding individuals without establishing a direct causal link for Jerry and Sylvia.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This does not seem to involve the repetition of the same proposition; the defective argument type <RR> does not apply here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This argument does not appeal to any consensus or majority opinion; it is based on an assertion about group differences in mathematics performance between men and women. Therefore, <FU> does not apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: There is no linguistic ambiguity evident in the argument. The terms used are quite straightforward. Therefore, <DEP> does not apply.

Given the analysis, the argument "Men score better on math than women do. Jerry is a man. Therefore, Jerry is better at math than Sylvia, who is a woman." can be identified as being defective primarily due to **Generalization (<G>)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**, **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
