<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Applied Analysis. To determine if the argument or appeal used in the phrases from the Declaration of Independence— specifically "appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world" and "with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence"—fits one of the defined defective argument types, we should analyze the nature of the appeal.

The phrases "appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world" and "with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence" invoke divine authority and support. These appeals are based on a higher, often religious, authority to justify the actions and position of the signatories.

Here is the analysis:

- The appeal to "the Supreme Judge of the world" and "divine providence" might not directly fit into the categories defined as <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP> since these defective argument types are typically more specific to logical fallacies or argumentative errors.

However, if we consider whether these appeals presume a consensus among the audience based on shared religious beliefs, it can potentially fall under:

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** These appeals assume a shared worldview of divine authority among the audience, which might not apply uniformly to all readers or listeners. If the argument presumes that everyone accepts the authority of a divine judge or providence without substantive support for this presumption, it might be seen as faulty in appealing to broadly accepted consensus without ensuring all parties necessarily agree with such religious justifications.

So, <IDAA> applied analysis would likely identify these phrases as most aligned with <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus), assuming the shared acceptance of divine authority without adequately accounting for differing beliefs.
