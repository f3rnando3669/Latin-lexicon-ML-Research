Sure! Let's apply the framework you've outlined to analyze the argument in the statement:

"I was assigned a personal trainer at the Rec, and he gave me a new workout program. But I don't have any confidence in his expertise, since he has obvious trouble controlling his own appetite."

First, let's identify the parts of the argument:

1. **Premise**: "I was assigned a personal trainer at the Rec, and he gave me a new workout program."
2. **Conclusion**: "I don't have any confidence in his expertise."
3. **Reasoning**: "since he has obvious trouble controlling his own appetite."

Now, let's apply the types of defective arguments to see if any fit this reasoning:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This doesn't seem to be a case of a broad generalization.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not list cases or items incompletely; it focuses on a specific individual.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning provided does not logically connect the trainer's appetite control with his professional expertise. Just because someone struggles with appetite does not necessarily infer incompetence in other areas.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument assumes a causal link between the trainer's personal discipline with appetite and his ability as a trainer without sufficient justification.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This is not applicable here, as the argument doesn't repeat a proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There is no attempt to suggest that a consensus exists or should be presumed.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language is clear and unambiguous in this context.

Given this analysis, the defective arguments most relevant here are:

- **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**: The argument fails to provide a conclusive reason for doubting the trainerâ€™s professional skills.
- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The argument assumes an unsubstantiated causal connection between the personal trainer's control over appetite and his professional expertise.

Therefore, the argument can be classified as follows:
**<IDAA> IR, WCB**
