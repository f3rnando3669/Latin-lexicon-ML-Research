For 
Applying the defective argument types to the statement "Over 99 billion people served…":

**Generalization (<G>):**
This statement might be seen as a Generalization because it implies that serving over 99 billion people is an indicator of high quality or widespread satisfaction, which may not necessarily be true in all cases. It fails to account for the diverse experiences and opinions of those 99 billion people.

**Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
This statement could exhibit Incomplete Enumeration if it suggests that the figure of "99 billion people served" encompasses all relevant data. It doesn't provide specific details such as the time frame, the distribution across different locations, or the satisfaction level of those served.

**Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
The argument might have Inconclusive Reasoning as it tries to draw a conclusion about quality or success solely based on the number of people served. The number itself doesn't necessarily indicate repeated satisfaction, quality service, or any detailed evaluation.

**Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
There is an Insufficient Causal Basis here because the high number of people served does not inherently cause or indicate a high level of service quality or customer happiness. It fails to establish a direct causal relationship between the number of people served and the company's success or quality of service.

**Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
The statement might also be categorized as Faulty Repetition if it is repeatedly used as a slogan or marketing phrase to suggest high quality or popularity without any further evidence. It is merely repeating the large number without justifying why that number should matter to potential customers.

**Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
The statement could be an example of Presumptuous Consensus by implying that since 99 billion people have been served, all those people are satisfied, endorsing, or recommending the service, which is presumptuous and likely false.

**Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
Lastly, the statement "Over 99 billion people served" might be using Ambiguous Language because "served" can be vague. It doesn't clarify whether the service met the customers' expectations, the context of the service, or specific criteria that define what it means to be 'served' in a beneficial way.

Using <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Application) on "Over 99 billion people served…", it is evident that multiple defects can be identified, making the statement a potentially unreliable measure of quality, customer satisfaction, or success.
