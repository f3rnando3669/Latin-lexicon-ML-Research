Applying the process of Identifying Defective Argument Applications (IDAA) to the given statement: 

"Because cases spiked rapidly in New York City back in March, it justified us closing down the whole country."

Let's break down the argument and identify any defects:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument could be seen as overgeneralizing since it takes the instance of New York City's situation and applies it to the entire country without considering local conditions elsewhere.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This argument may fall into incomplete enumeration since it looks at only one area (New York City) without enumerating or considering other areas that might not have had similar conditions.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: It could be argued that the reasoning here is inconclusive. Just because one city had a spike in cases doesn't necessarily provide a conclusive reason for a country-wide shutdown, unless more correlated data or causal links are shown.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is an assumption of a causal link (cases spiking in New York City ➔ need to close the country) without substantial evidence that this spike in one location causally necessitates the closures elsewhere.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This doesn't seem to apply here since the statement does not rely on repetitively reinforcing the same point incorrectly.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument assumes that the consensus or decision to close the country is justified by the situation in New York City alone, which may not accurately reflect collective agreement or sufficient reasoning.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language in the statement is relatively clear and direct, and doesn't seem to use ambiguities effectively to mislead or confuse.

In conclusion, the statement:
"Because cases spiked rapidly in New York City back in March, it justified us closing down the whole country."
primarily seems to suffer from **Generalization (G)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** as it extrapolates New York City’s experience to the entire country without adequate evidence that such a widespread action was necessary based on the conditions of a single location.
