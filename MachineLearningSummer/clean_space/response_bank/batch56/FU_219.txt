For 
The argument "This is an emotional appeal that speaks the concept that many people agree or disagree, so you should, too" can be analyzed and classified using defective argument types as follows:

This argument suggests that because many people agree or disagree with a concept, you should also conform to their stance. This implies a reliance on assumed widespread agreement or disagreement to persuade action or belief, rather than presenting substantive evidence or logical reasoning. 

Therefore, the defective argument type that best applies here is:

<FU> Presumptuous Consensus.

The revised argument identification would be:

<FU> This is an emotional appeal that speaks the concept that many people agree or disagree, so you should, too.
