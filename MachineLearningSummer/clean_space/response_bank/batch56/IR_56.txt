Certainly! Let's break down and analyze the statement "Check out the pretty lights. Don’t look behind the curtain." to identify any defective argument types (if any apply):

1. **Generalization (G)**: This is the exaggerated general statement drawn from insufficient evidence.
   - Not applicable directly as the statement mainly gives an imperative.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This occurs when the argument provides an incomplete list of possibilities.
   - Not applicable directly as the statement does not involve a list or enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This happens when the reason provided does not sufficiently support the conclusion.
   - "Pretty lights" could be seen as an appeal to distraction without a substantive reason, hence mildly applicable.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This occurs when an insufficient basis is provided to justify causation.
   - Not applicable in this case as causation is not discussed.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This occurs when an argument relies on the repetition of a proposition without substantiating it.
   - Not applicable as there is no repetitive proposition in the argument.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This happens when the argument relies on presumed agreement or consensus without real evidence.
   - Not applicable in this case as the argument does not imply consensus or majority agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This happens when the argument uses language that is vague or ambiguous.
   - "Pretty lights" is subjective and not specifically defined, but it doesn’t necessarily create ambiguity that affects the argument.

Given the definitions, the most fitting defective argument type for this statement is **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. The statement "Check out the pretty lights" does not provide a substantive reason why one should divert attention to the lights and away from what's behind the curtain. It's directing attention without providing a valid justification, making it inconclusive.

So, the final application of IDAA to the statement is:

**Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: the directive to focus on "pretty lights" gives no substantial reason and instead draws attention away from potentially important information behind the curtain.
