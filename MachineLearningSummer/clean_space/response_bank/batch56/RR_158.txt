The argument you've presented is often referred to as "begging the question" or "circular reasoning." This means it assumes the very thing it is trying to prove. Let's break it down with the identified defective argument types:

"It says in the Bible that God exists. Since the Bible is God's word, and God never speaks falsely, then everything in the Bible must be true. So, God must exist."

1. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The argument essentially repeats the proposition it is trying to prove. It starts with the assumption that the Bible is God’s word and then uses that to conclude that God exists, which is the very point under contention. This forms a circle and does not provide external validation.

2. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument presumes a consensus that the Bible is God’s word without obtaining any external confirmation. It assumes everyone already agrees with this point (which is not universally accepted) to support the conclusion.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning is inconclusive because it relies on a premise that requires independent validation. Simply stating that something is God's word because the book itself claims it does not necessarily provide conclusive or objective evidence.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: If we were to consider a causal link, stating the Bible is true because it says so offers insufficient causal basis. The causation provided lacks additional substantiation outside of the claim itself.

Overall, this argument is a clear example of circular reasoning, most appropriately classified under the <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition) but also touching upon aspects of <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus) and <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
