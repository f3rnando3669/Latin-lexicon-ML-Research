The argument in the dialogue between Lolita and Celina can be analyzed for its defective reasoning types as follows:

Lolita's statement: "Since about half the people in the world are female, the chances of the next person to walk out that door being female is about 50/50."

Let's apply the defective argument types (where relevant):

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Lolita makes a generalization about the global population's gender ratio and applies it directly to a specific, local, and context-dependent situation, which is faulty.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Lolita's reasoning can also be seen as an incomplete enumeration because she fails to consider the specific information about the context (i.e., the door leading to Dr. Vulvastein, the gynecologist).

Celina's rebuttal: "Do you realize that is the door to Dr. Vulvastein, the gynecologist?"

Celina points out a crucial piece of information that invalidates Lolita's generalization by introducing context-specific evidence. This sheds light on why Lolita's statistical reasoning is inappropriate for the situation at hand.

Thus, the most relevant defective argument types in this scenario are:

- <G>: Generalization
- <FE>: Incomplete Enumeration

Therefore, the appropriately tagged application would look like this:

Lolita: Since about half the people in the world are female, the chances of the next person to walk out that door being female is about 50/50. <G>, <FE>
Celina: Do you realize that is the door to Dr. Vulvastein, the gynecologist?
