For 
Applying the defined defective argument types to the statement "I have a right to free speech so I can say what I want and you shouldn't try to stop me" might involve the following considerations:

This statement could be an example of a defective argument type called **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. Here’s why:

- The argument is premised on the right to free speech but does not consider the complexities or boundaries of free speech (e.g., it doesn’t address whether certain speech might be harmful or restricted under certain circumstances).
- It uses a general right to support a specific and possibly slightly contentious application without sufficient reasoning or addressing potential counterarguments.

Therefore, applying <IDAA> to the statement:
"I have a right to free speech so I can say what I want and you shouldn't try to stop me" is an example of <IR>.
