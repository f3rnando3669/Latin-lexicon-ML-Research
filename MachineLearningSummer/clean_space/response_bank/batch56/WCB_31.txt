To analyze the given argument, we need to identify the type(s) of defective argument(s) present in the statement: "earthquakes in the Andes were correlated with the closest approaches of the planet Uranus. Therefore, Uranus must have caused them."

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This argument type is invoked when there is a correlation between two events, but a causal relationship is wrongly assumed without adequate evidence. In this case, although there is a correlation between the timing of earthquakes and Uranus's proximity, this alone doesnâ€™t provide sufficient causal evidence that Uranus caused the earthquakes. Other potential causes must be considered and ruled out.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This argument type occurs when the premises do not convincingly support the conclusion. Here, the correlation does not conclusively establish causation and fails to account for alternate explanations or underlying mechanisms.

Using these identified defective argument types, we can critique the argument explicitly:

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument assumes that because earthquakes in the Andes and the closest approaches of Uranus are correlated, the planet must have caused the earthquakes. This is a classic case of confusing correlation with causation without sufficient evidence.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The premise that these events are correlated does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that one caused the other. The available evidence is not conclusive enough to support the causation claim.

Thus, applying IDAA (Identify Defective Argument Analysis), we identify that the argument is flawed due to the presence of "Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)" and "Inconclusive Reason (IR)."
