Sure, let's analyze the given statement using the previously defined defective argument types:

"I know nothing about Tank Johnson except that he has a criminal record as long as your leg, but I’ll bet he’s really just misunderstood."

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement acknowledges a single fact about Tank Johnson — his extensive criminal record — but then jumps to a conclusion without considering other necessary aspects or facts (incomplete enumeration of relevant information). This type of argument assumes that there might be mitigating circumstances without presenting or evaluating them.

2. **Defective Reasoning (<IDAA>): Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The statement suggests that despite admitting no other knowledge about Tank Johnson except his criminal record, the conclusion is reached that he is "just misunderstood." This repetition creates an assumption without additional supporting information and could be viewed as relying on a preconceived notion.

Therefore, the argument presented in the statement can be classified as an **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, because it fails to consider a broader range of facts about Tank Johnson, and it also shows **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**, as it reiterates a perception based on insufficient grounds. 

In summary, the argument suffers predominantly from **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** and **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** among the defective argument types defined.
