For 
Certainly! To apply Intelligent Detection and Analysis of Argument (IDAA) to the provided argument:

**Statement**: "Russia has a terrible human rights record."  
**Response**: "Well, the United States has done plenty of bad things."  
**Context**: The President when confronted about Russia's human rights abuses.

**IDAA Analysis**:

1. **Defective Argument Type**:
   - This response falls into the type of defective argument known as *Deflection* or *Red Herring*. In our defined defective argument list, none of those would precisely fit "Deflection," but we can identify closely related issues.

2. **Generalization (G)**:
   - Not Applicable in this case as there is no sweeping generalization based on insufficient evidence.

3. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - Not Applicable here, as the argument does not rely on listing incomplete options or parts.

4. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - Not directly applicable, although suggesting the failings of one entity (the U.S.) does not provide a conclusive reason about another entity (Russia).

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - Not applicable as this does not concern an insufficient causal relationship.

6. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - Not applicable since this argument does not rely on repeating a faulty proposition.

7. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - Not applicable, as the argument does not assert a consensus of opinion without evidence.

8. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - Partially applicable as the president's response is somewhat ambiguous in terms of relevance since it diverts the discussion rather than addressing the issue directly.

Given this analysis, the specific type of defective argument is a form of what’s commonly known in classical fallacy terms as *tu quoque* or *appeal to hypocrisy*.

**Conclusion**: 
In the provided scenario, the President's response ("Well, the United States has done plenty of bad things.") when confronted about Russia's human rights abuses represents a diversion tactic, specifically a **tu quoque fallacy**. This tactic attempts to discredit the argument by claiming the opponent’s hypocrisy without directly addressing the issue of Russia's human rights record. This matches closely with our notion of an Inconclusive Reason (IR) but with a specific contextual type known as *Appeal to Hypocrisy*.

Thus, the appropriate defective argument type is primarily:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** interlaced with aspects of **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**.
