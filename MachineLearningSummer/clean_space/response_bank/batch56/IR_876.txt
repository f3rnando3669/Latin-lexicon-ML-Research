For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Annotation) to the statement ""The critical mission was horribly executed." is an example of ...":

1. **Look for Signs of Defective Arguments**: Analyze the statement to see if it includes any elements characteristic of the defined defective argument types.
2. **Identify and Annotate Defective Argument**:

   The statement "The critical mission was horribly executed." uses the adjective "horribly," but does not provide specific details or evidence to support this claim.

   - **Generalization (<G>)**: This could be applied if "horribly" represents an overgeneralization without sufficient specifics.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not applicable here directly since the statement isn't listing.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This could be similar to "Generalization," indicating a claim made without enough reasoning or evidence.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This might apply if there's an implied cause-effect (implied failure in mission execution) without depth.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This one does not apply due to lack of repetition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This might apply if the term "horribly" is meant to invoke a shared sentiment without verifying that consensus.
   - **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The term "horribly" is subjective and lacks clear specifics, potentially making it ambiguous.

3. **Choose the Most Precise Annotation**:

   Considering the nature of the statement, **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language)** seems the most accurate annotation. The adjective "horribly" is subjective and open to interpretation without sufficient clarification.

Therefore:
"The critical mission was horribly executed." is an example of **<DEP>** (Ambiguous Language).
