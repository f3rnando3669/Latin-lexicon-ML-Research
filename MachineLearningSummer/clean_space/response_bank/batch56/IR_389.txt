For 
<IDAA> stands for an Indirect Defective Argument Analysis. Let's break down the given statement and identify the defective argument types:

**Statement:** "Andrea Dworkin has written several books arguing that the media harms women when it comes to body image. But Dworkin is an ugly, bitter person, so you shouldn't listen to her."

1. **Ad Hominem Attack (not defined but useful for analysis):**
   - This statement attacks Andrea Dworkin's character by calling her "ugly" and "bitter," rather than addressing the merits of her arguments or the content of her books. This type of argument aims to discredit a view by discrediting the person who holds the view.

2. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The statement makes a broad and unstated assumption that if someone is deemed "ugly" and "bitter," their arguments or contributions are therefore worthless. This is a type of hasty generalization.

3. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - Labels like "ugly" and "bitter" are subjective and ambiguous. What one person considers "ugly" or "bitter" can vary greatly. This ambiguity can cloud the discussion and mislead the audience.

By applying <IDAA>, we see that the statement about Andrea Dworkin contains a personal attack (general Ad Hominem), a defective generalization (<G>), and uses ambiguous language (<DEP>). It fails to address the substance of her arguments and instead focuses on discrediting her personally.
