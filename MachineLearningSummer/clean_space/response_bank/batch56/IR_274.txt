The argument present in the statement is:
"In our psychology department, half of the faculty believe that the new assistant professor shows serious problems in the area of ethics. The other half believe that the new faculty member shows no problems in the area of ethics. Obviously the new professor shows mild to moderate problems in the area of ethics."

By breaking down the reasoning step-by-step, we can identify the potential defects in this argument:

1. **Generalization (G):** The conclusion about the new professor showing mild to moderate problems is based on a division of opinions, but it improperly generalizes the average of two extreme opinions to conclude a moderate stance without proper justification.

2. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument assumes that an average of polar opinions will necessarily yield the correct or a reasonable conclusion, implicitly assuming that moderate problems are a consensus view that logically follows from the divided opinions.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The argument is based on inconclusive evidence. The differing opinions don't provide a clear reason for concluding that mildly moderate problems exist.

By tagging this argument with the defective argument types defined:
- **Generalization (G)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**

We can understand that the argument is defective because it improperly generalizes the divided opinions (G), presumes that an averaged or middle-ground position is correct (FU), and fails to provide a conclusive reason or evidence supporting such a conclusion (IR). Hence, <IDAA> for this argument would be <G>, <FU>, and <IR>.
