For 
The argument in question is: "Jimmy stole Tommy’s lunch in the past. Therefore, it is acceptable for Tommy to steal Jimmy’s lunch today."

Let's analyze this argument using the defective argument types defined:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument doesn't make a broad statement about multiple cases based on single instances, so it's not a generalization.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This argument isn't about listing limited options, so it doesn't fall under incomplete enumeration.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason given (Jimmy's theft) does not logically justify the conclusion (Tommy's theft being acceptable). Thus, it could be classified as Inconclusive Reason.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This argument is not about establishing a causal relationship, so it doesn't fit under insufficient causal basis.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: There's no repetition of a proposition here, so this label doesn't apply.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This argument doesn't appeal to a consensus or assumption that others agree, so it doesn't fall under presumptuous consensus.
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The language in the argument is not ambiguous. It clearly states the past action and the supposed justification for a future action.

Given this analysis, the most fitting defective argument type for "Jimmy stole Tommy’s lunch in the past. Therefore, it is acceptable for Tommy to steal Jimmy’s lunch today." is **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**.
