Applying Inappropriate Defective Argument Analysis (IDAA) to the statement "Not only is paying a higher income tax a patriotic duty, it is also a sacred obligation," involves identifying one or more defective argument types present within the statement.

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument type could be present if the statement assumes that paying higher taxes is a patriotic duty for all individuals without considering exceptions. However, this specific type of generalization doesn't seem to fit well in this context.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This might be applied if the statement ignores other aspects or obligations that could also be considered patriotic or sacred. Since it only mentions the higher income tax, it could be leaving out a broader list of patriotic duties and sacred obligations.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This could be relevant because calling something a "patriotic duty" and a "sacred obligation" may not provide concrete reasons or evidence for why paying higher taxes fits these descriptions. 

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This argument type might be present if the statement implies that there is a cause-and-effect relationship (higher income tax leading to patriotism and sacred obligation) without sufficient evidence. 

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This does not seem to apply as there is no repetition of the same proposition in this statement.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This argument could be suggesting that it is a commonly accepted idea that higher income tax is a patriotic duty and sacred obligation without actual consensus or evidence supporting this broad claim.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The terms "patriotic duty" and "sacred obligation" are vague and open to interpretation, which could introduce ambivalence and ambiguity in what is meant by these terms.

In conclusion, the defective arguments present in the statement could include Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), and Ambiguous Language (DEP). The statement lacks clear, concrete reasoning and relies on broad, ambiguous terms that may not have a universally agreed-upon meaning.
