For 
The statement "Only a selfish, non-caring person would believe that this is ok." can be analyzed for defective arguments using the provided definitions:

- **<G> Generalization**: This statement generalizes the belief in question by attributing it only to selfish, non-caring individuals without considering other possible motivations or reasons people might have.

- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: The statement does not provide a comprehensive list of all types of people who might agree with the belief, implying that selfishness and lack of care are the only reasons, thus making an incomplete enumeration of possible viewpoints.

- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The reasoning provided does not conclusively prove that only selfish, non-caring people would support the belief. It assumes a direct correlation without sufficient evidence.

- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: It suggests a causality between a person's character (selfish and non-caring) and their belief without sufficient grounds to establish this causal link convincingly.

- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: The statement doesn't involve any repetition of a proposition in a faulty manner, so <RR> is not applicable here.

- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: The statement presumes consensus by implying a strong moral judgment that anyone outside of this belief is morally deficient, thus hinting at a consensus on what is acceptable or not.

- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**: The language can be seen as somewhat ambiguous because "this" is not explicitly defined within the statement itself, though context could clarify what "this" refers to.

**Defective Arguments:**
- <G>: Generalization
- <FE>: Incomplete Enumeration
- <IR>: Inconclusive Reason
- <WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis
- <FU>: Presumptuous Consensus
- <DEP>: Ambiguous Language (potentially, due to the pronoun "this")

The analysis reveals multiple defective argument types present within the statement.
