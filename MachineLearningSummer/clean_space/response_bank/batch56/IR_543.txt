For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application. In the example provided, "You call the Marcoses murderers and plunderers yet you cannot lend me money for my school project, murdering my chance for a higher grade. You are just like them," we need to identify the defective argument types present in the statement.

1. **Generalization (G):** This argument seems to be making a broad generalization. The speaker is equating the refusal to lend money with being a murderer or plunderer. This is an exaggerated and unjustified leap.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason provided ("cannot lend me money for my school project") is weak and inconclusive to justify the serious accusation of being "just like them." Thereâ€™s no strong or relevant connection between the acts of the Marcoses and the refusal to lend money.

3. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The term "murdering my chance for a higher grade" uses dramatic and ambiguous language that conflates the literal act of murder with the figurative situation of not lending money. This manipulation of language intends to provoke an emotional response rather than presenting a logical argument.

Therefore, applying IDAA to the statement:

- **Generalization (G)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**
