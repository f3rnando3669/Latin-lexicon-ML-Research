The argument presented by Jon could be analyzed using a combination of different defective argument types. Let's break it down:

1. **Generalization (G)**: Jon is making a broad generalization about the futility of exercising based on his spouse's eating habits while on vacation. Such generalizing statements can be misleading and do not take into account individual choices and health impacts.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Jon's argument is not considering all the reasons why someone might exercise. It's not just about competing with or matching a spouse's eating habits but also about personal health benefits, mental well-being, and long-term health goals.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Jon's rationale that he should not bother exercising lacks a conclusion based on logically sound premises. His spouse eating more while on vacation does not logically imply that his own exercise efforts are pointless.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: If Jon frequently repeats the idea that his effort in exercising is futile because of his spouseâ€™s dietary habits, it doesn't add more validity to his argument. Repetition of a faulty proposition does not improve the original reasoning.

5. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Jon seems to assume that because one person (his spouse) is indulging, it creates an unspoken agreement or rationale for him to dismiss exercising. This does not account for individuality and personal choice.

Considering the presence of these defective argument types, it seems Jon's justification for not exercising is based on flawed reasoning.
