The argument "Let’s go buy the iPhone X in spite of the $999 price tag--all of our friends have one already!" can be dissected and analyzed for defective argument types. 

Upon closer inspection:

1. **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: The argument suggests that because all of our friends have an iPhone X, we should buy one too. This rests on the presumption that the actions of our friends inherently provide a sufficient reason to follow suit, which is a logical fallacy.

The main defective argument type present in this statement is <FU> Presumptuous Consensus. 

Thus, applying **<IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Analysis and Application)** would specifically highlight:
**FU - The argument relies on a presumptive consensus, claiming that since all friends have an iPhone X, it’s a sufficient reason for the speaker to buy it too. This consensus is taken as a given without any substantive reason to support the necessity or value of following the crowd.**
