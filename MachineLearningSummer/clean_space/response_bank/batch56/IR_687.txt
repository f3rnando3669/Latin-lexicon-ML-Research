For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Attributes. 

To apply **_<IDAA>_**:

1. **Analyze the statements**:
   - **Speaker 1** states: "No fault divorce has proven to be detrimental to society and the family."
   - **Speaker 2** responds: "You didn’t seem to think that when you got divorced."

2. **Identify the potential defective argument types in Speaker 2’s response**:
   - **Relevance**: Speaker 2’s response doesn’t address the validity or evidence of Speaker 1’s argument about no fault divorce being detrimental. Instead, it shifts focus to Speaker 1’s personal history, which does not inherently refute the initial claim.
     - **Possible defective argument type**: **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**—because the argument about the personal history of Speaker 1 is irrelevant in proving the truth or falsity of the initial claim about no fault divorce.
   
   - **Personal Attack (Ad Hominem)**: The comment attacks Speaker 1’s consistency or character rather than addressing the claim directly.
     - This can be categorized under incomplete argumentative structure, weakening the focus on actual evidence or logical reasoning.
   
   - **Ambiguity of Moral Standpoint**: Assuming that Speaker 1’s past behavior directly impacts the argument without defining the nuances between personal experience and logical reasoning in a debate.
     - **Possible defective argument type**: **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**—because the attempt to discredit based on personal inconsistency ventures into unclear ground without addressing the main issue.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Speaker 2’s response diverts from directly discussing the claim made by Speaker 1 and instead focuses on an irrelevant aspect—thus the argument is an **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**. Additionally, there's an element of **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)** due to the confusion created by mixing personal history with argumentative validity.
