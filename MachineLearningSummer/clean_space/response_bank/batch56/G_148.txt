For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Types) to the statement "Jack is a good athlete. Jack comes from Canada. Therefore, all Canadians are good athletes.", we need to analyze the logic and see which defective argument type it falls under.

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument claims something very broad based on a very limited sample size (i.e., one individual). Jack's athletic ability is generalized to the entire population of Canada.

   Analysis: The argument is taking one specific case (Jack) and making a broad statement about all Canadians. This is indeed a form of faulty reasoning known as Generalization.

Thus, the defective argument type applied to the statement "Jack is a good athlete. Jack comes from Canada. Therefore, all Canadians are good athletes." is <G> (Generalization).
