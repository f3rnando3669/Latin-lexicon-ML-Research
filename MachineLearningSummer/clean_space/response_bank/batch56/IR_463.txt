For 
<IDAA> refers to the Identification of Defective Argument Attributes.

In the provided argument "What can our new math teacher know? Have you seen how fat she is?", we need to identify the defective argument attributes present in it.

This argument primarily contains the following defects:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The argument uses an irrelevant characteristic (the teacher's weight) to question their knowledge or competence in math, which does not logically follow.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The term "know" is used ambiguously, which could mean various aspects of knowledge or teaching ability. The specific context of what is being questioned is not clear.
  
Therefore, the application of IDAA would highlight these issues:
- **IR**: The reason provided (teacher's weight) is not a valid basis to conclude about their knowledge in math.
- **DEP**: The ambiguous use of "know" makes the argument less clear and direct.
