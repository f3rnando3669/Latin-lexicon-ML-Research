In order to analyze the argument "Intentionally using negatively charged words is an example of which technique?" using the definitions provided:

- **Generalization (G)**: Drawing a broad conclusion from a small set of examples.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Omitting some relevant cases or possibilities in an argument.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Presenting reasons that do not adequately support the conclusion.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Attributing a cause without enough evidence.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Repeating the same statement as though it provides sufficient support.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Claiming that a proposition is true based on an assumed or false consensus.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Using vague or unclear terms that can lead to misunderstanding.

To determine which defective argument type applies:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This does not seem to fit as the statement does not draw a broad conclusion from limited examples.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This does not list specific cases, so it is not about omitting relevant possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The statement doesn't provide reasons or evidence, it simply asks what technique is being used.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This doesn't deal with causation.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: There is no repetition in the statement.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There is no claim of consensus, false or otherwise, in the statement.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The term "negatively charged words" could be considered ambiguous, as it could refer to criticism, emotionally laden words, or words with negative connotations without clear definition.

Thus, the most fitting defective argument type applied to this statement is **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**. The term "negatively charged words" is not fully explained and can give rise to multiple interpretations.
