For 
To apply the concept of Identifying Defective Argument Application (IDAA) to the statement "Terrorists must not be given the chance to invade our beloved country," we should examine whether this statement contains any of the previously defined defective argument types: Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Presumptuous Consensus, or Ambiguous Language.

1. **Generalization (G):** This doesn’t seem to fit because the statement does not make broad generalizations based on limited or unrepresentative evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** There is no listing of possibilities that seems to omit alternatives, so this doesn’t fit either.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The statement is assertive but lacks clear reasoning or evidence. It makes a strong claim but doesn’t provide sufficient reasoning why preventing terrorists from invading is necessary.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The statement implies that allowing terrorists a chance will directly lead to an invasion, which is a causal relationship that isn’t sufficiently established in the argument.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** There are no repeated propositions leading to a conclusion, so this does not apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The assertion assumed might suggest that a collective agreement exists that "terrorists must not be given the chance to invade," neglecting any counterarguments or differing views.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The terms “terrorists,” “chance,” and “invade” could be interpreted in various ways, leading to different conclusions about what is being discussed or implied.

Given this analysis, we can identify the following defective argument types in the statement:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The statement provides an assertion without supporting reasons or evidence.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The cause-and-effect relationship implied in the statement isn't supported adequately.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** It assumes a unanimous agreement without addressing differing viewpoints.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The language used could be interpreted in multiple ways, leading to potential ambiguity.

Therefore, the statement "Terrorists must not be given the chance to invade our beloved country." can be marked with the defective argument types: <IR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.
