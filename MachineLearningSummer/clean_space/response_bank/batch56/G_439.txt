The logical form "A is part of B. A has property X. Therefore, B has property X." describes a fallacy known as the **Fallacy of Composition**.

The Fallacy of Composition occurs when someone assumes that what is true for a part of a whole must necessarily be true for the whole itself. In this case, just because part A has property X, it doesn't logically follow that the whole B will also have property X.

The correct way to denote this with your defined terms and codes could be <IDAA>: Fallacy of Composition.
