For 
Certainly! Let's analyze the argument "“It must be cool because everyone is doing it…" said Kinza" using the defective argument types you've defined:

- **Define**: The argument presented by Kinza is a form of the bandwagon fallacy, suggesting that something is true or acceptable simply because a large number of people believe it or are doing it.
- **Identify**: The specific defective argument type that applies here is <FU>, Presumptuous Consensus.
- **Analyze**: Kinza's argument relies on the assumption that widespread acceptance or participation inherently validates the proposition that something is "cool." However, this is a logical fallacy because popularity does not equate to value or correctness.
- **Apply**: By labeling this argument as <FU>, Presumptuous Consensus, we highlight that Kinza is uncritically using the majority's behavior as a substitute for independent criteria of what "cool" should entail.

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the argument: 

1. **Define** the context of the fallacy.
2. **Identify** the relevant defective argument type, which is <FU>.
3. **Analyze** how this fallacy undermines the argument by relying on an assumed consensus.
4. **Apply** the specific defective argument type label <FU> to the statement for clarity.

So, the argument "“It must be cool because everyone is doing it…" said Kinza" is an instance of <FU>, Presumptuous Consensus.
