For 
The argument provided in the scenario is: "All teachers are the enemy!" when asked about a bad grade in math class by your parent.

To identify the defective argument applied here, let's break down the argument:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This occurs when a conclusion is drawn about a whole group based on a sample that is not representative. In this case, claiming "All teachers are the enemy!" is an unfounded generalization about all teachers based on a presumably negative experience with some or one.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This happens when not all possibilities are considered. The statement does not consider that there could be many other reasons for having a bad grade, such as difficulty understanding the material, lack of study, or personal issues, leading to an incomplete enumeration of potential causes.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This occurs when the reason provided does not logically lead to the conclusion. Saying "All teachers are the enemy!" does not necessarily explain why there is a bad grade in math specifically. There is no direct logical causation shown between the hostility of teachers perceived by the student and their performance.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This happens when the argument implies causation without sufficient evidence. The argument suggests that having "enemies" as teachers is a sufficient cause for bad grades, but does not provide evidence to support this causal relationship.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This would involve repeating a statement without providing new evidence. In this case, the argument is not repetitive.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This involves presuming agreement or consensus on a matter without evidence. The claim "All teachers are the enemy!" assumes a consensus without verification.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This involves using language that is unclear or has multiple interpretations. The term "enemy" can be seen as ambiguous and could be interpreted in several ways, but in this context, it is being used more as a generalization rather than ambiguous terminology.

Given the analysis, the statement primarily falls under the category of **Generalization (<G>)**, supported by evidence of **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** and **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**.

Thus, the identified defective argument types for the statement "All teachers are the enemy!" when asked about a bad grade in math class would be:
- **Generalization (<G>)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
