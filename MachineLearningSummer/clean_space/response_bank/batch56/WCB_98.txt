For 
The provided statement "Since event Y followed event X, event Y must have been caused by event X" falls under the category of a fallacy known as "Post hoc ergo propter hoc," which is a specific type of faulty causal reasoning. This fallacy assumes a cause-and-effect relationship purely based on the sequence of events. Here, the defective argument type can be classified as:

<WCB> - Insufficient Causal Basis.

This is because the argument asserts causation solely based on the chronological order of events without sufficient evidence to support a causal connection.
