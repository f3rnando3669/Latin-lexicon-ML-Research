For 
Certainly! To identify and analyze the defective arguments in the given statement using the defined types, let's begin by breaking down the sentence:

"The best example of this fallacy is presented by the person who coined this term, Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his 2007 book, The Black Swan. There are two people."

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - There doesn’t seem to be a clear generalization in this particular excerpt. The statement is more specific about an example and an individual.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - This excerpt does not list items or provide examples in a way that might omit crucial elements, so no incomplete enumeration is evident here.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - The phrase "The best example of this fallacy is presented by the person who coined this term" could be identified as an inconclusive reason. Simply stating it's the best example without providing reasons or evidence to support why it is the best example makes the argument inconclusive.
   - Inconclusive Reason (IR): "The best example of this fallacy is presented by the person who coined this term"

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - There is no obvious causal relationship being suggested in this excerpt, so this does not apply.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - Repetition of terms doesn’t occur in a way that establishes or restates a proposition merely by repeating it.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - The excerpt does not claim or imply consensus, so this type does not apply here.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - There might be ambiguous language in the sense that "There are two people" is an incomplete thought or lacks a clear connection to the rest of the statement.
   - Ambiguous Language (DEP): "There are two people" (missing further information on who these two people are and their relevance). 

To summarize, our analysis using IDAA on the given statement identifies the following defective argument types:
- Inconclusive Reason (IR): "The best example of this fallacy is presented by the person who coined this term"
- Ambiguous Language (DEP): "There are two people"
