The argument given is:

"One day, Megan wore a Donald Duck t-shirt, and she got an 'A' on her Chemistry test. Now she wears a Donald Duck t-shirt every day to Chemistry class."

The fallacy here is an example of assuming a causal relationship where there might not be one, based on limited evidence. Megan's behavior suggests she believes that wearing the Donald Duck t-shirt caused her to receive an 'A' on her test, without sufficient evidence to support this causal link.
