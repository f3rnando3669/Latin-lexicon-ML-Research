For 
<IDAA> stands for Inappropriate Appeal to Emotion, a defective argument type where the speaker tries to manipulate emotions instead of providing logical reasons or evidence for their position.

In the given statement: 

"Professor, you have to give me an A on this paper. I know I only turned in a sentence and some clip art, but you have to understand, my grandmother suddenly died while traveling in the Northern Yukon, and her funeral was there so I had to travel, and my parents got divorced in the middle of the ceremony, and all the stress caused me to become catatonic for two weeks. Have some pity â€” my grandmother's last wish was that I'd get an A in this class."

The speaker is appealing to the professor's pity and compassion due to their personal hardships and their grandmother's last wish, rather than providing a valid academic reason for why they deserve an A on the paper. Hence, this is indeed an example of an Inappropriate Appeal to Emotion (<IDAA>).
