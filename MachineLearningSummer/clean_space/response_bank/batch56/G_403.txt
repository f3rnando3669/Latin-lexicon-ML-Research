Sure, let's analyze the statement "I have one Japanese friend and it's true that all of them are numb." and identify the defective argument types applied to it.

1. **Generalization <G>**:
   - This statement takes the behavior or characteristic of one individual and applies it to an entire group of people without sufficient evidence. Just having one Japanese friend is not enough to claim something about all Japanese people.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>**:
   - The statement does not consider the diversity and variance within the group of Japanese people. It assumes that all members of the group are the same based on a very limited sample size (just one friend).

3. **Inconclusive Reason <IR>**:
   - There is no logical reasoning provided that explains why knowing one Japanese person means that the statement about all Japanese people being numb is logically sound.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>**:
   - The conclusion drawn lacks a causal basis. Just because the person has one Japanese friend doesn't mean there is a cause-effect relationship that justifies the claim about all Japanese people.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>**:
   - The statement doesn't appear to repeat any proposition or attempt to validate itself through repetition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>**:
   - The statement does not seem to indicate a false consensus. It appears to be more of a hasty generalization rather than assuming broad agreement among others.

7. **Ambiguous Language <DEP>**:
   - The term "numb" is ambiguous in this context. It could mean emotionally numb, physically numb, or some other interpretation. This ambiguity weakens the argument further.

Given these points, the statement primarily falls under:

- **Generalization <G>**
- **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>**
- **Inconclusive Reason <IR>**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>**
- **Ambiguous Language <DEP>**

Therefore, the argument in the statement "I have one Japanese friend and it's true that all of them are numb." is defective due to generalization, incomplete enumeration, inconclusive reason, insufficient causal basis, and ambiguous language.
