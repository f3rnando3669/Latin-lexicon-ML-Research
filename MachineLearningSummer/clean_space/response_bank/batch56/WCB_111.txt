For 
Let's apply the defined defective argument types (Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Presumptuous Consensus, and Ambiguous Language) to the argument:

"Global chocolate consumption is highest in Switzerland, yet people there are among the trimmest in the industrialized world. Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that chocolate helps keep your weight down."

**Defective Argument Analysis (IDAA):**

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - This argument makes a broad generalization based on limited data. It assumes that because one country (Switzerland) with high chocolate consumption has a trim population, this causal relationship applies universally. This overlooks other factors and the uniqueness of Switzerlandâ€™s context.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (IE):**
   - The argument does not consider other potential factors contributing to the trimness of the Swiss population, such as diet, lifestyle, genetics, and healthcare. By focusing solely on chocolate consumption, it fails to account for a comprehensive set of variables.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - There is no definitive evidence presented to support the claim that chocolate consumption leads to lower body weight. The correlation between chocolate consumption and trimness in Switzerland does not establish a direct causative link.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - The argument lacks a sufficient causal basis to conclude that chocolate consumption leads to lower weight. It ignores confounding factors and assumes causation from correlation without adequate supporting evidence.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - The argument does not necessarily repeat the same proposition in a faulty manner, so this type may not be particularly relevant here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - The argument does not explicitly claim that there is a consensus. However, it implicitly suggests that the observed phenomenon in Switzerland is a generally accepted fact that can be reasonably concluded, without providing consensus-based evidence.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - The term "helps keep your weight down" is ambiguous and could be interpreted in various ways. It lacks specificity and does not clearly define how chocolate consumption supposedly affects weight. The argument also uses "reasonable to conclude" in a rather loose and subjective manner, which contributes to its ambiguity.

In summary, this argument primarily suffers from Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (IE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), and Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB). The language used is somewhat ambiguous (DEP), but there is no clear evidence of Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR) or Presumptuous Consensus (FU) being a major issue in this specific case.
