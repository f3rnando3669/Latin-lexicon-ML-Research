For 
The argument provided is "Everyone I know is making fruit smoothies for quick, portable meals, so smoothies must be really good for you."

Let's identify the defective argument types (IDAA stands for "Identify Defective Argument Attribute"):

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - This argument generalizes from a limited set of observations (everyone the speaker knows) to a broad conclusion (smoothies must be good for you). The sample size is not representative of the general population.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - The argument suggests that because everyone the speaker knows is making smoothies, this is a comprehensive representation of all possible reasons or behaviors concerning smoothies. It doesn't consider other people's opinions or behaviors.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The reasoning provided is not conclusive. Just because the speaker's acquaintances are making smoothies doesn't necessarily mean that smoothies are inherently good for health. The argument lacks evidence outside the limited observation.
   
4. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - The argument assumes a consensus (that smoothies are good) without providing substantial proof. It presumes that a widely adopted practice among a small group equates to a valid consensus.
   
From this analysis, the defective argument types present in the statement are <G>, <FE>, <IR>, and <FU>.
