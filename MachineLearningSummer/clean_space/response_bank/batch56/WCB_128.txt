For 
<IR> (Inconclusive Reason): The statement "There was a thunderstorm with rain therefore I did not finish my homework" is an example of inconclusive reasoning because the presence of a thunderstorm and rain does not necessarily provide a definitive reason for not finishing homework. There could be other factors at play, and the argument does not establish a clear causal link between the weather and the incomplete homework. 

Thus, the application of <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Attributes) in this case is:

<IR> There was a thunderstorm with rain therefore I did not finish my homework.
