For 
The argument given is: "That candidate wants to raise the minimum wage, but they aren't even smart enough to run a business."

To analyze this with <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Attributes), we can look at the types defined and see which ones might apply:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This type involves drawing a general conclusion from a small sample size or specific instances.
   - The argument does not make a generalization based on specific instances, so this does not apply.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This occurs when an argument lists some cases and assumes there are no other cases.
   - The argument focuses only on the candidate's intelligence related to business without considering other aspects of their capability to handle wage policies. However, this doesn't quite seem to fit the scenario of incomplete enumeration as described.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This type is used when premises provided do not logically justify the conclusion.
   - Here, criticizing the candidate's intelligence related to running a business does not logically support the idea that the policy proposal (raising the minimum wage) is flawed or invalid. Thus, this argument type applies.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This type occurs when a causal connection is asserted without sufficient evidence.
   - The argument does not directly assert a causal relationship between the candidate's intelligence and their wage policy, so this does not apply.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This is when an argument simply repeats the claim without providing support or evidence.
   - The argument does not repeat the proposition without support but attacks the candidate's intelligence instead, so this does not apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This is when an argument assumes a consensus or agreement without evidence.
   - The argument does not presume consensus, so this does not apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This involves using language that is vague, ambiguous, or has multiple meanings.
   - The language used here is not particularly ambiguous or vague, so this does not apply either.

Based on this analysis, the defective argument type that applies here is:

**Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument criticizes the candidate's intelligence in relation to running a business, but this does not logically support or refute the candidate's proposal to raise the minimum wage. Therefore, the argument given has an inconclusive reason.

So, the <IDAA> application result is:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
