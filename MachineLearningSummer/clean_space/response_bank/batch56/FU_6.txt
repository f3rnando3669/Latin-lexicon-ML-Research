OK, let's apply the definitions of the defective argument types to analyze the statement "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong."

From the defective argument types we've defined:

- **<G> (Generalization):** Drawing a conclusion based on a small or unrepresentative sample.
- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):** Making a conclusion without considering all possible cases.
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** Providing a reason that doesn't necessarily support the conclusion.
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** Assuming a causal relationship without sufficient evidence.
- **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** Repeating a proposition without adding evidence or reasoning.
- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):** Assuming a consensus based on insufficient or biased sampling.
- **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language):** Using language that is unclear or has multiple interpretations, leading to confusion.

The statement "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong" suggests that because 1 billion people have chosen Verizon, it must be the right choice.

- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):** The argument does not consider all other telecom options and reasons for choosing or not choosing them. It assumes that because a large number of people chose Verizon, it must be the best, without comparing it to other providers or considering individual needs and reasons.
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** The reason given ("1 billion people can't be wrong") does not necessarily support the conclusion that Verizon is the best choice for everyone. People could have chosen Verizon for a variety of reasons that don't apply universally.
- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):** The statement presumes that the large number of users (consensus) means Verizon is the right choice without considering whether this consensus was obtained fairly or if these users had ample alternatives to choose from.

We can argue that the primary defective argument type here is **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)** because the statement relies heavily on the appeal to the large number of users as a measure of correctness without accounting for other factors or potential biases.

Therefore, applying **<IDAA> to "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong"** results in identifying it as an example of **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**.
