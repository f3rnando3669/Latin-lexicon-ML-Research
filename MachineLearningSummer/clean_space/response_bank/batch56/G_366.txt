For 
<IDAA> stands for "Identify Defective Argument Attributes."

In the given statement, "If you don't go to camp, you won't have fun this summer, and your whole summer will be ruined!", we can identify multiple defective argument attributes:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** - The argument assumes that going to camp is the only way to have fun during the summer and that without it, the entire summer will be ruined. It does not consider other possible activities or ways to have fun.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** - The statement presents a cause-and-effect relationship (not going to camp will lead to an unfun and ruined summer) without sufficient proof or reasoning to substantiate this claim.

3. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)** - The terms "fun" and "ruined" are subjective and not well defined. What constitutes "fun" or a "ruined" summer can vary greatly from person to person.

Thus, the statement "If you don't go to camp, you won't have fun this summer, and your whole summer will be ruined!" can be tagged with the attributes <FE>, <IR>, and <DEP>.
