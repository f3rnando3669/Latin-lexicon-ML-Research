For 
When you apply the IDAA (Identify Defective Argument Attribute) to the statement "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights," you are evaluating the logical integrity of the argument and identifying any flawed reasoning present. 

In this case, the defective argument types you are looking for according to the given definitions are:

1. **Generalization (G):** Making a broad statement that applies to all cases based on a limited number of cases or examples.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Presenting a selection of options as if they are the only possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Using reasons that do not logically lead to the conclusion.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Suggesting a causal relationship without sufficient evidence.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Repeating a claim without providing supporting evidence.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Assuming that everyone or many people agree with a proposition when this is not established.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** Using language that is unclear or has multiple interpretations.

The statement "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" seems to display the following defective argument attributes:

**Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The statement presents only two options as if they are the complete range of possibilities when, in fact, there are many other ways someone could support women's rights without supporting Hillary Clinton for President. This is a false dichotomy, a type of logical fallacy.

**Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reasoning used does not logically lead to the conclusion. Supporting a particular political candidate is not the only way to demonstrate belief in womenâ€™s rights; thus, the argument's conclusion does not follow logically from its premise.

Therefore, the defects in the statement are best categorized under <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration) and <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
