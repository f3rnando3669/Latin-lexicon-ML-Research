To apply the process of Identifying Defective Argumentation Attributes (IDAA) to the argument, we need to break down the argument and then analyze it to identify any of the specified defective argument types. Here is the argument in question:

"According to the university brochure, the majors with the most students are Economics and Computer Science. Therefore, you should declare one of these majors if you want to have a successful career."

Let's dissect and analyze it step by step:

1. **Premise:** The majors with the most students are Economics and Computer Science.
2. **Conclusion:** You should declare one of these majors if you want to have a successful career.

Now, let's identify any potentially defective argument types at play here:

1. **<G> Generalization**: This argument appears to be drawing a general conclusion about the desirability of declaring certain majors based on their popularity. It generalizes that because these majors have the most students, they are the best choices for a successful career.

2. **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: The argument omits consideration of other factors and majors that could lead to a successful career. It implies that Economics and Computer Science are the only viable paths without accounting for the full range of possible paths.

3. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: There is an implicit assumption that the number of students majoring in a field correlates directly to career success. The argument lacks a sufficient causal basis for this correlation. The popularity of a major does not necessarily cause success in a career.

4. **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: The argument reiterates the idea that the popularity of certain majors should influence one's decision without providing new evidence or reasoning.

5. **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: By suggesting that one should declare one of these majors, the argument presumes a consensus that these majors are inherently better for career success. This presumption lacks supporting evidence and may not reflect a true consensus.

6. **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**: The term "successful career" is vague and can mean different things for different individuals. The argument relies on this ambiguity to make a broad, unsupported claim.

Based on the analysis, the argument "According to the university brochure, the majors with the most students are Economics and Computer Science. Therefore, you should declare one of these majors if you want to have a successful career." can be critiqued for the following defective argument types:

- **<G> Generalization**
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**

Each of these defects undermines the argument's validity and strength.
