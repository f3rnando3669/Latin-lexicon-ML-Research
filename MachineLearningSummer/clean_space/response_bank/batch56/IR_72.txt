For 
To indicate the defective argument type for the statement "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you," we must identify the pertinent argument flaw. Here, the person is making a decision based solely on what their best friend says, without evaluating the evidence or reasons for themselves. This reliance on a single, possibly biased source of information suggests a form of presumptive consensus.

The most fitting defective argument type from the provided list is <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus), as the individual assumes the veracity of the claim simply because someone they trust holds that belief.

The statement can thus be categorized as:

"My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you." – <FU>
