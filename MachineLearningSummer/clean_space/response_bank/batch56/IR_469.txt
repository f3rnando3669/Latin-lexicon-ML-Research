Sure, let's apply the argument analysis process <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Annotations) to the given statement: "I don't think that there should be marriage among homosexuals. Anyway, taxes on married people are high. I think that taxes on the married are just ridiculous."

**1. Identify the Claims:**

- The speaker's primary claim appears to be: "I don't think that there should be marriage among homosexuals."
- The secondary claim mentioned is: "Taxes on married people are high."
- Another related claim is: "I think that taxes on the married are just ridiculous."

**2. Analyze for Defective Arguments:**

- **Generalization (<G>):** The statement "I don't think that there should be marriage among homosexuals" could be seen as a generalization if it is based on a biased or insufficient sample of experiences or opinions but we will need further context to conclude this solidly.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The statement doesnâ€™t list specific reasons for why the speaker opposes marriage among homosexuals, which may imply an incomplete reasoning process here.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reasons given do not directly support the conclusion about homosexual marriage. The claim about taxes on married people does not logically follow as a reason for opposing homosexual marriage.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** There is an implied causal relationship between homosexual marriage and taxes that married people pay, which is not substantiated and hence weak.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** There is a repetition of the idea that taxes on the married are high and ridiculous, but faulty repetition is not a major issue here.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The speaker's statement may imply a presumption that others will agree with the idea that taxes on the married are ridiculous without any supportive consensus data.

- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** There is no overwhelmingly ambiguous language employed in the argument that would fit under this defective argument type.

**3. Annotate the Defective Arguments:**

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The initial claim lacks specific reasoning as to why marriage among homosexuals should not be permitted.
  
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The shift to talking about taxes on married people is irrelevant to the debate on homosexual marriage, making the argument non-sequitur.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** There is no clear causal link between homosexual marriage and the tax burden on married individuals. 

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The statement "I think that taxes on the married are just ridiculous" suggests a presumed agreement.

**4. Description and Explanation:**

The primary problem with the argument is that the speaker's reason for opposing marriage among homosexuals ("taxes on married people are high") is not directly relevant to the argument regarding the legitimacy of homosexual marriage. This introduces several defects in the argument:

- The lack of specific reasoning on why homosexual marriages should not happen implies an **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**.
- The discussion on taxes being high is not connected logically with the claim about homosexual marriage, making it an **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**.
- Any implied connection between homosexual marriage and tax burdens is unsupported by evidence, indicating an **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
- The statement about taxes presumes a consensus without evidence, which is a **Presumptuous Consensus** (<FU>).

Thus, the argument presented contains multiple defects that undermine its validity.
