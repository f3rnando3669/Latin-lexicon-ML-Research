For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Types. Let's examine the statement in question:

"If someone told you, 'Why should we be worrying about how the government treats Native people, when people in our city can't get a job?' what logical fallacy are they using?"

To identify the defective argument type:

1. **Defining the Argument:**
   - This statement presents an argument that suggests we should prioritize one issue (unemployment in the city) over another (treatment of Native people) without providing a logical basis for why one should exclude the other.

2. **Breaking Down the Logical Fallacy:**
   - This argument sets up a false dilemma, implying that concern for one issue must negate concern for the other.
   - There's an implicit assumption that resources, attention, or compassion can only be allocated to one issue at a time, which is not necessarily true.

3. **Identifying the Defective Argument Type:**
   - The argument does not provide sufficient reasoning to support the exclusion of concern for the treatment of Native people based on the stated reason, i.e., the state of unemployment in the city.
   - It also leaves out the possibility of addressing both issues simultaneously or even acknowledging that both could be of significant concern independently.

Given this analysis, the statement aligns best with:

**<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** The reasoning provided, that city unemployment should prevent concern for how the government treats Native people, is inconclusive and insufficient to support the claim.

There is also an aspect of **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:** It overlooks other possible ways to address the issues or prioritize concerns, presenting a misleading dichotomy.

Therefore, the primary defective argument type in this statement is **<IR> Inconclusive Reason** with elements of **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration** also present.
