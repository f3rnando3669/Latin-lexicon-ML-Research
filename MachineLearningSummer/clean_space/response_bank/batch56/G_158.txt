To analyze the argument "Sometimes flu vaccines don’t work, therefore vaccines are useless," we'll need to apply the defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** This argument takes the specific occurrence of flu vaccines sometimes not working and generalizes it to conclude that all vaccines are useless. This is an overgeneralization, as it ignores the numerous instances where vaccines are highly effective.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument overlooks other important situations and contexts where vaccines are known to work effectively. It does not take into account the broader evidence base that supports the efficacy of vaccines.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The premise that flu vaccines sometimes don’t work does not logically lead to the conclusion that all vaccines are useless. There is a missing link in reasoning here, making the argument inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The argument fails to establish a sufficient causal link between the premise (sometimes flu vaccines don’t work) and the extremely broad conclusion (vaccines are useless). There is no robust causal reasoning presented.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This defective argument type is not strongly applicable in this case because there isn't a direct repetition of the same proposition to drive the argument.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The argument assumes a consensus or common agreement without sufficient evidence. It improperly asserts that because there are some instances of flu vaccines not working, everyone should conclude that vaccines in general are useless.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** The term "useless" is ambiguous and overly broad. It implies absolute inefficacy, which is not supported by the premise discussing flu vaccines.

In summary, the argument "Sometimes flu vaccines don’t work, therefore vaccines are useless" primarily displays the defective argument types Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), and Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>).
