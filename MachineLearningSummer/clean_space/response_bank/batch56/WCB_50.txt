For 
The argument provided is: “The rooster crows always before the sun rises, therefore the crowing rooster causes the sun to rise.”

Let's apply the defective argument analysis to this argument:

**Argument:** 
“The rooster crows always before the sun rises, therefore the crowing rooster causes the sun to rise.”

This argument can be categorized under the defective argument type:

**Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Definition of WCB:** This type of argument assumes a causal relationship between two events without sufficient evidence to support this causality.

**Explanation:**
The argument assumes that because the rooster crows before the sun rises, the crowing is the cause of the sunrise. This is a classic example of the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy, where it is assumed that because one event follows another, the first event must be the cause of the second. There is no causal basis provided to support the claim that the rooster’s crowing causes the sun to rise.
