<IDAA>: Identify Defective Argument All Applications

Let's analyze the provided argument: “It’s wrong to tax corporations—think of all the money they give to charity, and think of the costs they already pay to run their businesses!” using the defined defective argument types.

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - This argument could be seen as an overgeneralization that assumes all corporations give significant amounts to charity and all have high operational costs. It does not account for the variation among different corporations regarding their charitable contributions and costs.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: 
   - The argument lists two reasons (charity contributions and operational costs) but fails to mention other relevant factors like profitability, tax avoidance strategies, or benefits of corporate taxes to society. This incompleteness makes it an Incomplete Enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The reasons given (charity contributions and operational costs) do not necessarily lead to the conclusion that it is wrong to tax corporations. These points don’t conclusively support the argument against taxing corporations.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - The argument lacks a causal connection between the reasons and the conclusion. Just because corporations donate to charity and have operational costs does not provide a sufficient causal basis to conclude that they should not be taxed.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - The argument does not exhibit faulty repetition; it presents two distinct points.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - The argument does not explicitly rely on a generalized consensus or assumption about shared values or beliefs. There is no presumption of consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - The language in the argument is relatively straightforward and does not include ambiguous terms that could lead to misinterpretation.

**Conclusion**:
The argument shows signs of the following defective types:
  - **Generalization (G)**
  - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
  - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
  - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the given argument reveals several defects:
- It generalizes about corporate behavior without substantiating this generalization.
- It provides an incomplete list of factors relevant to the issue.
- It offers reasons that are not logically conclusive to the argument.
- It fails to establish a sufficient causal connection between the reasons and the conclusion.
