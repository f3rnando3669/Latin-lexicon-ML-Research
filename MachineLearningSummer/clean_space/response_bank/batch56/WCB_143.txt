For 
The argument presented is: "My child was diagnosed with autism after receiving vaccinations. That is proof that vaccines are to blame."

Applying the defective argument types to the argument:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument implies a causal relationship between autism and vaccinations without sufficient evidence. Just because autism was diagnosed after receiving vaccinations does not prove that the vaccines caused it. There could be many other factors involved, and without rigorous scientific evidence and controlled studies, this causal claim is unfounded.

Thus, the relevant defective argument type for this statement is **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
