To apply the defective argument types to the statement "Every time I wear this necklace, I pass my exams. Therefore, wearing this necklace causes me to pass my exams," let's identify the specific flaws in reasoning according to the given types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: The statement is based on too few observations to make a conclusive claim. Just because the individual has passed exams while wearing the necklace a few times does not mean this will always be the case.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement overlooks other potential factors that could contribute to passing exams, such as studying, preparation, or intrinsic ability.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The evidence provided (wearing the necklace and passing exams) is not sufficient to conclusively establish causation. Correlation does not imply causation.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is no causal evidence presented that links wearing the necklace directly to passing exams. The claim lacks the necessary logical basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This argument might repeat the flawed logic without presenting new evidence, thereby reinforcing the faulty reasoning.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The statement presumes a local or personal experience to be universally applicable without adequate support.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: There is no ambiguous language in this particular argument.

In summary, the argument "Every time I wear this necklace, I pass my exams. Therefore, wearing this necklace causes me to pass my exams" can be identified as having the following defective argument types:

- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

These labels help to point out the various weaknesses and faulty reasoning present in the argument.
