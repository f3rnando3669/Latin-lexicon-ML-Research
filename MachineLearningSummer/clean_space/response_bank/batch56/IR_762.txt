For 
The argument given is an instance of ad hominem, where the speaker dismisses the validity of advice based on the personal characteristic of the doctor (the doctor's weight) rather than the content or evidence behind the advice. 

Applying <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Application):

"My doctor is overweight, so I don't believe anything he tells me about improving my health."

- **Type**: Ad Hominem (personal attack)
- **Explanation**: This argument is defective because it attacks the individual (the doctor) rather than addressing the validity and evidence of the health advice provided.
- **Defective Argument Classification**: This specific reasoning doesn't precisely fall under the defective argument types provided earlier (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>). However, for the sake of categorization, if it had to be placed under one, one might argue it marginally fits under **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** since the person's weight does not conclusively refute the correctness of their health advice.
