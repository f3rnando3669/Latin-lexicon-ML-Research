For 
<IDAA>: Identify Defective Argument Application

The argument presented is as follows: "An environmental group illegally blocked loggers and workers at a nuclear plant. Therefore, environmentalists are radicals who take the law into their own hands."

To identify the defective argument types in this statement, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument takes the actions of a specific environmental group and generalizes it to all environmentalists. The behavior of one group does not necessarily represent the behavior of the entire category.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not take into account the diversity of environmentalist groups and their actions. It provides an incomplete enumeration by focusing on one incident without considering whether it is representative.

3. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The term "environmentalists" is used ambiguously. It could refer to anyone concerned with the environment, ranging from peaceful activists to radical groups. The lack of specificity leads to a misleading conclusion.

Therefore, the argument primarily suffers from <G> (Generalization), <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration), and <DEP> (Ambiguous Language).
