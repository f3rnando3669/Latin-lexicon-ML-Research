The scenario where someone says, "You can't prove that space aliens don't exist, so they must be real," is an example of **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**. This fallacy occurs when the absence of evidence is used as evidence of existence or truth, which is not a valid logical conclusion. 

In this case, the reasoning is flawed because the inability to disprove something does not constitute proof of its existence. This common error in logic is also known as an appeal to ignorance fallacy.
