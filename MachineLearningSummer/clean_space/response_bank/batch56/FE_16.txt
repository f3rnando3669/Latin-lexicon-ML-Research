The argument presented can be examined using <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Application) to determine if any defective argument types apply. Here's the breakdown:

"The school is in bad shape. Either we tear it down and put up a new building, or we continue to risk students’ safety. Obviously, we shouldn’t risk anyone’s safety, so we must tear the building down.”

1. **Generalization (G):** This type involves making a broad conclusion based on a limited set of examples. Though potential, it's less applicable here since the argument doesn't seem to generalize broadly from a few cases beyond the specific instance of the school.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This defective argument shows up when only a few options are considered while ignoring others. This argument presents a false dichotomy by suggesting there are only two possible actions: tearing down the building or risking safety, overlooking potential third options (e.g., repairing the building). Hence, <FE> applies here.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This type involves premises that do not sufficiently support the conclusion. While there is a logical connection here (safety concerns leading to action), the argument’s lack of exploration of alternative solutions might still reflect an inconclusive reason.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This applies when a causal relationship is presumed without adequate justification. If we scrutinize this, there is a superficial causality implied between the building's state and danger without deeper evaluation. So <WCB> might be lightly applicable.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Repetition doesn’t necessarily play a role here as the argument isn't circling back to restate an unsupported claim repeatedly.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This would occur if the argument falsely assumes shared agreement. The argument doesn’t really presume that everyone agrees with tearing down the building, so <FU> is less applicable.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** This defective argument would rely on unclear or flexible wording. This particular passage doesn’t overtly use ambiguous terms; hence <DEP> doesn’t seem to apply.

### Conclusion:
The primary defective argument type applicable here is:

- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: The argument commits to a false dilemma by presenting only two options without considering other viable alternatives (like renovating or repairing the building).

Secondary, though less strongly, could be:

- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** and possibly **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)** for not sufficiently exploring causal connections or premises.

Thus, the primary <IDAA> application should focus on <FE>.
