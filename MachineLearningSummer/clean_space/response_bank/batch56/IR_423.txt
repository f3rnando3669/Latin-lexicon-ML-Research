For 
<IDAA> stands for "Identify Defective Argument Application." Let's apply it to the provided statement:

Statement: "We should offer movies on our company’s website."

Reply: "No, we’ve built our company’s fortune by renting movies only through our stores."

In this case, the reply seems to use <IR> (Inconclusive Reason). The fact that the company has built its fortune by renting movies only through their stores does not conclusively address the potential benefits or viability of offering movies on the website. The argument in the reply lacks a strong reasoning that directly addresses why expanding to the web would not be beneficial or worth considering. Instead, it merely relies on past success in a different context, which does not necessarily preclude future success in a new venture.
