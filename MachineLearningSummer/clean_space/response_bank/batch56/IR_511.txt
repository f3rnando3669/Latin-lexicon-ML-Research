Based on the definitions provided for defective argument types, we can identify the most appropriate categorization for the argument in question:

"Only asking 5 people their opinion about Christian Heritage and saying their opinions are the "majority" of people."

This argument can be identified as <FE>, which stands for Incomplete Enumeration. Here's why:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This type of defective argument occurs when a conclusion is drawn based on an insufficient or non-representative sample size. In the given example, the conclusion about the majority opinion is drawn from the responses of only 5 people, which is not a reliable or comprehensive sample size to represent the entire population's opinion on Christian Heritage.

Thus, the argument "Only asking 5 people their opinion about Christian Heritage and saying their opinions are the 'majority' of people" is an example of <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration).
