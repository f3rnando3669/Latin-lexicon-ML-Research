For 
Applying <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Application) to the statement:

"Which rhetorical fallacy is a broad statement about people on the basis of gender, ethnicity, race, or political, social, professional, or religious group?"

The rhetorical fallacy being described is closely aligned with the defective argument type "Generalization" (G). Generalization involves making a broad statement without sufficient evidence to support such a wide-reaching conclusion. In this context, generalizations about people based on their gender, ethnicity, race, or membership in any sort of group would fall under this category, specifically termed as "hasty generalization" in the context of rhetorical fallacies.
