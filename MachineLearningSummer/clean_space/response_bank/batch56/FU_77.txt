For 
The phrase "Ninety percent of all people surveyed said that McDonalds is better than Burger King, so we can confidently say we are the best." can represent the following defective argument types:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This argument might suffer from an incomplete enumeration because it depends on a specific sample of people surveyed without specifying the breadth, diversity, or randomness of the sample. The survey may not be representative of the general population.
  
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This could also fall under insufficient causal basis as the argument assumes that a survey's result necessarily equates to a factual or objective "best" without considering other factors like individual preferences, nutritional quality, or service consistency.

3. **Generalization (G)**: The argument generalizes the opinion of those surveyed to assert a universal truth. It assumes that what is true for the surveyed group is true for everyone, which may not be the case.

Therefore, this phrase can be seen primarily as an **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** and a **Generalization (G)**.
