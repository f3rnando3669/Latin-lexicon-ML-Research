In order to properly analyze "If you are not with us, you are against us" using the defective argument types defined, we need to outline the potential flaws in the argument. Here's the analysis:

### Argument Analysis: "If you are not with us, you are against us."

1. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - "If you are not with us, you are against us" implies a false dichotomy. It presents only two mutually exclusive options without considering other possibilities, such as neutrality or partial agreement. This false repetition oversimplifies complex social or political stances.

2. **Generalization (G)**:
   - This statement generalizes all potential stances into binary categories (with us or against us), ignoring the nuances and spectrum of opinions that people might hold. 

3. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - The argument fails to enumerate all possible scenarios. Not everyone who isn't explicitly "with" a group is "against" it. There could be neutral parties, people with partial agreement, or people indifferent to the cause.

4. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - The terms "with us" and "against us" are ambiguous as they lack precise definitions. Someone could interpret "with us" to mean full support, occasional support, or even passive agreement, while "against us" could be interpreted in varying intensities, from active opposition to mere disinterest.

Based on the types of defective arguments denoted, "If you are not with us, you are against us" can be identified as primarily involving **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**, **Generalization (G)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, and **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**. It simplifies a complex range of positions into two extreme and inaccurately defined categories.
