IDAA: Identify, Define, Assess, and Address

**Identify**: 

"Moving the goalposts or making up exceptions when a claim is shown to be false."

**Define**: 

This is a logical fallacy where one changes the criteria for proof or modifies the claim being argued in order to avoid admitting that the original claim has been disproven. It can also be known as the "special pleading" fallacy.

**Assess**:

1. **Nature of the Fallacy**: This fallacy makes it difficult to disprove the claim because it continually shifts the requirements needed to disprove it.
2. **Impact on Argument**: It undermines the integrity of the argument, making it appear that the person using this tactic is not interested in a fair and logical examination of evidence.
3. **Common Signs**: Statements like "But what I really meant was..." or "That evidence doesn't count because..." are common markers of moving the goalposts.

**Address**:

1. **Confront the Shifting Criteria**: Point out that changing the criteria is unfair and leads to an endless loop where the claim can never be properly addressed or disproven.
2. **Request Clear Criteria**: Insist on a clear and consistent standard for what evidence would be required to prove or disprove the claim.
3. **Highlight Inconsistency**: Emphasize how the original criteria for the argument have been met and show how shifting them demonstrates a lack of commitment to a logical and fair debate.

**Categorization under Defective Argument Types:**

- **Defective Argument Type**: **<IDAA>** Moving the goalposts or making up exceptions when a claim is shown to be false can be considered a defective argument type because it relies on constantly altering the premise rather than addressing the original argument directly.
- **Potential Subtypes Involved**:
  - **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: If moving the goalposts involves demanding further evidence without acknowledging the sufficiency of the presented evidence.
  - **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: If the new exceptions are brought up as inconclusive reasons to dismiss the falsification without solid grounds.
  - **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: If the criteria are changed based on assumed agreement that hasn't been empirically established.
