For 
The defective argument type <IDAA> seems to be missing from the list provided. However, based on the statement provided, we can analyze it using one of the defined defective argument types. 

We can see that J is diverting the argument about the preference of cats over dogs to make a personal attack on V's character instead of addressing the main issue. This diversion strategy does not match any of the listed defective argument types explicitly but is commonly referred to as an "Ad Hominem" fallacy in classical terms. Since we don't have <IDAA> defined, we can't apply it specifically. 

However, let's analyze it with the other types to ensure accuracy:

- Generalization <G>: Not applicable as the argument does not involve an over-generalization.
- Incomplete Enumeration <FE>: Not applicable as the argument doesn't involve failing to list all possibilities.
- Inconclusive Reason <IR>: Could be considered this because J's personal attack does not conclusively resolve the argument on cats vs. dogs.
- Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>: Not applicable as there is no causal relationship being incorrectly established here.
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>: Not applicable as no proposition is being redundantly repeated.
- Presumptuous Consensus <FU>: Not applicable as a false consensus is not being claimed.
- Ambiguous Language <DEP>: Not applicable as the language used by J is not ambiguous.

Out of the types provided, the closest match might be <IR> â€“ Inconclusive Reason, because J's attack on V's character does not provide a logical conclusion to the debate about cats vs. dogs. Nonetheless, the provided argument chiefly aligns with an Ad Hominem fallacy, which isn't listed here.
