For 
To apply the defective argument type IDAA (Identify Defective Argument Application) to the statement "The news is fake because so much of the news is fake," we need to identify which specific defective argument types are present in this statement.

1. **Generalization (G)**: 
   The argument presumes that because "so much of the news" is fake, it follows that all news is fake. It's a broad generalization without sufficient evidence for such a sweeping conclusion. 

2. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: 
   The argument is circular. The premise "so much of the news is fake" is nearly identical to the conclusion "The news is fake," offering no new evidence and merely restating the same idea.

So, the statement contains the following defective argument types:
- **Generalization (G)**
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**

By identifying these defects, we can better understand why the given argument is flawed.
