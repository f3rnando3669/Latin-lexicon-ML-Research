For 
<IDAA> refers to Identifying Defective Argument Applications. Given this context, let’s analyze the provided text for any defective arguments.

Text Analysis:
"Who is Sam Brownbeck, and why is he saying all those terrible things about rock lyrics? On Nov. 6, Brownbeck, an ambitious Kansas Republican ... convened a hearing billed as "An Example of Violent Music Lyrics on Youth Behavior and Well Being ..." Brownbeck's subcommittee, which supervises schools and streets in D.C., has much more important work to do, but the senator, who will run again in 1998, is clearly searching for an issue to give him national prominence."

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - The text implies a broad generalization that all statements by Sam Brownbeck on rock lyrics are "terrible things." It doesn't consider the specific content of his statements or any evidence supporting them.
  
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - The text mentions that Brownbeck's subcommittee has "much more important work to do" but doesn't list these other priorities or evidence to substantiate the claim that they are more important.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - There is a suggestion that Brownbeck is holding a hearing purely to gain national prominence for the 1998 election. While it might be plausible, the reasoning is not conclusively demonstrated; it's speculative without supporting evidence.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - The text provides insufficient causal basis by stating that Brownbeck's actions are principally driven by ambitions without clearly linking his motives and the specific actions or providing evidence of this causation.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - Not extensively present. The argument about Brownbeck’s ambition does not seem to be repetitive in the text.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - The claim that the senator’s work subcommittee has more important things to do presumes a consensus on what constitutes “important work” without providing evidence of a widely accepted consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - Terms like "terrible things" and "much more important work" are vague and ambiguous, lacking clarity and specificity.

In summary, the text indeed contains several defects in its arguments, specifically <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>. Identifying these helps to understand the potential biases and weaknesses in the argument being presented.
