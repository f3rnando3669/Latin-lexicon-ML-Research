For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application.

In the given exchange between Dr. Simmons and Misty, Misty's response can be analyzed for defective arguments as follows:

"Dr. Simmons: I am working on a way to lengthen the human lifespan to about 200 years.
Misty: You are declaring war on Mother Nature, and Mother Nature always wins!"

The statement from Misty includes the following potential defective arguments:

1. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Misty uses the phrase "declaring war on Mother Nature," which is a metaphor with ambiguous implications. This phrase does not clearly define what "declaring war on Mother Nature" means in the context of extending human lifespan. There is a lack of precise language here.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Misty's assertion that "Mother Nature always wins" is not clearly supported by specific evidence or reasoning related to extending the human lifespan. This is a generalization that does not address the specifics of Dr. Simmons' research or provide a concrete basis for why it would inevitably fail.

By applying <IDAA>, Misty's response can be identified as incorporating the following defective arguments:

- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**: The phrase "declaring war on Mother Nature" is not clearly defined and is open to multiple interpretations.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The claim that "Mother Nature always wins" lacks specific evidence and reasoning relevant to the discussion about extending human lifespan.

Therefore, Misty's argument can be considered defective due to these elements.
