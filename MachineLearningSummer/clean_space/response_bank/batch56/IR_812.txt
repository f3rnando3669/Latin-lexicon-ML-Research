For 
IDAA (Identify Defective Arguments and Assign) involves identifying and categorizing defective arguments within a given text. Let's analyze the given dialogue and identify any defective arguments:

### Dialogue:
1. "The police should stop environmental demonstrators from inconveniencing the general public. We pay our taxes."
2. "Surely global meltdown is infinitely worse than a little inconvenience?"

### Analysis:

#### Statement 1:
"The police should stop environmental demonstrators from inconveniencing the general public. We pay our taxes."

- **Type:** Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
  - **Explanation:** The speaker is implying that because we pay taxes, the police should stop environmental demonstrators. The argument lacks a sufficient causal connection between paying taxes and the police's duty to stop demonstrators, as tax payments do not directly specify such actions.

#### Statement 2:
"Surely global meltdown is infinitely worse than a little inconvenience?"

- **Type:** Generalization (G) and Inconclusive Reason (IR)
  - **Explanation of Generalization (G):** The speaker makes a broad statement implying that all forms of environmental demonstration are justified because global meltdown is worse. This generalizes the severity and relevance of all environmental protests without considering specific contexts.
  - **Explanation of Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The argument is inconclusive because it doesn't directly address whether or not the police should intervene in specific demonstrations, making the reasoning provided insufficient to support a specific actionable conclusion against the previous statement.

### Conclusion:
Using IDAA (Identify Defective Arguments and Assign), the dialogue contains the following defective argument types:
1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** in the first statement.
2. **Generalization (G)** and **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** in the second statement.
