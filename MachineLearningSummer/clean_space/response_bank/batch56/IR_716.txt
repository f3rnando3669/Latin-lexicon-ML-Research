For 
To apply Identifying Defective Argument Analysis (<IDAA>) to the statement:

"During the presidential campaign of 1800, John Adams was called 'a fool, a gross hypocrite and an unprincipled oppressor.' His rival, Thomas Jefferson, on the other hand, was deemed 'an uncivilized atheist, anti-American, a tool for the godless French.'"

we need to identify which, if any, of the defective argument types are present in the given statement.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This type is not obviously applicable here as the statement does not offer a broad generalization based on limited evidence.
  
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This type is used when only a partial list is presented as if it were complete, which does not seem applicable here.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This may somewhat apply since the statement provides accusations without providing substantial evidence or reasoning to support those claims. The terms used are subjective and inflammatory without argumentative support.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This type is about causation claims that lack sufficient basis. The statement does not make causal claims, so this tag does not apply.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This type refers to repeating a proposition without substantiating it further. The statement does have repeated accusations but does not repeat a single proposition to make it seem true.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This involves assuming agreement without actual evidence of such. This might partly apply since the statement implies these views were widely held without evidence of consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This would be applicable if the terms used in the argument are not clearly defined or can be interpreted in multiple ways, which applies here given the vague and subjective nature of the insults.

Assessing the statement using <IDAA>:

- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The statement uses disparaging labels without providing supporting evidence for these accusations.
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: The accusations imply that these negative views were universally accepted without evidence of such consensus.
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**: The terms used are subjective and could be interpreted in various ways, leading to ambiguity.

Thus, the statement can be tagged with <IR>, <FU>, and <DEP> indicating the defective argument types identified.
