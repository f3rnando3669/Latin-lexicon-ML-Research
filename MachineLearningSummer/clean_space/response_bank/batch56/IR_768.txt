The argument presented, "We should abolish the death penalty. Even Taylor Swift is opposed to it," falls under a persuasive technique that leverages the opinion of a prominent figure, which may lack a substantive basis for the claim being made. In this context, it assumes that Taylor Swift's opposition to the death penalty is a compelling reason for everyone else to hold the same view without providing empirical evidence or logical reasoning supporting the position.

None of the defective argument types you've defined directly encapsulate this form of argument, although aspects could be seen as related to others like:

1. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)** - since it might imply a broader social consensus based on a celebrity's opinion.
2. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** - since the reason given (Taylor Swift's opposition) is insufficiently substantiated for the conclusion (abolishing the death penalty).

So, while not a perfect fit to the types defined specifically here, "We should abolish the death penalty. Even Taylor Swift is opposed to it" aligns most closely with an Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), as it fails to provide a necessarily valid or strong basis for the argument, presuming that the opinion of a celebrity should sufficiently influence public policy on its own.

Thus, we label it as:

<IR>
