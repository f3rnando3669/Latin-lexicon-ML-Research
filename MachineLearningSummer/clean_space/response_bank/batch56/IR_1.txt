For 
<IDAA> refers to "Identifying Defective Argument Types and Applying Annotations."

Let's analyze the provided argument and identify any defective argument types:

**Argument:**
"World-renowned physicist Dr. Patricia Mitchell assures me that exposure to natural sunlight, even exposure resulting in mild sunburn, is still significantly less of a cancer risk than brief exposure to the artificial light in a tanning bed. So I make sure to tell all of my friends that if they’re looking to get a tan this summer they should do it outdoors, and not at the tanning salon!"

## Identified Defective Argument Types:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - The argument presents only two options for tanning: natural sunlight and tanning beds. It does not consider other possible methods of tanning, such as spray tans or the use of sunscreen to minimize risks.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - The argument relies heavily on the authority of Dr. Patricia Mitchell without providing specific evidence or studies to back the claim. It assumes that a statement from an authority figure is conclusively persuasive without further support.

3. **Generalization (G):**
   - The argument generalizes that all exposure to natural sunlight (even leading to sunburn) is necessarily better than any exposure to tanning bed light. This does not account for individual variations in skin type, existing health conditions, or other factors.

## Application of <IDAA>:

**Annotated Argument:**
"World-renowned physicist Dr. Patricia Mitchell assures me that exposure to natural sunlight, even exposure resulting in mild sunburn, is still significantly less of a cancer risk than brief exposure to the artificial light in a tanning bed **(<IR>, relying on authority without detailed evidence)**. So I make sure to tell all of my friends that if they’re looking to get a tan this summer they should do it outdoors, and not at the tanning salon **(<FE>, not considering other tanning options), (<G>, generalizing about sunlight and tanning beds without considering variations)**!"

This annotation process identifies specific defects in the argument and provides insight into its weaknesses for better evaluation and critical thinking.
