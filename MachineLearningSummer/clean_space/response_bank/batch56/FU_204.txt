For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument in Application.

Applying <IDAA> to the statement "Trying to convince others that everyone is doing it or everyone feels this way so they should too," we can identify the following defective argument type:

This statement exemplifies <FU>, Presumptuous Consensus.

In this context, the argument relies on the assumption that because a majority (or seemingly everyone) behaves or thinks a certain way, this should be taken as a valid reason for others to conform to the same behavior or opinion. This is problematic because it imposes a consensus without critically addressing the validity or reasoning behind the behavior or opinion itself.

Therefore, the defective argument type in this case is <FU> - Presumptuous Consensus.
