Defining <IDAA> as a placeholder for Identifying the Type of Defective Argument Applied:

Let's break down the argument "Don't ever steal! Once you start, you won't be able to stop, and you'll end up bankrupt." to identify any defective argument types:

1. **"Don't ever steal!"** - This is a categorical statement against stealing but is not itself a complete argument.

2. **"Once you start, you won't be able to stop,"** - This implies that stealing is inevitably a slippery slope which is a form of Generalization (<G>). The argument assumes that once someone starts stealing, they will inherently be unable to stop, without considering individual differences or circumstances.

3. **"and you'll end up bankrupt."** - This statement is jumping to a causative conclusion without sufficient basis. It suggests a direct causal relationship between stealing and ending up bankrupt, which may not necessarily follow. This can be classified as Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).

Combining these insights:

**Applying <IDAA> to:**

"Don't ever steal! Once you start, you won't be able to stop, and you'll end up bankrupt."

- **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement assumes an inevitable progression from starting to steal to being unable to stop.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The conclusion that one will end up bankrupt due to stealing lacks sufficient causal evidence.

Thus, the argument contains both Generalization and Insufficient Causal Basis as defective argument types.
