For 
<IDAA> stands for **Identifying Defective Argumentation Appealing Arguments**.

In the given statement, "4 out of 5 dentists recommend this toothpaste! (only 5 were asked. Out of 1000 asked, only 20% recommend it)," we can identify the defective arguments as follows:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The claim "4 out of 5 dentists recommend this toothpaste" suggests a high approval rate, but it is based on an inadequately small and unrepresentative sample size of only 5 dentists. The broader sample of 1000 dentists shows that only 20% recommend the toothpaste, which gives a more realistic but significantly less impressive approval rate.

To apply <IDAA>:
1. **Identify the incomplete enumeration**: The statement takes a small subset of data (5 dentists) to make a general recommendation.
2. **Recognize the misleading nature of the selection**: The subset (5 dentists) is not representative of the larger group (1000 dentists).
3. **Conclude the defective nature**: The argument is defective because it uses a small and selective sample to make an exaggerated generalization, ignoring the more comprehensive dataset.

The statement "4 out of 5 dentists recommend this toothpaste" is a defective argument due to **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**.
