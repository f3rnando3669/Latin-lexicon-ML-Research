For 
The argument provided falls under a kind of logical fallacy or defective argument often referred to as an "appeal to emotion" or more specifically, an "appeal to pity" (ad misericordiam). However, based on the defective argument types defined:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This argument assumes that just because the defendant is the speakerâ€™s son and a generally good person who made a mistake, it addresses the individual case without considering all instances where someone might argue the same.

This argument is appealing to the judge's emotions to gain leniency, not the legal principles or objective reasons regarding the case at hand. Though it doesn't fit perfectly into any of the provided codes, <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration) comes closest because it fails to consider the broader context and other similar situations that might also demand leniency by arguing the same point.
