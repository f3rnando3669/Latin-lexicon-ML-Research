Certainly! To apply the Identifying Defective Argument Analysis (IDAA) to the given statement, we need to identify any defective argument types within it. The statement is:

"What I do know is that if a dirty bomb goes off on Wall Street and the winds are blowing this way, then I and much of this part of Brooklyn are possibly toast. Is that worth possible violations of the rights of some psycho-violent street thug? To me it is."

Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The statement "if a dirty bomb goes off on Wall Street and the winds are blowing this way, then I and much of this part of Brooklyn are possibly toast" could be an overgeneralization. It assumes a specific scenario will happen and generalizes the outcome without sufficient evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The argument implies there are only two options: violating rights or risking safety. It does not consider other potential solutions or factors, leading to an incomplete enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The argument question "Is that worth possible violations of the rights of some psycho-violent street thug?" presupposes that violating rights is justified by potential safety without a logical connection or conclusive reasoning that supports such action.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The connection between the presence of a "psycho-violent street thug" and preventing a dirty bomb scenario is not causally established. There is insufficient basis to link the two events directly.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - This doesn't directly apply here since there is no repeated proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - The use of "To me it is" implies a personal consensus rather than an objective assessment, presuming agreement without providing substantive consensus-building evidence.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - The term "psycho-violent street thug" is ambiguous and subjective, leading to a potentially biased or loaded interpretation, thus not clearly defined.

In conclusion, the statement "What I do know is that if a dirty bomb goes off on Wall Street and the winds are blowing this way, then I and much of this part of Brooklyn are possibly toast. Is that worth possible violations of the rights of some psycho-violent street thug? To me it is." contains the following defective argument types:

- Generalization (<G>)
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
- Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)

By identifying these defects, we see the argument lacks robust reasoning and relies on presumptions, ambiguous language, and incomplete logical structure.
