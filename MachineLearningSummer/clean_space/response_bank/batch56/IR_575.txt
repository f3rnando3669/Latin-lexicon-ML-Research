Sure, I can help you apply these defective argument types to the given example. However, it seems there is a typo in your request. You mention applying `<IDAA>`, but it seems you might have intended to apply one of the defective argument types you defined earlier.

Here's the example you provided and how it might fit:

**(Ignoring the Question): when a rebuttal doesn't address the question** 

This is a classic case of avoiding the actual issue or diverting attention. This type of argument doesn't directly align with the defective argument types defined earlier, but we can interpret it in terms of these categories.

- **Generalization (<G>)**: This might not fit here since it involves drawing broad conclusions from specific instances.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This usually implies failing to account for all possibilities, which doesn't exactly fit.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This could apply if the rebuttal avoids the question by providing reasoning that doesn't lead to a clear conclusion.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This generally applies to arguments lacking causal evidence, not to directly avoiding questions.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This refers to repeating something without proper support, which isn’t the case here.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This involves assuming agreement without basis, which doesn’t directly apply.

- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: If the rebuttal doesn’t address the question due to vagueness or ambiguity, this could apply.

Considering the possibilities, the best match for "Ignoring the Question" could be:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** if the rebuttal leads to a situation where the question remains unanswered due to insufficient and vague reasoning.
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)** if the rebuttal's response is unclear or vague, thereby sidestepping the actual question.

However, in a strict sense, "Ignoring the Question" might most closely relate to a different type of fallacy not explicitly listed in your definitions, such as a **Red Herring** or **Evasion**. These terms from traditional logical fallacies might capture it more precisely than the provided defective argument categories.

Would you like to refine the definitions or add more categories to better capture this concept?
