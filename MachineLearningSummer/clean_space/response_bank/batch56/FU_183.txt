For 
To analyze the argument "Doing something because everyone else is doing it" using defective argument types, we apply the principles of defective argument analysis (IDAA) to see which specific defects are present in this reasoning.

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument assumes a general principle that if everyone is doing something, it must be appropriate or correct. This is an overgeneralization since it doesn't consider individual circumstances or the potential flaws in the majority's decision.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument may imply that the only reason to do something is because others are doing it, disregarding other important factors. It fails to enumerate all possible reasons or justifications for the action.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning is inconclusive because the popularity of an action does not necessarily constitute a logical or justifiable reason for doing it. The fact that others are doing something does not inherently prove it is beneficial or correct.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is insufficient causal basis in claiming that the action is correct solely based on its popularity. Just because an action is common does not provide a causal link to its suitability or correctness.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The statement might involve repeating the faulty premise that popularity equals correctness without any new support or justification.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument presumes consensus to be a valid reason for action, which is a presumptuous claim. It assumes that if a majority is involved in an action, that consensus itself provides a rationale for participation without additional evidence.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The phrase "everyone else" is ambiguous. It is not clear who "everyone else" includes or the contexts where this behavior is observed. This ambiguity weakens the argument by not specifying the scope or relevance of the majority being referenced.

By applying IDAA, we recognize that the argument "Doing something because everyone else is doing it" is primarily defective due to:

- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**

These identified defects illustrate that the argument is logically flawed and insufficient as a sound basis for decision-making.
