The argument provided involves the fallacy of False Dilemma (or False Dichotomy), where only two possible options are presented as if they are the only available choices, excluding other potential alternatives.

Given your request for defining and applying specific defective argument types (though <IDAA> is undefined within your original list, it seems logical that it may refer to an Identity Argument Application Directive) here is an analysis under a reasonable assumption:

The argument begins with the premises about Caldwell Hall's condition and concludes by asserting that, for safety reasons, the building must be torn down, claiming there are no other solutions.

Analysis:
- **Premise**: Caldwell Hall is in bad shape.
- **Premise**: Either we tear it down or continue to risk students' safety.
- **Conclusion**: We must tear the building down.

We can identify the defective argument here:
- **Generalization (G):** None present.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This closely aligns with the nature of a False Dilemma, suggesting more than one solution is possible apart from those listed. This argument assumes only two possible actions without considering other feasible options (like renovation, upgrading safety measures, etc.)

Thus, applying the defective argument type:
**“Caldwell Hall is in bad shape. Either we tear it down and put up a new building, or we continue to risk students’ safety. Obviously we shouldn’t risk anyone’s safety, so we must tear the building down.”** demonstrates Incomplete Enumeration (FE). 

In summary, the inappropriate narrowing down of options presented makes this an **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**.
