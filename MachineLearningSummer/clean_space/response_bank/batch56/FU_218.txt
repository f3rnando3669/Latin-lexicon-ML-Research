For 
The argument "Killing thousands of people as a result of drug war campaign is not a crime to humanity because millions of Filipino support it" can be analyzed and identified as a defective argument type using <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Types Applied Analysis).

1. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This argument falls under the type <FU> because it presumes that the support of millions of Filipinos legitimizes or justifies the killings associated with the drug war campaign. Consensus or widespread support does not inherently validate the ethical or legal status of an action.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument provides an inconclusive reason by appealing to popular support without addressing the actual moral or legal implications of the killings. Just because many people support an action does not necessarily make it right or justifiable.

Based on the analysis, the argument in question can be identified primarily under <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus) and <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
