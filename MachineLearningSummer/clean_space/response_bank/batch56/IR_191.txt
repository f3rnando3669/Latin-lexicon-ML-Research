For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application.

The dialogue between Roommate A and Roommate B is an example of a **Deflection**, shifting the focus from the initial complaint to another issue without addressing the original problem. However, it doesn't perfectly fit the previously defined defective argument types, but we can still identify it within a broader context of argumentation.

Breaking it down:
- **Roommate A** brings up an issue about the dog peeing everywhere.
- **Roommate B** responds by bringing up a different issue about the cat shedding.

Since none of the provided defective argument types directly match this deflection technique (also known as a *"Tu Quoque"* or "Whataboutism"), it can be analyzed as an attempt to deflect criticism rather than addressing it, though not defined explicitly above.

We can provide an analysis for general understanding:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: This isn't a general claim, but a specific issue about a dog.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: It doesn't fit incomplete listing of possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Doesnâ€™t fit an unsupported conclusion about the original issue.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Causal connections are not a focus here.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This isn't a case of repeating a faulty proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: It doesn't assume consensus without evidence.
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: Language isn't particularly ambiguous in this exchange.

Given the original context, the dialogue more closely fits within the realm of deflective argumentation rather than the specific defective arguments defined above. Thus, it may be best described as showing symptoms of a **"Deflection"**, not listed within those provided defective argument types but generally understood in argument analysis.
