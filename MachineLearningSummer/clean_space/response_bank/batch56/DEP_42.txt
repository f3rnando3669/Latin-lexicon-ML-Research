For 
To apply the defective argument analysis (<IDAA>) to the statement "Science shows us that improved quality of life comes through research and invention," we will examine the statement to identify potential defects in the argument's structure and reasoning. Let's break down the potential defective argument types and see if any of them apply:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This occurs when a broad conclusion is made based on a limited number of cases. In this statement, there is an implicit assumption that "improved quality of life" is solely or predominantly due to "research and invention," which may be an overgeneralization if not all improved quality of life cases are due to these factors.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This is when an argument fails to consider all possible options. The statement suggests that research and invention are the only pathways to an improved quality of life, which overlooks other potential factors such as social policies, economic conditions, and education.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This occurs when the evidence provided does not conclusively support the conclusion. While science, research, and invention may contribute to quality of life improvements, the statement does not provide specific evidence or detailed reasoning on how these factors are directly responsible for the improvements, making the reasoning inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This applies when an argument assumes a causal relationship without adequate evidence. The statement assumes that research and invention directly cause improved quality of life, which may not be sufficiently supported by evidence.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This occurs when the same proposition is repeated in different forms without adding substantive new arguments or evidence. The given statement does not exhibit this defect.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This is when an argument assumes a consensus that may not exist. The use of "Science shows us" implies a broad scientific agreement, which may be presumptuous if there is not unanimous scientific consensus on this specific claim.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This occurs when the statement uses vague or ambiguous terms. The terms "improved quality of life," "research," and "invention" are somewhat undefined and could mean different things to different audiences, potentially leading to misunderstandings.

Given the statement and possible applications of defective argument types, let's identify the most relevant defects:

- **(G)**: Generalization, because the statement broadly concludes that "improved quality of life" results from "research and invention" without consideration of other contributing factors.
- **(FE)**: Incomplete Enumeration, since it suggests that research and invention are the sole contributors to an improved quality of life, excluding other relevant factors.
- **(IR)**: Inconclusive Reason, since the statement claims a causal relationship without conclusive evidence.
- **(WCB)**: Insufficient Causal Basis, as there may not be sufficient evidence to claim a direct causal link.
- **(FU)**: Presumptuous Consensus, because the statement assumes that the scientific community unanimously agrees on this assertion without providing evidence of such a consensus.
- **(DEP)**: Ambiguous Language, due to potentially vague terms like "improved quality of life" and "research and invention."

In summary, the argument "Science shows us that improved quality of life comes through research and invention" could be considered defective due to Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), and Ambiguous Language (DEP).
