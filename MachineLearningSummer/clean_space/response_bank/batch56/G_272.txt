For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Types.

Let's analyze the argument presented:
"Chihuahuas are good inside dogs. German Shepherds are dogs; therefore, German Shepherds would be good inside dogs, too."

This argument makes an assumption based on a broad categorization, while ignoring significant differences between the two specific breeds mentioned. Here is an application of <IDAA> to identify the defective argument types present:

1. <G> Generalization: The argument extrapolates the characteristics of Chihuahuas to all dogs without sufficient evidence. It assumes that what holds for one specific breed (Chihuahuas) must hold for another (German Shepherds), despite their substantial differences in size, temperament, and needs as inside dogs.

2. <IR> Inconclusive Reason: The reasoning connecting Chihuahuas being good inside dogs to German Shepherds being good inside dogs is not robust. It does not consider additional relevant factors like the difference in space requirements, energy levels, and behavioral tendencies of the two breeds.

So, the appropriate defective argument types for this argument are:
- <G> Generalization
- <IR> Inconclusive Reason
