For 
To apply the identification of defective argument types as "IDAA" to the given statement "My grandmother ate 10 cloves of raw garlic every day. Not surprisingly she lived to be 102.", we need to analyze the argument for any potential logical flaws or faulty reasoning. Let's break it down:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement bases the longevity of one person (the grandmother) on her habit of eating raw garlic. However, this does not account for the vast number of other factors that can contribute to a person's lifespan, nor does it provide enough cases to justify a general rule about garlic and longevity. If we were to generalize the experience of one person to a larger population without sufficient evidence, this would be a defective argument of generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument only considers the grandmother's garlic consumption as a factor for her long life without acknowledging other potential influences such as genetics, lifestyle, healthcare, environment, etc. This incomplete enumeration of factors makes the argument defective.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: There is no conclusive causal link provided between consuming raw garlic and living to 102. The argument lacks empirical evidence or explanation as to why garlic, specifically, would result in increased longevity, making the reasoning inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The statement implies a causal relationship between consuming garlic and longevity without sufficient scientific or causal evidence to support this claim. Correlation does not imply causation, and without a clear causal mechanism, the argument's basis is insufficient.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This defective argument type doesn't seem to apply here as the argument is not repetitively asserting the same proposition in a faulty manner.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: There is no mention of a consensus or appeal to general agreement in this argument. It is an individual observation rather than a claim about what people generally agree upon, so this defect does not apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The language in the statement is not particularly ambiguous; it is straightforward in asserting a connection between garlic consumption and longevity.

Given all the analysis, the primary defective argument types identified (IDAA) for this statement are:

- Generalization (<G>)
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)

Thus, the statement "My grandmother ate 10 cloves of raw garlic every day. Not surprisingly she lived to be 102." primarily exemplifies these identified defective argument types.
