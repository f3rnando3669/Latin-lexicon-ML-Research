For 
The argument given is an example of a **Slippery Slope** fallacy. This defective argument type typically involves suggesting that one small step will lead to a chain of related (and usually negative) events without providing sufficient evidence that the chain of events will actually occur.

Here's the breakdown of the argument and the fallacy:

---  
**Original Argument**: "If we let the government implant tracking devices in criminals, it's not going to stop there! They're going to want to track us at work, our school children, and then eventually everyone!"

**Identification of Defective Argument**:  
- The claim leaps to extreme and dramatic consequences without providing evidence for how tracking criminals would inevitably lead to tracking everyone.
  
**Defective Argument Label (<IDAA> Applied)**:  
-<IDAA>: **Slippery Slope**

**Reason for Labeling**:  
- The argument assumes that allowing tracking devices in one context (criminals) will unavoidably lead to tracking in increasingly broader and more intrusive contexts (everyone), without demonstrating a direct or necessary causal link for such a progression.

---  
If we were to further categorize this using some of the defective argument types you defined, we might use:

<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis): This specifically highlights that there is an assumption of a causal relationship between the initial action (tracking criminals) and the extreme outcome (tracking everyone), but lacks sufficient evidence to support that causal connection.
