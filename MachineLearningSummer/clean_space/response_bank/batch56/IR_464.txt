For 
<IDAA> refers to "Irrelevant Deflection of Attention Argument," often known as an ad hominem argument, which involves attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, rather than addressing the argument itself.

So, applying <IDAA> to the phrase ", motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument," you identify that the argument is targeting the individualâ€™s characteristics instead of engaging with the substance of the argument they present. 

The full identified context of an IDAA-type argument could be something like: 

"The critique focuses on attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument rather than addressing the argument itself."

Thus, it demonstrates a logical fallacy by deflecting the attention away from the actual issue at hand.
