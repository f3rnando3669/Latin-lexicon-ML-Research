Certainly! Based on your definitions of defective argument types, I will now apply the concept of "Identifying and Describing Argument Abnormalities" (<IDAA>) to the given sentence ", or a group of people think, in order to persuade one to think the same way."

**Diagnosis:**
- The phrase ", or a group of people think, in order to persuade one to think the same way," suggests that an individual's belief is based on the belief of a group of people, and the purpose is to persuade others to conform to that belief.

**Analysis:**
1. **Generalization (<G>):** This could imply a generalization when suggesting that what a group of people think is always persuasive or valid enough to convince others. However, the focus here is not on generalization.
 
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The phrase does not list all possible reasons or factors, but it is not trying to enumerate options, so this doesn't apply.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** It could imply an inconclusive reason because it presupposes that group consensus alone is sufficient to persuade others.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** There's no direct causal claim being made, so this one does not apply.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** There's no repetition here that is faulty.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This seems to be the most fitting. The argument is defective because it assumes that just because a group of people agree on something, it is persuasive or valid enough without providing substantial evidence or reasoning.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** The language is relatively clear and specific. No significant ambiguity is present.

**Conclusion:**
The most appropriate defective argument type here is **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**. The sentence assumes that because a group of people think in a particular way, it is compelling enough to persuade others to think the same, which is a presumptuous consensus without adequate support.
