To analyze the argument "Eat lamb--could thousands of coyotes be wrong?" using the defined defective argument types, let's break it down step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Premise**: The argument suggests that because thousands of coyotes eat lamb, this serves as evidence that eating lamb is a good or advisable practice.
2. **Conclusion**: Therefore, it implies that humans should also eat lamb.

### Applying Defective Argument Types:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This argument assumes that the dietary habits of coyotes (eating lamb) are indicative of what is suitable for humans, without considering other factors such as human dietary needs, ethics, and health implications. The enumeration of reasons is incomplete because it does not consider why coyotes eat lamb (necessity for survival, natural instinct, etc.) versus the broader context of human dietary choices.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument seems to suggest that because a large number of coyotes eat lamb, there is a consensus that it is a good thing to do. This is presumptuous since the consensus implied is based on an irrelevant comparison between the natural behavior of coyotes and the choices available to humans.

### Full Application:

**<IDAA> "Eat lamb--could thousands of coyotes be wrong?"**

The argument employs <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration) as it lists only one reason (the behavior of coyotes) to support the conclusion that humans should eat lamb, ignoring other important considerations. Additionally, it uses <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus) by suggesting that the sheer number of coyotes eating lamb constitutes an argument for humans to follow suit, without establishing a relevant connection between the behavior of coyotes and appropriate human dietary practice.

Therefore, the argument "Eat lamb--could thousands of coyotes be wrong?" is defective due to <FE> and <FU>.
