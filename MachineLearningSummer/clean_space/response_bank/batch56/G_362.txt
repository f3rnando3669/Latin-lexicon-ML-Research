For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application. Let's identify and apply the relevant defective argument types to the statement: "My neighborâ€™s child was kidnapped while playing alone in her yard. My city must be a dangerous place for children."

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument makes a broad conclusion about the safety of an entire city based on a single incident. Generalizing from one event to the overall safety of the city is not logically sound because it does not consider the myriad of factors that contribute to the overall safety of a place.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not enumerate or account for all the incidents or data points relevant to the safety of children in the city. It relies on just one case to draw a sweeping conclusion, which is a form of incomplete enumeration.

In summary, the argument can primarily be identified as a **Generalization (G)**, and it also involves **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**.
