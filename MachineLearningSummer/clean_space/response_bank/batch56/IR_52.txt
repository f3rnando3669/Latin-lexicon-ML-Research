For 
To apply the IDAA (Identify Defective Argument Apply Attribute) classification to the argument "Dr. X is an engineer, and he doesn't believe in global warming," we need to analyze the argument and see if it exhibits any of the defective argument types.

1. **Generalization (G)**: This is a broad statement or conclusion drawn from a limited number of instances. 
    - **Analysis**: The argument doesn’t seem to generalize from limited instances but instead presents a specific case.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This argument type involves drawing a conclusion based on an incomplete list of possibilities.
    - **Analysis**: The argument does not seem to list out possibilities or overlook various factors explicitly.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This argument type deals with providing reasons or premises that do not necessarily lead to the conclusion.
    - **Analysis**: The fact that Dr. X is an engineer does not provide sufficient grounds to accept his belief about global warming since expertise in engineering does not equate to expertise in climate science.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This involves asserting a causal relationship without sufficient evidence.
    - **Analysis**: The argument doesn’t explicitly assert causation, so this doesn’t fit.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This involves repeating a proposition without adding any new evidence or reasoning.
    - **Analysis**: There is no repetition in the argument.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This argument type assumes consensus or agreement without sufficient backing.
    - **Analysis**: The argument doesn’t assume broader consensus but rather cites a specific individual's belief.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This involves using terms or language that lacks precise meaning and leads to unclear reasoning.
    - **Analysis**: The language used in this argument isn’t inherently ambiguous.

Given the analysis, the best fit for the defective argument type is **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the argument's premise (Dr. X being an engineer) does not lead to a logically sound conclusion about global warming, as his expertise in engineering does not inherently qualify him to properly assess climate science.

So, applying IDAA, the argument:
"Dr. X is an engineer, and he doesn’t believe in global warming."
is best classified under:
**<IR> Inconclusive Reason**
