For 
"Although we have proven that the moon is not made of spare ribs, we have not proven that its core cannot be filled with them; therefore, the moon’s core is filled with spare ribs."

This argument is defective for several reasons:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The fact that we have not proven that the moon’s core cannot be filled with spare ribs does not constitute conclusive evidence that the moon’s core *is* filled with spare ribs. This reasoning is fallacious because it relies on the lack of disproof as proof.

2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is no evidence or causal basis provided to support the claim that the moon’s core is filled with spare ribs. The argument fails to establish any legitimate connection between the premises and the conclusion.

Thus, this argument can be classified as an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and an **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
