Sure! Let's analyze the argument in the given statement using the defect types specified:

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - There is no specific instance of generalization in the statement as it does not over-extend a principle to a broad conclusion without enough support.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - The statement does not list options or possibilities incompletely, so it doesn't fit this defect type either.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - The statement implies that by donating to a Kickstarter fund for a new phone case, you can help put an end to phone screen shattering incidents. The reasoning provided does not conclusively prove that donating to this fund will stop these incidents, which makes it an inconclusive reason.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - The claim that donating to the Kickstarter will "put an end to these devastating tragedies" lacks sufficient causal basis. It does not adequately establish how this new phone case will conclusively prevent phone screens from shattering.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - Thereâ€™s no repetitive proposition that needs to be identified.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - The statement does not rely on a presumed consensus without providing evidence. It does not indicate or assume that everyone already agrees on the necessity or effectiveness of the new phone case.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - Words like "devastating tragedies" can be considered somewhat ambiguous or emotionally loaded, suggesting extreme consequences without providing clarity or specific context about the severity of shattering a phone screen.

Based on these considerations, the main defective argument types that apply to the statement are:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**

So, the analyzed defective argument types for the given statement would be: <IR>, <WCB>, and <DEP>.
