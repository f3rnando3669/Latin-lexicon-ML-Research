For 
The statement "Nobody thinks homelessness is a good thing" can be analyzed using the defective argument types defined. Let's break it down:

### <G> Generalization:
The statement makes a sweeping generalization by claiming that no one at all thinks homelessness is a good thing. This is unlikely to be true in every single case, as there could be outliers or specific contexts where someone might think homelessness has some positive aspects (e.g., increased motivation for societal change).

### <FE> Incomplete Enumeration:
The argument assumes an exhaustive enumeration of everyone's beliefs about homelessness without considering that some people might have nuanced views or unexpressed opinions.

### <IR> Inconclusive Reason:
The statement doesn't provide any specific reasons, evidence, or context to support the claim that "nobody" thinks homelessness is a good thing. It simply asserts a conclusion without substantiating it.

### <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:
The statement does not attempt to establish a causal relationship, so this category might be less applicable here.

### <RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:
The statement is just presented once and does not involve any repetitive arguments, so this defect type is not applicable.

### <FU> Presumptuous Consensus:
The argument assumes a consensus without providing evidence that everyone indeed shares this belief. It presumes unanimity without foundation.

### <DEP> Ambiguous Language:
The term "good thing" is quite ambiguous and subjective. It isn't clear what it means for homelessness to be a "good thing" â€“ whether that refers to moral goodness, practical benefits, or some other criteria. The lack of clarification leads to ambiguity.

Therefore, the analysis of the statement "Nobody thinks homelessness is a good thing" using defective argument types yields:

- <G> Generalization
- <FE> Incomplete Enumeration
- <IR> Inconclusive Reason
- <FU> Presumptuous Consensus
- <DEP> Ambiguous Language
