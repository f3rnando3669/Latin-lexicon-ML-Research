For 
To apply the Identifying Defective Argument Analysis (IDAA) to the argument "Trying to finish a marathon is impossible, I know because I tried it once," let's identify which defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP) are involved:

1. **Generalization (G)**: Generalization involves making a broad claim based on a limited number of examples. The statement "Trying to finish a marathon is impossible" is a broad generalization made based on the speaker's single experience. This qualifies as **<G>** because the speaker is using their one experience to generalize about the difficulty of finishing a marathon for everyone.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Incomplete Enumeration occurs when an argument is based on a limited sample that is not representative of the whole. The statement assumes that the speaker's single experience is representative of what is possible or impossible for everyone, which is an incomplete enumeration of all possible outcomes for other people trying to run a marathon. This qualifies as **<FE>** because it's based on incomplete sampling that cannot represent the definitive difficulty of completing a marathon universally.

Given these points, let's apply the IDAA to the argument:

"Trying to finish a marathon is impossible, I know because I tried it once." 

**<G> Generalization:** The argument makes a broad claim about the impossibility of finishing a marathon based on a single example. 

**<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:** The argument does not consider the experiences of other people who have successfully finished a marathon, hence presenting an incomplete picture.

Therefore, the defective arguments identified in this statement are **<G> Generalization** and **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**.
