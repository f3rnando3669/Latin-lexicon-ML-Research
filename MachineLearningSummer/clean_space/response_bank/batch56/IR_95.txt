For 
The argument presented is: "My minister says the Covid vaccine will cause genetic mutations. He has a college degree, and is a holy man, so he must be right."

To apply the defective argument analysis acronym <IDAA> effectively, let's break down the argument and determine which types of defective arguments (as defined) it may involve:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** There is no indication that a sweeping generalization is being made in the provided statement, as it focuses specifically on the opinion of one individual (the minister).

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument does not appear to rely on an incomplete listing of evidence as its basis.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The argument presumes the minister's qualifications (having a college degree and being a holy man) are directly relevant to the specific claim about genetic mutations from the Covid vaccine. However, these qualifications do not necessarily provide a sufficient or conclusive reason to support his claim scientifically. Thus, the argument might exhibit characteristics of being inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The statement implies causation (Covid vaccine causing genetic mutations) without providing scientific evidence or a proper causal mechanism. The minister's credentials do not adequately establish a causal link.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The argument reiterates trust in the minister's claim due to his qualifications without providing additional evidence or logical support, potentially echoing a faulty repetition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This argument does not explicitly invoke the consensus or agreement of others; it is relying solely on the minister's perceived authority rather than the broad agreement of qualified experts.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** The language used ("college degree" and "holy man") is not ambiguous, but it is misleading in terms of relevance. The expertise inferred by these credentials does not directly correlate with expertise in genetic mutations or vaccine science.

Considering the analysis above, the primary defective argument types identified are:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The minister's qualifications do not provide a scientifically sound basis for his claims about the vaccine.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** There is no scientific explanation or evidence provided to support the claim about genetic mutations.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The argument reiterates trust in the minister's authority without substantial evidence.

Therefore, the argument "My minister says the Covid vaccine will cause genetic mutations. He has a college degree, and is a holy man, so he must be right." can be accurately labeled with:

<IR>, <WCB>, and <RR>.
