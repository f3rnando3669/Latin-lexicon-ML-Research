For 
<IDAA> stands for "Identify Defective Argument Application." Let's analyze the given statement using the definitions provided for defective argument types:

"You should always eat everything on your plate, think of all the children in Africa who donâ€™t always have enough food."

This argument can be classified under the defective argument type <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis). 

Here's the reasoning:

The statement implies that there is a causal link between eating everything on one's plate and the plight of hungry children in Africa. However, this connection is insufficient and faulty because the action of eating all the food on one's plate does not directly affect the situation of hunger in Africa. The underlying suggestion is that by eating everything on your plate, you somehow contribute to solving hunger issues, which is not logically or causally substantiated.

Therefore, <IDAA(WCB)> is appropriate for this argument.
