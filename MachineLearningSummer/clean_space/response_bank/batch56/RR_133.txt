For 
It appears that "<IDAA>" is an acronym or notation not defined in your initial list of defective argument types. Based on the context, it seems you might be asking for the identification and application of a defective argument type to the statement "Murder is morally wrong. Therefore, abortion is morally wrong."

Let's analyze the argument to see which of the previously defined defective argument types could apply:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   The argument does not seem to be a broad generalization from a specific case.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   This argument does not concern an incomplete listing of cases or instances.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   This could apply if the reasoning from "murder is morally wrong" to "therefore, abortion is morally wrong" lacks sufficient evidence or is not logically compelling. The statement seems to assume that the morality of abortion directly follows from the morality of murder without establishing a clear connection or rationale.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   This argument is not about causality but rather a moral equivalence.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   This argument does not simply repeat a proposition without providing new evidence.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   This argument is not presuming consensus without grounds but making a direct moral claim.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   The terms "murder" and "abortion" are not ambiguous per se, but their moral equivalence could be contested.

Given this analysis, the most applicable defective argument type is **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. The statement jumps to a conclusion that abortion is morally wrong based solely on the premise that murder is morally wrong, without adequately establishing the moral equivalence or addressing the complexities and differing contexts of the two acts.

So, applying **<IR>** to the argument:

Murder is morally wrong. Therefore, abortion is morally wrong. <IR>
