For 
<IDAA> refers to Identifying Defective Argument Application. To apply IDAA to the question "Fred, do you still cheat on your girlfriend?," we need to determine which defective argument type(s) the statement exemplifies.

This particular question is a classic example of a complex question fallacy, which presupposes something problematic or controversial as part of the question. In this case, it assumes that Fred cheats on his girlfriend.

Here's an analysis using IDAA:

1. **<DEP> Ambiguous Language:** The question contains implicit assumptions and ambiguous language regarding the behavior of "cheating."

2. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** This could also fall under inconclusive reasoning as it presumes a point (Fred cheats or did cheat on his girlfriend) without evidence or support, leading the discussion in a biased direction.

Thus, we can say that the question "Fred, do you still cheat on your girlfriend?" shows characteristics of both ambiguous language **<DEP>** and inconclusive reason **<IR>**.

Would you like to analyze another statement or have more detailed explanations on these defective argument types?
