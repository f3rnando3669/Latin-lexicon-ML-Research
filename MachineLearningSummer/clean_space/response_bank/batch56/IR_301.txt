For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Attributes. Let's identify which defective argument types apply to the given statement:

*"Nature gives people diseases and sickness; therefore, it is morally wrong to interfere with nature and treat sick people with medicine."*

1. **Generalization (G)**
   - This argument might involve overgeneralizing the role of nature in causing diseases to make a sweeping claim about morality.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
   - The statement does not consider other possibilities or solutions, such as the benefits of medicine, societal ethics, or the natural propensity for humans to seek self-preservation through medicine.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
   - This argument does not convincingly link the premise (nature causing sickness) to the conclusion (morality of interfering with nature). The connection between nature's role and moral action is not sufficiently established.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
   - The causal basis for declaring it morally wrong to treat people because nature causes diseases and sickness is insufficient. Just because something is natural does not inherently make interfering with it morally wrong.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
   - There might be a biased repetition here implying that any interference with nature, including medicine, is morally wrong without addressing the complexities involved.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
   - The argument assumes a consensus that natural occurrences should dictate moral actions, which is not necessarily a consensus shared by all. 

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**
   - The terms "nature," "morally wrong," and "interfere" might be ambiguous or not well-defined, leading to confusion about the argument's real intent or scope.

In summary, the statement "Nature gives people diseases and sickness; therefore, it is morally wrong to interfere with nature and treat sick people with medicine" exhibits attributes of Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), and potentially Ambiguous Language (DEP).
