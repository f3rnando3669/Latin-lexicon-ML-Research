For 
<IDAA>: Irrelevant Diversion from Argument Analysis

Applying <IDAA> to the given scenario:

"Marty said that his Xbox One X had better resolution than Phil’s PS4 during their gaming console debate. Phil suddenly brought up how powerful his PC was when Marty started talking about the specs of the two gaming consoles."

Phil's response is an example of <IDAA> because it diverts the discussion away from the original argument about the Xbox One X and PS4 by introducing a new, irrelevant topic—the power of his PC. This move does not address the specific point Marty was making about the resolution of the gaming consoles, thus evading the original argument.
