To analyze the argument "Having a television rating system is like being in prison. Both infringe on one's rights." using the defective argument types you have defined, it is crucial to identify the underlying weaknesses in the argument's logic. Here's an examination of each relevant defective argument type (IDAA stands for "Identify Defective Argument Applicable"):

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument does not seem to be making a broad generalization directly, so <G> is not immediately applicable.
  
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not list out all possible instances or options before reaching a conclusion, which might suggest that <FE> is not the main flaw here.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This might be more relevant because comparing a television rating system to being in prison lacks a solid foundational basis—it’s an inconclusive analogy. While both might be seen as "restrictions," the severity and nature of the restrictions differ vastly and do not lead to a definitive, conclusive comparison. Therefore, <IR> is indeed applicable.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument does not appear to make a causal claim directly. It's more of an analogy that likens two different situations, so <WCB> may not be particularly relevant here.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The argument does not repetitively state the proposition in different forms without providing new justification, so <RR> does not apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument does not assume that there is a consensus on the comparison being made (i.e., that everyone agrees that television ratings and prison both infringe on rights). Thus, <FU> is not applicable.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This may partly apply because the term "infringe on one's rights" is very general and can mean different things in different contexts. The ambiguous use of this phrase without clear definitions makes the argument weaker.

Therefore, the primary defective argument types at play here are:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Because the analogy between a television rating system and being in prison is weak and fails to provide a conclusive reason for the comparison.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The phrase "infringe on one's rights" is used ambiguously without clear context or definition.

In conclusion, the statement "Having a television rating system is like being in prison. Both infringe on one's rights." suffers primarily from **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**.
