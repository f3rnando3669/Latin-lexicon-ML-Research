For 
It seems like there might be a mix-up in the instruction to "apply <IDAA>" since "IDAA" is not defined among the defective argument types given. However, I'll assume you want me to identify any defective arguments in the statement "George Bush is a good communicator because he speaks effectively." Based on the types you've described, the relevant defect might be:

**Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
- **Definition**: Using the same idea or premise to support itself without additional evidence.
- **Application**: The argument "George Bush is a good communicator because he speaks effectively" is actually a circular argument. The proposition "he speaks effectively" essentially restates the same notion as "he is a good communicator," without providing independent supporting evidence.

Thus, the primary defective argument type for this statement is:

### <RR> â€“ Faulty Repetition of Proposition

The statement is logically circular in trying to prove George Bush's communication skills by using a premise that equates to the conclusion.
