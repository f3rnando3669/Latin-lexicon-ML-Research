For 
<IDAA> stands for Irrelevant Dismissal or Ad Hominem Attack.

Applying <IDAA> to the given dialogue:

"FlatSam: Common sense tells us that if the earth were a sphere, people on the bottom would fall off.
ReasonEric: I don’t think you get to reference something you clearly don’t have."

In this case, ReasonEric's response, "I don’t think you get to reference something you clearly don’t have," is an <IDAA>. Instead of addressing the argument of FlatSam regarding the shape of the Earth and gravity's role, ReasonEric dismisses FlatSam's argument by attacking FlatSam’s understanding or intelligence, which is irrelevant and does not contribute any substantive counter-argument to the discussion.
