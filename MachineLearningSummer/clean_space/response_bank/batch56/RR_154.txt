It looks like the term <IDAA> in your instruction wasn't defined earlier. However, let's proceed with the analysis by identifying potential defective arguments in the provided statement based on the specified argument types.

“The best minds in physics have studied physics most of their lives, as it’s necessary to study physics extensively to become a top physicist.”

- **Generalization (G)**: The statement generalizes that all top physicists have necessarily studied physics for most of their lives. While it is common for successful physicists to have extensive study backgrounds, it is not an absolute requirement for all cases.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument implies that extensive study is the only path to becoming a top physicist but doesn’t consider other potential contributing factors (e.g., mentorship, access to resources, natural talent).

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The statement implies a causal relationship between studying physics extensively and becoming a top physicist, but it might be seen as lacking conclusive evidence since many other variables could influence this outcome.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Similar to Inconclusive Reason, there's a cause-and-effect claim (studying extensively leads to becoming a top physicist) that may not have enough evidence or may oversimplify the causation.

In this argument, <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration) and <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) seem the most fitting classifications for potential defects. The argument assumes that adequate study is the sole necessary and sufficient condition for becoming a top physicist without necessarily providing enough evidence or considering other factors.

Would you like to further analyze or apply any other specified defective arguments to this statement?
