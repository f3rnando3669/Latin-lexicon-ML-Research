The argument provided can be analyzed for defects using the defined types of defective arguments. Let's break it down:

**Argument:**
"All living beings come from other living beings. Therefore, the first forms of life must have come from a living being. That living being is God."

In this argument, we can identify the following defective arguments:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   The argument assumes that the only possibility for the origin of the first forms of life is that they came from a living being, without considering other scientific or natural explanations such as abiogenesis. This is an example of incomplete enumeration because it does not take into account all possible options.

2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   The claim that the first forms of life came from a living being, and that this living being is God, lacks sufficient causal basis. The statement does not provide adequate evidence or reasoning to support the causal link between the first forms of life and a divine being.

By applying the defective arguments to the provided statement, we can label the argument as falling into the types "Incomplete Enumeration" (FE) and "Insufficient Causal Basis" (WCB).
