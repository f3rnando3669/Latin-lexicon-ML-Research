For 
To apply the defect analysis approach (terming it <IDAA>) to the given statement "Flippityflu: smarter than a Floppityflip. Floppityflip: dumber than a Flippityflu," we need to assess the logic and validity of the arguments presented and identify any deficiencies (or defective arguments) based on the defined defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
    - This argument does not seem to generalize from specific cases to a general rule, so it is not a <G>.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
    - There is no evidence of a selection of specific instances leading to a generalized conclusion, thus not <FE>.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The argument structure repeats itself and does not present new, independent evidence or reasoning. It merely restates the same points in a circular manner without proving either, which can be seen as inconclusive reasoning, thus <IR>.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
    - There is no causal relationship discussed in this argument. It simply states comparative judgments without any causal basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
    - The propositions repeat each other in different wording. "Flippityflu: smarter than a Floppityflip" and "Floppityflip: dumber than a Flippityflu" simply state the inverse relationship and do not add any meaningful differentiation or evidence, which qualifies as <RR>.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
    - This argument does not assume any consensus from others; it just asserts a direct comparison, so it is not an instance of <FU>.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
    - The terms "smarter" and "dumber" are subjective and can be ambiguous without clear definitions of what metrics or criteria they are based on. Hence, <DEP> applies as the language leaves too much room for interpretation.

Therefore, the statement "Flippityflu: smarter than a Floppityflip. Floppityflip: dumber than a Flippityflu." contains the following defective argument types:

- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: Indicates that the argument doesn't provide independent evidence and repeats itself in a circular manner.
- **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: Shows that the statements are essentially repetitive and do not provide new information.
- **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language)**: Highlights the subjectivity and ambiguity of terms like "smarter" and "dumber".
