For 
To analyze the given statement using the idea of identifying defective argument types (IDAA), we can dissect Laura's reasoning and determine if it exemplifies any of the specified defective argument types.

**Statement:**
"Laura is the class president. She believes that the class should sponsor a dance as a fundraiser. Then she learns that a group of girls that she doesn't like also support the idea of a dance as a fundraiser. So, Laura changes her mind and decides that the class should plan a race instead."

Let's identify the potential defects:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This might apply if Laura's change of mind was based on an overgeneralization, such as believing that any idea supported by people she dislikes must be inherently bad. However, this isn't explicitly stated; the focus is on her reaction to specific people rather than a broader generalization about people she dislikes.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This does not seem to apply, as there's no indication that Laura is relying on an incomplete set of options or evidence.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Laura's change of stance is based solely on her dislike for the girls who support the dance, which is not a conclusive reason for determining the best fundraising event. This indicates an Inconclusive Reason.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is no causal claim being made in this argument, so this type doesn't apply.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This defective type involves repeating a proposition without providing new support. Laura isn't repeating a faulty proposition; she's changing her stance based on imperfect reasoning.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This defective type involves assuming that a consensus implies correctness. Laura's argument doesn't hinge on consensus but rather on her reaction to the support group.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: There is no ambiguous language in the reasoning given.

**Assessment:**
The primary defective argument here is <IR>: Inconclusive Reason. Laura's change in belief about the dance fundraiser is based on a subjective and irrelevant factor (dislike for the group supporting the idea) rather than an objective assessment of the fundraiser's merits.

Thus, applying <IDAA> yields the conclusion that Laura's argument is defective primarily due to an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
