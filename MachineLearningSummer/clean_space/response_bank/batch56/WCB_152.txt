Certainly! Let’s analyze the argument "1. “Michael Jordan wore his UNC shorts during every game he played in the NBA and he won 6 championships.”" using the defective argument types defined.

**Defective Argument Identified:** Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)

**Explanation:**
This statement implies a causal relationship between Michael Jordan wearing his UNC shorts and winning 6 championships. However, there isn't sufficient causal basis to support this claim.
