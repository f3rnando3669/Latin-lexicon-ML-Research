For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Applications. So, let's analyze the given statement "If you give a mouse a cookie, he'll want a glass of milk to go with it" in the context of a defective argument type.

The argument in the statement essentially revolves around the idea that one action (giving a cookie) will inevitably lead to another action (wanting a glass of milk). This assumes a chain reaction without necessarily providing evidence for the inevitability or necessity of the subsequent desire.

Given the defective argument types defined, the most fitting type would be:

**<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The statement assumes a causal relationship between giving a cookie and wanting milk without sufficient evidence to support that this sequence will always or necessarily occur. The claim suggests a popular slippery slope that might not be justified by actual evidence.

Therefore, we could say:

<IDAA> to "If you give a mouse a cookie, he'll want a glass of milk to go with it" is a book built around THIS fallacy. â†’ **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
