For 
The argument "A little boy says that his friends should not go swimming in a river because his Mama said there were germs in the river" can be analyzed for potential defective arguments according to the types defined above.

To identify and classify the defective arguments (IDAA), we can break down the argument as follows:

1. **Generalization (G):** This type of argument makes a broad, sweeping statement from a limited amount of evidence.
   - **Possible Application:** If the boy is generalizing that the presence of germs in one part of the river means the entire river or all rivers are germ-infested, it could be a Generalization. For instance, if there's no specific recent evidence that the spot they are at indeed has germs, this could qualify as <G>.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This type of argument makes a conclusion based on an incomplete account of possibilities.
   - **Possible Application:** If the boy's observation about germs is based on a single occasion or limited knowledge, and doesn't account for other tests or evidence possibly showing different results, it might be seen as Incomplete Enumeration. For instance, if the statement was, "My Mama said there were germs in this one river and hence all rivers are unsafe to swim in."

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This type of argument uses evidence that doesn't necessarily support the conclusion fully.
   - **Possible Application:** The presence of germs in the river doesn’t conclusively prove that swimming there is definitively harmful without further context (e.g., how dangerous the germs are, the likelihood of infection, etc). The boy's conclusion might be seen as inconclusive because more information is needed to determine the actual risk.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This type of argument assumes a causal relationship without sufficient evidence.
   - **Possible Application:** If the boy assumes that the presence of germs automatically leads to illness without enough scientific evidence, it could be insufficient causal basis. For instance, not all germs present in water are harmful enough to prevent swimming.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This type of argument repeats a proposition without adding new evidence or argument.
   - **Possible Application:** Not clearly applicable, as there isn’t a pattern of repeating the proposition without new reasoning in the given example.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This argument assumes that people generally agree with an assertion without proof.
   - **Possible Application:** Not directly applicable unless the boy assumes that everyone should agree with his Mama’s assertion without question.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** This argument uses vague or unclear terms that can lead to misunderstanding.
   - **Possible Application:** If the boy uses the term "germs" ambiguously without specifying what kind of germs, their concentration, or the specific hazard they pose, this could be seen as ambiguous language.

Based on the above analysis, it seems the following defective argument types could apply to the statement:

- Inconclusive Reason (IR): The reasoning doesn’t fully support the conclusion that they should not swim without more specific contextual data.
- Generalization (G): If the boy is using limited knowledge from his Mama’s warning to make a broad statement about the unsafe nature of the river.
- Ambiguous Language (DEP): The term "germs" is vague and not specific enough to form a concrete argument about the risk.

Thus, we can apply <IR>, <G>, and <DEP> to the argument provided by the little boy.
