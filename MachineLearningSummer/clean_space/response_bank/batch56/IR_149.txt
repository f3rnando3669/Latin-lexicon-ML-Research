For 
Reagan's response illustrates the use of a defective argument type called **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**.

In his response, Reagan does not directly address why his approach to the SALT II treaty is better compared to President Carter's approach. Instead, he offers general statements about having a consistent foreign policy, a strong America, and a strong economy. These points do not provide specific, conclusive reasons or evidence to support the superiority of his stance on the SALT II treaty compared to President Carter's stance. Therefore, his argument can be categorized as **<IR> Inconclusive Reason** because it lacks specific reasoning directly related to the question asked.
