For 
It seems like there's a small confusion in your request. You asked to define several defective argument types, but then referred to apply <IDAA> which wasn't defined earlier. Assuming you meant to apply one or more of the defined defective argument types from your list to the given statement, I'll proceed to identify which ones apply.

The statement is: "Stephen Hawking is the smartest scientist on the planet, so if he says global warming is real, it must be true!"

Hereâ€™s an analysis of the statement based on the defective argument types you defined:

1. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   The statement repeats the idea of Hawking's intelligence as a reason for the truth of global warming, but doesn't provide actual evidence or reasons for the claim about global warming itself.

2. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   The statement implies that because one very intelligent scientist believes in global warming, this should be accepted by everyone, presuming a consensus without actually proving one.

3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   The statement causally connects Hawking's intelligence to the truth of global warming without sufficient evidence. Being smart does not causally guarantee correctness in every domain.

Based on the definitions you provided, these seem to be the most fitting defective arguments for the given statement.
