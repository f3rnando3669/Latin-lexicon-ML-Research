For 
The argument presented is an example of a defective argument type known as "Ad Hominem," which is an irrelevant diversion that focuses on the characteristics or beliefs of a person instead of the argument they are making.

An Ad Hominem logical fallacy attacks the person making the argument instead of addressing the argument itself. In this case, the statement "Kyra doesn't know anything about science because she likes weird music" is an Ad Hominem fallacy because it dismisses Kyra's knowledge of science based on her taste in music, which is irrelevant to her scientific expertise. 

So, applying:

<AA (Ad Hominem Argument)> to "If someone told you, "Kyra doesn't know anything about science because she likes weird music," what logical fallacy are they using?"

The logical fallacy being used is <AA> (Ad Hominem Argument).
