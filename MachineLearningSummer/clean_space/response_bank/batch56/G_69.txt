For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Types) to the statement "All chess players are geniuses," we need to evaluate and determine if any of the predefined defective argument types apply to this statement. 

1. **Generalization (G)**:
    - This is a classic example of a generalization. The statement implies that every single chess player falls into the category of "geniuses," which is an overly broad and likely inaccurate conclusion based on a potentially limited sample.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
    - This type could apply as well since the claim does not enumerate specific evidence or instances to support the assertion that "all" chess players are geniuses. It assumes a conclusion without a comprehensive analysis of all chess players.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
    - If the argument was based on unspecified or non-specific reasoning to reach the conclusion, it could be classified under this type. For instance, if the argument is that "some chess players are geniuses, therefore all are," it would lack conclusive reasoning.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
    - If the statement implied causation, such as playing chess causes someone to be a genius or vice versa without sufficient causal evidence, it could fall under this category. However, the statement as it stands does not directly indicate causation, so this might not be as applicable.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
    - This type appears irrelevant to the given statement unless it was a baseless assertion repeated multiple times without providing adequate evidence, but the single statement given does not exhibit repetition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
    - If the argument presumed a consensus without actual evidence of a widespread agreement that all chess players are geniuses, it could fit this category. The statement itself does not claim consensus explicitly, so this might not be directly applicable.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
    - The statement is fairly clear in its assertion, so ambiguity does not seem to be a primary issue here.

In summary, the most applicable defective argument types for the statement "All chess players are geniuses" would be **Generalization (G)** and **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**. Less directly applicable, but still pertinent under certain assumptions, would be **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** if further context implied those defects.
