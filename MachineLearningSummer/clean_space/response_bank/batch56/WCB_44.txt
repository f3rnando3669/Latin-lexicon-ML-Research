For 
The argument presented is: "Every time I wash my car, it rains. Me washing my car has a definite effect on the weather."

To identify and categorize the defective arguments in this statement, let's apply the appropriate types:

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument establishes a causal relationship based on a correlation between car washing and rain. However, it does not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that washing the car actually causes rain. This lack of proper causal connection fits the definition of an insufficient causal basis.

Thus, the defective argument type identified in the statement is:

- **<WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis.**
