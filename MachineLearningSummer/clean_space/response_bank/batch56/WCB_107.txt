For 
To apply the identification of defective argument types (IDAA) to the statement "When the new administration came on campus, test scores increased and attendance improved," we need to analyze it for any potential defective arguments listed:

**1. Generalization (G)** – This would occur if the statement is making broad claims based on limited evidence.

**2. Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** – This would involve presenting an argument that leaves out significant alternatives or factors.

**3. Inconclusive Reason (IR)** – This applies if the reasoning does not sufficiently lead to the conclusion drawn.

**4. Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** – This is when an argument claims a causal relationship without sufficiently proving it.

**5. Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** – This occurs if the argument merely repeats the proposition without adding new evidence.

**6. Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** – This would apply if the argument assumes agreement or presents consensus without proper evidence.

**7. Ambiguous Language (DEP)** – This is when the statement uses ambiguous or unclear language that can be interpreted in various ways.

Applying these types to the given statement:

**Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
The statement "When the new administration came on campus, test scores increased and attendance improved" seems to imply a causal relationship between the arrival of the new administration and the improvement in test scores and attendance. However, without additional evidence to substantiate this causal link, it can be seen as having an insufficient causal basis. Correlation does not imply causation; other factors could be responsible for the changes.

Thus, this statement can be identified as containing a defective argument of type <WCB>, as it attributes causality without adequate evidence.
