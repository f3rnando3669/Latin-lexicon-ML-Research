To analyze the tweet by Donald Trump Jr. using the defective argument types, we can break it down and identify which types are applicable.

Here is the tweet: 
> "If I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful? That's our Syrian refugee problem."

1. **Generalization (G)**: This tweet makes a sweeping generalization by suggesting that the risk posed by Syrian refugees can be equated to finding deadly skittles in a bowl. The comparison is overly simplistic and does not account for the complexity and nuance of the refugee crisis.

   - **Generalization (G) Identified**: The tweet generalizes the diverse and intricate issue of Syrian refugees into a simple and misleading risk analogy with deadly skittles.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument implies that a few dangerous individuals among refugees justify treating the entire group with suspicion or refusal, without accounting for the many who are innocent and fleeing from violence. The tweet fails to enumerate the numerous successful integrations of refugees who have not posed any danger.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE) Identified**: The tweet fails to consider the vast majority of refugees who do not pose any threat, thereby providing an incomplete enumeration of the situation.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning in the tweet is inconclusive as it assumes that the presence of a potential threat is sufficient grounds for rejecting all refugees. This does not logically follow, as it ignores measures that can be put in place to mitigate risks.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR) Identified**: The argument presented in the tweet does not conclusively prove that all refugees pose a threat equivalent to poisonous skittles, nor does it account for safety measures.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The analogy suggests a direct causation between accepting refugees and imminent danger, which is not substantiated by evidence. Refugee admission processes often include thorough vetting to prevent such dangers.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB) Identified**: The tweet implies a causality between accepting refugees and encountering deadly threats, without sufficient evidence to support this causal claim.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Not directly applicable here as the tweet does not seem to repeat a previously debunked proposition, but rather introduces a new analogy.

   - Not identified in this tweet.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The tweet might be seen as trying to create a sense of urgency and consensus by appealing to a fear-based hypothetical scenario. However, it does not claim that a majority believe this without basis.

   - Not identified in this tweet.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language in the analogy is relatively clear in its intent, but it does exploit ambiguity in terms of risk comparison. It's more inappropriate analogy rather than ambiguous in language.

   - Not identified in this tweet.

Summary of identifiable defective arguments:
- **Generalization (G)**: The tweet generalizes the refugee problem through an overly simplistic and misleading analogy.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The tweet does not acknowledge the vast majority of refugees who pose no threat.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The tweet assumes potential risk is enough reason to reject all refugees, without considering mitigating measures.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The tweet implies a direct and unsupported causality between accepting refugees and encountering danger.

The identified defective argument types for this tweet are **Generalization (G)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
