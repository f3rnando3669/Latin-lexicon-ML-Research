Certainly! For clarity, let's break down the context given and apply the identified defective argument types to the statement: "Everyone else is buying it, so you should too!".

### Definitions of Defective Argument Types:

1. **Generalization (G)**
   - A conclusion drawn from a sample that is either too small or not representative.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
   - Drawing a conclusion based on considering only some of the relevant cases.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
   - Providing a reason that does not adequately support the conclusion.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
   - Establishing a cause-and-effect relationship where evidence of such a relationship is lacking or insufficient.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
   - Repeating an assertion without providing supporting evidence.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
   - Assuming that because many people believe something, it must be true.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**
   - Using language that is unclear or has multiple meanings, leading to misunderstanding or misinterpretation.

### Analyzing the Statement:
"Everyone else is buying it, so you should too!"

- **Generalization (G):** The statement assumes that because a certain number of people are buying it, it must be suitable or desirable for everyone, which might be an overgeneralization.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The statement does not consider individuals who are not buying it and why they might not be interested or able to buy it.
  
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The assertion that one should buy something because others are buying it does not provide a strong reason—there's no direct link between others' actions and what an individual should do.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The statement suggests a causation (others buying it causes you to need it) without providing sufficient causal evidence.
  
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The statement might be an example of societal repetition—if it’s always repeated that because others do something you should too, without further justification.
  
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This is the primary defective argument type in this case. The statement heavily relies on the idea that what the majority is doing should be automatically followed by everyone, without critical assessment. This embodies the “bandwagon” fallacy.
  
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The phrase "everyone else" is ambiguous. Who is "everyone"? This term may be used to convey a larger group than actually exists.

### Conclusion:

For the statement: **"Everyone else is buying it, so you should too!"**

The argument falls under <FU> Presumptuous Consensus as it assumes the majority’s action is inherently correct or desirable, but it also touches on elements of other defective argument types such as Generalization (G), Inconclusive Reason (IR), and Ambiguous Language (DEP).

Therefore, when applying <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Application), the statement fits most clearly within <FU> while exhibiting characteristics relevant to several other defective argument types.
