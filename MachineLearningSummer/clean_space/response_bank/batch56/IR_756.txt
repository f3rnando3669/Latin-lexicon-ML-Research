The statement "I’m not a doctor, but I play a doctor on TV, and I wouldn’t dream of using anything but Tylenol for my toughest headaches." is a classic example of a defective argument type involving inappropriate authority, often known as **Inappropriate Appeal to Authority** (<IDAA>).

Here, the speaker provides an endorsement for Tylenol based on their experience as an actor playing a doctor on TV, which does not make them an actual medical expert. Therefore, their recommendation holds no legitimate authority in the context of medical advice. This misleads the audience into believing that the actor’s opinion has medical credibility.
