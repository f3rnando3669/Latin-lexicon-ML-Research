For 
Applying <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Attributes) to the given statement made by Trump:

**Full Statement:**
"When asked about his comments Trump made on his tape with Billy Bush, Trump responded, “It’s locker room talk, and it’s one of those things. I will knock the hell out of ISIS. We’re going to defeat ISIS. ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment. And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS.”

**Analysis:**

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - Claim: "It’s locker room talk, and it’s one of those things."
   - Justification: This is a broad generalization about his remarks, implying that such behavior is common and acceptable in certain environments without addressing the specific ethical or moral implications.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Claim: "It’s locker room talk, and it’s one of those things."
   - Justification: This is a vague statement that avoids specifics and does not fully address the scope or impact of the comments made on the tape.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Claim: Transitioning from the "locker room talk" to discussing ISIS.
   - Justification: The response does not logically address the initial accusation. Instead, it shifts focus to an unrelated topic (ISIS), failing to provide a conclusive reason for why the original comments are justifiable or acceptable.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Claim: "ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment."
   - Justification: This statement attributes the rise of ISIS to "bad judgment" and a "vacuum" without sufficient evidence or detail to support this causal claim.

5. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - Claim: Terms like "locker room talk," "one of those things," and "bad judgment."
   - Justification: These phrases are vague and open to interpretation, lacking clear and concrete meaning.

Overall, Trump's response displays several defective argument attributes: it uses generalization to downplay the seriousness of the comments, fails to provide a thorough explanation, diverts attention to an unrelated topic without a clear link, and relies on ambiguous language.
