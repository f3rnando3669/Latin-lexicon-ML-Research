For 
The argument "I know four poor families. They are lazy drug addicts. Therefore, all poor people are lazy drug addicts." can be analyzed using the following defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - This argument generalizes the characteristics of a few individuals (the four poor families) to an entire group (all poor people) based on insufficient evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - The argument makes a sweeping conclusion about all poor people based on a very limited and non-representative sample size of just four families. This small sample may not adequately represent the diversity and variability within the whole population of poor people.

So, we label the argument as:
- <G> Generalization
- <FE> Incomplete Enumeration
