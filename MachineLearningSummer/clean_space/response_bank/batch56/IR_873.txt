For 
The argument presented is an example of an **Ad Hominem** fallacy, which occurs when an argument attacks a person's character or circumstances rather than addressing the content of their argument directly.

**<IDAA> Identifying Defective Argument Attribution:**
- **Argument:** "You can't believe Jack when he says there is a God because he doesn't even have a job."
- **Defective Argument Type:** Ad Hominem

This argument is defective because it attacks Jack's personal situation (namely, his employment status) rather than engaging with the validity or content of his claim about the existence of God. The fact that Jack does not have a job has no bearing on the truth or falsity of his statement regarding the existence of a deity.
