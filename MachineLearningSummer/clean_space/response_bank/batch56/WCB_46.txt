For 
The argument presented is as follows:

"Every person who has ever drunk water has died. Therefore, drinking water causes death."

Let's apply the defective argument types to this statement:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument potentially looks like a sweeping generalization, assuming that because all people who have drunk water have eventually died, the act of drinking water itself is the cause of death.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument could be seen as incomplete enumeration since it fails to account for other factors that could lead to death. It only considers the fact that those who drank water eventually died, without examining the myriad of other causes and conditions that contribute to mortality.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This argument provides an inconclusive reason, as it does not establish a clear causal link between drinking water and death. It draws a correlation where causation has not been demonstrated.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument has an insufficient causal basis because it assumes causality without providing any evidence or mechanism that links drinking water directly to death. There's a common fallacy known as "post hoc ergo propter hoc" (after this, therefore because of this), where it is assumed that if one event occurs after another, the first event must be the cause of the second.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: There isn't a repetition in this particular argument, so this faulty reasoning type doesn't apply here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This argument does not rely on the notion of consensus, presumed or otherwise, so this defective argument type doesn't apply in this context.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The language used in the statement is not particularly ambiguous. It is fairly clear in its assertion, even though the conclusion is faulty.

Evaluating the argument using the defective argument types, it primarily fits:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**

These classifications indicate that the argument is defective for multiple reasons, most notably because it fails to explain a direct causal link, omits other potential fatal factors, and assumes causation based on an observed sequence without thorough examination.
