The argument in the statement "With 80% of consumers choosing our product, isn't it obvious that you should, too?" seems to imply that the popularity of the product is sufficient reason for someone to choose it. This can be categorized under the defective argument type <FU>, or "Presumptuous Consensus".

The fallacy being committed here is known as the **Bandwagon Fallacy**. The Bandwagon Fallacy, or Argumentum ad Populum, occurs when one argues that something is true or right simply because it is popular or a majority of people agree with it.

So to apply <IDAA> (Ideal Defective Argument Application), the statement would be analyzed as a Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):

**Statement:** "With 80% of consumers choosing our product, isn't it obvious that you should, too?"
**Defective Argument Type:** <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)
**Logical Fallacy:** Bandwagon Fallacy
