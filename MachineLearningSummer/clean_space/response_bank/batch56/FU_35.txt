For 
<IDAA: FU (Presumptuous Consensus)>

The argument ", if everyone else is doing something, it must be right/good." relies on the assumption that a consensus equals correctness or goodness without sufficiently evaluating the merits or logic behind the action itself. This reflects the defective argument type called "Presumptuous Consensus" (FU), as it presumes that the majority's behavior automatically aligns with what is right or beneficial.
