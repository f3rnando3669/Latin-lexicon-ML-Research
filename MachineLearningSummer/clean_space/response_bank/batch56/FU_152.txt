Certainly! Here's the analysis of the argument using the identified defective argument types (<IDAA>):

Statement: "Almost everyone at my school will be at the party Friday night. It must be the right thing to do."

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This statement generalizes the behavior of individuals based on a specific group of students. The use of "almost everyone" implies that because a majority is doing it, it justifies the action for everyone, which is a hasty generalization.

2. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument assumes that because a large number of people are attending the party, it inherently validates the action as the "right thing to do." This appeals to a presumed consensus rather than providing a substantive reason why attending the party is right.

3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument lacks a sufficient causal basis for why attending the party is the right thing to do. There is no explanation of how the attendance of many students at the party causes the action to be morally or ethically correct.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The second sentence ("It must be the right thing to do.") repeats the conclusion without providing additional support or reasoning. This is a logical leap based on the proposition that "almost everyone at my school will be at the party."

With this analysis, the argument "Almost everyone at my school will be at the party Friday night. It must be the right thing to do." exhibits characteristics of <G> (Generalization), <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus), <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis), and <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
