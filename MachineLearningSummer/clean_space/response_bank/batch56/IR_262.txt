For 
Let's break down and identify the defective arguments applied in the statement "Big deal! Lots of people cheat too."

Firstly, let's decode what the defective arguments are in this statement:

### Generalization (<G>):
This statement is making a broad generalization without sufficient evidence. It claims that "lots of people cheat," but does not provide specifics or data to substantiate how many people cheat, in what contexts, or to what extent.

### Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):
The statement implies a completeness in the enumeration of people who cheat without actually listing or elaborating on what defines "lots of people." It assumes that mentioning an unspecified number of individuals is adequate to support the argument.

### Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):
The statement also assumes that cheating is prevalent and therefore not a big deal, presuming consensus or common behavior without actual evidence. It attempts to justify cheating by suggesting it is widespread and normal.

### Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):
The phrase "lots of people cheat too" is ambiguously phrased. The word "lots" is vague and does not quantify how many people are involved, and "cheat" could relate to different contexts (e.g., academic cheating, infidelity, financial cheating) without specifying which is being referred to.

### Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):
The argument implies that because many people cheat, it's somehow acceptable or less significant. This reasoning is flawed as it doesn't establish a causal link between the prevalence of cheating and the moral or ethical evaluation of the behavior.

### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):
The phrase also exhibits a form of faulty repetition. Repeating the idea that because many people cheat, it impacts the context or severity of cheating, which doesn't add any new information or strengthen the argument logically.

### Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):
The statement provides an inconclusive reason by suggesting that the prevalence of cheating among people negates the significance or necessity to address cheating. However, it does not give a robust rationale for why the behavior should be dismissed based on frequency.

Thus, applying the defective arguments we see:

The statement "Big deal! Lots of people cheat too." can be broken down into the following defective arguments:

- Generalization (<G>)
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
- Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)

By understanding these defects, we are better equipped to evaluate and critique the reasoning presented in the statement.
