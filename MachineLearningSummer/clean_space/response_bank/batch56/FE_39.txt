For 
<IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Types Applied) 

The argument "Reduce complicated issues to only two possible courses of action" can be identified as a defective argument known as a **False Dichotomy** or **False Dilemma**. This type of argument oversimplifies complex issues by presenting a limited number of options when in fact more possibilities exist.

1. **False Dichotomy/False Dilemma**: This argument reduces complicated issues to two possible courses of action, suggesting that other possible solutions or nuances do not exist. This is a form of oversimplification and creates a misleading choice between only two options.

It does not directly align with the specific types of defective arguments defined in your list (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP). However, it shares similarities with **<G> Generalization**, as it oversimplifies a complex issue, potentially leading to a flawed general conclusion. Keep in mind, the argument types you've provided could be expanded or adapted to include a category that more accurately captures the False Dichotomy fallacy.
