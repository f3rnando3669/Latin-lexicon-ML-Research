1. **Identify**: "Snarl Words are an example of..."
2. **Define**:
    - Snarl Words: These are words that carry negative connotations and are used to instill disapproval without providing substantive argumentation or evidence.
    - Defective Argument Types:
        - **Generalization (G)**: Making a broad claim based on limited evidence.
        - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Listing several instances but neglecting others that are relevant, leading to an incomplete conclusion.
        - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Giving reasons that do not sufficiently support the argument.
        - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Asserting a cause-and-effect relationship without adequate evidence.
        - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Repeating a proposition in different words without adding new justification or evidence.
        - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assuming consensus or agreement without adequate proof.
        - **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Using vague or ambiguous language that can be interpreted in multiple ways.

3. **Apply**:
   Snarl Words can be an example of several defective argument types:
    - **Generalization (G)**: Using Snarl Words can involve making broad, unwarranted generalizations based on minimal evidence.
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: When using Snarl Words, a speaker might selectively list negative instances, ignoring positive examples that would offer a broader view.
    - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Snarl Words often rely on reasons that do not conclusively support the argument, leaning more on emotional appeal than logical substantiation.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Snarl Words might imply a cause-and-effect relationship (e.g., "They're bad because they're liars") without sufficient evidence linking the behavior to the negative outcome.
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Repeated use of Snarl Words can reinforce a proposition without adding new evidence or reasoning, perpetuating an unsubstantiated claim.
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Using Snarl Words might presume that the audience already agrees with the negative connotations, without presenting proof.
    - **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Snarl Words often rely on ambiguous or emotionally charged language that can be open to multiple interpretations, thus weakening the argument's clarity and precision.

4. **Analyze**:
In analyzing the use of Snarl Words as a defective argument type, it is evident that they can undermine rational discourse by:
    - Emphasizing emotional appeals over logical reasoning.
    - Dismissing the need for evidence or thorough investigation.
    - Encouraging agreement based on emotion rather than fact.
    - Fostering divisive and polarized discussions without constructive dialogue.

Using Snarl Words inherently limits the effectiveness and validity of an argument as it relies on negative emotional appeal, which does not necessarily correlate with factual or logical persuasion.
