For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Attribution. To apply IDAA to the given dialogue, let's analyze Speaker 2's argument to see if it falls under any of the defined defective argument types:

Speaker 1: "I really think we need to do something about the rising levels of poverty and homelessness in our country."
Speaker 2: "Why are you worried about poverty? Look how many children we abort every day."

Here, Speaker 2 redirects the discussion from poverty and homelessness to the issue of abortion without addressing the initial concern. This tactic can be identified as a logical fallacy known as a Red Herring, where the argument distracts from the original issue.

While none of the provided defective argument types exactly match the definition for a Red Herring, we can still analyze the given argument using the provided types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This doesn't fit since Speaker 2 isn't making a generalization about a group or event.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This doesn't fit as Speaker 2 isn't attempting to provide an incomplete list of causes.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: While Speaker 2's argument might be seen as inconclusive, it doesn't strictly fit because it isn't providing irrelevant support—it’s diverting the topic entirely.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This doesn't fit as Speaker 2 isn't making a causal claim.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This doesn’t fit; there’s no proposition being repeated.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This doesn’t fit; Speaker 2 isn't assuming a consensus exists.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This doesn’t fit as Speaker 2's language isn’t ambiguous but rather distractive.

Given that none of the provided types perfectly fit, Speaker 2's argument mainly represents a distraction tactic rather than falling strictly within one of the defined defective argument types. In the landscape of logical fallacies, this is best identified as a Red Herring. Therefore, while the IDAA can't directly label it with one of the provided defective types, it highlights a misdirection from the original discussion point.
