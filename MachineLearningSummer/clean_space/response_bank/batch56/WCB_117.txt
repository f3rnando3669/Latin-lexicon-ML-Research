Certainly! Let's analyze the given statement: "If the country is ever going to be safe from terrorists we have to close the borders."

<IDAA> refers to Identifying Defective Argument Attributes. Here, we will apply it to identify any defective argument types present in the statement.

1. **<G> Generalization**: The statement generalizes that closing the borders will make the country safe from terrorists without considering other factors or solutions. It assumes that all terrorist threats come from crossing borders.

2. **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: The argument fails to enumerate all possible approaches to making the country safe from terrorists. It overlooks other methods such as enhancing internal security, intelligence sharing, or addressing root causes of terrorism.

3. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The reasoning in the statement is inconclusive because closing borders does not necessarily eliminate the threat of terrorism. There is no direct evidence provided to support the claim.

4. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: The argument assumes a direct causal relationship between closing the borders and safety from terrorists without sufficient evidence to establish that closing borders will have the desired effect. It overlooks other factors that contribute to terrorism.

5. **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: The statement does not repeat a proposition, so this defective argument type is not applicable here.

6. **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: The statement implies that there is a general agreement that closing the borders is the way to ensure safety from terrorists, but it does not provide evidence of such a consensus.

7. **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**: The term "safe from terrorists" is somewhat ambiguous. It does not specify what being "safe" entails or how closing the borders directly contributes to this safety.

Given the analysis, we can identify the following defective argument types in the statement:
- <G> Generalization
- <FE> Incomplete Enumeration
- <IR> Inconclusive Reason
- <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis
- <FU> Presumptuous Consensus
- <DEP> Ambiguous Language

The statement relies on multiple defective arguments that weaken the overall claim.
