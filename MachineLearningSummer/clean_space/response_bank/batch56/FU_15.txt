The argument presented in the dialogue can be analyzed for defective argument types as per your request. Here’s the breakdown of "Mark: Do you believe in virgin births? Sue: You mean that babies are born virgins? Mark: I mean birth without fertilization. Sue: No. Mark: How could you not believe in virgin births? Roughly two billion people believe in them, don’t you think you should reconsider your position?".

1. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - **Sue: You mean that babies are born virgins?**
   - Here, Sue misinterprets Mark’s question, showing ambiguity in the term "virgin birth". This indicates the use of ambiguous language.

2. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - **Mark: How could you not believe in virgin births? Roughly two billion people believe in them, don’t you think you should reconsider your position?**
   - Mark’s suggestion that Sue should believe in virgin births because roughly two billion people believe in them is an appeal to popular belief. This is a presumptuous consensus, indicating that the argument relies on the belief of a large number of people as evidence for its validity.

Thus, applying IDAA (Identification, Definition, Analysis, and Application), we outline the identified defective argument types:
- Ambiguous Language (DEP) is used when Sue initially misunderstands the term "virgin birth".
- Presumptuous Consensus (FU) is employed when Mark suggests Sue's belief should align with that of roughly two billion people.

This analysis demonstrates the presence of flawed reasoning within the presented dialogue, specifically DEP and FU.
