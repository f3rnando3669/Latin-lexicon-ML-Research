For 
The argument presented is: "Pamela never lies. She told me herself, so it must be true." This argument relies on the assertion made by Pamela herself as proof of its truthfulness. 

Let's apply the defective argument type that best fits this scenario.

### Analysis:
1. **Generalization (G)**: This doesn't fit because the argument isn't making a broad generalization from specific cases.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This doesn't fit because the argument isn't relying on an incomplete list of examples or cases.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This might partially fit, as the reason given (Pamela’s own statement) doesn't conclusively prove that she never lies.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This doesn't fit because the argument isn’t about causality.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This doesn’t fit because the argument isn’t repeating the same proposition as evidence.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This doesn’t fit because it isn’t assuming agreement from multiple sources.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This doesn’t fit because the argument isn’t relying on ambiguous terms.

### Conclusion:
The most fitting defective argument type for "Pamela never lies. She told me herself, so it must be true." is **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.

**Explanation**: The reason provided (Pamela's statement about herself) does not conclusively establish the claim that she never lies. The argument relies on a source that could be inherently biased or self-serving, which makes the reasoning inconclusive.
