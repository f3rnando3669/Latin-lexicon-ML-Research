For 
Applying <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Types) to the statement provided:

"If I don't take this Advanced Placement (A.P.) class, then I won't do well on the exam. If I don't do well on the A.P. exam, then I can't get into a good college. If I can't get into a good college, then I'll never get a good job. If I can't get a good job, then I'm going to have to live in my parents' basement forever. Guess I'll sign up for the A.P. class."

1. **If I don't take this Advanced Placement (A.P.) class, then I won't do well on the exam.**
   - Defective Argument Type: <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)
     - Justification: The statement assumes that taking the A.P. class is the only way to do well on the exam, without considering other factors like self-study or tutoring.

2. **If I don't do well on the A.P. exam, then I can't get into a good college.**
   - Defective Argument Type: <G> (Generalization)
     - Justification: The statement generalizes that not doing well on one A.P. exam will prevent admission to a good college, ignoring other aspects of college applications like grades, extracurriculars, and other qualifications.

3. **If I can't get into a good college, then I'll never get a good job.**
   - Defective Argument Type: <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)
     - Justification: The statement assumes that not attending a good college will necessarily lead to not getting a good job, which is inconclusive since many people succeed through alternative routes.

4. **If I can't get a good job, then I'm going to have to live in my parents' basement forever.**
   - Defective Argument Type: <G> (Generalization)
     - Justification: The statement generalizes that not getting a good job leads to living in one's parents' basement forever, without considering other options like different career paths, further education, or job improvement over time.

Conclusion: **"Guess I'll sign up for the A.P. class."**
   - Defective Argument Type: <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)
     - Justification: The conclusion presumes consensus on the chain of assumptions made previously, suggesting that the only reasonable action is to sign up for the A.P. class without addressing the fallacies in the preceding statements.

So, applying <IDAA> to the entire argument shows multiple defective argument types: <WCB>, <G>, <IR>, <G>, and <FU>.
