For 
To identify and analyze the defective argument in "Nike's are great because they're awesome.", let's first break down the argument and then apply the definitions of the defective argument types to see which one fits.

The statement "Nike's are great because they're awesome" is a circular argument where the conclusion (Nike's are great) is supported by a premise that essentially restates the conclusion in different words (they're awesome). Each term does not provide independent support for the other.

Given the provided definitions of defective argument types, the appropriate category for this statement is:

<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition.

Reasoning: The argument repeats the proposition without providing new evidence or reasons, making the conclusion and the premise essentially the same, which is why it falls under Faulty Repetition of Proposition.
