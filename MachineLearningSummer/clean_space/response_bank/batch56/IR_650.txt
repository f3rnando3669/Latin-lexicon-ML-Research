The argument you've supplied appears to be an instance of a common rhetorical technique that relies on ambiguous or vague language to give an impression without providing substantive content. According to the definitions provided:

<DEP> - Ambiguous Language: This type of defective argument uses language that is not clear or is open to multiple interpretations, which muddies the argument and prevents a clear understanding or conclusion.

Applying the code <DEP> to the statement "This technique uses vague positive words that actually hold little meaning" seems fitting because the focus is on the use of language that lacks precise or concrete meaning.

So, the coded identification would be:

"This technique uses vague positive words that actually hold little meaning." <DEP>
