For 
Analyzing the argument "Everybody loves Raymond because he is so popular. Popular people are loved by everybody." under the defined defective argument types, we have the following:

This argument employs defective reasoning that fits <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition). The reasoning given simply repeats the claim using different words.

Here's how it breaks down:
- The conclusion is "Everybody loves Raymond."
- The reason given is "because he is so popular."
- The second part asserts "Popular people are loved by everybody."

The statement essentially makes a circular argument. It says Raymond is loved because he's popular, and then states that being popular means being loved by everyoneâ€”restating the initial claim without providing additional information or evidence.

Thus, the defective argument type <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition) applies in this case.
