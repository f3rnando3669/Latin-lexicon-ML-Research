For 
The argument "One day robots will enslave us all. It's true. My computer science teacher says so." can be identified and categorized using the defective argument types defined above as follows:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement makes a broad claim ("robots will enslave us all") based on limited evidence (the opinion of one computer science teacher). However, since it doesn't explicitly suggest a trend from a few instances, it may not fit this category perfectly.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not present sufficient evidence to support the claim. It relies solely on the authority of one teacher's opinion without considering other sources or evidence.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The argument fails to provide compelling, conclusive reasoning for why robots will enslave us. The teacherâ€™s opinion is not adequate proof.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument lacks a solid causal explanation of how and why robots will enslave humanity. Simply stating that a teacher believes this does not establish a causal link.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The argument repeats the initial proposition without adding new supporting information. It restates the claim ("It's true") without providing evidence or reasoning beyond the teacher's opinion.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument appeals to the teacher's authority as if his opinion represents a broader consensus or expert agreement, which is not substantiated.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The language used is relatively straightforward and does not seem to suffer from ambiguity in this particular case.

Therefore, the most fitting defective argument types for "One day robots will enslave us all. It's true. My computer science teacher says so." would be:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**

The argument relies on the authority of the teacher without offering concrete evidence, provides no clear reasoning, lacks a causal link, and presupposes consensus from an insufficient basis.
