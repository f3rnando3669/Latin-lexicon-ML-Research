For 
Applying <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Attributes) to the argument "You cannot detain me. I am still grieving my cat's death.":

1. **Argument Analysis:**
   - **Premise:** "I am still grieving my cat's death."
   - **Conclusion:** "You cannot detain me."

2. **Identify Defective Argument Type:**
   - The argument is essentially an appeal to emotion, where the speaker is using their personal grief as a reason why they shouldn't be detained. It does not provide a logical or legally sound reason for why they should not be detained. 

3. Possible Defective Argument Types:
   - **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** The reasoning that grieving the loss of a pet should prevent detention is not logically sufficient or relevant. It fails to directly address the legal or situational requirements related to detention.
   - **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):** Implicitly suggests that emotional distress (like grieving a pet) is a universally accepted reason not to detain someone, which is not necessarily the case.

Based on this analysis, the most accurate defective argument types to apply would be:

- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** The reasoning provided does not conclusively support the conclusion that detention is inappropriate.
- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):** Assuming that others would universally agree that grieving a pet should be a reason for avoiding detention. 

Thus, the argument "You cannot detain me. I am still grieving my cat's death." can be identified as containing attributes of <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).
