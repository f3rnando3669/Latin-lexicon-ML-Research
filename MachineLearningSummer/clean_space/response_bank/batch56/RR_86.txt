For 
To apply an argument type to "We know God exists because he made everything," let's analyze it to determine which, if any, of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>) it could fall under:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This indicates an argument where a specific case is used to make a general rule. This doesn’t seem to be applicable here because the argument isn’t trying to generalize from a specific instance.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This involves drawing a conclusion that all cases fit a particular pattern without checking all possible cases. This doesn't quite fit, as the argument is focused on a singular cause rather than enumerating cases.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This indicates a reasoning where the provided reason does not conclusively support the claim. This seems likely because the statement "he made everything" is not presented with evidence that would conclusively prove God's existence.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This involves making a causal claim without sufficient evidence. This seems applicable, as the argument claims God made everything without providing sufficient evidence for this causal relationship.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This occurs when a proposition is repeated in different wording without new evidence or logical support. Though the argument repeats the idea of God’s existence and creation, it doesn’t do so by simply rephrasing it multiple times.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This implies assuming that just because a group of people believes something, it must be true. The argument does not assert consensus as a support mechanism.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This involves using vague or unclear language to support an argument. The statement "he made everything" could be seen as ambiguous, especially if "everything" is not clearly defined.

Given these considerations, the most relevant defective argument types to apply to this statement appear to be:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
3. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**

Each of these labels identifies a specific flaw in the argument: <IR> for providing an unsubstantiated reason, <WCB> for asserting a cause without evidence, and <DEP> for using potentially ambiguous language.
