For 
<IDAA> stands for Identify Defective Argument Annotation. Let's apply <IDAA> to the statement provided:

1. **Generalization <G>:** There is no specific defective use of generalization here.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>:** The argument does not attempt to list factors or points incompletely.
3. **Inconclusive Reason <IR>:** The reason provided ("The reason is patently clear. Isn't it obvious that unrestricted commercial relations will bestow...") is vague and inconclusive, as it does not provide specific or concrete evidence or reasoning.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>:** The statement does not provide a clear causal explanation for why free trade would benefit the country. It assumes the benefits without establishing a causal relationship.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>:** The statement essentially repeats the proposition in different words without adding new information or evidence ("Free trade will be good for this country" and "unrestricted commercial relations will bestow... the benefits").
6. **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>:** The phrase "Isn't it obvious" presumes that the audience already agrees with the viewpoint without presenting a substantial argument.
7. **Ambiguous Language <DEP>:** The terms "patently clear" and "obvious" are ambiguous and not clearly defined, which can lead to different interpretations.

Annotated statement with <IDAA>:

"Free trade will be good for this country. The reason is patently clear (<DEP>). Isn't it obvious (<FU>) that unrestricted commercial relations will bestow on all sections of this nation the benefits which result when there is an unimpeded flow of goods between countries?" (<IR>, <WCB>, <RR>)

In this analysis, the statement is found to suffer from:
- Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)
- Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
