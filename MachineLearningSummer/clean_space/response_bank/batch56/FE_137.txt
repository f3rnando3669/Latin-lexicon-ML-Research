For 
<IDAA> stands for Identification and Analysis of Argumentative Defect. By applying this process, we first identify the defective argument and then analyze why it qualifies as such.

**Argument:** "Either we pass this ordinance or there will be rioting in the streets."

1. **Identification of Defective Argument Types:**
   
   - **False Dichotomy/Bifurcation (FD):** This argument presents only two options as if they are the only possible outcomes, ignoring other possible scenarios.
   - **Appeal to Fear (AF):** This argument attempts to persuade by invoking fear of a negative consequence.

2. **Analysis of Argument:**
   - **Generalization (G):** This argument might be overgeneralizing the consequences of not passing the ordinance. It assumes the extreme outcome (rioting) without considering less severe possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reasoning that failing to pass the ordinance will lead directly to rioting is inconclusive since it doesn’t provide evidence that rioting is the inevitable outcome.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The argument lacks a sufficient causal link between not passing the ordinance and rioting. It doesn’t consider other factors that might prevent rioting or lead to it regardless of the ordinance.

3. **Conclusion:**
   
   The argument "Either we pass this ordinance or there will be rioting in the streets," primarily suffers from a **False Dichotomy/Bifurcation (FD)**. Additionally, it can be analyzed under defective argument types such as **Generalization (G)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. 

By recognizing these defects, we understand that the argument is flawed and overly simplistic, failing to acknowledge other potential outcomes and lacking sufficient rationale.
