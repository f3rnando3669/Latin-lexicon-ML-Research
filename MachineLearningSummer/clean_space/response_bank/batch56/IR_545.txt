For 
<IDAA> in this context refers to Identifying Defective Argument Types Applied to the given statement: "If you don't start recycling now, our entire planet will be destroyed in ten years."

Let's analyze the argument for potential defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)** - This statement seems to imply that the failure of an individual to recycle will lead to the destruction of the entire planet, which is an overgeneralization. The environmental impact of recycling habits is significant but cannot be reasonably attributed solely to the actions of a single person or even a small group.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** - The argument presents recycling as the sole solution to prevent planetary destruction, ignoring numerous other critical environmental actions (e.g., reducing carbon emissions, conserving water, protecting biodiversity, etc.). This omission makes it an incomplete enumeration.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** - The claim that the planet will be destroyed in exactly ten years without recycling is extreme and lacks a solid, conclusive scientific foundation. The timeline and outcome are presented without sufficient evidence to support such a definitive prediction.
   
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** - The causal relationship implied in the statement is over-simplified. While recycling contributes positively to environmental health, claiming that the planet's destruction hinges on this one action alone lacks an adequate causal basis.
   
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)** - The argument does not appear to restate a proposition faultily within itself, so this defect is not applicable here.
   
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)** - The argument does not claim consensus or widespread agreement as a premise for its conclusion, so this defect is not applicable here either.
   
7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)** - The term "destroyed" is quite ambiguous in this context. The actual consequences of not recycling could range from environmental degradation to climate change impacts, but "destroyed" is an ambiguous and alarmist term that doesn't precisely convey what is meant.

Thus, the statement "If you don't start recycling now, our entire planet will be destroyed in ten years" can be identified as containing the following defective argument types:

- Generalization (<G>)
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)

By identifying these defective argument types, it becomes clear that the statement is flawed in several ways and relies on exaggerated, oversimplified, and ambiguous reasoning.
