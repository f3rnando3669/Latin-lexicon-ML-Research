For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "If you lie, then you will end up in jail," we need to determine which, if any, of the defined defective argument types this statement falls under.

- **Generalization (<G>)**: This type of defective argument involves making broad statements based on limited evidence. This statement might not apply as it does not generalize from specific instances.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This faulty argument type involves making claims based on an incomplete list of possibilities. Again, this does not fit the context of the statement.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This type involves presenting a conclusion without sufficient reason to warrant it. The claim that lying will necessarily end up with jail time might fall here, as it lacks a nuanced understanding of circumstances and context.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This defective argument involves drawing a cause-and-effect conclusion without adequate support. This seems very appropriate since the statement overly simplifies the relationship between lying and ending up in jail without considering the complexity of legal processes and the nature of lies that might warrant jail time.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This type involves repeating a statement without adding evidence or support for its truth. This does not directly apply.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This argument type involves assuming that a proposition is true because many people believe it. This does not apply in this scenario.

- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This involves using vague or unclear language that could be interpreted in multiple ways. The statement is quite direct and does not fit this category.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate classification for the statement "If you lie, then you will end up in jail," would be:

**Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**

This classification fits because the statement draws a simplistic cause-and-effect relationship between lying and going to jail, which overlooks the necessary legal context and specifics of individual cases.
