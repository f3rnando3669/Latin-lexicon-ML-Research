For 
Certainly! In the statement "Since 88% of people polled believe in UFOs, they must exist,” there are several potentially defective arguments. Let's break it down and apply the defective argument analysis (IDAA):

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - The statement takes the opinion of a particular group (88% of people polled) and generalizes it to imply a universal truth (UFOs must exist). This could be considered a faulty generalization because the belief of a group does not necessarily equate to evidence of existence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - The statement assumes that polling a certain percentage of people gives a complete picture of reality. It does not account for other evidence or viewpoints that might contradict this belief.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The reasoning that belief equates to existence is inconclusive. Just because a majority believes in something doesn’t provide conclusive evidence for its existence.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - The causal connection between belief and existence is insufficient. The cause of the belief (e.g., personal experiences, media influence) does not provide a basis for the actual existence of UFOs.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - If the argument is repetitively based on the polling percentage without further substantive evidence, it could be seen as faulty repetition. However, this may be less directly applicable compared to the other defective arguments.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - The argument presumes that consensus or majority belief (88% in this case) is tantamount to evidence of existence, which is a form of faulty consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - There is no obvious ambiguous language in the statement; the terms used are clear and specific.

**Applying Defective Argument Analysis (IDAA)**:

Given the statement, "Since 88% of people polled believe in UFOs, they must exist,” the following defective arguments are most apparent:

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument relies on the presumed consensus among those polled to establish the existence of UFOs.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning that people's belief in UFOs necessarily means they exist is inconclusive.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The cause of the belief doesn’t provide sufficient basis for the actual existence of UFOs.
- **Generalization (G)**: The argument generalizes the results of the poll to imply a universal truth.

In summary, the statement contains multiple defective arguments that question the validity of its conclusion.
