For 
The statement "You can be a good politician and play dirty or you can drop out." presents a dichotomy that suggests there are only two mutually exclusive options: either you play dirty and succeed in politics, or you refuse to play dirty and have to drop out. This argument type can be categorized under <G> Generalization because it generalizes the situation by presenting a black-and-white scenario without acknowledging other possibilities. For instance, one could be a good politician without playing dirty or dropping out, by adhering to ethical standards and still having a successful career.

Additionally, another defective argument type could better apply here. This argument could also be seen as an oversimplified binary or false dilemma, but since that specific defective argument type isn't provided in your list, <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Applied Accurately) would likely assign <G> Generalization as the most fitting.

Thus, the argument type is classified as:
- <G> Generalization
