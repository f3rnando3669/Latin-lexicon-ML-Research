Certainly, let's analyze the given argument using the defined defective argument types.

Argument: "Order is necessary to justice because justice can only be achieved by a program of social and legal order."

This argument can be marked as <IR> Inconclusive Reason. The reason given in the statement ("justice can only be achieved by a program of social and legal order") does not conclusively establish that order is necessary to justice. The argument presupposes its conclusion without providing concrete evidence or exploring other potential pathways to justice. Therefore, it lacks the necessary support to be deemed conclusive.

So the identified defect for the argument is:
<IDAA> <IR>

The use of <IR> indicates that the argument "Order is necessary to justice because justice can only be achieved by a program of social and legal order" is an example of the defective argument type called Inconclusive Reason.
