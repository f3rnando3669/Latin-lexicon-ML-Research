For 
When evaluating the statement "When sales of hot chocolate go up, street crime drops," we can identify several potential types of defective arguments:

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** 
   - The statement implies a causal relationship between increasing hot chocolate sales and decreasing street crime, but it does not provide sufficient evidence to support this causation. There could be other factors at play, such as colder weather leading to both higher hot chocolate sales and fewer people engaging in outdoor activities, which might reduce crime rates.

2. **Generalization (G):**
   - If the argument is based on limited data or specific instances, it risks overgeneralizing the relationship between hot chocolate sales and crime rates. More comprehensive data would be needed to make a valid generalization.

3. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - The statement may be missing other variables that influence street crime rates. Without considering other potential factors, the argument remains incomplete.

4. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - The data showing a correlation between hot chocolate sales and crime reduction might not be conclusive enough to establish any real connection. Correlation does not imply causation, and without more evidence, the reasoning remains weak.

5. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - The terms used in the statement, like "sales of hot chocolate" and "street crime," could be ambiguous and need clearer definitions. What kind of street crime is being referred to? Are we considering all types of hot chocolate sales?

In this case, the defective argument type **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** is the primary issue, as the statement suggests a causal link without sufficient evidence to support such a claim.
