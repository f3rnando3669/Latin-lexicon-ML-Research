For 
To analyze the argument "Joe eats horribly; therefore, his heart attack was caused by his eating habits." using the defective argument types defined, we need to evaluate if the argument fits any of these types:

1. **<G> Generalization**: This argument does not make a broad general statement based on limited evidence, so it does not fall under this category.

2. **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: This argument does not list specific instances selectively to support a conclusion, so it is not an example of incomplete enumeration.

3. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The argument suggests a reason (bad eating habits) for the heart attack, but it may be considered inconclusive if it does not provide enough evidence that this is the sole or primary cause. Other factors could contribute to a heart attack, such as genetics, stress, or lack of exercise.

4. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: This appears to be the most fitting category. The claim that Joe's heart attack was caused *solely* by his eating habits lacks sufficient causal basis without ruling out other factors or providing comprehensive evidence of causation.

5. **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: The argument does not involve repeating a proposition to make it seem more valid, so this type does not apply.

6. **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: The argument does not rely on the false assumption that a consensus exists to support its conclusion, so this type does not apply.

7. **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**: The language in this argument is not ambiguous; it is straightforward in its claim.

Thus, the most appropriate defective argument type for "Joe eats horribly; therefore, his heart attack was caused by his eating habits." is:

**<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**
