To analyze the argument presented, let's break it down and identify the defective elements:

1. **You've got to teach the boys logic!**
2. **If you don't teach them logic, they won't learn how to think, and they'll become hobos and die in prison!**
3. **Don't you care about your sons? (Mother to Father)**

1. **You've got to teach the boys logic!**

   This is presented as a conclusion without sufficient support, prompting the need for closer examination of the reasons given.

2. **If you don't teach them logic, they won't learn how to think, and they'll become hobos and die in prison!**

   - Here, we see a **Faulty Generalization (G)**, as it assumes teaching logic is the only way for them to learn how to think.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** is present because the reasoning given does not conclusively lead to the outcome predicted (becoming hobos and dying in prison).
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** appears since there is no demonstrated causal link between not learning logic and ending up in prison.

3. **Don't you care about your sons? (Mother to Father)**

   - This is an appeal to emotion, implying that not teaching logic equates to not caring for the sons, which does not follow logically. This could be categorized as **Ambiguous Language (DEP)** in the way "care" is being manipulated to support an emotional appeal.

Summary:

Upon applying **IDAA** (Identify Defective Argument Attributes), the argument contains the following defective elements:

- **G** (Faulty Generalization): Assumes logic is the only path to critical thinking.
- **IR** (Inconclusive Reason): The reasoning that not teaching logic leads to becoming hobos and dying in prison is not conclusive.
- **WCB** (Insufficient Causal Basis): No demonstrated causal relationship between not learning logic and severe negative life outcomes.
- **DEP** (Ambiguous Language): Utilizes emotionally charged language that is ambiguous ("Don't you care?") to manipulate the father's feelings.

Therefore, the argument exemplified would be sufficiently criticized based on the defective argument types identified above.
