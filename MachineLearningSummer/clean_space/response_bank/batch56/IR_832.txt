For 
The argument in the statement "Luke didn't want to eat his sheep's brains with chopped liver and brussel sprouts, but his father told him to think about the poor, starving children in a third world country who weren't fortunate enough to have any food at all." can be analyzed to identify potential defective argument types if present. Here’s how each type might apply:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - This is not a generalization since it focuses on a specific instance with Luke and his father's statement.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - Incomplete Enumeration might suggest that there are more reasons Luke might not want to eat the meal, which are not listed, but this isn't the primary defect in the argument.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The reasoning might be emotionally persuasive but is not directly conclusive because it doesn't address Luke's reasons for not wanting to eat the meal directly. Thus, an element of Inconclusive Reason (IR) could be present.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - The argument might suggest that Luke should eat because other children are starving, but this connection is not causally sufficient. Therefore, part of the argument can be seen as having an Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - Faulty Repetition does not seem to be present since the statement doesn't repeat any proposition unnecessarily.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - The argument does imply that because others (starving children) are less fortunate, Luke should comply, which can be seen as a Presumptuous Consensus (FU).

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - There's no evident ambiguity in language here.

Therefore, applying the defective types, the argument in this statement appears to suffer primarily from:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Emotional appeal without directly addressing Luke's personal reasons for not wanting to eat.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The suggested reason (starving children) lacks a sufficient causal connection to the action Luke should take.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assumes a consensus that starving children’s situations morally obligate Luke to eat his meal.

Thus, the classified defective arguments applied are:
  
  - IR (Inconclusive Reason)
  - WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)
  - FU (Presumptuous Consensus)
