The fallacy committed by the announcer in the commercial can be analyzed using the definitions of defective argument types provided. Let's identify which fallacy applies here:

The announcer states, "This is the best foot cream on the market because no other foot cream makers have been able to prove otherwise." This argument is problematic because it relies on the lack of contrary evidence rather than positive evidence for the claim being made.

This fits the definition of <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), where the proposition is being repetitively asserted without sufficient evidence. The announcer is essentially repeating the claim that the foot cream is the best based on the absence of disproof, rather than providing substantive evidence to support the claim.

Therefore, the fallacy committed by the announcer is:

**<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**.
