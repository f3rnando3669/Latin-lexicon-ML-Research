For 
The argument provided is: "The temperature has dropped this morning, and I also have a headache. The cold weather must be causing my headache."

Let's analyze this using the defined defective argument types:

- **Generalization (G)**: The argument does not apply a broad conclusion based on limited evidence, so this does not seem to be the issue here.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not list out other possible causes for the headache before concluding that it is due to the cold weather.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Simply observing that two events occur together (temperature drop and headache) does not provide a conclusive reason for a causal relationship.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is an assumed causal relationship between the cold weather and the headache without sufficient evidence to establish this cause-effect link.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This argument does not rely on repeating the proposition to make it seem more valid.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument does not assume an agreement or consensus to support its conclusion.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language used in the argument is clear and unambiguous.

The most pertinent defective argument type here is "**Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**," followed by "**Inconclusive Reason (IR)**." The argument assumes a direct causal relationship between the cold weather and the headache without sufficient evidence or reasoning to support this conclusion.

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the given argument yields: <WCB, IR>
