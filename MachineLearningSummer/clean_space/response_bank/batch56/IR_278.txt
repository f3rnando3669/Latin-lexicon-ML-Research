To analyze the argument presented in the statement, we need to determine if it falls under any of the defined defective argument types. The statement is:

"She's such a mean teacher and person – that's why she wouldn't raise my grade ONE percent!"

Let's break down the argument:

1. "She's such a mean teacher and person" - This is a characterization of the teacher based on perceived personality traits.
2. "– that's why she wouldn't raise my grade ONE percent!" - This is the conclusion drawn from the characterization, suggesting that the reason for not raising the grade is her meanness.

Looking at the defects in reasoning:

- **Generalization (G)**: The argument generalizes the teacher's entire character based on the incident of not raising the grade. However, this is not the primary defect.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This could apply if the argument fails to consider other reasons why the grade might not have been raised.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This implies that there's a conclusion that doesn't logically follow from the premises.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This appears to be the main defect—inadequate evidence supports the claim that the teacher's refusal to raise the grade demonstrably stems from being mean.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This doesn't apply here.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This isn't relevant in this context.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language in the argument isn't ambiguous, though it is emotionally charged.

After a thorough examination, the defective argument type <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) seems most fitting as the primary issue. The argument presumes a causal relationship between the teacher's personality (being 'mean') and the action (not raising the grade), without sufficient evidence to support this causal connection.
