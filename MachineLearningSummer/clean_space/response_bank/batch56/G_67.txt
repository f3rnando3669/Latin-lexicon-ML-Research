For 
The argument "The United States is the wealthiest nation in the world. So every American is wealthy." contains a logical fallacy that can be classified under defective argument types. In this case, the fallacy is:

**Generalization (<G>):** This type of fallacy happens when a broad statement is made about an entire group based on limited evidence.

The argument incorrectly generalizes the wealth of the nation to every individual within it. Just because the United States, as a nation, is wealthy, it does not mean that every American person is wealthy. Wealth can be distributed unevenly within a country, and there are significant variations in wealth among the population. 

Applying the defective argument type, we can annotate it as follows:

**<G> The United States is the wealthiest nation in the world. So every American is wealthy.**

This highlights that the argument is fallacious due to incorrect generalization.
