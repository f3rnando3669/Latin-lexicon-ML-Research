For 
The argument in the statement, “The two courses I took at Harvard were not very interesting. I don't think it is a good university,” can be analyzed and classified as a type of defective argument.

Applying <IDAA> (which seems to denote Identifying Defective Arguments Analysis):

1. **Identify the Argument**:
   - The argument is essentially claiming that because two specific courses at Harvard were not interesting, the entire university is not good.

2. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**:
   - This type of argument fits the definition of <G> (Generalization). It generalizes the quality of the entire university based on the limited experience of just two courses.

The argument commits the fallacy of Generalization (<G>). It draws a broad conclusion about Harvard University based on the experience of only a couple of courses, which is insufficient to make such an overarching judgment about the entire institution.
