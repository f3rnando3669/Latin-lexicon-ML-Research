The statement "Historically, up until the late 16th century, most people believed that the Earth was the center of the universe. Today we understand this is not true," serves as the context for identifying an argumentative fallacy.

To apply the concept of <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Application) to this statement, let's break it down:

1. **Historically, up until the late 16th century, most people believed that the Earth was the center of the universe.**
    - This part of the statement can be seen as an appeal to historical beliefs, implying that widespread historical acceptance lends weight to the argument.

2. **Today we understand this is not true.**
    - This part of the statement juxtaposes current scientific understanding against past beliefs.

The entirety of the statement might be intended to showcase a mistake in past consensus against modern knowledge, so let's identify if it falls under any of the defective argument types defined earlier.

In this case, the closest match is:
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** This fallacy involves assuming that a belief or proposition is true simply because a majority or consensus holds it to be true.

So the statement showcases a **presumption** about historical consensus knowledge while today it aims to correct that, making it fall under the argument type **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**.

Therefore, applying <IDAA>, we conclude that the argument presented does reflect a **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** fallacy based on its reliance on historical majority opinion as a basis for discussing the incorrectness of the belief that the Earth was the center of the universe.
