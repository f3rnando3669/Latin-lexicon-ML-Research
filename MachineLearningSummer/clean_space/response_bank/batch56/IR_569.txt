For 
The conversation appears to be discussing a complex or potentially recursive layer of meanings behind the term "Red Herring." Let's break down the text to see how each of the defective arguments apply:

1. "**'What about Red Herring, ma'am?''**
   - <IDAA>: This doesn't appear to contain a defective argument by itself; it's a straightforward question.

2. **"'I'm not sure. Is Red Herring a red herring? Or is it the fact that we're meant to think Red Herring is a red herring that is actually the red herring?'**
   - <DEP>: The term "Red Herring" is used ambiguously here, complicating the understanding of the argument. The ambiguity creates confusion rather than clarity.

3. **"'Or perhaps the fact you're meant to think Red Herring isn't a red herring is what makes Red Herring a red herring after all.'**
   - <DEP>: The language here is ambiguous again, using the term "Red Herring" in a recursive and confusing manner. It's unclear what the real argument or point is because of the multiple layers of ambiguity.

4. **"'We're talking serious metaherrings here.'"**
   - <DEP>: The term "metaherrings" introduces further ambiguity. It's not a standard term and adds to the confusion instead of resolving it.

Overall:

- **<DEP>** (Ambiguous Language) is the primary defective argument type present in this conversation. The repeated use of "Red Herring" in an ambiguous manner makes it difficult to discern the actual point being discussed.
