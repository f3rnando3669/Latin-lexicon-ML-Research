For 
To analyze the argument "People nowadays only vote with their emotions instead of their brains" using the defined defective argument types (\<G>, \<FE>, \<IR>, \<WCB>, \<RR>, \<FU>, \<DEP>), we need to identify which of these types apply to the argument. Here’s the application:

1. **Generalization (\<G>)**:
   - The statement suggests that all people ("people nowadays") vote with their emotions rather than their brains. This is a generalization because it makes a broad claim about an entire group of people based on an assumed or limited observation.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE>)**:
   - The statement claims that people *only* vote with their emotions, implying that no other factors come into play. This is an incomplete enumeration because it fails to consider other possible reasons or methods of how people might vote. 

3. **Ambiguous Language (\<DEP>)**:
   - The terms "emotions" and "brains" are used ambiguously. It is unclear what is meant by "emotions" versus "brains" in the context of voting. Such a dichotomy oversimplifies complex human behavior and decision-making processes.

Using the above analysis, the argument "People nowadays only vote with their emotions instead of their brains" can be seen as incorporating the following defective argument types:

- Generalization (\<G>)
- Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE>)
- Ambiguous Language (\<DEP>)

Thus, the argument “People nowadays only vote with their emotions instead of their brains” can be marked with:

\<G\>, \<FE\>, \<DEP\>
