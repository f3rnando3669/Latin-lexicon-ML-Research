The example given in the question "Skipping looking for a second opinion or evidence and just asking one doctor is what fallacy?" can be identified as the defective argument type <FE>, which stands for Incomplete Enumeration. 

Here is the reasoning behind this:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This defective argument occurs when conclusions are drawn based on insufficient consideration of all relevant evidence or options. In the context of seeking medical advice, consulting only one doctor without seeking a second opinion or additional evidence implies a limited assessment. This can lead to conclusions that may not be fully informed or accurate, hence exemplifying an incomplete enumeration.
