To apply the analysis based on the given definitions of defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G):** This argument might be seen as a generalization because it makes a broad claim about all robins based on the observed characteristic of having red breasts. If not all robins have red breasts, then the generalization is inaccurate.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The statement could also be considered an incomplete enumeration. It might be making a definitive statement without examining every individual instance of robins. 

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The statement may lack comprehensive evidence or reasoning to support the claim that all robins have red breasts.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This argument type might not be relevant here, as the statement does not discuss causality regarding robins having red breasts.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This argument type does not seem to apply here, as the statement isn't a repetition of a proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There isn’t an explicit presumption of consensus in the statement, so this argument type also does not seem applicable.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The term "red" might be somewhat ambiguous, as the exact shade, extent, or appearance of the breast's coloration might vary. However, the primary defective argument type applicable here doesn’t strongly hinge on ambiguity itself.

Analyzing the statement "All robins have red breasts" primarily under the defective argument types, Generalization (<G>) and Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>) are the most relevant. The statement generalizes a characteristic to all robins, and it does so without verifying every instance, making it both a generalization and an incomplete enumeration.

So, applying <IDAA>:

- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
