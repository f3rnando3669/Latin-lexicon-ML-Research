Applying the concept of a defective argument type to the statement "That song is stupid because I don't know that musician." involves identifying the type of fallacious reasoning present in the statement.

This statement suggests that the quality of the song is determined by the speaker's lack of knowledge about the musician. This reasoning is not logically sound.

The defective argument type that fits closest to this reasoning would be:

- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** The conclusion that the song is "stupid" is based on the inconclusive reasoning that the speaker's unfamiliarity with the musician is sufficient grounds to judge the song's quality.

Thus, the defective argument type for the statement "That song is stupid because I don't know that musician." is:

- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**
