For 
The argument "You've never visited another country, so who cares what you say about immigration reform!" can be identified as an <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) type of defective argument. Here's why:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This type of argument base its reasoning on a premise that does not logically lead to the conclusion. In this case, the fact that someone has never visited another country does not logically disqualify them from having a valid opinion or valuable insights about immigration reform. The argument dismisses the person's perspective without addressing the actual content or reasoning behind their views on immigration reform. Therefore, it fails to provide a conclusive reason to disregard their opinion.

Thus, we can label this argument as <IR>.
