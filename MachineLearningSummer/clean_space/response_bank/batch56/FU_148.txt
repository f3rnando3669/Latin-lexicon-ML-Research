For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application. Let's analyze the provided statement step by step for potential defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - **No clear presence**: The statement doesn't make a broad conclusion based on limited evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - **Possible**: The claim about "so many people believing in leprechauns" might be an incomplete enumeration if it fails to account for all relevant perspectives or overstates the actual number of believers.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - **Potential**: The question of how many people believe in leprechauns if they are merely a superstition does not provide evidence for or against the belief itself; it's an inconclusive question that doesn't resolve the issue at hand.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - **Potential**: If the argument implied that the mere existence of a belief by many people is sufficient proof of its truth (without causal or rational basis), it could be argued this is insufficient causal basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - **Not applicable**: There is no repetition of an identical proposition without additional premises in the statement provided.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - **Likely**: The argument could be pointing towards a presumptuous consensus by implying that the widespread belief in leprechauns is evidence of their existence, which assumes that popular belief equates to truth.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - **Not clearly applicable**: The language in the statement seems straightforward without key terms that are open to multiple interpretations.

After analysis, the most fitting defective argument types identified in the statement "Shamus pointed a drunken finger at Sean and asked him to explain how so many people could believe in leprechauns if they're only a silly old superstition. Sean, however, had had a few too many Guinness himself and fell off his chair." are:

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**

Therefore, we can apply the <IDAA> as follows:

- **FU (Presumptuous Consensus)**: Shamus's question seems to rely on the assumption that the belief of many people in leprechauns is evidence of their validity.
- **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**: The question posed fails to provide or solicit conclusive evidence regarding the truth of the belief in leprechauns, instead focusing on the fact of belief itself without addressing why the belief should be considered valid or invalid.
