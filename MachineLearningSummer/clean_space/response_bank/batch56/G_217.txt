Implementing the analysis for defective arguments (IDAA) to the statement "Science fiction books are not worth the time it takes to read them," involves identifying which, if any, of the defined defective argument types might apply. Here's a breakdown:

### Generalization (G)
- **Definition**: Making a broad claim based on a limited sample.
- **Application**: The statement "Science fiction books are not worth the time it takes to read them" could be seen as a generalization. It makes a sweeping claim about all science fiction books without providing evidence or acknowledging variability in quality and interest.

### Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
- **Definition**: Presenting a conclusion based on limited evidence or just a few cases.
- **Application**: This applies if the person making the statement has only read a few science fiction books and based their judgment on that small sample, thus not considering the full range of the genre.

### Inconclusive Reason (IR)
- **Definition**: The evidence provided is insufficient to support the conclusion.
- **Application**: If no specific reasons or evidence are given to support why science fiction books are not worth reading, the argument relies on an inconclusive reason.

### Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
- **Definition**: Claiming a cause-and-effect relationship without enough evidence.
- **Application**: If the statement assumes that reading science fiction books leads to wasted time without providing sufficient evidence for this causal link, it may fall under insufficient causal basis.

### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
- **Definition**: Repeating a claim without providing any new evidence or arguments.
- **Application**: If someone keeps stating "science fiction books are not worth reading" without elaborating or providing additional arguments, it would be an example of faulty repetition.

### Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
- **Definition**: Assuming that because some people believe it, it must be true.
- **Application**: If the statement is based on the assumption that a majority of people think science fiction books are not worth the time, without actual evidence of this consensus, it would be presumptuous consensus.

### Ambiguous Language (DEP)
- **Definition**: Using vague or unclear terms that can be interpreted in various ways.
- **Application**: The term "worth the time" can be subjective and ambiguous. What one person considers not worth their time, another might find invaluable, leading to ambiguity in the statement.

### Conclusion
To fully classify the statement "Science fiction books are not worth the time it takes to read them," it most strongly indicates:

- **Generalization (G)**: The assertion is too broad, covering all science fiction books without differentiation.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The judgment may be based on a limited experience of the genre.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Lack of supporting reasoning inherently makes the argument inconclusive.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The phrase "worth the time" is subjective and can be interpreted in various ways.
