Certainly! To identify the defective argument application (IDAA) in the given example, we'll assess the reasoning presented in the statement:

**"Global chocolate consumption is highest in Switzerland, yet people there are among the trimmest in the industrialized world. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that chocolate helps keep your weight down."**

This argument suggests a causal relationship between chocolate consumption and maintaining a trim body based on the coincidental observation in Switzerland. 

Here are possible defective arguments applied to this statement:

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - The argument concludes that chocolate consumption leads to lower body weight solely based on the observation in one country (Switzerland). This does not account for other factors that might contribute to the trimness of Swiss people, such as lifestyle, diet, genetics, or even socioeconomic factors.

2. **Generalization (G)**:
   - The argument generalizes the specific case of Switzerland to apply more broadly, without sufficient evidence that the situation in Switzerland is representative of other contexts. It's a stretch to assume that what happens in Switzerland would also apply to other countries or individuals regarding chocolate consumption and weight.

3. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - The argument draws a conclusion based on an incomplete view. It looks at the high chocolate consumption in Switzerland and the trimness of its people, without considering other data points or additional examples from other populations where high chocolate consumption does not correlate with lower body weight.

4. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The reasoning given doesn't conclusively prove the claim that chocolate consumption leads to a lower weight. There are many potential explanations for the observation noted that have not been ruled out.

Upon considering all these, the most pertinent defective argument application appears to be **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, as the argument fails to establish a direct causal relationship and oversimplifies the complex factors that influence body weight.

So, applying **IDAA**:
**Defective Argument Type: <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**

Explanation: The conclusion that chocolate helps keep your weight down is based on an insufficient causal basis, as the argument does not sufficiently account for other factors influencing weight nor does it establish a direct causal link between chocolate consumption and maintaining a lower body weight.
