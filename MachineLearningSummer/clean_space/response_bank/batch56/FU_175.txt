For 
The argument given is "Throughout history, most philosophers thought men were more rational than women, therefore this is true."

Using <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Type Assignment), we need to categorize this argument based on the defined defective argument types.

The statement suggests that because most philosophers historically believed something, it must be true. This type of reasoning is defective because it relies on the presumed agreement of a group (philosophers in this case) rather than providing sound evidence or reasoning to support the claim. This aligns with the defective argument type called **Presumptuous Consensus** (<FU>).

**<IDAA>: Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**

So, applying <IDAA> to the argument, we identify it as <FU> Presumptuous Consensus.
