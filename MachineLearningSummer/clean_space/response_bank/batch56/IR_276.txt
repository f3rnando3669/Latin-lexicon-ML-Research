For 
<IDAA> stands for "Identify Defective Argument and Assess."

1. **Identify the Defective Argument:**
   The parent's response to the child's statement employs a rhetorical tactic that diverts the focus from the child's complaint about the taste of the fish to a broad, unrelated issue of children starving in Africa. This form of reasoning shifts the discussion away from the immediate concern (the taste of the fish) to a global issue, which is not directly relevant to the child's point.

2. **Classification using provided defective argument types:**
   - The parent's argument could be considered **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** because the reasoning provided does not directly address the initial concern of the child. The fact that children are starving in Africa does not provide a conclusive reason why the child should eat the fish that tastes funny.
   - Alternatively, the argument might also exhibit characteristics of **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)** as it assumes an implicit agreement that the child's complaint should be dismissed in favor of a more broadly acknowledged concern (starvation in other parts of the world).

3. **Assess the argument’s effectiveness:**
   The argument is ineffective in its purpose to engage with the actual issue presented by the child. Instead of addressing the child's complaint about the taste of the fish directly (perhaps by considering alternative options or acknowledging the child's taste), the argument shifts to an unrelated matter. This tactic usually fails to persuade because it doesn't connect logically to the child's perspective or immediate experience.

**Conclusion:** The parent's response employs a defective argument type—most closely categorized as **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**—because it fails to provide a relevant or conclusive reason addressing the child's problem with the fish's taste. In focusing on an unrelated issue, the argument does not effectively resolve the child's concern.
