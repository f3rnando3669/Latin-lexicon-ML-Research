For 
When analyzing the statement "An attempt to gain a customer’s trust in an advertisement is referred to as," we will apply each of the defined defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>) to identify any potential flaws or weaknesses in the argument.

1. **Generalization (G):** The statement could be making a broad and possibly unfounded generalization. If it claims that any and all attempts to gain trust in advertisements fall under a uniform category without acknowledging the variety and complexity of different strategies, it might be generalizing.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** If the statement implies that gaining a customer's trust is the sole or primary goal of all advertisements without considering other objectives (such as awareness, interest, or action), it reflects incomplete enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** If the argument assumes that the concept of gaining trust in advertisements is universally understood and accepted without providing conclusive reasons or evidence to support this, it is inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** If the argument suggests that the attempt to gain trust in advertisements always leads to positive outcomes without establishing a sufficient causal basis for such a claim, it demonstrates insufficient causal basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** If the statement repeats a proposition without providing new evidence or clarification to support it, it exemplifies faulty repetition of the same proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** If the argument assumes that there is a general consensus on the definition without presenting viewpoints or evidence from different perspectives, it is presumptuous.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** If the terminology used, such as "gain a customer’s trust," is vague or ambiguous without specifying the context or methods, it reflects ambiguous language.

In conclusion, analyzing the statement "An attempt to gain a customer’s trust in an advertisement is referred to as" through these defective argument types can reveal potential flaws. The specific defective argument type will depend on how the statement is framed and the context in which it is used. For instance, if the term used is too broad or vague, it may fall under <DEP> (Ambiguous Language). If it oversimplifies the objective of advertisements, it may be categorized under <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration).
