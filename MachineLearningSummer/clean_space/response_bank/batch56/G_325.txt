For 
Certainly! The argument "People from big cities are not as friendly as those from small towns." can be analyzed and classified using the defined defective argument types.

- **Generalization (G)**: This argument makes a sweeping statement about people from big cities and small towns without providing sufficient evidence or considering individual differences. It assumes that friendliness is a trait uniformly distributed across all people within these categories, which is a generalization.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument fails to acknowledge the presence of friendly and unfriendly people in both big cities and small towns, thereby not providing a complete enumeration of all possibilities. This type of defective argument assumes that only the observed samples represent the whole population.

Given these points, the statement "People from big cities are not as friendly as those from small towns." could largely be categorized under Generalization (*G*) since it makes a broad statement without sufficient specificity or evidence, and under Incomplete Enumeration (*FE*) because it doesn't consider the full spectrum of friendly and unfriendly individuals in both contexts.

So, we apply the labels:
- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**

Thus, the defective arguments applied would look like:

```
People from big cities are not as friendly as those from small towns. <G> <FE>
```
