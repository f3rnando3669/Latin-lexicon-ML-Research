For 
To apply the <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Application) process to the argument "“Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist and perhaps the foremost expert in the field, says that evolution is true. Therefore, I believe it's true,”" we need to analyze the argument based on the definitions provided for defective argument types and determine which, if any, apply.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This defective argument occurs when a broad conclusion is drawn from a small or non-representative sample. This does not apply here since the argument is not based on generalizing from limited examples.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This defective argument occurs when a conclusion is drawn by failing to consider all relevant cases or instances. This does not seem applicable since the argument does not involve listing cases or instances.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This defective argument occurs when the reasons provided do not sufficiently support the conclusion. This applies somewhat since the fact that an expert believes something to be true does not, on its own, establish its truth.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This occurs when a causal connection is asserted without sufficient evidence. This does not apply directly as there is no causal connection being argued.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This occurs when a proposition is repeated without additional evidence or reasoning. This does not apply since the argument does not rely on mere repetition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This occurs when the argument assumes that because many people believe something, it must be true. This does not apply directly here but could if the argument implied that one should believe evolution simply because an authority does.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This occurs when the argument relies on ambiguous or unclear language. This does not seem to apply here as the terms used are clearly defined.

Upon reviewing the definitions and the argument, the most applicable defective argument type is **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**. The argument relies on the authority of Richard Dawkins, which, while persuasive, is not a conclusive reason to accept the truth of evolution without further evidence or explanation. The argument does not provide sufficient reasoning beyond the appeal to authority.

Therefore, the argument "Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist and perhaps the foremost expert in the field, says that evolution is true. Therefore, I believe it's true”" can be identified as **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** in the context of defective argument types.
