Certainly! The argument in the statement "If I went to the mall and polled 3 people, those opinions would not represent the opinions of the city population" can be analyzed through the lens of the defective argument types defined:

- **Generalization <G>:** This argument type involves making a broad generalization based on a limited sample.
- **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>:** This type involves reaching a conclusion without considering all possible cases or relevant information.
- **Inconclusive Reason <IR>:** This argument fails to provide a solid basis for its conclusion.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>:** This involves asserting a causal connection without sufficient evidence.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>:** This involves repeating a proposition without adding substantiation.
- **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>:** This involves assuming consensus or agreement without sufficient evidence.
- **Ambiguous Language <DEP>:** This involves using unclear or ambiguous language that can lead to misinterpretation.

Analyzing the statement in question:

"If I went to the mall and polled 3 people, those opinions would not represent the opinions of the city population."

1. **Generalization <G>:** The statement is countering the idea of generalizing the opinions of 3 people to represent the entire city population. While it warns against making a faulty generalization, it itself isn't making the kind of broad generalization that this defective argument identifies.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>:** This particular defective argument betrays the argument in the opposite direction. Here, it isn't failing to consider relevant information; rather, it indicates that a sample size of 3 is inadequate.

3. **Inconclusive Reason <IR>:** The statement is actually providing a sound reason (a small sample size) for its conclusion. It's not leaving the reason ambiguous or inconclusive but pointing out the insufficiency of the polling method.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>:** Similarly, this type does not seem to apply here. The argument isn't about a causal relationship but about the representativeness of a sample size.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>:** There is no repetition of proposition in this argument.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>:** The statement is not assuming consensus. Instead, it disputes any notion that a small sample could lead to an accurate representation of the city consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language <DEP>:** The language used in the statement is quite clear and unambiguous.

Upon deeper reflection, it is evident that none of the defined defective argument types (as per the provided taxonomy) fit the given statement. The statement "If I went to the mall and polled 3 people, those opinions would not represent the opinions of the city population" is actually pointing out the fallacy of generalization and is, therefore, a sound remark rather than a defective argument itself.
