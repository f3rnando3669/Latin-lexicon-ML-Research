For 
In order to apply the defective argument analysis (<IDAA>) to the sentence "What is the name of the fallacy in question 4 about Marcus?", we need to identify any instances of the defective argument types defined.

Let's break down the question systematically:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument type involves making broad statements based on limited evidence. Given the limited context, there's no indication of a generalization here.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This involves presenting an incomplete list as if it were complete. Since this question does not present a list or claim to cover all possibilities, it doesnâ€™t qualify as <FE>.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This refers to using reasons that do not support the conclusion adequately. The question does not present a conclusion or reasons, so it doesn't apply here.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This involves assuming a causal relationship without sufficient evidence. The question does not make any causal claims, so this does not apply.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Repeating a proposition in different words without adding new information. This question does not repeat propositions, so <RR> does not apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This involves assuming that something is true because many or most people believe it. There's no reference to a consensus or popular belief here.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Using language that is open to multiple interpretations or unclear. Since the question is straightforward and clear, it doesn't use ambiguous language.

In conclusion, the question "What is the name of the fallacy in question 4 about Marcus?" does not appear to exhibit any of the defined defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>). Therefore, <IDAA> reveals that it is free from these specified defective arguments.
