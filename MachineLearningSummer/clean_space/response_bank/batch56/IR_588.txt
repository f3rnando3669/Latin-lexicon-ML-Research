For 
Applying "Identification and Dissection of Argumentation Anomalies" (IDAA) to the given statement: 

Statement: "My teacher always brings up stuff about Women's Rights. She only cares about it because she is a woman. The stats she shows us are probably bias."

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - "My teacher always brings up stuff about Women's Rights."
     - This is a generalization, implying that the teacher only talks about one subject all the time without considering other potential topics discussed.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - There is no clear enumeration in the statement that misses necessary components.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - "She only cares about it because she is a woman."
     - This is an inconclusive reason, as it assumes the teacher's interest is solely because of her gender without considering other possible motivations or interests.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - Again, "She only cares about it because she is a woman."
     - The causality implied (teacher's interest being because she is a woman) is insufficiently substantiated.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - There is no repetition in the statement to fall under this category.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - "The stats she shows us are probably bias."
     - This leans towards a presumptuous consensus, assuming the stats are biased without examining the actual data or offering any evidence of bias.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - "Brings up stuff about Women's Rights" is somewhat ambiguous but can be contextually understood. However, "probably bias" is ambiguous.
     - It should be "probably biased," indicating the language's ambiguous and incorrect use.

**Dissection Summary**:
- The statement exhibits **Generalization (G)**: assumes the teacher always talks about one topic.
- It also shows an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: makes an assumption about the teacher's motivations.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: does not adequately substantiate the cause-and-effect claim.
- Finally, it demonstrates **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: assumes bias without evidence.
- Additionally, there is **Ambiguous Language (DEP)** in the incorrect use of "bias" instead of "biased."

Thus, the argument contains multiple defective argument types, making it a weak and poorly substantiated assertion.
