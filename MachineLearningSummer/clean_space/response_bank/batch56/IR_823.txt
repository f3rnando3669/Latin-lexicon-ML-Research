For 
The Interaction Defective Argument Analysis (<IDAA>) applied to the dialogue between Ginger and Mary is as follows:

1. **Identify the Argument and Conversation Context:**
    - **Ginger’s Assertion:** Your dog just ran into our house and ransacked our kitchen.
    - **Mary’s Response:** He would never do that, look at how adorable he is with those puppy eyes!

2. **Determine the Defective Argument Types in Mary’s Response:**
    - **Defective Argument Type: Generalization (G):** Adorable appearance (puppy eyes) is being used to generalize the dog's behavior. Mary is inferring that because the dog looks cute, it could not have done something mischievous, which is not a valid basis for such a claim.
    - **Defective Argument Type: Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The argument that the dog wouldn’t have ransacked the kitchen solely based on its adorable appearance is inconclusive. The cuteness of the dog does not provide conclusive evidence about its behavior.
    - **Defective Argument Type: Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Implied assumption that everyone would agree that an adorable dog could not cause trouble due to its appearance.

3. **Evaluate and Describe the Defective Arguments:**
    - **Generalization (G):** Mary is using the general trait of "adorability" (the puppy eyes) to broadly generalize the dog’s behavior, which is a defective way to judge the specific event in question.
    - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Mary’s reason (that the dog is too adorable to ransack the kitchen) does not logically follow as a definitive reason; cuteness does not preclude mischief.
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Mary is presuming a consensus that cute dogs are incapable of bad behavior, which is an unsupported assumption.

**Conclusion of IDAA Application:**
- In attempting to respond to Ginger’s complaint, Mary employs Generalization (G), Inconclusive Reason (IR), and Presumptuous Consensus (FU), all of which diminish the validity of her argument based solely on the dog's cute appearance.
