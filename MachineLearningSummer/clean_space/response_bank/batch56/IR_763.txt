For 
<IDAA>: This stands for "Identify Defective Argument Application". Let's apply <IDAA> to the given statement.

Statement: "Don't listen to Senator Bob's opinion. He is a crook, and a spiteful loony man."

The defective argument present here is an "ad hominem" attack, which focuses on attacking the character of Senator Bob instead of addressing the content of his opinion.

According to the defective argument types defined:

- This statement doesn't fit into the definitions of <G> (Generalization), <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration), <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis), <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus), or <DEP> (Ambiguous Language).

Instead, it constitutes a classic case of ad hominem, which isn't one of the defective argument types listed. However, if we were to categorize it under one of the given definitions, it most closely relates to the idea of using irrelevant or inappropriate reasoning (possibly an incomplete enumeration of the reasons not to listen to him), but this is a bit of a stretch. It doesn't fit neatly into any of the specially defined defective argument types provided.
