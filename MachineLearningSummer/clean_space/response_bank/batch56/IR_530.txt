For 
Applying the Identifying Defective Argument Analysis (<IDAA>) to the statement:

"My opponent raises a really good point, but can we really trust him? He moved to this town three years ago and everyone knows his wife left him."

We can identify multiple defective argument types in this statement:

1. **Ad Hominem Attack (a type of <G> Generalization or <IR> Inconclusive Reason)**: The speaker dismisses the opponent's point not by addressing the argument itself but by attacking the opponent's character and personal history. This falls under Generalization as it attempts to discredit the opponent's argument by suggesting personal aspects overshadow their argument, thereby making an inappropriate generalization about the opponent's trustworthiness.

2. **Irrelevant Information (<IR> Inconclusive Reason)**: The speaker brings up the opponent moving to town three years ago and the fact that his wife left him, which are irrelevant to the argument at hand. These details do not have any bearing on the validity of the opponent's point, making the reasoning provided inconclusive in addressing the argument's substance.

3. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The statement "everyone knows his wife left him" implies that there is a widely accepted consensus that is being used to dismiss the opponent's credibility. This is presumptuous as it suggests that common knowledge or popular opinion should affect the argument's validity.

In summary, the statement uses **Generalization (<G>)** through an ad hominem attack, **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** by introducing irrelevant information, and **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)** to undermine the opponent's argument.
