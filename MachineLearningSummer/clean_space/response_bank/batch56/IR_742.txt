For 
Certainly! Let's analyze the argument contained in the provided statement and identify any defective argument types (IDAA) using the defined types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: Making a broad statement based on limited evidence.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Listing possibilities but missing some.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Reasons presented are not conclusive or do not strongly support the conclusion.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Causal claims made without enough evidence.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Repeating a point without adding new evidence.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assuming agreement or consensus without justification.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Using language that is unclear or open to multiple interpretations.

Let's break down the statement:

"I'd also like you to consider the possibility that these people intend to attack both Mandela and myself. That doesn't mean I'm excluding the possibility that it really is Mandela these lunatics are after. I just want you to think critically about what you are doing. Pieter van Heerden was murdered. That means there are eyes and ears everywhere. Experience has taught me that red herrings are an important part of intelligence work. Do you follow me?"

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - "There are eyes and ears everywhere." This is a broad statement implying widespread surveillance based on a single event (the murder of Pieter van Heerden), lacking sufficient evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - "Consider the possibility that these people intend to attack both Mandela and myself. That doesn't mean I'm excluding the possibility that it really is Mandela these lunatics are after." The speaker lists two possibilities but may miss other potential scenarios or targets, displaying incomplete enumeration.

3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - "Pieter van Heerden was murdered. That means there are eyes and ears everywhere." The murder of one person is not sufficient evidence to conclude that there is ubiquitous surveillance, indicating an insufficient causal basis.

4. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - "I just want you to think critically about what you are doing. ... Do you follow me?" The speaker presumes that the listener will unquestionably agree with their perspective without providing substantial evidence.

5. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - "Red herrings are an important part of intelligence work." The term "red herrings" is used ambiguously and can be interpreted in several ways without a clear context.

By applying IDAA, we detect various defects:

- **Generalization (G)**: The speaker generalizes the presence of surveillance based on a single event.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument presents limited possibilities without exploring all potential scenarios.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Assumes a causation that lacks strong evidence.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assumes the listener will concur without due consideration.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Uses vague terminology — "red herrings" — which can confuse the point being made.

Accordingly, the main defective argument types present in the statement are <G>, <FE>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.
