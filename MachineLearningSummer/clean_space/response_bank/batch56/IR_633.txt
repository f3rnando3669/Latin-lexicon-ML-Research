**IDAA** stands for **Identifying Defective Argument Application**. It involves identifying which type of defective argument is being used in a given statement or question.

Let's analyze the given text: "Which of the following is true?"

This question prompts us to consider whether it inherently contains a defective argument based on the list you provided: Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Presumptuous Consensus, or Ambiguous Language.

Upon examination, it seems that the question by itself, "Which of the following is true?", does not inherently contain a defective argument. Instead, it's requesting the evaluation of truth from an ensuing list of options, which we don't have access to in isolation.

However, if we hypothesize possible contexts where this question might be used defectively, we can apply the types accordingly. For example:

1. If the list provided was not exhaustive, it could be an application of <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration).
2. If the options provided used unclear or vague terms, it could be an application of <DEP> (Ambiguous Language).

Thus, without additional context or content following the question, we cannot definitively apply a defective argument type. The question itself is a neutral prompt, and the defectiveness would come from the options it asks you to evaluate.
