For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Attributes. Let's apply this to the given statement:

"Politician Running for Public Office: You can all trust what I say. I have never lied in my life."

1. **Generalization (G)**: The politician makes a sweeping claim about their trustworthiness based on an unverified, broad statement. The assertion "I have never lied in my life" is a generalization that lacks specific evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The politician fails to provide a comprehensive list of reasons or evidence to support their claim of never lying. Without substantiation, this enumeration is incomplete.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The statement "I have never lied in my life" does not conclusively prove that the politician can be trusted in all matters, especially in the context of public office. It’s insufficient as evidence for universal trustworthiness.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The politician implies that their statement about never lying causally justifies trust. However, even if true, it does not account for other relevant factors that contribute to trustworthiness, such as transparency or competence.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: While not explicitly a repetition here, the assertion might be seen as a simplistic reiteration that doesn't add depth or additional support to the proposition of being trustworthy.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The politician presumes that declaring their honesty will automatically garner consensus among the audience regarding their trustworthiness, without providing sufficient evidence or allowing for skepticism.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The phrase "I have never lied in my life" could be seen as ambiguous because it doesn’t specify what constitutes a "lie" or the context in which this honesty was supposedly maintained. Different people might interpret this statement in various ways, leading to potential misunderstandings.

Thus, applying <IDAA> reveals multiple defective argument attributes in the politician's statement. Specifically, it highlights issues related to generalization, incomplete enumeration, inconclusive reasoning, insufficient causal basis, presumptuous consensus, and ambiguous language.
