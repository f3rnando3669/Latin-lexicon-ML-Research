Defective arguments can often obscure the true nature of a discussion or debate, leading to misunderstandings or unjust conclusions. Let's identify and analyze the defects in the argument: "Senator Jones supports a strong national defense, and he wants your vote. I would never vote for a coward like him."

Firstly, the acronym <IDAA> must be defined before applying it to the argument provided. Since an acronym for defective arguments typically follows the use of existing types to analyze, I'll assume IDAA stands for something like "Identify Defective Argument Analysis." Therefore, I'll proceed with identifying the potential defective arguments in the given statement.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The first part of the statement mentions that Senator Jones supports a strong national defense and implies a broad conclusion by calling him a coward without providing specific reasons or evidence for this claim. This can be seen as a defective generalization because it makes an assumption without supporting it with facts.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument offers limited information about Senator Jones's overall character or policies. It bases a judgment of cowardice purely on the desire for a strong national defense and wanting votes, disregarding numerous other factors that could define his character or stance.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The assertion that one would never vote for a "coward like him" lacks a coherent link between supporting national defense and being a coward. The rationale provided is inconclusive and fails to make a convincing argument.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Describing Senator Jones as a coward without directly connecting how his specific actions relate to cowardice shows an insufficient causal basis. There's no evidence provided that directly correlates his support for a strong national defense to cowardice.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: While the statement does not repeat the same proposition verbatim multiple times, it does implicitly restate the idea that supporting a strong national defense is inherently linked to cowardice. This faulty repetition reinforces a flawed concept.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: By asserting that the senator is a coward, the speaker presumes that voters will agree with their negative assessment without providing sufficient basis for such consensus. This presumption lacks substantiated input from others.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The term "coward" is ambiguous and subjective, especially in political discourse. It's not clear on what grounds the speaker is making this judgment. This kind of language can mislead or confuse the audience regarding the true nature of Senator Jones's character and policies.

In conclusion, the argument presented is riddled with several types of defective reasoning, such as Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Presumptuous Consensus, and Ambiguous Language. Proper discourse should involve clear, evidence-based reasoning rather than these kinds of flawed rhetorical techniques.
