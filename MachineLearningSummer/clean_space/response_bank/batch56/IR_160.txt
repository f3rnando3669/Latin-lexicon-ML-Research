For 
The argument "Don't believe what Kim says about global warming. Kim dropped out of college!" can be classified under a defective argument type known as Ad Hominem. Ad Hominem is a type of fallacy where the argument attacks the person making the claim rather than the claim itself. In this case, the argument attempts to discredit Kim's stance on global warming by pointing out her academic background rather than addressing the merits or evidence of her position on the issue.

Thus, based on the provided defective argument types, this does not precisely fit into any of the specified categories (Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Presumptuous Consensus, Ambiguous Language). However, it matches the Ad Hominem fallacy, where the speaker attacks the character or circumstances of an individual instead of addressing the argument they're presenting.
