For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Appointments. To identify the defective arguments in the conversation between Helga and Hugh, we will examine each statement and see if any of the defined defective argument types apply.

**Helga's Statement:**
"You should not be eating that... it has been scientifically proven that eating fat burgers are no good for your health."
- **Type: Generalization (<G>)**: Helga makes a broad statement suggesting that all types of "fat burgers" are harmful based on scientific evidence, without specifying the extent or scope of the study.
- **Type: Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Helga does not specify what exact health risks are proven, leaving the argument incomplete.
- **Type: Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Depending on how comprehensive the evidence is, Helga's statement might lack conclusive reasoning, as not all "fat burgers" or their effects may have been covered.

**Hugh's Statement:**
"You eat fat burgers all the time so that canâ€™t be true."
- **Type: Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Hugh responds by dismissing Helga's argument based on her personal behavior rather than addressing the scientific claim.
- **Type: Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Hugh assumes that because Helga eats fat burgers herself, her claim about their health effects must be incorrect, instead of separating the behavior from the evidence.
- **Type: Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Hugh does not provide any counter-evidence or reasoning to refute the scientific claim Helga mentioned.

**Summary of Defective Argument Types Identified:**
- **Helga's Argument:**
  - Generalization (<G>)
  - Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
  - Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- **Hugh's Argument:**
  - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
  - Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
  - Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)

By identifying these defective argument types, we can better understand where the logical issues lie in their exchange.
