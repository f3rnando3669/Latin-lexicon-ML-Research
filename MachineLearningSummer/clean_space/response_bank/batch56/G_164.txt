To apply the defective argument analysis <IDAA> to the argument "If I eat this donut today, I'll probably do it again tomorrow and the next day, and then I'll never be able to eat healthy again," we will first analyze it in terms of the defined defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument might be making a broad generalization about behavior based on a single instance of eating a donut.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument doesn't consider other potential outcomes or factors that could influence eating habits beyond just eating a donut today.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument does not provide a conclusive reason to support the chain of events leading to "never being able to eat healthy again."

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Eating a donut today does not necessarily cause a complete inability to eat healthily in the future; the causal link is weak.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The argument repeats the idea of eating a donut over the next days without introducing new evidence or reasoning.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There is no evidence presented that anyone else would agree that eating a donut today will inevitably lead to an inability to eat healthily.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The phrase "never be able to eat healthy again" is somewhat ambiguous and extreme, lacking specificity.

Based on this analysis, here is how the defective argument types apply:

- **Generalization (G)**: The argument makes a sweeping statement about future eating habits derived from a single instance.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: It fails to consider other factors that could affect future eating habits.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument does not adequately justify why one instance will lead to a perpetual unhealthy eating pattern.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal relationship between eating a donut today and a lifetime of unhealthy eating is not well-supported.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The argument repeats the idea of eating a donut without bolstering the claim.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument assumes a consensus on the slippery slope of eating habits without evidence.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The term "never be able to eat healthy again" is vague and hyperbolic.

Thus, when examining the argument "If I eat this donut today, I'll probably do it again tomorrow and the next day, and then I'll never be able to eat healthy again," multiple defective argument types appear to be at play, notably Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), and Ambiguous Language (DEP). This makes the argument flawed and unreliable.
