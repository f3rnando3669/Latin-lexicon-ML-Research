Sure, I'll analyze the argument using the given definition types for defective arguments.

**Argument:** "You’re a vegetarian? You do realize that Hitler was a vegetarian, too?"

1. **Generalization (G):** This argument suggests that because Hitler was a vegetarian, being a vegetarian is somehow negative or wrong. It uses a specific negative example to generalize about all vegetarians, which is logically flawed.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument selectively mentions Hitler’s vegetarianism to make a point, ignoring the multitude of other reasons people might choose vegetarianism and the diversity of individuals who are vegetarians.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The argument fails to provide a strong causal or logical link between being vegetarian and being morally or ethically comparable to Hitler. It is inconclusive as it does not establish a direct and relevant connection.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The mere fact that Hitler was a vegetarian does not imply any causation or sufficient basis to judge vegetarianism as a dietary choice. The argument assumes a causal connection without sufficient grounds.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** If this argument is often repeated, it fails every time to build a legitimate connection, merely relying on repetition to create a false association.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** It may presume that people generally agree on the negative connotation associated with Hitler to make the case against vegetarianism, assuming a consensus without substantiation.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The term "vegetarian" in this context is used ambiguously to connect two unrelated aspects (dietary choice and moral character), creating confusion and misdirection.

Thus, by using IDAA (Identification of Defective Argument Analysis), this argument can be classified as containing elements of Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), and potentially Ambiguous Language (DEP).
