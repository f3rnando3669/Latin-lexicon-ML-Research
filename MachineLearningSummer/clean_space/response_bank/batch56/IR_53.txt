For 
To apply the defective argument types you have defined to the statement, "This fallacy isn’t proof of anything except that you don’t know something," we should first interpret the statement and then determine if any of the specified defective argument types apply. Here's the analysis:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This doesn't seem to be a generalization; it's not making a broad statement based on limited evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument isn't listing options or choices, so this type doesn't apply.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This may apply because the statement asserts that a fallacy proves only that the person doesn't know something, which is not a conclusive reason. The mere presence of a fallacy does not necessarily mean the person lacks knowledge; it could be a mistake or a miscommunication.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This doesn't seem to fit as there isn't a causal link being weakly established here.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The statement doesn't repeat any proposition or argument, so this type doesn't apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This isn't about claiming a consensus; thus, it doesn't fit.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language might be considered somewhat ambiguous, particularly "you don’t know something." This is a vague claim and doesn’t specify what "something" is, making it hard to verify or discuss.

Given these considerations, the statement can be classified as having an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and potentially **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:

- **IR**: The argument is inconclusive because labeling something as a fallacy doesn’t inherently prove a lack of knowledge without further context or evidence.
- **DEP**: The phrase "you don’t know something" is ambiguous and does not clearly specify what is not known, which can lead to misunderstandings.

Thus, the defective argument types applicable to the statement "This fallacy isn’t proof of anything except that you don’t know something" are **<IR>** and possibly **<DEP>**.
