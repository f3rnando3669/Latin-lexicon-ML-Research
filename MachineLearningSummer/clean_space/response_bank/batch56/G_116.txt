To apply the identifier scheme "<IDAA>" based on the defective argument types defined:

The statement "Colin Closet asserts that if we allow same-sex couples to marry, then the next thing we know we'll be allowing people to marry their parents, their cars and even monkeys." appears to employ a type of slippery slope argument where one action is assumed to lead to a series of other extreme and unlikely actions. This is considered a fallacious argument.

In terms of the defective argument types defined, this argument seems to closely align with:

### Inconclusive Reasoning (IR)
The reasoning presented by Colin Closet is inconclusive, as it posits an unlikely chain of events without substantive evidence supporting the inevitability of these consequences.

Thus, applying the identifier scheme "<IDAA>":

**<IR>: Colin Closet asserts that if we allow same-sex couples to marry, then the next thing we know we'll be allowing people to marry their parents, their cars, and even monkeys.**

This identifies the use of an inconclusive reason (IR) in Colin Closet's argument.
