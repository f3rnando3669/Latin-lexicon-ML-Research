For 
To analyze "Do you still beat your wife?" we need to identify which defective argument types are present. The question sets a faulty presumption, implying guilt regardless of the answer given.

Upon review, the defective argument at play here is best classified as:

**<DEP> Ambiguous Language**: The question employs ambiguous language that unfairly presumes guilt and entraps the respondent in a no-win situation. Whether the respondent answers "yes" or "no," they would implicate themselves in either past or current wrongdoing. Ambiguous Language is used to create traps and confusion rather than seeking clarity or truth.

Thus, the defective argument type **<DEP> Ambiguous Language** is applicable.
