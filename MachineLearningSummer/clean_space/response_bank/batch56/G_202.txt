For 
To analyze the argument "Parents today would rather their kids suppress their identity rather than just be who they are even if it doesn't go with the norm" using the defined defective argument types, we can break it down as follows:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The statement makes a broad generalization about "parents today." This implies that the behavior or attitude of all parents is being described without sufficient evidence to support such a sweeping claim.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The argument does not consider other possible reasons and perspectives that parents might have regarding their children's behavior and identity. It presents only one possible motivation for parents (that they want their kids to suppress their identity), which is incomplete.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The statement might rely on anecdotal evidence or personal observations, but it is not grounded in empirical evidence that conclusively shows that most parents prefer suppression over self-expression for their children. 

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - The argument assumes a causal relationship between parental attitudes and children's suppression of identity without providing sufficient evidence to establish this causation.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - Although not directly evident in this isolated statement, if this argument were repeatedly asserted in different forms without new evidence or reasoning, it would fall under this category.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - The statement seems to presume a consensus about parents' attitudes without backing it up with surveys, studies, or any data. It implies that "everyone knows" this to be true without demonstrating that it is a commonly held and verifiable belief.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - Terms like "parents today," "suppress their identity," and "the norm" are ambiguous. These phrases lack clear definition and could be interpreted in various ways, leading to misunderstandings and misrepresentations of the argumentâ€™s point.

In summary, the argument can be identified as a Generalization (<G>), as it broadly labels all parents today with a specific mindset without sufficient evidence. It also falls under Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), as it doesn't consider other possibilities or reasons for parents' attitudes. Further, it potentially involves Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>) and Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>) due to the lack of supporting evidence and presumed agreement. Finally, it uses Ambiguous Language (<DEP>), which can obscure the argument's clarity and precision.
