For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application. Let's apply this to the given argument:

"Mrs. Collier, we can't take a quiz tomorrow! The new season of Game of Thrones premieres tonight!!"

First, let's analyze the argument:
- The argument is that a quiz should not be held tomorrow because the new season of Game of Thrones premieres tonight.

Now, let's check for defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - This is not a case of generalizing from specific examples to a broad conclusion.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - This argument does not attempt to list all possible reasons why a quiz should not be held, so it doesn't fall under incomplete enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The reasoning here is not directly related to the conclusion. Watching a TV show doesn't provide a conclusive reason why a quiz shouldn't be held, which fits this category.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - There's no causal relationship being wrongly claimed between watching a TV show and the ability to take a quiz.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - The argument doesn't repeat a proposition; it's making a single claim with an emotional appeal.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - The argument does not claim consensus or assume unanimous agreement to support the conclusion.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - The language used is clear and unambiguous.

Given the above analysis, the best fit for the defective argument type is:

**<IR> Inconclusive Reason:**
- The argument gives an inconclusive reason (the premiere of a TV show) which does not logically justify cancelling the quiz.

Therefore, the application of <IDAA> to the given argument results in identifying it as an <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
