To apply the task of identifying defective arguments (IDAA) to the stated argument, let's break it down and examine which defective argument types from the provided list are present.

Here is the argument for reference:
"There is no need for additional taxes for education. Every year we throw more money into education, and all they do is hire more management and build more buildings. None of the money actually reaches the classroom or is really used for education."

1. **<G> Generalization:** 
   - The statement "Every year we throw more money into education, and all they do is hire more management and build more buildings." is a broad generalization that may not reflect the true diversity of spending in different educational sub-sectors or regions.

2. **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:**
   - The argument lists only negative uses for the additional funds (hiring more management, building more buildings) without considering or enumerating other potential positive uses of the funds that may benefit education directly.

3. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:**
   - The conclusion ("There is no need for additional taxes for education") is not necessarily supported logically by the premises, which only highlight poor usages of current funds. The argument fails to conclusively establish that additional funds, if properly managed, would not benefit education.

4. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:**
   - The argument implies a causal relationship between increasing funds for education and misallocation to management and buildings, without sufficient evidence to support that the additional funds are not occasionally used for beneficial educational purposes.

5. **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:**
   - This defective type is not directly present in the argument. The argument does not restate the proposition repeatedly without adding new information.

6. **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:**
   - The argument does not invoke a consensus, so it does not seem guilty of asserting a presumption that everyone agrees with the position stated without verification.

7. **<DEP> Ambiguous Language:**
   - The term "education" is used ambiguously, as it does not specify how all money is managed or fully define what is encompassed by "really used for education". 

In summary, the argument under examination falls into the following defective argument types:
- **<G> Generalization**
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**

By identifying these defective argument types, we can better understand and critique the logic of the provided statement.
