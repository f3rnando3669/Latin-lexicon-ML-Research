For 
The argument presented, "You would think that taxes should be lowered because you are a Republican [and therefore your argument about taxes should be rejected]," is an example of the defective argument type known as "Irrelevant Deflection of Argument by Association" (<IDAA>).

Here's the breakdown:

- **Irrelevant Deflection of Argument by Association (IDAA):** This type of argument deflects the actual point at hand by associating the argument with a particular group, person, or stereotype, rather than addressing the merits of the argument itself. 

In this case, the statement claims that because the person is a Republican, their argument about taxes should be rejected, thus deflecting from actually discussing the argument's validity about tax policy. The focus is on the person's affiliation rather than the content of the argument, making it an example of <IDAA>.
