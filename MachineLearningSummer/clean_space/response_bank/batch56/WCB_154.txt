For 
IDAA is often used as an abbreviation in some contexts to mean "Identify, Define, Analyze, and Address." Let's apply this approach to the argument "The Church used to claim that giving 10% of your income to the Church will free a child’s soul from Limbo into Heaven, so clearly giving money to the Church is a scam!"

1. **Identify the Argument:**
   - Premise: The Church used to claim that giving 10% of your income to the Church will free a child’s soul from Limbo into Heaven.
   - Conclusion: Giving money to the Church is a scam.

2. **Define Defective Argument Types:**
   - <G> Generalization
   - <FE> Incomplete Enumeration
   - <IR> Inconclusive Reason
   - <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis
   - <RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition
   - <FU> Presumptuous Consensus
   - <DEP> Ambiguous Language

3. **Analyze the Argument for Defects:**
   - The premise provides a historical claim made by the Church regarding the effect of donations.
   - The conclusion is a broad label that all donations to the Church are scams.

   Here’s a breakdown of potential defects:
   - **<G> Generalization:** The conclusion that all donations to the Church are a scam is a broad generalization based on a specific historical claim.
   - **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** The premise does not logically lead to the conclusion. Just because the Church had a specific belief about donations does not necessarily imply that all fundraising efforts by the Church are fraudulent.
   - **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** There is a lack of causal evidence showing that donating to the Church is inherently a scam.
   - **<DEP> Ambiguous Language:** Terms like "scam" can be interpreted in various ways. The argument does not clarify what it specifically means by "scam".

4. **Address the Defects:**
   - To improve the argument, one would need to provide a stronger causal link and avoid overgeneralizing based on a specific belief or practice.
   - Clarify what is meant by "scam" and provide thorough evidence showing that the organization consistently misleads donors with the intent of fraud.

So, in conclusion, the argument "The Church used to claim that giving 10% of your income to the Church will free a child’s soul from Limbo into Heaven, so clearly giving money to the Church is a scam!" can be classified as containing:
   - <G> Generalization
   - <IR> Inconclusive Reason
   - <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis
   - <DEP> Ambiguous Language

These defective reasoning types weaken the overall persuasiveness of the argument.
