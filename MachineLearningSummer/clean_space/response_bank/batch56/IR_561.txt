Applying the Identifying Defective Argument Analysis (<IDAA>) to the statement "Don't buy any of the clothes made by that company. Most of them are made in China so they must be cheap":

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement is using a broad generalization. It assumes that because most clothes are made in China, all of them are of low quality and cheap. This is a sweeping assertion that doesn't account for the variety and quality of products that can be produced in any country.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement doesn't consider other factors or sources. The company might have clothes made in other countries or at varying qualities and prices, but this information is ignored.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided is weak and inconclusive. The fact that clothes are made in China doesn't necessarily mean they are cheap or of poor quality. The conclusion doesn't logically follow the premise.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: There is an implied causal link between the location of manufacturing and the quality or cost, but it lacks sufficient basis. Manufacturing location alone isn't a reliable indicator of cost or quality.

5. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The statement presumes agreement on the notion that Chinese-made products are cheap and low-quality, without evidence to back up this consensus.

By identifying and applying these defective argument types, it becomes clear that the initial recommendation to avoid the company's clothes is based on flawed reasoning.
