For 
Let's analyze the provided argument using the schema for identifying defective arguments, <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Attributes):

**Argument:**
"If there is objective morality, then good moral behavior will be rewarded after death. I want to be rewarded; therefore, morality must be objective."

1. **Identify the premises and conclusion:**
   - Premise: If there is objective morality, then good moral behavior will be rewarded after death.
   - Premise: I want to be rewarded.
   - Conclusion: Therefore, morality must be objective.

2. **Check for defective argument types:**

   - **Generalization (<G>):**
     This argument does not seem to be making an overly broad generalization from specific instances, so it does not exhibit a problem of generalization.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
     The argument wraps a desire for reward into a conclusion about objective morality without enumerating or considering other possible reasons or evidence for objective morality or rewards after death. This is **Incomplete Enumeration**.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
     The connection between the desire to be rewarded and the assertion of objective morality is not logically sound because wanting something does not cause it to be true. This is an instance of **Inconclusive Reason**.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
     The argument does not sufficiently establish a causal relationship between the desire for a reward and the objectivity of morality. This also reflects an **Insufficient Causal Basis**.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
     The argument does not repeatedly state a proposition to underscore a point, so it doesn't fall under faulty repetition.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
     Thereâ€™s no attempt here to assume a consensus based on an unwarranted presumption of agreement.

   - **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
     The terms used in the argument are fairly clear; there is no significant ambiguity in the language itself.

3. **Determine the primary defective argument type:**
   - The key issues with this argument are its **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** by failing to explore other possible explanations and **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the desire for a reward does not logically dictate the truth of objective morality. There is also an element of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).**

Thus, the argument chiefly exhibits flaws due to **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
