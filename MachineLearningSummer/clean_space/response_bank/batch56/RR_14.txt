For 
Applying IDAA, the task seems to be identifying and labeling the defective argument(s) in the given statement: "No one can deny that [my theoretical orientation] is the only valid theoretical orientation."

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - Reason: The statement makes a sweeping claim that "no one" can deny the validity of the theoretical orientation without providing sufficient evidence.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - Reason: The claim that "no one can deny" doesn't provide any substantial reason or evidence to support the assertion that the theoretical orientation is the only valid one. It's a conclusion without clear reasoning.

3. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - Reason: The statement presumes a consensus ("No one can deny") without actually demonstrating that such a consensus exists among relevant experts or the general public.

Thus, the identified defective arguments in the given statement are:
- <G>: Generalization
- <IR>: Inconclusive Reason
- <FU>: Presumptuous Consensus
