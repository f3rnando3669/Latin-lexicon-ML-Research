For 
Applying the Defective Argument Analysis Attribute (IDAA) to the argument between Martin and Charlie:

1. **Martin's Statement: "All white people are not racists."**
   - **Argument Type: Generalization (G)**
     - Martin's statement involves a generalization. It does not account for individual differences and specific cases that could contradict the broad claim that "all white people are not racists."
   
2. **Charlie's Response: "Yes they are. You just believe that because you are white."**
   - **Argument Types:**
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
       - Charlie asserts that all white people are racists without providing sufficient evidence or considering all relevant cases.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
       - Charlie assumes a consensus or common belief ("you just believe that because you are white") without evidence that this belief is widely held or true.

Taking these identifications into account, here's the breakdown:

- **Martin's Generalization (G):**
  - Assuming an absolute statement about all members of a group without considering exceptions or individual variances weakens the argument.
  
- **Charlie's Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
  - By stating "yes they are" without backing up the claim with specific evidence, Charlie commits the fallacy of incomplete evidence.
  
- **Charlie's Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
  - Suggesting that Martin's belief is based solely on his race without evidence that this belief is widespread or typical is an overreach and a presumptive statement.
