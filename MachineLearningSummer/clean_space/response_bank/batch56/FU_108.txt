For 
Certainly, let's identify and analyze the defective arguments in the statement:

"Certainly this is the case at most colleges in America nowadays."

This statement can potentially exhibit the following defective arguments:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The phrase "most colleges in America" suggests a sweeping generalization. Without specifying data or concrete evidence, the statement assumes that a particular condition or event is commonly present across the majority of colleges, which might not be accurate.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The term "most colleges" might imply that the speaker has considered all colleges, but it does not provide specific examples or data to back this up. This can lead to incomplete enumeration because it assumes a broad understanding without thorough examination of individual instances or exception cases.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The statement "Certainly this is the case" lacks supporting arguments or reasons for why the speaker believes this to be true. Without presenting valid reasoning or evidence, the conclusion remains inconclusive.

To summarize, the statement "Certainly this is the case at most colleges in America nowadays" manifests defective arguments primarily as a Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), and Inconclusive Reason (<IR>).
