For 
The argument in the statement "Look at people like Michael Vick and OJ Simpson. Professional athletes really have no sense of morality." employs **Generalization (<G>)**.

Here's how the defective argument analysis applies:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This type of argument generalizes a characteristic based on a limited number of examples. In this case, the behavior of two individuals (Michael Vick and OJ Simpson) is used to draw a sweeping conclusion about all professional athletes.
   
   - **Reasoning**: Focusing on the immoral actions of two professional athletes and then asserting that all professional athletes lack morality is a hasty generalization. Not all professional athletes engage in unethical behavior; many lead exemplary lives both professionally and personally. 

Using <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Analysis):

- **Defective Argument Type**: Generalization (<G>)
- **Illustrative Case**: "Look at people like Michael Vick and OJ Simpson."
- **Broad Claim Identified**: "Professional athletes really have no sense of morality."
- **Flaw Explanation**: The argument unjustly attributes the actions of a few individuals to an entire group, neglecting the diverse behaviors and moral standings of all professional athletes. This overgeneralization doesn't provide a comprehensive or fair evaluation of the group.
