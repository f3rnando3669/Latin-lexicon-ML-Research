The argument "If we keep kids from enjoying recess, eventually they will never want to preserve nature" can be analyzed using the defective argument types defined.

Here is a breakdown applying potential defective argument labels:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement makes a broad generalization implying that all children who don't enjoy recess will never want to preserve nature. This fails to consider individual differences and other influencing factors.

2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument assumes a causal relationship between "keeping kids from enjoying recess" and "never wanting to preserve nature," without providing sufficient basis or evidence for this causal link.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasoning provided does not conclusively link the premise to the conclusion. The argument lacks a strong logical connection between recess and attitudes towards nature preservation.

Given these points, it seems most relevant to label the argument as primarily involving:

<WCB> - Insufficient Causal Basis: The argument lacks sufficient evidence to establish a direct causal relationship between preventing kids from enjoying recess and their eventual disinterest in preserving nature.
