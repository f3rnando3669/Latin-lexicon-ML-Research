For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application. Let's dissect the argument "If you love your family, you'll buy this new stealth security system" using the defined defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** This argument applies a broad claim about love and security systems to all individuals without considering individual circumstances. It suggests that all people who love their family will buy this particular security system, which is a hasty generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This argument does not consider other ways to show love for your family or other security systems that might also be effective. It narrowly presents buying this one specific product as the only option to demonstrate care.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reasoning that buying this security system necessarily follows from loving your family is not conclusively established. There could be other methods or means to demonstrate love and ensure security.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** There is an implied causation that loving your family causes you to buy this security system, but the argument provides no substantial evidence that this cause-and-effect relationship holds true.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This argument does not seem to involve repetition of the proposition itself. Hence, <RR> might not directly apply here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The argument presumes a sort of consensus that if you love your family, you'll automatically agree that buying this security system is the proper action. It assumes a mutual understanding that may not exist.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** Phrases like "stealth security system" and "if you love your family" might be considered ambiguous. What qualifies as a "stealth security system"? And what specific actions or purchases indicate "love" for one's family? These ambiguities can lead to misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the argument's intent.

Given all these points of analysis, the argument "If you love your family, you'll buy this new stealth security system" demonstrates several defective aspects such as <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.
