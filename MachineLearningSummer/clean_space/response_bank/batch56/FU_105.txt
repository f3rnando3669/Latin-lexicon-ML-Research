The argument made by Matthew can be categorized as \(<FU>\), Presumptuous Consensus. Here's the breakdown:

- **Matthew's Argument:** "Everyone believes that teachers get paid enough for the job they do. Therefore, it must be true."

- **Defective Argument (Presumptuous Consensus (\(FU\))):** This defect occurs when an argument assumes that something is true simply because many people believe it to be true, without providing adequate evidence or consideration of contrary viewpoints.

Thus, Matthew is assuming that because there is a general belief (presumed consensus) that teachers are paid enough, this belief must be factual, which falls under the category of \(<FU>\).
