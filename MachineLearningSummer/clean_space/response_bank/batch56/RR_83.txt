For 
The argument "After years of ignoring God, people have a hard time realizing what is right and what is wrong, what is good and what is bad." can be analyzed in terms of the defective argument types defined previously. Here is a detailed breakdown using the defective argument analysis approach (IDAA):

### 1. Generalization (<G>):
This statement seems to generalize the behavior of all people who ignore God. It doesn't account for the diversity of moral beliefs and understanding that people may hold, independent of their religious beliefs or lack thereof.

### 2. Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):
The argument fails to enumerate all possible reasons why someone might struggle with moral discernment. It exclusively attributes the difficulty to "ignoring God," ignoring other potential factors such as upbringing, education, personal experiences, etc.

### 3. Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):
The reason given—"ignoring God"—is not conclusively linked to the ability to understand moral concepts. There are many other reasons that contribute to someone's sense of right and wrong, and the statement does not provide conclusive evidence to support its claim.

### 4. Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):
The argument assumes a causal relationship between ignoring God and moral confusion without adequate support. There are numerous alternative explanations for why someone might have difficulty discerning right and wrong.

### 5. Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):
The argument does not iterate the necessary substantiation of the core proposition. It presents the idea without further exploration or evidence, leaving the primary assertion unexamined.

### 6. Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):
This argument assumes that there is a consensus that the state of moral confusion is directly linked to abandoning religious beliefs, which may not be widely accepted. It presumes that such a belief is commonly held without actually demonstrating that this consensus exists.

### 7. Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):
The terms "ignoring God," "right," "wrong," "good," and "bad" are not clearly defined. These terms can be interpreted in various ways, leading to potential ambiguity and misunderstandings regarding the exact nature of the argument.

In conclusion, the statement "After years of ignoring God, people have a hard time realizing what is right and what is wrong, what is good and what is bad" exhibits several defects according to the IDAA approach, illustrating how it can be seen as a defective argument based on the types provided.
