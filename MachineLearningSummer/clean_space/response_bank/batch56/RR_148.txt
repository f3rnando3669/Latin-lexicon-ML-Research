For 
To analyze the argument using the defective argument types defined, we will break down the statement and identify instances where these types of defective arguments might apply.

Original statement:
"Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan are banging at the doors, and the political establishment, consisting of both politicians and the media, seems determined not to let them in on the grounds that they have no public support."

1. **Generalization (\<G\>)**: This type involves making a broad statement based on limited evidence. In this case, suggesting that the entire political establishment is determined to exclude Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan might be a generalization if it is based on a few examples rather than comprehensive evidence.

   **Application**: The phrase "the political establishment, consisting of both politicians and the media, seems determined not to let them in" could be seen as a broad generalization about the entire establishment without specific supporting evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)**: This type involves listing only some of the available evidence or cases and leaving out others. 

   **Application**: The statement does not account for possible members of the political establishment who might support Nader and Buchanan. This selective inclusion could be an instance of incomplete enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**: This type involves reasoning that does not sufficiently support the conclusion.

   **Application**: Claiming that Nader and Buchanan are not let in because they "have no public support" might be based on inconclusive evidence, especially if no concrete data about their exact level of public support is presented.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**: This type indicates an insufficient basis for a causal relationship.

   **Application**: Stating that the political establishment acts in a certain way solely because of a perceived lack of public support assumes a direct causal relationship without sufficient evidence to back this up.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)**: This involves repeating a statement as if it were evidence without providing new supporting information.

   **Application**: The statement doesnâ€™t particularly exhibit this defect; it is more about asserting a situation than repeating a claim without support.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)**: This involves assuming a consensus without sufficient evidence that such consensus exists.

   **Application**: The statement presumes a unified approach by the entire political establishment ("seems determined") without providing evidence for such unanimity.

7. **Ambiguous Language (\<DEP\>)**: This involves using language that is vague or has multiple meanings.

   **Application**: The term "political establishment" is quite broad and ambiguous, potentially encompassing a wide range of individuals and groups without clear definition.

**Summary**:
- Generalization (<G>): The political establishment's unified action can be seen as a generalization based on limited evidence.
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>): The statement excludes the possibility of any support within the establishment for Nader and Buchanan.
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>): The link between lack of public support and exclusion is not conclusively demonstrated.
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>): A direct cause-and-effect relationship is assumed without enough basis.
- Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>): The statement assumes a consensus within the political establishment without verifying it.
- Ambiguous Language (<DEP>): The term "political establishment" is ambiguous.

By applying these defective argument types, we can critically analyze and understand potential weaknesses in the argument being made about Ralph Nader, Pat Buchanan, and the political establishment.
