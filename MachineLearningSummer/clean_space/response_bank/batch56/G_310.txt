Sure! Let's break down and identify the defective arguments in the statement:

"In both of the murder mysteries I have read, the District Attorney was the culprit. All mystery writers like to make lawyers out to be villains."

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument type is present in the statement because it draws a broad conclusion about all mystery writers based on the limited experience of reading two books. The argument generalizes that "all mystery writers like to make lawyers out to be villains" based on a very small and non-representative sample size.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This defective argument type can also be identified here. The statement assumes that because two specific instances involve District Attorneys as culprits, this is a common or universal trope in all murder mysteries. It fails to account for the vast number of other murder mysteries where this may not be the case.
   
Given that "Inconclusive Reason (IR)," "Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)," "Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)," "Presumptuous Consensus (FU)," and "Ambiguous Language (DEP)" are not directly applicable to this statement, we primarily identify the defective arguments as Generalization (G) and Incomplete Enumeration (FE).
