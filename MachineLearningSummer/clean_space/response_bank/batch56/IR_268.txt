For 
The argument presented by Sarah contains elements of multiple defective argument types, but the most prominent fallacy seems to fit well under <IR> (Inconclusive Reason). Sarah provides several reasons for why she deserves to take the test over (her breakup, her sick dog, and her stained dress), but none of these reasons directly justify her not taking responsibility for missing the test or validate her request for a makeup test. These reasons are inconclusive and fail to adequately support her claim.

Thus, the fallacy could be identified as Inconclusive Reason (<IR>).
