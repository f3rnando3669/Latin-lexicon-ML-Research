For 
The argument "No one has ever been able to prove that extraterrestrials do not exist, so they must be real." can be identified with the following defective argument types:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** - The argument jumps to a conclusion based on the lack of evidence to the contrary. Just because extraterrestrials have not been disproven doesn't necessarily mean they exist. Absence of evidence is not evidence of existence.

Hence, this argument falls under the defective argument type **<IR>** - Inconclusive Reason.
