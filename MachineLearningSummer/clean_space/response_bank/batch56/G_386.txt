For 
<IDAA> refers to a defective argument type known as "Invalid Disjunctive Argumentation Approach" or some variation thereof. Assuming we're using standard reasoning patterns that might relate to this type of argument, the given argument:

"If we allow our 14 year-old to have her first date tonight, what's next? A wedding, kids?"

could potentially be identified as an application of the slippery slope fallacy, where permitting a small action (a first date) is argued to lead inevitably to extreme and typically negative outcomes (wedding, kids), without demonstrating the necessary causal connections between these steps.

However, in terms of fitting it into the predefined categories of defective arguments, this argument might most closely align with the following:

- <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis): The argument lacks sufficient evidence or logical basis to conclusively demonstrate that allowing a 14-year-old to date will inevitably lead to marriage and having children shortly thereafter.

Thus, the argument can be primarily identified as:
**<WCB>**: Insufficient Causal Basis
