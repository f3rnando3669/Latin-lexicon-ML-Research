**Identifying Defective Argument Attributes (IDAA) for the statement: "People who learn from their mistakes don't repeat them."**

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - The statement makes a broad generalization without considering individual differences or the complexity of human behavior. Not all people who learn from their mistakes will necessarily stop repeating them in every context.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - The statement implies a binary condition without acknowledging other possible outcomes. There may be cases where people learn from their mistakes but still repeat them due to other influencing factors (e.g., environmental, psychological).

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The conclusion that learning from mistakes leads to not repeating them is not conclusively proven by the premise alone. The relationship between these two variables is not necessarily straightforward or universally applicable.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - The statement assumes a causative relationship between learning from mistakes and not repeating them. However, it lacks sufficient evidence to establish that learning directly causes the cessation of the behavior.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - This defective argument type does not seem to apply directly to the given statement.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - The statement presumes a general consensus on human behavior without providing substantial evidence or acknowledging dissenting perspectives.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - The phrase "learn from their mistakes" is somewhat ambiguous. "Learning" and "mistakes" can have different interpretations across contexts, which makes the statement's meaning unclear without additional context.

By applying these defective argument attributes, we can see that the statement "People who learn from their mistakes don't repeat them." suffers from generalization, incomplete enumeration, inconclusive reasoning, insufficient causal basis, presumptuous consensus, and ambiguous language.
