In your context, to apply defective arguments and identify the type of argument presented, we will analyze the statement: "The political commercials described the mayor as a ‘monster’ who ‘hated babies’ but they never discussed his plans for the city."

1. **Generalization (G)**: Making broad statements based on limited evidence.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Listing examples that are not exhaustive and don't represent the whole picture.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Drawing a conclusion based on reasons that do not logically follow.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Attributing a cause without adequate evidence to support the cause-effect relationship.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Repeating a proposition to make it seem as though it carries more weight without additional support.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assuming everyone agrees without proof of consensus.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Using language that's open to multiple interpretations to support an argument.

The statement in question:
"The political commercials described the mayor as a ‘monster’ who ‘hated babies’ but they never discussed his plans for the city."

1. **Generalization (G)**: It could be argued that the description of the mayor as a "monster" who "hated babies" may be a form of generalization as it makes broad, extreme characterizations that are not substantiated with specific, verifiable facts.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The commercials list derogatory traits without providing a complete picture of the mayor’s actions, hence this could be seen as an incomplete enumeration.
3. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The phrases "monster" and "hated babies" are heavily loaded terms that lack precise definition. They're emotionally charged and can be interpreted in various ways, fitting an ambiguous language defect.

Thus, the statement as it stands could primarily be categorized under:

1. **Generalization (G)**
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
3. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**
