Applying <IDAA> involves identifying, defining, analyzing, and assessing the defective arguments in the given statement.

**Statement**: "Suggesting that John F. Kennedy won the presidency over Richard Nixon exclusively because of the debate on TV."

1. **Identifying Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: This argument suggests that a single factor (the TV debate) was the sole reason for Kennedy's victory, ignoring other possible factors.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument fails to consider other significant factors that might have contributed to Kennedy's victory, such as campaign strategies, political endorsements, voter demographics, and overall political climate.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The claim appears to attribute causality (Kennedy's win) to insufficient grounds (just the TV debate), without substantial evidence.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument does not conclusively prove that the TV debate was the definitive reason for Kennedy's victory, as other events and circumstances could also have played significant roles.

2. **Defining the Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: Drawing a broad conclusion from a single or limited piece of evidence.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Listing insufficient or selective causes while ignoring other relevant factors.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Claiming causality with inadequate evidence.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Providing a reason that does not conclusively support the conclusion.

3. **Analyzing the Statement**:
   - The statement asserts without substantial evidence that the TV debate was the sole reason for Kennedy's victory, which falls under **G**.
   - It selectively focuses on one event (TV debate) and overlooks multiple other contributing factors (**FE**).
   - The causal link made between the TV debate and the election outcome isn't sufficiently supported by comprehensive evidence (**WCB**).
   - The reasoning used does not conclusively prove the argument, as it has gaps and lacks a comprehensive analysis (**IR**).

4. **Assessing the Argument**:
   - Given historical analyses, while the TV debate was a significant event, it is overly simplistic to claim it was the exclusive reason for Kennedyâ€™s victory. Other factors, such as his campaign strategy, political platform, and sociopolitical dynamics of the time, also likely played crucial roles.
   - Thus, the given argument is defective as it employs **Generalization (G)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, and **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** to draw a conclusion.

By applying <IDAA>, we've identified and analyzed several defective argument types present in the statement, ultimately assessing that the argument is flawed due to its over-reliance on a single factor while ignoring a broader context and substantial evidence.
