The argument "The music industry must either raise album prices or reduce pay for technicians and producers" can be considered a defective argument type known as Incomplete Disjunctive Argument Assumption (<IDAA>).

An incomplete disjunctive argument assumption occurs when an argument presents a limited set of options as if they are the only possible choices, neglecting other potential alternatives. In this case, the argument presents only two possible actions for the music industry (raising album prices or reducing pay for technicians and producers) without considering other alternatives, such as finding efficiencies elsewhere, increasing revenue through other means (like streaming services or live performances), or cutting costs in other operational areas.

By focusing solely on these two options, the argument omits potential solutions that might be more favorable or viable, making the reasoning incomplete and possibly misleading.
