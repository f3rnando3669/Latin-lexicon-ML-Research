For 
Applying the framework of Defective Arguments to the statement "Shortly after MySpace became popular, U.S. soldiers found Saddam Hussein," we can identify which type of defective argument this represents. 

- <G> Generalization: No, this statement doesn't seem to be making a broad generalization based on limited evidence.
- <FE> Incomplete Enumeration: This doesn't fit since it isn't listing options or scenarios in a way that's incomplete.
- <IR> Inconclusive Reason: This might partly apply, but it would need to involve a weak connection between the premises and the conclusion.
- <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis: Yes, this seems most applicable. The statement is implying a causal relationship between the popularity of MySpace and the capture of Saddam Hussein without sufficient evidence or a plausible connection.
- <RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition: This doesn't apply as the argument isn't repeating the same thing in a faulty manner.
- <FU> Presumptuous Consensus: This doesn't apply because the argument isn't making an unjustified assumption based on supposed consensus.
- <DEP> Ambiguous Language: The language in the statement is clear in its assertion, not ambiguous.

Therefore, the defective argument type that best applies to the statement "Shortly after MySpace became popular, U.S. soldiers found Saddam Hussein" is <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis.
