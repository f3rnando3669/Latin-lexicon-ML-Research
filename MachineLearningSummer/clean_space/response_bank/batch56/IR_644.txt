For 
It looks like there is a missing definition for the term <IDAA> in your provided context. However, based on the description "attacking the individual rather than their position," the defective argument type you are referring to might be commonly known as an "Ad Hominem" fallacy. 

If we were to define <IDAA> specifically for this context, it could be interpreted as:

<IDAA>: "Identified Argumentum Ad Hominem"

Given this, it could be applied to the statement "against the man; attacking the individual rather than their position" as follows:

The statement exhibits <IDAA> because it focuses on discrediting the person making the argument rather than addressing the content or validity of the argument itself. By doing so, it diverts attention away from the actual issue and attempts to weaken the opponent's position through personal attacks rather than logical reasoning.
