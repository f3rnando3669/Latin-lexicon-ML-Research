For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Attributes) to the claim "The bigger a child's shoe size, the better the child's handwriting," we need to examine the statement for possible flaws or defective argument types as defined. 

- **<G> Generalization**: The statement suggests a broad relationship between shoe size and handwriting quality based on likely insufficient evidence, implying a generalization about children.

- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: There is an implied causal connection between shoe size and handwriting quality without sufficient evidence to support it. Shoe size and handwriting quality might be correlated due to a third factor (e.g., age), but one does not cause the other.

- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The statement does not provide a warranted reason to believe that bigger shoe sizes directly cause better handwriting, making any reasoning behind it inconclusive.

In the context of the argument: 

- The claim can be seen as a **<G> Generalization** because it broadly links the shoe size to handwriting quality without adequate support.
- It is also an **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis** because it suggests a causal link that isn't sufficiently justified.

Thus, applying <IDAA> reveals that the claim "The bigger a child's shoe size, the better the child's handwriting" primarily suffers from issues <G> Generalization and <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis.
