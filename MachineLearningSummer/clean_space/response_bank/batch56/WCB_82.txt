For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Application) to the provided statement, we need to analyze it for any defective arguments and then determine the central idea.

First, let's break down the statement:

"Earthquakes are caused when the plates of the Earth's crust move. Earthquakes happen along 'fault lines' in the earth’s crust. When the plates in the Earth suddenly shift, the Earth will begin to shift, shake, or tremble."

### Analysis of Defective Arguments:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - There is no generalization that applies broadly beyond what is scientifically accepted regarding plate tectonics.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - The statement doesn’t attempt to list causes incompletely but focuses on a singular cause (plate movement).

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - No inconclusive reasoning. The cause-effect relationship between plate movement and earthquakes is well established scientifically.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - The causal basis is sufficiently explained (connection between plate movement and earthquakes).

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - No faulty repetition, as each sentence provides unique information about the cause and effect of earthquakes.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - Doesn’t assume consensus but states facts based on geological science.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - The language is clear and precise, with terms like "fault lines", "plates", "shift", and "tremble" having specific, commonly understood meanings in geology.

### Central Idea:

The central idea of the statement is that earthquakes are caused by the movement of the Earth's crustal plates along fault lines, resulting in the Earth shaking or trembling.

Given the clarity and scientific nature of the argument, no defective argument types from our list apply to this statement.
