For 
The argument "My opponent suggests that lowering taxes will be a good idea -- this is coming from a woman who eats a pint of Ben and Jerry’s each night!" commits a **Defective Argument** of the type called **Ad Hominem Attack**. 

Ad Hominem Attack (IDAA):

- **Definition**: An argument that attacks a person's character, traits, or behavior instead of addressing the content of their argument or position.
  
In this specific case, the speaker is dismissing the opponent's perspective on tax policy not by critiquing the merits of the policy itself but by pointing out a personal habit (eating a pint of Ben and Jerry’s each night) that is irrelevant to the argument about taxes. This distracts from the actual discussion about the effects and benefits of lowering taxes.
