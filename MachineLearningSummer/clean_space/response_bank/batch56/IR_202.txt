For 
To accurately apply the <IDAA>—identify defective argument types application—to the statement "Why must you always take such a stupid and uninformed approach to ethics?", we need to analyze this statement and see if any of the defective argument types defined (Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Presumptuous Consensus, and Ambiguous Language) apply to it. 

Here's the analysis:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This involves making broad statements based on limited information. The phrase "always take such a stupid and uninformed approach" can be seen as a generalization because it assumes that the approach is always the same without considering any exceptions.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This involves presenting a limited list of possibilities as if they are the only ones. This does not directly apply to this statement, as no list is being provided.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This happens when the reasons provided do not adequately support the conclusion. In this case, the statement doesn't provide a reason but rather an accusation, so this type doesn't apply directly.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This suggests a causal relationship without adequate evidence. The statement does not establish a causal relationship, so this type does not apply directly.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This involves asserting the same proposition repetitively without additional justification. The statement is an accusation and does not repeat any proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This is when it is assumed that there is a consensus without evidence. The statement does not imply any consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This involves using language that is unclear or has multiple interpretations. The use of the words "stupid" and "uninformed" is pejorative but not necessarily ambiguous.

Therefore, the most fitting defective argument types for this particular statement are:

- **Generalization (G)**: The statement generalizes the other person’s approach as “always” stupid and uninformed, without considering any specific contexts or variations.

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the statement results in identifying it as having a **Generalization (G)** deficiency.
