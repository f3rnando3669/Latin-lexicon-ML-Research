Sure, I will analyze Old Major's speech and identify defective arguments using the defined categories.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   Old Major's speech includes statements like "ALL the animals will unite and revolt against the humans." This can be classified under <G> as it's a sweeping generalization assuming that every single animal will join the revolt.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   If Old Major lists examples of animals or situations but leaves out pertinent ones that might contradict his argument, it could fall under <FE>. For instance, if he mentions only a few animals' grievances while ignoring others who might be content or indifferent.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   Old Major's reasoning about why the animals should revolt might lack strong supporting evidence. If he bases his argument on emotions or unproven assertions rather than solid facts, this would be an example of <IR>.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   If Old Major claims that the animals’ misery is solely due to the humans without considering other possible factors, this would be a <WCB>. For instance, there might be natural resource limitations or internal animal conflicts contributing to their plight.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   If Old Major repeats the idea that "ALL animals will unite and revolt" without presenting new supporting arguments each time, he's engaging in <RR>.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   If he asserts that all animals already agree on the need to revolt, without evidence that such a consensus truly exists, this is an example of <FU>.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   If Old Major uses vague or ambiguous terms that could be interpreted in multiple ways, it would fall under <DEP>. For instance, if he speaks of "freedom" or "equality" without clearly defining what he means by these terms, it introduces ambiguity.

In summary, Old Major’s statement "ALL the animals will unite and revolt against the humans" can primarily be identified as a **Generalization (<G>)**, with potential for other defective arguments depending on the specific content and context of his speech.
