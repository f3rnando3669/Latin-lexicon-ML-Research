To apply the defective argument type definitions to the given statement, we need to match it with the characteristics described by each type. Here, the statement discusses the concept of correlation not necessarily implying causation. 

Examining the characteristics of the defective argument types that you have defined:

1. **Generalization** (<G>): Making a broad claim based on a small sample.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration** (<FE>): Listing some possibilities and ignoring others.
3. **Inconclusive Reason** (<IR>): Providing a reason that does not conclusively support the conclusion.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis** (<WCB>): Misinterpreting correlation as causation without sufficient evidence.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition** (<RR>): Repeating a proposition in a faulty manner without new evidence.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus** (<FU>): Assuming consensus without sufficient justification.
7. **Ambiguous Language** (<DEP>): Using language that can have multiple interpretations, leading to misunderstandings.

Given that the statement is highlighting the distinction between correlation and causation, a common pitfall in argumentation where correlation is incorrectly assumed to imply causation, the defective argument type that best fits here is:

**Insufficient Causal Basis** (<WCB>): The statement directly addresses the error of assuming a causal relationship based on mere correlation without sufficient evidence. This is a classic example of <WCB> as it cautions against jumping to conclusions about causality from mere correlation.

So, the application would be:

"una conexión entre dos ideas que no siempre significa que una causa la otra (correlación vs. causación)" <WCB>

This emphasizes that the defect lies in assuming a causal link between correlated events without enough proof.
