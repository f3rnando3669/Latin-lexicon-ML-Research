For 
<IR> - Inconclusive Reason: The argument that "Because you found something difficult to understand, or are unaware of how it works, you made out like it is probably not true" is an example of inconclusive reasoning. Just because something is difficult to understand or one is unaware of how it works does not conclusively prove that it is not true. The conclusion being drawn (that it is probably not true) is not adequately supported by the premise (difficulty or lack of understanding).
