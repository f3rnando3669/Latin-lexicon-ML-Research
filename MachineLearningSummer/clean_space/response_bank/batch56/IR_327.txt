For 
<IDAA>, which stands for Identify, Describe, Analyze, and Assess, is a structured method to evaluate defective arguments. Here is how it can be applied to "Studies show it takes up to seven years for the human body to digest a piece of gum."

**I - Identify:**
Identify the type of defective argument present in the statement.

- The statement "Studies show it takes up to seven years for the human body to digest a piece of gum" might initially seem to rely on scientific evidence but could be misleadingly presenting information. Let’s explore the possible defective argument types.

**D - Describe:**
Describe the nature and specifics of the argument and why it might be defective.

- **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>**: The statement might be an incomplete enumeration if it selectively cites or references studies without considering the broader consensus or the full range of scientific studies available.
- **Generalization <G>**: If the statement takes a small or specific set of data and improperly applies it broadly, it could be a generalization.
- **Ambiguous Language <DEP>**: The term "digest" is ambiguous here because while the body doesn't digest gum in the traditional sense, it does not literally take seven years to pass through the digestive system either. Most swallowed gum is excreted unchanged within a few days.

**A - Analyze:**
Analyze the potential reasoning flaws or misrepresentations within the argument.

- The claim about gum taking seven years to digest is a popular myth not supported by scientific evidence. Most gum components are indigestible and pass through the digestive tract relatively unchanged and are excreted within a few days. The phrase “studies show” can be misleading if no specific studies are cited, or if those studies are not representative.

**A - Assess:**
Assess the legitimacy of the claim and the type of logical fallacy it may fall under.

- **Ambiguous Language <DEP>**: The statement suffers significantly from ambiguous language because "digest" can mislead the audience about what happens to gum inside the human body.
- **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>**: Utilizing the assertion "studies show" without proper citation might presume a consensus that does not exist or mischaracterizes the rarity or nature of the studies.
- **Generalization <G>**: If a specific instance or anecdote is broadly applied, it could also constitute a generalization.

Therefore, the statement "Studies show it takes up to seven years for the human body to digest a piece of gum" primarily contains aspects of **Ambiguous Language <DEP>**, since it miscommunicates the process by which gum passes through the digestive system without being digestible in the usual sense. It could also involve elements of **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>** and **Generalization <G>**.
