For 
It seems you want to identify the type of defective argument used in the statement "We either ban hairspray or the world will end."

The statement given is an example of a false dichotomy (also known as a false dilemma), which is a type of logical fallacy where only two extreme options or outcomes are presented, ignoring any alternative possibilities.

However, based on your definitions, the listed defective argument types do not directly align with a false dichotomy. Nevertheless, among the given options, the closest defective argument type to a false dichotomy might be <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), because the reasoning provided is unconvincing and presents a drastically limited and extreme set of choices without adequate justification.

Therefore, the most appropriate label for this argument from your provided categories would be:

```markdown
<IR>
```

So, the applied label to the statement "We either ban hairspray or the world will end." is:

"We either ban hairspray or the world will end." <IR>
