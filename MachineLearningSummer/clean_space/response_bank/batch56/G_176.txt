For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) (Identify Defective Argument and Analyze) to the statement:

"This crash will likely damage the reputation of Malaysia Airlines, which will hurt the tourism industry of Malaysia and ruin their economy."

We will identify and analyze any defective arguments present in the statement according to the categories defined:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This involves making broad statements or conclusions from limited evidence. 
   - The statement assumes that the crash will inevitably damage the entire tourism industry of Malaysia and lead to the ruin of their economy. This may be an over-generalization as it doesn't take into account other factors that contribute to the economy or other possible outcomes.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (IE)**: This involves considering only a subset of possible causes, effects, or solutions.
   - The statement only considers the crash as a cause of potential harm to the economy, without acknowledging other variables that could mitigate the impact or other factors that could also contribute to economic issues.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This involves providing reasons that do not necessarily lead to the conclusion.
   - The reasoning that the crash will ruin their economy due to harm to the tourism industry is not necessarily conclusive. There could be other industries and economic activities that sustain the economy.
   
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This involves attributing a causal relationship without sufficient evidence.
   - The assertion that the crash will ruin the economy of Malaysia suggests a direct causal link that may not be sufficiently backed by evidence. The impact of one airline's reputation on an entire economy is not necessarily direct or solely deterministic.
   
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This involves repeating a proposition in different forms without additional justification.
   - The statement rephrases the potential negative impacts in terms of reputation, tourism industry, and overall economy, but without additional evidence to support each step of the causal chain.
   
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This involves assuming agreement or consensus without sufficient evidence.
   - The statement presumes a consensus that the crash will inevitably lead to significant negative consequences, without providing evidence that this is the widely accepted view among experts or stakeholders.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This involves using language that can have multiple interpretations.
   - The use of terms like "likely," "damage," "hurt," and "ruin" can be seen as ambiguous because they do not provide specific metrics or definitions about the extent of the harm or the conditions under which these outcomes would occur.

**Analysis:**
- The argument appears to involve aspects of **Generalization (G)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (IE)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, and **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**. It draws broad conclusions from limited evidence, does not consider other contributing or mitigating factors, and presumes a direct causal link that may not be substantiated. Additionally, it assumes consensus without evidence and uses language that can be interpreted in multiple ways, contributing to its defective nature.
  
In summary, the argument presented in the statement is defective according to several of the categories defined above.
