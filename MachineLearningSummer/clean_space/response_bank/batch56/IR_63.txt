For 
The provided statement consists of an argument which can be analyzed for defective argument types (IDAA stands for Identify Defective Argument Types Applied). Here's the argument breakdown:

**Argument Statement:** "We need more revenue to support the programs that we have. Children are our future. Let's support children."

Applying <IDAA>:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>**: The statement suggests raising taxes as the sole solution to support programs without considering or addressing alternative ways of generating revenue. It incompletely enumerates the possible solutions to the problem.

2. **Inconclusive Reason <IR>**: The reasoning provided about "Children are our future" as a justification for raising taxes is not necessarily a direct cause-and-effect relationship. Supporting children is a noble goal, but it does not provide a conclusive reason for raising taxes specifically.

3. **Ambiguous Language <DEP>**: The phrase "support the programs that we have" is quite vague and lacks specificity. It doesnâ€™t clarify which programs are underfunded or in need of support, leading to ambiguity in the argument.

In summary, this argument exhibits instances of <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration), <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), and <DEP> (Ambiguous Language).
