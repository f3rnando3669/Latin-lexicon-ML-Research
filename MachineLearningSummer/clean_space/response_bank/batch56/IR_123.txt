Applying <IDAA> involves identifying the defective argument type in a persuasive technique meant to influence a person’s emotions. Let's break down the scenario to identify which defective argument type best applies.

**Scenario:**

"A persuasive technique meant to influence a person’s emotions."

**Analysis and Identification of Defective Argument Type (IDAA):**

1. **Generalization (<G>):** This would be the case if the persuasive technique is based on an assumption that a small sample is representative of a larger group or that a limited number of examples can support a broad conclusion.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This would be relevant if the argument lists some possible factors or instances to support a claim while neglecting others which may be equally or more relevant.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This would be the case if the persuasive technique relies on premises that do not sufficiently support the conclusion, leaving the argument logically unconvincing.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This would be relevant if the technique assumes a cause-and-effect relationship without adequate evidence, thereby lacking a strong causal foundation.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This would apply if the argument relies on repeating a proposition without adding new or substantial evidence to support it.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This would be the case if the persuasive technique assumes that a consensus (real or imagined) exists without sufficient evidence that the consensus is relevant or well-founded.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** This would apply if the argument uses vague or ambiguous language to influence emotions or mislead, rather than providing clear and precise reasoning.

For this scenario, let's consider which defective argument type specifically applies to the generic characterization "A persuasive technique meant to influence a person’s emotions."

The phrase is vague and non-specific, which suggests that it leans towards using emotional influence rather than clear reasoning or evidence. Thus, it fits best with:

### Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)

**Justification:**
The technique described is not clearly defined in terms of how it influences emotions, what specific emotions are targeted, or through what means it operates. This ambiguity makes the argument difficult to evaluate or challenge, relying instead on a general appeal to emotion.

Therefore, the defective argument type applied here is <DEP> (Ambiguous Language).
