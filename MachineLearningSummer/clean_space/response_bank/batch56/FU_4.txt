For 
Certainly! The argument "Most people believe in ghosts, so ghosts are real." employs a defective argument type because it assumes that the belief of many people constitutes proof of the claim. In the context of the defined defective argument types, this fits with:

<FE> Incomplete Enumeration: The argument assumes that because a majority holds a belief, the belief must be true, without considering the quality or validity of the evidence behind those beliefs. It fails to enumerate or consider other significant factors that determine the existence of ghosts.

Also, it could be linked with:

<FU> Presumptuous Consensus: The argument relies on the assumption that the consensus (majority belief) logically and sufficiently establishes the truth of the proposition without considering that majority opinion is not a reliable indicator of factual truth.

So, applying <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Application):

"Most people believe in ghosts, so ghosts are real." <FE>, <FU>
