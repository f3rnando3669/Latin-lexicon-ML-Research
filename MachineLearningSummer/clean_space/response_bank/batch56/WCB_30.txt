The argument in the statement "You know Jane Fonda’s exercise video’s must be worth the money. Look at the great shape she’s in." can be analyzed for defective argument types (IDAA: Identify Defective Argument Types) as follows:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This could apply because the argument assumes that Jane Fonda's good physical shape is solely due to her exercise videos, without considering other factors like diet, genetics, other forms of exercise, or professional training.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This applies here by failing to recognize other potential reasons why Jane Fonda might be in great shape. It suggests a conclusion without considering all necessary components.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This also applies because the reason given—Jane Fonda being in great shape—is not sufficiently conclusive evidence that her exercise videos are worth the money. Her physical condition might not necessarily be a direct result of her own videos.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This applies because the statement does not provide enough causal evidence to establish that the exercise videos are the cause of her good shape. It presumes a direct link without much basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This does not clearly apply here as there isn't a repetition of a proposition in the argument itself.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This is not present in the given argument since there isn't an attempt to imply consensus or majority agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: There might be slight ambiguity over what "worth the money" means, but it's not a strong application here.

**Most strongly applying types**: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, and <WCB>.

Thus, the statement reflects several defective argument types, mainly Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, and Insufficient Causal Basis.
