Applying a structured approach to identify defective argument types (IDAA) to the argument "Atoms are colorless. Cats are made of atoms, so cats are colorless," we can analyze the argument and identify potential flaws:

1. **Generalization (G)**
   - **Definition**: This occurs when a broad statement is made based on limited or insufficient evidence.
   - **Application**: The statement "Atoms are colorless" is generalized to "Cats are colorless." This makes a broad generalization that the properties of atoms (being colorless) apply directly to a more complex structure (cats) which does not necessarily follow.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
   - **Definition**: This happens when not all relevant cases or possibilities are considered.
   - **Application**: The argument fails to consider other properties and characteristics of cats that contribute to their color, such as fur and pigmentation, not just their atomic composition.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
   - **Definition**: This implies that the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.
   - **Application**: Though atoms are colorless, the conclusion that "cats are colorless" is not logically valid because it ignores other factors that give cats their color.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
   - **Definition**: This type of defect occurs when causal relationships are assumed without adequate support.
   - **Application**: The premise that atoms being colorless causes cats to be colorless is an insufficient causal relationship because the color of cats is not solely determined by the color of atoms.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
   - *Note*: Not directly applicable here as there is no faulty repetition of a proposition, so we'll skip this one.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
   - **Definition**: This is where a consensus is presumed without adequate justification or evidence.
   - **Application**: Thereâ€™s no attempt at consensus in this argument, so this defect is not applicable here.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**
   - **Definition**: This flaw occurs when ambiguity in language causes confusion or misinterpretation.
   - **Application**: The term "colorless" might be taken ambiguously because it can refer to the absence of color in different contexts, however, in the context of atoms and cats, the language is relatively clear. Hence, this defect is less relevant here.

Considering these defects, the most applicable defective argument types for the statement "Atoms are colorless. Cats are made of atoms, so cats are colorless" are:

- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
