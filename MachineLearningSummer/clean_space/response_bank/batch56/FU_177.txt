For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Attributes) to the statement "Everyone was driving over the speed limit, so I shouldn't have gotten a ticket for it!" and determine which logical fallacy it represents, we need to analyze the components of the argument using the defective argument types defined.

Upon analysis, the statement can be understood to imply that just because multiple people were violating the traffic law, the speaker believes their individual violation should be excused. This type of argument is often related to appealing to common practice or bandwagoning, which can be considered under presumptuous reasoning.

Given the defective argument types listed:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument doesn't generalize from a few examples to a broad rule.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This argument doesn't fail by leaving important examples out or ignoring exceptions.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This argument could be seen as inconclusively reasoning that individual behavior should be justified because others are doing the same, but it's not the strongest match.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This argument does not attempt to establish a cause-and-effect relationship without enough evidence.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This argument does not merely repeat an assertion without proving it.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This argument presumes that because a behavior is common, it justifies an individualâ€™s engagement in that behavior. This seems to align closely with our statement as it assumes consensus (everyone doing it) makes it right or acceptable.
7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This argument does not rely on ambiguous or unclear language to make its point.

Therefore, applying <IDAA> to this argument, the most fitting defective argument type is:

<FU> - Presumptuous Consensus. 

The reasoning presumes that because everyone else was engaging in the behavior (driving over the speed limit), it should be acceptable for the speaker to engage in it as well, which is logically fallacious.
