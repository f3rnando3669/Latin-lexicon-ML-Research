For 
To apply the defective argument types to the statement "My neighbor's cat attacked me, therefore all cats are evil," let's analyze it:

This statement makes a broad conclusion based on a single incident involving one cat. It generalizes from a specific case to all cats, which fits the definition of a defective argument called Generalization.

Given that, the applied defective argument type to this statement is:
**<G> (Generalization)**.

Thus, the argument "My neighbor's cat attacked me, therefore all cats are evil" is an instance of <G>, a Generalization.
