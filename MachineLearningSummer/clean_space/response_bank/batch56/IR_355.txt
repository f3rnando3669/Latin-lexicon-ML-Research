For 
<IDAA> refers to 'Identify Defective Argument Type and Apply Annotations'.

The provided claim is:
"The claim that because somebody famous supports an idea, the idea must be right. This fallacy is often used in advertising."

To identify the defective argument type, let's analyze the structure and reasoning behind the claim:

1. The claim assumes that the endorsement of an idea by a famous person automatically validates the idea.
2. The fallacy here resides in the assumption that fame correlates with correctness or validity, without any substantial evidence supporting the idea itself, purely based on the endorser's fame.

The identified defective argument type in this case is an appeal to an inappropriate authority, often called an 'Appeal to Authority' or 'Argumentum ad Verecundiam'. However, in the context of the provided defective arguments, it aligns most closely with one of the enumerated types.

In particular:

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This fallacy occurs when it is assumed that a consensus must be correct simply because it is widely held or supported by someone influential. In this case, the fallacy leverages the authority of the famous person to create an impression of consensus or correctness without proper justification.

Therefore, applying the identified defective argument type, we get:

<IDAA: FU> The claim that because somebody famous supports an idea, the idea must be right. This fallacy is often used in advertising.
