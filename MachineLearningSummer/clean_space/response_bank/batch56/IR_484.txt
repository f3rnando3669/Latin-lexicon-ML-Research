The term **<IDAA>** needs to be defined first. Assuming <IDAA> stands for **Interpretative Defective Argument Analysis**, it would involve identifying if the argument presented contains any of the specified defective argument types.

Let's analyze the statement:

"I believe that when we die, we will spend eternity reading books and learning more about writing composition. I am so comforted by this belief!"

First, let's break down the components of this statement to see if any of the defined defective argument types apply:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - Generalization involves making a broad statement based on limited evidence. Here, the belief stated is very specific (spending eternity reading and learning), rather than generalizing from a few instances. Therefore, <G> does not apply.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - Incomplete Enumeration occurs when not all possibilities are considered. The statement asserts a belief about the afterlife without considering other possible outcomes. Therefore, <FE> could be applicable.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - Inconclusive Reason occurs when the argument doesn't lead logically to the conclusion. Here, the comfort derived from the belief does not provide a logical reason why the belief itself would be true, hence <IR> could apply as well.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - Insufficient Causal Basis involves lacking evidence to establish a causal relationship. The statement does not provide any evidence or reason why the belief in spending eternity reading would be true. Therefore, <WCB> can be considered applicable.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - This involves repeating a proposition without new evidence or reasoning. The statement here does not repetitively reinforce a concept in a circular manner. Therefore, <RR> does not apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - Presumptuous Consensus involves assuming a belief as true because it is widely held. The statement does not make any such assumption about general consensus. Thus, <FU> does not apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - Ambiguous Language pertains to language that is unclear or confusing. The statement is relatively clear in its meaning, so <DEP> does not apply.

Therefore, applying **Interpretative Defective Argument Analysis (<IDAA>)** to the statement:

"I believe that when we die, we will spend eternity reading books and learning more about writing composition. I am so comforted by this belief!"

reveals the following defective argument types that are applicable: **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
