Certainly! Here are the potential defective argument types applied to the statement "The economy grows as the number of likes on my Instagram account continue to increase. Clearly, the two are linked.":

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument implies causality without providing sufficient evidence to support the claim that the number of likes on an Instagram account is causing economic growth. Simply noting a coincidence does not establish a causal relationship.

2. **Defective Argument Type Generalization (<G>)**: This argument may be attempting to generalize a single observation (the growth of the economy when Instagram likes increase) without sufficient evidence to support a broad general conclusion.

The primary defective argument type here appears to be **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**. The statement assumes a causal link without substantiating it with adequate evidence or logical reasoning.
