To determine the fallacy being committed in the sentence "Dra. Vicky Belo said that all kinds of cars need fuel to start," we need to analyze the statement and the context under which this assertion is made. 

"Dra. Vicky Belo" is known as a well-known dermatologist in the Philippines and not as an automotive expert. Therefore, invoking her statement on a matter outside her field of expertise can be seen as an appeal to inappropriate authority.

<IDAA> = Identify the Defective Argument Applied Analysis

In this case, the appropriate defective argument type is:

- **Appeal to Inappropriate Authority (or Misleading Appeal to Authority)**: This fallacy occurs when the argument relies on the opinion of someone who has no relevant expertise or authority on the issue at hand.

Given the list of defective argument types you provided, none of them directly correspond to "Appeal to Inappropriate Authority." However, if Dra. Belo's statement is assumed to represent a general consensus without substantial basis, it may somewhat align with:

- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: This occurs when it is assumed that a belief or opinion is true simply because it is purportedly agreed upon by a number of people without critical examination or substantial evidence.

Thus, while "Appeal to Inappropriate Authority" is the primary fallacy, given the provided categories, the closest match from your list is <FU> Presumptuous Consensus. Dra. Belo's assertion about cars needing fuel would be presumed to be a consensus by the audience due to her established authority in an unrelated field.
