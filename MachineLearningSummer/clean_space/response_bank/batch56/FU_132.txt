For 
Given the context provided, it seems that <IDAA> is meant to label a specific argument type among the defined defective argument types. Let's apply the <IDAA> label to the phrase:

"peer pressure, persuasion based on the foundation that everybody’s doing it."

The most fitting defective argument type for this example would be <FU>, Presumptuous Consensus. This is because the argument relies on the idea that something is correct, acceptable, or preferable simply because a large number of people believe or do it, which assumes a consensus without sufficient evidence.

So, the labeled argument would be:
"peer pressure, persuasion based on the foundation that everybody’s doing it." <FU>
