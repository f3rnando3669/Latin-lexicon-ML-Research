To apply the classifications of defective argument types to the statement "Six million read a paper—must be excellent," we need to analyze the nature of the argument being made.

The statement suggests that because a large number of people (six million) read a particular paper, it implies that the paper must be of excellent quality. This reasoning falls into one of the defective argument types we defined. Let's analyze it step by step:

- **Generalization (G):** This would involve making a broad claim based on a small sample size. However, in this case, six million is a large number, so this might not apply directly here.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This type involves drawing a conclusion without considering all possible variables or scenarios. The statement does not consider the reasons why so many people might read the paper, which could include factors other than quality, such as marketing or sensationalism, making it an incomplete enumeration.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This would mean that the reason given does not sufficiently support the conclusion. The assumption that popularity directly correlates with excellence is not necessarily conclusive, since popularity can result from factors unrelated to quality.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This type involves assuming a causal relationship with insufficient evidence. Here, the causal link between the number of readers and the quality of the paper is presumed without adequate justification.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This would involve repeating a proposition without providing new evidence or reasoning. Since this is a single statement and not a repetition, it doesn't fit this category.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This involves assuming that widespread agreement or common belief indicates truth. The statement implies that because many people read it, a consensus on quality is assumed, which fits this category well.

- **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** This would involve using language that is vague or unclear. The terms "read a paper" and "excellent" are not particularly ambiguous here.

Based on this analysis, the most fitting defective argument types for "Six million read a paper—must be excellent" are:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement fails to consider all the potential reasons for the paper's popularity.
2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason (number of readers) given does not necessarily support the conclusion (excellence).
3. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument presumes that because many people read the paper, it must be excellent, which assumes consensus equates to truth.

Therefore, when applying the classification of defective arguments to this statement, **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, and **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** are the most relevant categories.
