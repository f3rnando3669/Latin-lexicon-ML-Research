For 
To apply an analysis of defective arguments (denoted as <IDAA>) to the statement "All tall people are good basketball players," we need to identify and categorize the potential logical flaws in this argument. 

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - The statement "All tall people are good basketball players" makes a broad generalization about tall people. It fails to account for individuals who may be tall but not skilled in basketball.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: 
   - The statement does not provide a comprehensive list or sufficient evidence that being good at basketball is solely determined by height. There are numerous other factors, such as skill, training, and experience.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: 
   - Just attributing basketball skills to height alone is an inconclusive reason, as it does not guarantee that every tall person has the physical coordination, practice, or interest needed to be good at the sport.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - Suggesting that being tall causes someone to be good at basketball has an insufficient causal basis. Height might be an advantageous factor, but it is not the sole cause of basketball proficiency. Many additional factors contribute to a person's ability to play basketball well.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - If the argument repeatedly insists that height alone determines basketball skill without new evidence or reasoning, it would be a faulty repetition of the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: 
   - This assumes a consensus that all tall people are good basketball players, which is likely not the case. There is no indication that this opinion is universally agreed upon or even backed by substantial evidence.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: 
   - The statement uses the term "good" which can be quite ambiguous. What qualifies someone as a "good basketball player" can vary significantly from one person to another.

Based on the above analysis, the statement "All tall people are good basketball players" exhibits the following defective arguments:
- Generalization (G)
- Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
- Inconclusive Reason (IR)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
- Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
- Ambiguous Language (DEP)

These defects illustrate that the argument is logically flawed and cannot be reliably accepted as true without further qualification and support.
