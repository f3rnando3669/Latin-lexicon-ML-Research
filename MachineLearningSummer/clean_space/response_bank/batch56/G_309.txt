For 
Assessing the argument "The numbers on gun violence speak for themselves. We should ban guns in the country!" against the context of defective argument types, we can identify possible instances of faulty reasoning. Let’s analyze it step by step.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This occurs when a broad conclusion is drawn from a small or unrepresentative sample. If the argument bases the call for a gun ban on a limited number of statistics without considering broader datasets or contexts, it may be a defective generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This involves neglecting other significant evidence or explanations. If the argument is based on gun violence numbers while ignoring other factors like mental health, social conditions, or the effectiveness of other forms of regulation, it would be an incomplete enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This type involves premises that do not adequately support the conclusion. If the numbers on gun violence don’t directly lead to the conclusion that banning guns is the most effective solution, then the reasoning is inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This occurs when a causal relationship is asserted without sufficient evidence. If the argument assumes that banning guns will directly reduce gun violence without addressing other contributing factors or potential consequences, it could be said to lack a sufficient causal basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This occurs when the proposition is repeated without additional support or evidence. If the argument repetitively asserts that gun violence numbers alone justify a ban without further elaboration or evidence, it could be seen as a faulty repetition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This is assuming that there is a unanimous agreement or that the majority supports the conclusion without evidence. If the argument assumes that everyone agrees that banning guns is the correct solution based on the statistics, then it could be presumptuous consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This involves using vague or unclear language. If terms like "gun violence numbers" or "speak for themselves" are not clearly defined or elaborated upon, the argument may suffer from ambiguous language.

Given the argument, several defective types potentially apply:
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: by focusing solely on gun violence numbers, it may ignore other factors or data relevant to the issue.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: the numbers alone may not necessarily lead to a justified conclusion that banning guns is the solution.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: assuming a direct causal relationship between gun ban and reduction in violence might be an overreach without sufficient evidence.

Thus, applying <IDAA>:
"The numbers on gun violence speak for themselves. We should ban guns in the country!" could be characterized by an **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**, **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, and potentially **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
