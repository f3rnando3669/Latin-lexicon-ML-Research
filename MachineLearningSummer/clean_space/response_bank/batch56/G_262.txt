For 
To analyze the argument "People nowadays only vote with their emotions instead of their brains" using the defined defective argument types, we can apply the following analysis:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - This argument generalizes the behavior of all people based on likely anecdotal or limited evidence. It assumes that "people nowadays" encompasses everyone in the current era without exceptions. 

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - The argument fails to consider the full range of reasons why people might vote the way they do, such as personal values, logical reasoning, political ideologies, historical perspectives, and personal experiences.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The argument suggests that voting with emotions is mutually exclusive from voting with one's brain, without providing evidence to support the assertion that emotional voting lacks cognitive processing.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - It presumes a causal relationship between "nowadays" and "voting with emotions" without substantiating why the current time period has bred such behavior or providing evidence to show a shift from previous voting behaviors.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - While the statement itself does not directly repeat a proposition, if a similar claim had been made repeatedly without any new evidence, it would fall under this defect.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - The argument assumes a consensus by stating "people nowadays" as if everyone agrees on the emotional nature of voting. Additionally, it might be suggesting that there's a common understanding or acceptance of this idea without validating it.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - The terms "emotions" and "brains" are vague and could be interpreted in various ways. Emotions can involve complex cognitive processes, and what it means to vote "with their brains" is not clearly defined.

By applying the IDAA to the statement, we can see multiple defective argument types that weaken the argument's validity:

- **G (Generalization)** is present as it makes an unqualified broad statement about "people nowadays."
- **FE (Incomplete Enumeration)** is evident as it overlooks other influencing factors on voting behavior.
- **IR (Inconclusive Reason)** applies due to lack of supporting evidence for the dichotomy of emotion versus thought.
- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)** fits because it assumes a causation trend without proof.
- **FU (Presumptuous Consensus)** is relevant as it presumes unanimous contemporary behavior.
- **DEP (Ambiguous Language)** applies due to vagueness in important terms. 

Assessing with these defective argument types helps to understand the weaknesses in the original claim.
