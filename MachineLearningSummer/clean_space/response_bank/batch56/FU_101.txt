For 
In the analysis of the given argument, we can break down the types of defective arguments being employed as follows:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - This does not seem to be present in the provided argument. The argument makes specific reference to Cathy's personal feelings and the actions of her friends without broadly generalizing these points.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - This might be slightly applicable as the argument doesn't consider alternatives to social media or the vastness of social interactions options available to Cathy besides joining social media. However, there are not enough details to confirm that an incomplete enumeration is made.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - This is partly applicable since the reasoning provided, that Cathy's friends joined social media, does not conclusively support the notion that Cathy *needs* to join social media as well. There could be other reasons she might decide to join or refrain apart from peer influence.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - This might be relevant because the argument presumes that Cathy's decision to join social media is solely based on her friends' actions, which may not be a sufficiently strong causal basis. There might be other underlying reasons for her feeling pressured or compelled to join.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - This type is not evidently applicable in this argument since there is no repeated proposition aimed at convincing the reader by mere repetition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - This is applicable here since the argument presumes that because more of Cathy's friends have joined social media, this creates a kind of consensus or peer pressure that she must follow, without establishing why this consensus should be decisive.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - This type might be slightly applicable if "needs to create an account" is considered ambiguous. It could imply either a strong necessity or simply a perceived pressure without clear explanation.

In summary, primary defective argument types applicable are:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** because the argument doesn’t sufficiently establish the necessity for Cathy to join based on the given premise.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** for the assumption that the actions of her friends are the sufficient cause for Cathy’s need.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)** by assuming that Cathy’s actions should align with her friends without providing adequate justification.
