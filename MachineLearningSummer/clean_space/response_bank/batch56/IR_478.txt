For 
<IDAA>, which stands for Identifying Defective Argument Assignments, is a tool used to categorize an argument based on the predefined defective argument types.

Let's analyze the given statement:

"Mrs. Peters is nominated for teacher of the year, which is voted on by her fellow faculty members. A colleague says that she would never vote for her because she is too young."

To apply <IDAA>, we identify any defective argument types in this statement:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This would apply if a broad conclusion is drawn from a limited sample. In this case, the colleague's opinion seems based solely on age, which may not represent the views of the entire faculty.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This applies if not all possibilities are considered. The colleague's reasoning ignores other qualities Mrs. Peters might have that make her a suitable candidate.
    
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This would apply if the reasoning given does not sufficiently support the conclusion. Saying someone is "too young" is not enough to conclude that they are not qualified for the award.
    
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This applies if a cause-and-effect relationship is inadequately supported. The colleague implies that being young means not being a good teacher, but this causal link is not justified.
    
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This doesn't seem applicable as there is no repetition of a proposition to support the argument.
    
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This applies if there is an assumption that a consensus exists without evidence. The colleague does not provide evidence that other faculty members share her view about Mrs. Peters' age.
    
7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This applies if the argument relies on unclear or equivocal terms. The term "too young" is subjective and not clearly defined.

Thus, applying <IDAA>, the statement "A colleague says that she would never vote for her because she is too young." is problematic due to:
- <G> Generalization: The conclusion may represent a personal bias rather than a general faculty opinion.
- <IR> Inconclusive Reason: The reason provided (age) is insufficient to dismiss someone's qualifications for the award.
- <DEP> Ambiguous Language: The term "too young" is vague and subjective.
- <FU> Presumptuous Consensus: There is an implication that others might share this view without providing supporting evidence.
