<IDAA>: Incorrect Dispute of Approximated Arguments

The statement "So you are saying your car is worth $20k. I think it is worth $1, so letâ€™s just compromise and say it is worth $10k." falls under the category of **Incorrect Dispute of Approximated Arguments** (IDAA). This is because the argument incorrectly assumes that a fair or reasonable outcome must lie exactly halfway between two vastly different valuations without consideration of the factual basis or the actual market value of the car. Essentially, it inappropriately applies the principle of compromise where it is not warranted, leading to a flawed conclusion.
