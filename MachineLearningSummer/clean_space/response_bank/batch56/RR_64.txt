For 
Certainly! First, let us break down the argument you provided:

"Richardson is the most successful mayor the town has ever had because he's the best mayor of our history."

This statement claims that Richardson is the most successful mayor (conclusion) and supports this claim by stating that he is the best mayor in history (premise). Now, we need to analyze this argument with respect to the defective argument types defined:

#### Inconclusive Defective Argument Analysis (<IDAA>)

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The argument does not seem to rely on generalizations or broad statements that lack sufficient support.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The argument doesn’t present a list of mayors from which Richardson is selected, so we can't confirm this defect here.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - This argument might actually suffer from this defect. The reason "he's the best mayor of our history" is subjective and doesn't necessarily prove success through concrete evidence or measures of success.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The argument lacks a clear causal link between being "the best" and being the "most successful." Success may depend on various factors not detailed here.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - This defect is present. The conclusion ("most successful mayor") is essentially repeating the premise ("best mayor of our history") without offering new or supporting evidence.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - The argument does not claim that people agree with the premise or conclusion; it is focused on the author's assertion alone.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP> - Ambiguous Language):**
   - The terms “most successful” and “best” may be interpreted differently by different people, introducing ambiguity into the argument.

### Conclusion:

The argument "Richardson is the most successful mayor the town has ever had because he's the best mayor of our history" can be analyzed as containing the following defective argument types:

1. <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)
2. <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)
3. <DEP> (Ambiguous Language)

Therefore, the argument’s support for the conclusion is weak due to its reliance on an inconclusive reason, repetition without new evidence, and the use of ambiguous language.
