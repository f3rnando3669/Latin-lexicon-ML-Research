For 
<IDAA> stands for Irrelevant Discrediting of Arguer's Attributes, which is a type of argument that attempts to discredit someone's position or argument by attacking their personal attributes or circumstances rather than addressing the substance of their argument. 

So let's apply <IDAA> to the given statement:

"Oh, please. What do you know about labor laws? You don't even have a job."

This statement is an example of <IDAA> because it discredits the person's knowledge about labor laws based on their employment status, which is irrelevant to the validity of their argument or knowledge about labor laws.
