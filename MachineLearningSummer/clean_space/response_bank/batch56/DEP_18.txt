For 
Applying <IDAA> to the provided argument involves identifying defective argument types (from those defined) within the dialogue between Bernice and Mildred. Here is the analysis of the exchange:

"**Bernice**: Do you support Black Lives Matter?  
**Mildred**: Of course, I do!  
**Bernice**: Then you should support me looting that store.  
**Mildred**: Wait... what?"

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Bernice makes the assumption that supporting the Black Lives Matter movement necessarily includes supporting all actions that might be associated with it, including looting. This is an <Incomplete Enumeration> fallacy because it fails to recognize the full scope of beliefs and actions that someone might hold regarding the movement. Supporting Black Lives Matter does not automatically imply support for looting, as the two are not universally enumerated or mutually inclusive.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Bernice asserts that Mildred's support for Black Lives Matter should logically extend to supporting looting. This is an <Inconclusive Reason> because the reason provided (support for BLM) does not conclusively lead to the conclusion (support for looting). Mildred could support the movement while condemning looting as counterproductive or unethical.

3. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - The term "support" in Bernice's argument may be used ambiguously. Supporting the general principles of Black Lives Matter is not the same as supporting every action taken in its name. The different interpretations of "support" create an ambiguous argument which can lead to confusion or miscommunication, as demonstrated by Mildred's confusion ("Wait... what?").

Based on this analysis, the main defective argument types present in this dialogue are <FE>, <IR>, and <DEP>.
