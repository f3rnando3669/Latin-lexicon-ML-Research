For 
The argument in question is:

"I go to my front porch every morning and yell, “May no tigers enter this house!” and for 20 years, not a single tiger has entered my house. My tiger prevention strategy clearly works."

This argument can be analyzed to identify the presence of defective argument types listed:

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument attributes the absence of tigers to the act of yelling, but there is an insufficient causal basis provided. It's highly likely that the absence of tigers is due to reasons unrelated to the yelling (e.g., tigers do not naturally roam that area).

2. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument presumes that the mentioned strategy is effective without any external verification or consensus. The effectiveness of the strategy is not supported by scientific evidence or shared knowledge.

Based on these considerations, the identified defective argument types are:

- <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)
- <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)

Therefore, applying <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Types and Apply Analysis), the argument suffers from both **Insufficient Causal Basis** and **Presumptuous Consensus**.
