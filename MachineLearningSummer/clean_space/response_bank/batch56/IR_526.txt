For 
"One pill is good, two will be better" can be analyzed for defective argument types. Let's break it down:

1. **Generalization (G):** This statement generalizes the positive effect of one pill to two pills without providing evidence that a higher dose will lead to better results. An assumption is made that increasing the quantity will proportionately increase the benefit, which might not be true and could potentially be harmful.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The statement considers only the positive outcome of taking two pills, without considering other possibilities such as adverse effects or diminishing returns.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reasoning behind why two pills would be better lacks substantiation. The statement does not provide a logical basis or empirical evidence showing that two pills are indeed more effective than one.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal link between taking two pills and the expected improvement over taking one pill is not established. There is no causal evidence provided that taking an additional pill will produce a better outcome.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The statement repeats the proposition that what works in a small dose is better in a larger dose without due support, reinforcing a potentially false belief.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The statement presumes agreement or common sense acceptance that more is better without actual consensus or proof. It assumes others will automatically see the logic in the increase.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The word "better" is ambiguous. Better in what sense? More effective, faster acting, or something else? The lack of clarity in what "better" actually means renders the argument vague.

Given all these points, the statement "One pill is good, two will be better" fits several defective argument types, mainly **Generalization (G)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, while also potentially fitting the others to varying extents.
