For 
<IDAA> refers to identifying defective argument types within a given statement. The statement you provided is: "I called my friend and he didn't answer. He wasn't home or he was dead."

Here is the analysis of the defective argument types in that statement:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The statement proposes only two reasons for why the friend didn't answer the call: either he wasn't home or he was dead. This is an incomplete enumeration because there are many other possible reasons (e.g., his phone was on silent, he was in another room, he was busy, etc.).

2. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The statement jumps to conclusions without sufficient evidence. Just because the friend didn't answer the call doesn't logically lead to the conclusion that he wasn't home or was dead. We lack conclusive reasons to narrow down to these two possibilities.

Therefore, applying <IDAA> to your statement would identify the following defective argument types:

<IDAA> = <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration), <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)
