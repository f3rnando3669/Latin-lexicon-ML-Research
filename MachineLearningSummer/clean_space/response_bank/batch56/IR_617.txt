For 
<IDAA> stands for Identification of Defective Argument Application. The statement provided is: "We can't believe what he says out of that ugly mouth of his." Let's identify the defective argument types that may be applicable:

1. **Ad Hominem Attack**: This statement attacks the person (specifically, his appearance) rather than addressing the content or validity of what he says. This is a clear example of an ad hominem fallacy, which can undermine the credibility of the argument without addressing the actual issue.

To identify which of the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP> it corresponds to, consider the following:

- **Generalization (G)**: Not applicable here, as there is no broad assertion based on limited evidence.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable, as there is no listing of possibilities or incomplete account.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Partially applicable, since the reasoning (attacking his appearance) does not logically connect to the truthfulness of his statements, making the reason inconclusive.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Not applicable, as there’s no discussion of cause and effect here.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Not applicable, as there is no repetition involved.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Not applicable, as there’s no reference to a supposed consensus or group agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Not really applicable, as the language used (“ugly mouth”) is quite clear, though inappropriate and irrelevant.

So, the primary defective argument type in this statement is:

<IR> Inconclusive Reason: The reason provided (the person’s appearance) is irrelevant and does not conclusively support the claim that we cannot believe what he says.

Hence, "We can't believe what he says out of that ugly mouth of his." can be tagged as:
<IDAA: IR>
