For 
<IDAA>, or Identify Defective Argument Application, involves analyzing and labeling defective argument types within a given statement. Let's apply <IDAA> to the statement:

"Your Honor, the defendant has been able to provide no strong evidence to prove his innocence; therefore, you must find him guilty."

This statement can potentially contain multiple defective argument types:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement overlooks other possibilities, such as the absence of strong evidence not necessarily indicating guilt. It doesn't enumerate all possible outcomes or considerations.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The conclusion (finding the defendant guilty) is based on insufficient evidence. The argument assumes that lack of strong evidence for innocence is conclusively equivalent to guilt, which is not necessarily valid.

3. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There is an implicit assumption that everyone (the jury and judge) would agree that lack of evidence for innocence automatically means guilt, presuming a consensus where it may not exist.

4. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The term "strong evidence" is vague and could mean different things in different contexts. What constitutes "strong" evidence could vary.

Letâ€™s summarize this:

<IDAA>: The argument "Your Honor, the defendant has been able to provide no strong evidence to prove his innocence; therefore, you must find him guilty." exhibits the following defective argument types:
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)** 

By identifying these defective argument types, we highlight the flawed reasoning and logical fallacies within the statement.
