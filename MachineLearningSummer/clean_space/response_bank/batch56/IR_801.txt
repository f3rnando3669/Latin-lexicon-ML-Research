For 
<IDAA> stands for **Defective Argument Analysis Application**, which is a method of identifying and labeling specific types of defective arguments within a given statement or discourse.

In the statement provided:

"I'm not surprised, frankly, that someone who gets lost in his own neighborhood would argue that New York has better pizza than Chicago."

we can identify multiple defective arguments. Let’s break it down:

1. **Irrelevant Reason (IR)**: The fact that someone gets lost in their own neighborhood is irrelevant to the debate about whether New York has better pizza than Chicago. The argument does not provide a relevant basis for dismissing their opinion on pizza.

2. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There is an implicit presumption that getting lost in one's neighborhood somehow establishes a general consensus that the person’s opinions on other matters are thus invalid or less credible.

3. **Ad Hominem Attack (a type of defeater)**: The argument attacks the person’s character (their navigational skills) rather than addressing the actual claim about pizza quality.

Therefore, applying IDAA:

- <IR> (Inconclusive Reason): **The reason given (getting lost in their own neighborhood) is irrelevant to the debate about pizza quality.**
  
- <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus): **Presumes a consensus based on irrelevance (navigation skills affecting opinion validity on pizza).**

- **Ad Hominem Attack**: **Attacks the person instead of addressing the actual argument.** (Note: This specific label isn't one of the outlined defective argument types you provided but is a well-known fallacy type.)

Thus, the comprehensive defective argument analysis application would reveal:

<IDAA> <IR> <FU> "I'm not surprised, frankly, that someone who gets lost in his own neighborhood would argue that New York has better pizza than Chicago."
