The argument type labeled as <IDAA> isn't defined in your list. However, based on the structure and context provided, it appears you're asking for an analysis of the given statement in terms of possible defective argument types. Let’s break down the provided statement.

**Statement: "Dean, the company you work for just filed for bankruptcy! How can I trust you with our money?"**

We can analyze potential defective argument types within this statement:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** The argument suggests that because Dean's company filed for bankruptcy, Dean is also untrustworthy with money. This is a potential case of hasty generalization. Just because the company faced financial issues, it doesn’t necessarily mean Dean is individually responsible or incapable of handling money responsibly.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The statement jumps to a conclusion about Dean's trustworthiness without considering other relevant factors or evidence that might contradict the assumption. It overlooks the broader context of Dean’s abilities or situation.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The argument connects the company's bankruptcy to Dean's personal trustworthiness with money, implying causation without sufficient reasoning. There could be many other factors leading to the company’s financial failure that have nothing to do with Dean's personal capabilities.

Applying these:

**Generalization (<G>):** "The company Dean works for filed for bankruptcy, so Dean must be untrustworthy with money."
**Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** "The company’s financial failure is reason enough to distrust Dean with our money, without looking at other evidence of Dean's financial prudence."
**Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** "The company’s bankruptcy directly implies Dean's inability to manage money."

In summary, the argument can be categorized using multiple defective argument types such as Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, and Inconclusive Reason. Each of these categories highlights the flaws in reasoning within the provided statement.
