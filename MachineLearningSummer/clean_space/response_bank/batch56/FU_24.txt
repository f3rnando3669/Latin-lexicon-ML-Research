For 
Let's break down the argument "Nobody else is wearing masks out in public. Why should you?" and determine which defective argument type(s) apply:

- Generalization (<G>): This argument seems to generalize based on the observed behavior of others. It assumes that because a few people (or even many) are not wearing masks, it is unnecessary for anyone to wear a mask. This is a faulty generalization because it doesn't consider the possibility of individual circumstances or the broader public health recommendations.
  
- Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>): The argument implies a consensus based on what is perceived ("nobody else is wearing masks") without necessarily having complete information about the broader community's behavior or health guidelines. This presumption is used to justify not wearing a mask.

- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>): The argument fails to consider all relevant reasons or perspectives on mask-wearing. It looks only at the immediate behavior of others without addressing the health guidelines or individual responsibility.
  
Therefore, the argument "Nobody else is wearing masks out in public. Why should you?" could be classified under Generalization (<G>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), and Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>).
