For 
The argument provided is:

"During the first week of July ice cream sales climbed, and during the second week murder rates climbed. Therefore, ice cream inspires murder."

To apply the specified defective arguments (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>) to analyze this argument, we identify which of these categories the argument falls into. In this case:

<WCB> â€” Insufficient Causal Basis: 

This argument assumes a causal relationship between ice cream sales and murder rates without providing sufficient evidence to establish such causality. Just because two events occur in sequence does not mean that one causes the other. This is a classic case of a correlation being mistaken for causation. Thus, this argument type leads to a faulty conclusion based on an insufficient causal basis.

So, the defective argument type for "During the first week of July ice cream sales climbed, and during the second week murder rates climbed. Therefore, ice cream inspires murder." is <WCB>.
