In the statement, "Ten years ago I got a 170 on the LSAT, so I expect to get the same score again," the argument type can be identified and evaluated. 

Here's how the argument can be classified and why:

**Identify Defective Argument Type (IDAA):**

The statement assumes that the score obtained ten years ago will predict the same score in the present without considering potential changes in preparation, test difficulty, or other intervening factors. This type of reasoning has a name among the defective argument types defined:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The argument relies on an assumption that the past score will directly cause the same result in the future. However, the conclusion drawn is not necessarily supported by the premises given, as there might be numerous factors that could affect the current test score.

Thus, the defective argument type in this case is:

**<IR>: Inconclusive Reason**

This classification highlights that the reasoning behind expecting the same score on the LSAT after ten years based solely on the past score is not sufficiently conclusive, as it ignores potential variables and changes over time.
