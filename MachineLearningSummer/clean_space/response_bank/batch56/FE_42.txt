For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application. Given the statement "Hillary Clinton wants to take your guns away, and she wants to abolish the Second Amendment," there are a few defective argument types that might apply:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument might overgeneralize Clinton's stance based on selective policies or statements, ignoring the nuances of her position on gun control.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: It assumes without evidence that Clinton's entire policy revolves around taking away guns and abolishing the Second Amendment, possibly ignoring other aspects of her policy proposals regarding gun control.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The statement does not provide concrete evidence for the claims made about Clinton's intentions. It offers conclusions without sufficient support.

4. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The language used is vague and loaded, which could be interpreted in multiple ways. For instance, "wants to take your guns away" and "wants to abolish the Second Amendment" are strong, ambiguous claims that might mislead or provoke emotional reactions without clear explanations.

In summary, applying <IDAA>, you could reasonably identify **Generalization (<G>)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**, **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, and **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)** as defective arguments present in the given statement.
