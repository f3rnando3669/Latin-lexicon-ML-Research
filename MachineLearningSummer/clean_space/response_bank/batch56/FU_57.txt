For 
<IDAA> stands for Identification of Defective Argument Application. By analyzing the statement "Don't be the only one not wearing Nike!" in the context of the defective arguments youâ€™ve provided, we can identify which types apply:

1. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This argument implies that everyone is wearing Nike and you should too, assuming that consensus or a presumed group behavior dictates correct action without providing valid reasons.
  
2. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The phrase "the only one" may create unnecessary ambiguity. It's unclear who specifically is wearing Nike and in what context.

3. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not consider other options or reasons why someone might not wear Nike. It simply focuses on group behavior without enumerating or discussing different perspectives or options.

Therefore, the statement "Don't be the only one not wearing Nike!" can be seen as containing elements of <FU>, <DEP>, and <FE>.
