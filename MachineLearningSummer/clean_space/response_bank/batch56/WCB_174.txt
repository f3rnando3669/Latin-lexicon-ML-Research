The argument provided can be roughly paraphrased and analyzed as follows:

**Argument:** "You cannot blame your friends for a rain delay just because every time they go with you to a ballgame it storms and play is delayed. Likewise, the fact that a pitcher bought new socks before he pitched a winning game does not mean that new socks cause a pitcher to throw faster."

This contains elements of <WCB> or **Insufficient Causal Basis** due to the following reasons:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This argument type involves asserting a causal connection between two events without sufficient evidence to justify such a connection. In the provided argument, the claim that friends cause rain delays or that new socks cause a pitcher to throw faster is not supported by sufficient evidence. The coincidence of rain during games with friends and the purchase of new socks before a winning game is used to imply causation, which is methodologically flawed because correlation does not imply causation.

Therefore, the defective argument type <WCB> can be applied to this argument.
