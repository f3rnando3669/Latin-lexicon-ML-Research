Based on the provided definitions of defective argument types, let's identify the defective argument type in the statement "My first day of basketball practice was easy, so it will always be easy."

The statement makes a broad assertion based on a single instance, which fits the definition of a **Generalization (G)**:

**Generalization (G)**: An argument that makes a broad claim based on limited or unrepresentative evidence.

Therefore, applying \( \text{Generalization (G)} \) to the statement, it can be labeled as follows:

**"My first day of basketball practice was easy, so it will always be easy." \( \text{<G>} \)**
