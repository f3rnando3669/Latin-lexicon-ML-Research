For 
Let's analyze the argument in the statement: "Of course, your minister says he believes in God. He would be unemployed otherwise."

This statement suggests that the minister's proclamation of belief is motivated by the necessity to maintain employment rather than genuine conviction. Let's examine if and how any of the defined defective argument types apply:

1. **Generalization (G):** This argument doesn't generalize from a small sample to a broad population. So, it doesn't fit here.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This argument isn't presenting a list of options while neglecting others. So, it doesn't fit this type either.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The argument does present a reason (the ministerâ€™s employment depends on professing belief), but it's baseless to assume this is the sole or primary reason for his belief. This is inconclusive; there is no solid evidence presented to support the claim. Therefore, this could fit under IR.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The statement suggests a causation (belief in God to ensure employment) without enough support or evidence. This also fits "Insufficient Causal Basis."

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The argument doesn't involve repeating an inaccurate proposition. So, it doesn't fit here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument doesn't rely on an assumption that everyone agrees with the conclusion. So, this is not a fit.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The language used is quite straightforward, lacking ambiguity. So, this isn't applicable.

Thus, applying the defective argument types defined:

The argument can be classified under both **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because it draws a conclusion about the minister's belief without providing concrete evidence, implying causation without sufficient support.
