For 
Certainly! "All my friends are doing a low carb diet. That must be the only way to lose weight." expresses a defective argument. Let's analyze it with respect to the defined defective argument types (IDAA - Identification of Defective Argument Type):

1. **Generalization (G):**
   The statement assumes that because a specific group (friends) is following the low carb diet, it is the only way to lose weight. This is an overgeneralization because it takes a limited sample and applies it universally without sufficient evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   The argument does not consider other possible ways to lose weight, such as exercising, dieting differently, or other scientific methods. It lists only one method and dismisses others without a thorough examination.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   The reasoning that because "all my friends are doing it" concludes that it is the only effective way is logically weak. The sample size (friends) and their success donâ€™t provide substantial evidence to make such a broad and definitive conclusion.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   The argument implies a causal relationship between following a low carb diet and being the only method to lose weight without sufficient evidence to establish that causality.

5. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   This argument type is relevant here as it presumes that because there's a consensus among a particular group (friends), it must be universally correct. It overlooks the fact that consensus within a small or specific group does not equate to universal validity.

Applying the above defective argument types, it can be deduced that Murtaza's statement, "All my friends are doing a low carb diet. That must be the only way to lose weight," suffers from the following defective argument types: **Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), and Presumptuous Consensus (FU).**
