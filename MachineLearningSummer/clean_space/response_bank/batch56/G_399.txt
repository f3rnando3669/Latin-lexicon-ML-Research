Certainly, let's apply the defined defective arguments to the statement: "You can never give anyone a break. If you do, they'll walk all over you."

IDAA refers to Identifying Defective Argument Application. Here’s the analysis based on the types provided:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The statement "You can never give anyone a break" is a sweeping generalization. It assumes that every single instance of giving a break leads to negative consequences without considering individual circumstances or exceptions.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The argument implicitly suggests that the only possible outcome of giving someone a break is that they will take advantage and "walk all over you." This ignores other potential outcomes, such as gratitude, improved relationships, or increased loyalty. Hence, it's an incomplete enumeration of the possible consequences.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The statement does not provide sufficient evidence to justify that giving a break always results in being mistreated. There could be many situations where giving someone a break doesn’t lead to being walked over. Thus, the reasoning is inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - Assuming a causal relationship between giving someone a break and them walking all over you lacks firm evidence. Many factors could influence whether a person takes advantage of kindness or not.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - The statement itself does not seem to repeat a faulty proposition. Faulty repetition typically involves reiterating the same claim without substantiation, which is not inherently present in this particular argument.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - There's an implicit assumption that everyone agrees on this point of view, suggesting a consensus without actual evidence of wide agreement. This can be seen in the categorical "You can never," which presumes a universal agreement without basis.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - The phrase "walk all over you" is metaphorical and ambiguous. It does not clearly define what behaviors constitute "walking all over" someone, leaving space for multiple interpretations.

Thus, applying <IDAA> reveals that the argument "You can never give anyone a break. If you do, they'll walk all over you." contains instances of defective arguments, specifically Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), and Ambiguous Language (<DEP>).
