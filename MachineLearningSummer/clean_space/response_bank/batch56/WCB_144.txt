To evaluate the argument "The rooster crows always before the sun rises, therefore the crowing rooster causes the sun to rise" using the defective argument types you've defined, we will analyze it based on each specific defect.

Firstly, identify the type of defective argument this statement primarily represents:

1. <WCB> - Insufficient Causal Basis: This applies because the argument asserts a causal relationship based only on a regular time sequence (post hoc reasoning), without sufficient evidence to establish that the rooster's crowing actually causes the sun to rise. The correlation between the rooster crowing and the sunrise does not logically substantiate causation.

Thus, applying <IDAA> (Identified Defective Argument Annotation), the argument appears as follows:

"The rooster crows always before the sun rises, therefore the crowing rooster causes the sun to rise." <WCB>

This annotation marks the primary defect of the argument, highlighting its insufficient causal basis.
