The logical fallacy that John F. Kennedy uses in his statement can be classified as <G> Generalization. 

Here's the reasoning:

- **Defective Argument Type <G> (Generalization):** Generalization involves making broad claims based on limited evidence or few examples. Kennedy states, "I'm not satisfied when the United States had last year the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world...". This statement is a generalization because it doesn't take into account the broader context, such as the fact that 1958 was a recession year, which Nixon later points out.

Thus, Kennedy's argument is guilty of making a broad generalization about the U.S. economic performance without sufficiently considering the specific circumstances that might explain the anomaly.
