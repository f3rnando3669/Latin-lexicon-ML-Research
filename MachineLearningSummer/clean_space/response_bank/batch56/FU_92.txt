It looks like you defined various defective argument types, but `<IDAA>` has not been defined in your list. Based on the context, it seems you might have mistyped or intended to apply one of your defined argument types to the statement "If you had school pride like the rest of us do, you would wear a mountain lion costume every day."

Let's evaluate the statement with respect to the given defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument type involves making broad statements or claims based on limited evidence.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This occurs when only part of the evidence is presented, ignoring other relevant evidence.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This refers to reasoning that does not sufficiently support the conclusion.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This involves claiming a causal relationship without adequate support.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This is repeating a statement without providing further evidence or reason.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This is assuming everyone agrees without justification.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This occurs when unclear or vague language leads to confusion or misinterpretation.

Given the statement, "If you had school pride like the rest of us do, you would wear a mountain lion costume every day":

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** stands out because the statement assumes that everyone else exhibits their school pride by wearing a mountain lion costume, which may not be justified or true. The argument assumes consensus about the relationship between school pride and wearing a costume without providing evidence that all or most people actually agree or behave this way.

Therefore, the defective argument type that best applies to the given statement is **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.
