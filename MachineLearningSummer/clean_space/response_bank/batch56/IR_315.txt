For 
<IDAA>, also known as Identify Defective Argument Application, is the process of analyzing a given argument for one or more of the defined defective argument types. Let's apply <IDAA> to the statement:

"To my knowledge, there are no studies supporting this approach. Therefore, I see no reason to change our routine."

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The statement "To my knowledge, there are no studies supporting this approach" suggests that the individual hasn't found any studies themselves, but this does not necessarily mean that such studies do not exist. This is an example of incomplete enumeration, as the speaker's knowledge (or lack thereof) is not a comprehensive survey of all possible studies.

Thus, the identified defective argument type is:

<FE> Incomplete Enumeration
