The task seems to be to apply "Identify Defective Argument Application" (IDAA) to the phrase "present ideas that elicit strong feelings." Here, we aim to identify if any of the defective argument types you've defined might apply to this phrase. Let's analyze:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This involves drawing a broad conclusion from a small sample. The phrase doesn't inherently make a broad conclusion based on limited evidence, so <G> doesn't apply here.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This involves making a conclusion based on a limited set of information without acknowledging all possibilities. The phrase does not provide a list or a number of ideas, so <FE> is not applicable.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This involves an argument where the reasons given do not lead to the conclusion. The phrase by itself doesnâ€™t provide a conclusion or reasoning structure, so <IR> isn't applicable.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This involves claiming a cause-and-effect relationship without sufficient evidence. The phrase does not suggest causation explicitly, so <WCB> is not fitting.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This refers to repeating an argument without further substantiation. The phrase does not involve repetition or argument structure, so <RR> does not apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This implies assuming consensus or agreement where there might be none. The phrase doesn't imply any assumption of consensus, so <FU> isn't relevant.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This involves using language that can be interpreted in multiple ways, leading to confusion. The phrase "present ideas that elicit strong feelings" can indeed be seen as ambiguous since "strong feelings" is a vague term. Does it refer to positive feelings, negative feelings, or any intense emotional reaction? Because of this ambiguity, it makes the argument defectively presented.

**Conclusion**:

Among the defective argument types listed, **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)** applies to the phrase "present ideas that elicit strong feelings," as the phrase's lack of clarity can lead to multiple interpretations and misunderstandings.
