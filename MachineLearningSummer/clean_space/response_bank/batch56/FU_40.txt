For 
To analyze the statement "God must exist because every culture has some sort of belief in a higher being." for defective arguments, I'll identify any potential argument flaws listed in the given definitions.

**Generalization (<G>)**: This occurs when a conclusion is based on an insufficient or non-representative sample. In the statement, the conclusion about God's existence is based on the cultural beliefs of different societies. Even though many cultures have some form of belief in a higher being, this generalization does not necessarily prove the existence of God.

**Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This takes place when not all relevant instances or possibilities are considered. The argument assumes that because a belief is widespread, it must be true, without considering cultures or individuals that do not share this belief or other possible explanations for the shared belief in higher beings.

**Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This refers to reasoning that does not definitively support the conclusion. The existence of a belief across cultures does not conclusively prove the truth of the belief; it could be influenced by psychological, sociological, or other factors.

**Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This happens when a cause is insufficient to produce the claimed effect. The widespread belief in a higher being is not sufficient evidence to cause or prove the existence of God. The reasons for such beliefs could be varied and complex, not necessarily pointing to the actual existence of such a being.

**Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This involves repeating a claim as proof of itself. The statement doesn't appear to involve repetition of the original proposition as evidence.

**Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This involves assuming something is true because many people believe it. The statement "God must exist because every culture has some sort of belief in a higher being" falls into this category by assuming consensus translates to truth.

**Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This refers to the use of vague or unclear terms that can lead to misunderstanding. The term "higher being" might be ambiguous as different cultures might have different interpretations or understandings of what constitutes a "higher being."

**Application of Identified Defective Argument Types (<IDAA>):**

The statement "God must exist because every culture has some sort of belief in a higher being." involves the following defective argument types:

- **FE (Incomplete Enumeration)**: It does not consider cultures or individuals without belief in a higher being.
- **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**: The presence of a widespread belief does not definitively prove the existence of God.
- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The mere existence of belief is not enough to establish the actual existence of God.
- **FU (Presumptuous Consensus)**: It presumes that because many people believe something, it must be true.
- **DEP (Ambiguous Language)**: The term "higher being" is vague and could mean different things to different cultures.
