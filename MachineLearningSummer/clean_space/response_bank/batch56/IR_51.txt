For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Arguments Application. Let's break down the given argument and identify any defective arguments:

"Professor X holds that the use of non-invasive ventilation has no place in the management of ARDS; this, therefore, is the approach we should adopt."

1. **Generalization (G)**:
    - Not applicable, as the statement does not involve making a broad generalization from a small sample.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
    - This argument could be an <FE> because it fails to consider or enumerate other expert opinions or evidence that may suggest non-invasive ventilation could be beneficial for ARDS.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
    - The argument assumes that Professor X's opinion alone is sufficient to conclude the appropriate treatment for ARDS without providing additional supporting evidence. This seems to fit the criteria for <IR>.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
    - Not applicable, as the statement does not claim a causal relationship based on insufficient evidence.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
    - Not applicable, as the argument does not involve repeating a proposition to reinforce its acceptance.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
    - The argument might imply that because Professor X, possibly an authority figure, holds a particular belief, it should be accepted without further consensus. This could potentially fit <FU> if it were assuming everyone agrees or should agree with Professor X without further evidence.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
    - Not applicable, as the language used in the statement does not seem ambiguous.

Based on the analysis, the argument primarily seems to fall under:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** because it does not account for other expert opinions or evidence.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** because it relies solely on Professor X's opinion without additional evidence.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** because it assumes the acceptability of the approach based on Professor X's authority without establishing wider agreement or evidence.

Thus, the identified defective arguments in the statement are **<FE>**, **<IR>**, and potentially **<FU>**.
