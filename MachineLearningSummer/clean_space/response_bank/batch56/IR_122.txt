The scenario described in "Asking a respected scientist to weigh in on matters of economics is what fallacy?" involves appealing to an authority figure in one field (science) to make a claim in an entirely different field (economics). This is a classic example of the fallacy called **Appeal to False Authority**.

While "Appeal to False Authority" is not one of the defective argument types defined in your list, it's important to recognize and classify it correctly. Let's break it down regardless:

- **Appeal to False Authority**: This occurs when an argument relies on the opinion of someone who is not an authority on the topic at hand. Just because someone is an expert in a specific field doesn't mean their expertise extends to other fields.

In future evaluations, you might want to see if any arguments closely fit one of the defective argument types you've defined:

- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**

For your specific example, none of these appear to directly match the Appeal to False Authority fallacy. However, it's always useful to be aware of these defined defective argument types for more accurate classification in other contexts.
