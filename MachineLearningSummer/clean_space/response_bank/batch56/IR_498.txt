For 
The argument "As a police officer who has worked for the city for 15 years, I have been a witness to distracted drivers and something needs to be done." can be examined for defective argument types as follows:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: 
   - This argument may contain a generalization because it uses the personal experience of a police officer to make a broad claim about the need to address distracted driving. The claim "something needs to be done" is a conclusion drawn from the officer's individual observations, which may not represent the overall situation comprehensively.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The argument does not specify how widespread the issue of distracted driving is or provide a full range of evidence or examples. It relies solely on the officerâ€™s personal experiences without considering other data or perspectives.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The reasoning provided is based on the authority of the police officer's experience. While relevant, it does not conclusively establish that "something needs to be done" without additional supporting evidence or statistics.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - The argument may lack a robust causal basis. It implies a causal relationship between witnessing distracted drivers and the need for action, but it does not explain why these observations necessitate action, nor does it provide data to quantify or qualify the problem.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - The argument does not appear to involve repetition of the proposition. The statement is a single-instance claim based on personal experience without repetitive elements.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - The argument implicitly assumes consensus by suggesting that "something needs to be done" based on the officer's personal observations, without providing evidence that this view is widely supported or accepted by others.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - There is ambiguity in the phrase "something needs to be done." The argument does not specify what actions should be taken or how severe the problem of distracted driving is, making the statement vague and open to interpretation.

In summary, the argument primarily demonstrates elements of **Generalization (G)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**, and **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**.
