The argument "Don't worry about eating fast food. After all, millions of Americans eat it every day." demonstrates a defective argument type known as Presumptuous Consensus, which we defined as **<FU>**.

**<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** This fallacy occurs when an argument claims validity based on a presumed agreement or behavior of a large number of people, without providing substantial evidence that the behavior is sound or the consensus is well-informed.

In this case, the argument is suggesting that fast food is not a cause for concern simply because many people consume it daily. This assertion does not address whether eating fast food is actually healthy or safe, making it a classic example of <FU>.
