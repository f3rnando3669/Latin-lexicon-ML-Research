For 
Applying the "<IDAA>" (Identify Defective Argument types and Analyze):

**Statement:** "I believe one should never deliberately hurt another person, thatâ€™s why I can never be a surgeon."

1. **EV (Evaluated Argument Types):**

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument makes a sweeping statement that one should never deliberately hurt another person without acknowledging the nuanced context, especially in professional domains like surgery where causing pain is a means to a beneficial end, such as saving or improving a life.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reasoning for not becoming a surgeon is based on an absolute principle of non-harm that does not take into account the moral and ethical justification for surgery. It fails to properly connect the ethical considerations involved in surgery to the broader principle.

2. **Analysis:**
   - **Defective Argument Type(s) Identified:** FE (Incomplete Enumeration), IR (Inconclusive Reason)
   
   The person is making an incomplete enumeration by not considering the context where causing short-term pain is for a greater good. There's also an inconclusive reason as the principle of not deliberately hurting someone doesn't straightforwardly lead to the conclusion of being unable to be a surgeon, where the intention is to heal and save lives, not to harm.

In summary, the argument provided is both an example of Incomplete Enumeration because it oversimplifies the ethical considerations, and Inconclusive Reason because the logical connection between the premise and the conclusion is not adequately justified.
