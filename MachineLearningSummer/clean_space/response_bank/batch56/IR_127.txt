The defective argument type for "Distracting your audience from the original issue by introducing an irrelevant topic" can be identified as an **Irrelevant Distraction and Argument Avoidance (IDAA)**. This fallacy occurs when someone shifts the focus of the conversation to an unrelated issue, thereby avoiding addressing the original point or argument. 

Here's an example of this in use:

**Original Argument:**
"Climate change is a significant threat that needs immediate government action."

**IDAA Response:**
"Instead of focusing on climate change, we should discuss how video games are affecting children's behavior."

In this case, the respondent is attempting to divert attention from the pressing issue of climate change to an unrelated topic. This tactic is used to avoid engaging with the original argument directly.
