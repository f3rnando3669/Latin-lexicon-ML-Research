For 
To apply the technique "<IDAA>" (Identify Defective Argumentation Attribute) to the given statement "The Bible is filled with stories of God's magic," you need to examine the statement for any potential flaws that match the defined defective argument types. Let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This might be applicable if the statement is making a broad claim based on limited examples from the Bible. However, it’s not explicitly clear from the statement alone if this is the case.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: If the statement claims “the Bible” as a whole is "filled" with such stories without considering other parts or types of content in the Bible, this could indeed be an incomplete enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The statement doesn’t provide reasoning but rather makes a simple claim. There isn't an argument whose reasoning could be judged inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This isn’t relevant here since the statement doesn't stipulate a causal basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This occurs when repetition of the same proposition is used incorrectly to make an argument. This isn't applicable here as there’s no repetition within the statement.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This would apply if the statement implied agreement or acceptance by all or most people without adequate basis. Since the statement is assertive without implying consensus, this doesn’t apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The term "God's magic" could be considered ambiguous. The phrase "magic" might be interpreted differently depending on one's perspective or religious belief. This suggests potential ambiguity.

### Conclusion:
Applying the "<IDAA>" technique reveals that the statement "The Bible is filled with stories of God's magic" may involve:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement doesn’t account for the full scope of content within the Bible.
2. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The term "God's magic" can be perceived in various ways, leading to ambiguity.

Thus, "<IDAA>" indicates that the statement demonstrates elements of both **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** and **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**.
