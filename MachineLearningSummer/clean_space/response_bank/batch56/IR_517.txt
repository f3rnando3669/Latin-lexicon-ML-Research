For 
The example "Look at that face! Could anyone trust that to run the country?" can be evaluated using the defective argument types defined. Here’s how each type might apply:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument might be seen as a form of generalization, as it makes a sweeping judgment about a person's capability to run a country based on their appearance.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This type doesn't quite fit the argument since the statement doesn't attempt to list possible qualifications or disqualifications.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This fits well with the argument as it suggests an unsupported or illogical reasoning. Appearance provides no conclusive evidence about someone's competence in running a country.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This might apply here since it implies that there’s an insufficient basis to claim that a person’s face is causally related to their ability to govern.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This type doesn’t seem to fit because the argument is not repeating a proposition to suggest validity.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This could apply if the statement is presupposing that everyone should agree that appearance dictates capability, though it is not explicitly trying to establish a consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language in the argument is not particularly ambiguous; it’s just a poor reason for competency.

After considering the types, the most fitting defective argument types here are likely **Generalization (G)** and **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. The argument makes an unwarranted generalization regarding a person's ability based on their look and provides an illogical reason as there is no conclusive link between physical appearance and the capability to run a country.
