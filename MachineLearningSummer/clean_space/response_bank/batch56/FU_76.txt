For 
Apologies, but I need a bit more clarification on what "IDAA" stands for in the context of evaluating the argument "Join the crowd and don’t get left behind!" 

Without this specific terminology, I would initially identify the argument type called <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus) based on the phrase provided. 

To apply this, let's dissect the argument:

### Argument: "Join the crowd and don’t get left behind!"

### Analysis:

- **Generalization (<G>):** This statement does not extensively classify all possible outcomes of not joining the crowd, so <G> does not apply.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The statement does not list possible scenarios or options, so <FE> is not applicable.
  
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reasoning is somewhat implied (you should join because others are doing it), but it is not concluded from concrete evidence.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** No specific causal relationship is implied or tested, so <WCB> does not apply.
  
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This is not repeating a proposition faultily, so <RR> does not apply.
  
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The argument assumes because the crowd is doing something, you should do it too without other validating reasons. This fits <FU> perfectly.
  
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** There is no ambiguous language requiring precise interpretation, making <DEP> not applicable here.

Hence, applying <FU> to the statement "Join the crowd and don’t get left behind!" identifies it as a **Presumptuous Consensus** argument.
