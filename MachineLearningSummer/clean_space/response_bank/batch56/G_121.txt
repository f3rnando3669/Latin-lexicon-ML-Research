For 
Sure, I will analyze the given statement using the defined defective argument types:

**Sentence:**
"After I listened to the first song of my favorite musician’s new vinyl record, I knew I’d hate the entire record, so I converted it into a Frisbee."

**Analysis:**
1. **Generalization (<G>):** The individual listened to just the first song and generalized that the entire album would be bad based on that single sample. This is a classic form of the Generalization fallacy.
   - **Label:** <G>

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** By judging the entire record based only on one song without listening to the rest of it, the person is making an Incomplete Enumeration of the album's content.
   - **Label:** <FE>

By applying the analysis to the given statement, it is clear that the argument is defective due to both Generalization and Incomplete Enumeration.

Therefore:
- The argument contains <G> (Generalization).
- The argument contains <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration).
