IDAA stands for "Identify Defective Argument Applicability and Analysis".

Applying IDAA to the conversation between Charlie and Bob:

1. **Identify Defective Argument**: Determine which defective argument types from the given list are applicable in Bob's response.

**Charlie**: "Fast food is filled with salt, fat, and added sugars. We need better regulation of the industry."

**Bob**: "That may be, but you’re such a hypocrite! I saw you devour a Triple-Baconator, super-sized fries, and 64 ounces of soda yesterday."

2. **Analysis**: Break down each part of Bob's response and see if it corresponds to any of the defective argument types.

Upon analysis, Bob is engaging in what is essentially an **Ad Hominem attack**, which is not explicitly listed in the defective arguments but is closely related to some types. Let's consider which listed defective argument types might capture the essence:

- **Ad Hominem**: Bob attacks Charlie’s character instead of addressing the argument about fast food regulation.

Given the context, the most relevant defective argument type might be **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, because Bob's response does not directly refute Charlie's argument about fast food regulation but rather diverts the focus to Charlie's personal behavior.

Here’s a summary of the applicability:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Bob’s attack on Charlie's personal eating habits does not address Charlie’s argument about the necessity for better regulation in the fast food industry.

In conclusion, Bob’s statement is a defective argument categorized as an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. It diverts attention from the argument presented by Charlie and fails to provide a counter-argument regarding the regulation of fast food.
