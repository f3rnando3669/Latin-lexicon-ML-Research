For 
<IDAA>, or Identify Defective Argument Application, involves pinpointing which of the predefined defective argument types applies to a given statement. Let's examine the statement "Everyone loves Rebecca, because she is so popular." in detail:

1. **Generalization (G):** This argument doesn't seem to be making an overly broad generalization from limited examples, so this type doesn't apply.
  
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This argument doesn't attempt to list all possible reasons or cases, focusing instead on a singular reason for her popularity.
  
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The argument "Everyone loves Rebecca, because she is so popular" is somewhat circular and doesn't provide an independent, substantive reason for her popularity. Popularity should be explained by factors that cause it, not by itself. Thus, this could be seen as an inconclusive reasoning.
  
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The argument suggests causality between popularity and being loved without adequate evidence. One could argue this type might apply since it assumes that her popularity is the sole reason without delving into other contributing factors.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The argument does not repeat the same proposition in a flawed way, so this type doesn't seem applicable.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The statement assumes an apparent consensual agreement ("Everyone loves Rebecca") without verifying if "everyone" actually does, thus fitting the nature of presumptuous consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The argument does not rely on vague or ambiguous language to make its case; hence this type does not seem to fit.

In summary, the argument "Everyone loves Rebecca, because she is so popular" best fits the **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** due to its circular reasoning and **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** due to its assumption of universal agreement.
