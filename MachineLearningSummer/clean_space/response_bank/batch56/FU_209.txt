Applying the concept of defective arguments to the given statement "I guess I should buy my 14 year old a new iPhone since everyone at her school has one," we can analyze it to identify which of the previously defined defective argument types might be relevant.

1. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - The statement assumes that just because "everyone" at her school has an iPhone, it is a necessary or rational choice for the speaker to also buy one. This relies on the presumption that the consensus is an adequate reason for the decision, which is not necessarily justified.

So, the defective argument type <FU> has been applied, indicating that the rationale for purchasing the iPhone is based on a presumptuous consensus without further critical evaluation.
