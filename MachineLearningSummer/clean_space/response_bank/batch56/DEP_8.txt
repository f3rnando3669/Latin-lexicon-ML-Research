Certainly! The process of identifying defective argument types involves evaluating the given statement to detect logical fallacies or weaknesses that undermine its validity.

Let's break down the statement: "It is said that we have a good understanding of our universe. Therefore, we know exactly how it began and when."

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument could be classified as a generalization because it jumps from a general claim ("we have a good understanding of our universe") to a specific conclusion ("we know exactly how it began and when"). The general understanding of the universe does not necessarily imply detailed knowledge of its origins.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument might be omitting other possibilities or complexities inherent in understanding the universe. By implying that a good understanding covers all aspects, it overlooks the specific limitations and nuances of scientific knowledge.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The claim made in the conclusion is not sufficiently supported by the premise. A good understanding of the universe in general terms does not automatically validate the detailed conclusion about the specific beginnings of the universe.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This could apply if the cause-and-effect relationship in the argument is weak or unsubstantiated. Saying that understanding the universe in general implies knowing its exact origins may be seen as assuming a causality that is not necessarily present.

5. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument implies a consensus ("It is said that we have a good understanding") and presumes this consensus leads to complete and exact knowledge about the universe's beginnings, which may not be justified.

6. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The term "good understanding" is ambiguous without further clarification. Does it mean comprehensive, partial, theoretical, practical, etc.? The ambiguity weakens the argument.

After applying the identification of defective argument types to the given statement, we can see that the argument possesses elements of Generalization (G), Inconclusive Reason (IR), and Ambiguous Language (DEP). These defects indicate that the conclusion drawn is not sufficiently supported by the premise due to overgeneralization, inconclusive reasoning, and ambiguous language.

So a more refined statement analysis using the argument defects would look like:

- **Generalization (G)**: The claim overextends the premise of having a good understanding of the universe to a specific assertion about precise knowledge of its origins.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The link between general understanding and specific detail (exact beginning and date) is weak.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The phrase "good understanding" is vague and undefined, leading to potential misinterpretation.

All these considered, the statement is flawed due to these identified defective argument types.
