For 
The fallacy that literally means "He did it himself" is the "ipse dixit" fallacy. "Ipse dixit" is a Latin phrase that translates to "he himself said it" or "he said it himself." This type of fallacy occurs when an assertion is deemed true purely based on the authority or statement of a particular person, without any supporting evidence or reasoning. It reflects a reliance on the supposed credibility of the speaker instead of providing logical or empirical support for the claim.
