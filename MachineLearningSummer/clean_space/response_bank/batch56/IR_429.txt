For 
<IDAA> stands for "Invalid Dislike of an Actor's Attributes."

In this case, the movie reviewer dislikes a Tom Cruise movie not because of its quality, direction, or other cinematic aspects, but solely because of the actor's religion. This is an unreasonable and irrelevant basis for forming an opinion about the movie. The reviewer is attempting to manipulate the audience's perception by directing them to focus on an external factor (the actor's religion) that has no bearing on the actual content or quality of the movie.

Thus, the argument here is defective because it is based on an **invalid dislike of an actor's attributes** rather than a legitimate critique of the movie itself.
