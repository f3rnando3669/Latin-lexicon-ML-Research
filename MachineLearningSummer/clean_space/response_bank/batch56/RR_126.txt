For 
<IDAA> typically refers to "Identify, Define, Analyze, Apply." Let's apply this method to the given argument:

1. **Identify**:
   - Argument: "President Bennett is an effective communicator, because he has a natural talent for speaking with people."
   - Position: President Bennett is an effective communicator.
   - Rationale: Because he has a natural talent for speaking with people.

2. **Define**:
   - Defective Argument Types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), Ambiguous Language (DEP).

3. **Analyze**:
   - The argument states that President Bennett is an effective communicator, using "natural talent for speaking with people" as the reason for this effectiveness.

4. **Apply**:
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The rationale provided ("natural talent for speaking with people") could be considered inconclusive because having a natural talent for speaking does not necessarily make someone an effective communicator. Effective communication often involves many other skills and attributes, such as listening, empathy, clarity, and the ability to adjust one's message to different audiences.
   - Additionally, one might argue that this falls under **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** as well, since the causal connection between having a natural talent for speaking and being an effective communicator is not sufficiently established; more evidence is needed to support this claim definitively.

Overall Application:
- **Defective Argument Type**: Inconclusive Reason (IR), with a potential case for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).
