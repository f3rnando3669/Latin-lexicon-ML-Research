For 
<IDAA> typically stands for Identifying Defective Argument Analysis. Given the definition of the defective argument types provided, let's analyze the argument, "If we allow euthanasia, the next thing you know, murder will be legal," to identify which defective argument type(s) it exhibits.

Upon examination, this statement appears to reflect a slippery slope fallacy, where allowing one action is presumed to inevitably lead to extreme and often unreasonable consequences without sufficient evidence connecting the two events directly. This analysis suggests that the argument:

- **Lacks sufficient causal basis** to conclusively state that allowing euthanasia will lead to the legalization of murder.
  - Thus, it can be labeled as **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.

So the identified defective argument type is:

<IDAA: WCB>
