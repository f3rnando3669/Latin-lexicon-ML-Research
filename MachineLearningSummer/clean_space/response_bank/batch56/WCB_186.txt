Harry Jaffa's argument appears to be primarily based on a presumed causal connection between the emergence of AIDS and the rise of the "Gay Rights" and "Gay Pride" movements. By making this claim, Jaffa seems to imply that the timing of AIDS diagnosis relative to the rise of these social movements is evidence of causation. This argument can be dissected as follows:

1. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: Jaffa's assertion that the emergence of AIDS is linked to the "Gay Rights" and "Gay Pride" movements is a classic example of insufficient causal basis. Simply because the diagnosis of AIDS comes after these movements doesn't prove that one caused the other. Correlation does not imply causation, and this relationship is not substantiated by any direct or scientific evidence presented in the argument.

2. **<G> Generalization**: The statement generalizes the origins of AIDS to being "entirely a disease of sodomites." This is a sweeping generalization that ignores the complexity and multifaceted nature of the AIDS epidemic, which affects diverse populations worldwide, not just the homosexual community.

3. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The fact that the first case of AIDS was diagnosed a little over a decade after these movements began is presented as a key point in the argument. However, this is an inconclusive reason because it doesn't adequately support the conclusion that the rise of these movements caused the epidemic.

4. **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: The argument might suggest or rely on an assumption that there is a consensus around the purported causal link between the gay rights movements and the AIDS epidemic. However, such a consensus does not exist, especially within the scientific and medical communities.

5. **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**: The term "sodomites" is loaded and ambiguous, carrying a historical and pejorative connotation that adds bias to the argument rather than providing clear, objective terms for discussion. Additionally, the phrase "can hardly be coincidental" is vague and does not offer concrete evidence or logic to support the claimed lack of coincidence.

By breaking down Harry Jaffa's argument using these defective argument types, it becomes clear that the assertion is flawed and does not hold up under scrutiny.
