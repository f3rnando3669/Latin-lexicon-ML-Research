For 
<IDAA> Argument Type:
"Irrelevant Distraction from Actual Argument" (IDAA) is a defective argument type that focuses on irrelevant details that distract from the actual point being discussed.

Example application:
"Discoveries from Archimedes should be dismissed because he made them in a bathtub and not a proper university laboratory."

This is an example of <IDAA> because it distracts from the actual scientific merit of Archimedes' discoveries by focusing on the irrelevant detail of where the discoveries were made, rather than evaluating the validity and significance of the discoveries themselves.
