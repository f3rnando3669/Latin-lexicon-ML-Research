For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application.

Let's break down the argument: "David is so wrong about Luna's work ethic. David is just an egotistical jerk with a God complex, what does he know?"

The argument can be analyzed as follows:

The first part of the statement claims that "David is so wrong about Luna's work ethic," without providing any evidence or reasoning for why David's opinion is wrong.

The second part of the statement attacks David's character by calling him "an egotistical jerk with a God complex," which diverts attention away from the actual issue at hand (Luna's work ethic).

This form of argumentation exemplifies the **ad hominem** fallacy, where the attack is on the person rather than their argument or the merits of their position.

Applying the defective argument types, the statement primarily falls under the category of **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** because it does not provide any substantive evidence or reasoning regarding Luna's work ethic but instead relies on discrediting David's character. This tactic is a diversionary technique meant to undermine David's credibility without addressing the actual topic.

So, the application of <IDAA> to the statement "David is so wrong about Luna's work ethic. David is just an egotistical jerk with a God complex, what does he know?" is categorized as:

<IR> - **Inconclusive Reason**.
