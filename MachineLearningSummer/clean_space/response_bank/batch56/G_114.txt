For 
Certainly! To apply the <IDAA> (Identification of Defective Argument Types) to the examples given:

1. For the argument "Each brick in that building weighs less than a pound. Therefore, the building weighs less than a pound.":

   - **Defective Argument Type Applied**: <G> (Generalization)
   - **Explanation**: The argument commits the fallacy of over-generalizing from the properties of individual components to the whole. Just because each brick is less than a pound does not mean the collective whole (the building) weighs less than a pound. This represents a faulty generalization based on the parts' attributes.

2. For the argument "Hydrogen is not wet. Oxygen is not wet. Therefore, water (H2O) is not wet.":

   - **Defective Argument Type Applied**: <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)
   - **Explanation**: The argument erroneously attempts to conclude a property about a compound based on properties of its individual elements without considering the chemical nature that alters their properties when combined. This is incomplete enumeration where the argument incorrectly assumes the whole (H2O) has properties solely derived from its separate parts (H and O) without accounting for their interaction in combination.

By applying <IDAA>, we've identified the defective argument types for the two provided examples as <G> for Generalization and <FE> for Incomplete Enumeration.
