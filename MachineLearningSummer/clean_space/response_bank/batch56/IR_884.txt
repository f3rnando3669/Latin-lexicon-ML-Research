For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identification of Defective Argument Types) to the statement "People have believed that fish is 'brain food' for decades, so I don't believe the FDA when they claim that eating fish does not enhance the intellect," we need to identify the specific defective argument types present in the statement.

**<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:**
The statement relies on the repetition of a belief ("fish is 'brain food'") that has been held for decades but does not provide new evidence to support this claim. The repetition of the belief does not inherently make it true.

**<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:**
The argument assumes that because a belief has been held by many people over time, it must be true. This type of argument relies on the presumed consensus of the population, rather than evidence or scientific data.

**<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:**
The statement suggests a causal relationship between eating fish and enhanced intellect based on tradition and belief, rather than on scientific evidence provided by a reputable authority (the FDA). There is insufficient causal evidence to support the claim that eating fish actually enhances intellect.

In conclusion, the statement "People have believed that fish is 'brain food' for decades, so I don't believe the FDA when they claim that eating fish does not enhance the intellect" contains the following defective argument types:
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**
