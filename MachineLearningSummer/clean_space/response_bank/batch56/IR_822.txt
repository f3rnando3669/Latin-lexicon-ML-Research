In order to apply the Defective Argument Analysis Annotation (IDAA) to the statement "This is why a woman shouldn’t do a man's job," we need to identify and categorize the defective arguments present in this statement.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement implies a broad and unjust conclusion about all women and all jobs that are considered "man's jobs" without considering individual capabilities, contexts, or evidence to support such a generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement does not provide specific reasons or evidence for why a woman should not do the job, simply positing it as a truth without exhaustive analysis of potential reasons.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Any reason provided in the statement is not substantial or sufficient to definitively conclude that women are unsuited for those jobs; thus, it's an inconclusive argument.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The statement assumes there is a causal relationship between being a woman and the inability to perform a man's job without providing adequate causal evidence.

5. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The statement implies an assumed and unjust consensus that such opinions are universally accepted or self-evident, without any proof that a broad consensus exists.

6. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The phrase "man's job" is ambiguous and undefined. It can mean different things in different contexts, leading to a lack of clarity in the argument.

Applying these annotations:

"This is why a woman shouldn’t do a man's job"
- Generalization <G>: This statement makes an unjustified general assumption about all women and "man's jobs."
- Incomplete Enumeration <FE>: The statement fails to consider all potential reasons or evidence, providing none here.
- Inconclusive Reason <IR>: The reasoning (if any is implied) is insufficient to conclude that women should not do certain jobs.
- Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>: The assumed causal link between being a woman and not being able to do a man's job is not substantiated.
- Presumptuous Consensus <FU>: The statement presumes a general agreement or stereotype without supporting evidence.
- Ambiguous Language <DEP>: The term "man's job" is not clearly defined and is contextually ambiguous.

By breaking down the statement with these defective argument types, we can see the various ways it fails to present a robust and valid argument.
