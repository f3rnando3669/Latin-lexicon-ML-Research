For 
When applying <IDAA>, which appears to suggest an "Identification and Analysis of Argumentation," the statement "If you never gave money to charity, then you must be a greedy millionaire" can be analyzed for potential defects in its argumentation.

### Analysis:
The statement is making a conditional claim that correlates the act of not giving money to charity with being a greedy millionaire.

### Potential Defective Argument Types Identified:
1. **Generalization (<G>):** The statement could be seen as an overgeneralization by implying that all individuals who do not give to charity are greedy millionaires. This is a broad and unsupportable generalization that fails to account for numerous other reasons someone might not donate money to charity.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The statement might be displaying incomplete enumeration because it doesn't consider all the possible reasons someone might not give to charity. There are plenty of reasons apart from greed, such as financial hardship, different charitable choices (like donating time instead of money), or simply personal preference.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason given (not giving money to charity) does not conclusively lead to the conclusion (being a greedy millionaire). The premises are not strong enough to reach such a definitive conclusion.

### Conclusion:
The statement "If you never gave money to charity, then you must be a greedy millionaire" can primarily be identified as a **Generalization (<G>)**. It assumes that all people who do not give charity fall into the category of being greedy millionaires, overlooking other possibilities and presenting an unsupported broad claim. It also has characteristics of **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** and **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** but, most prominently, it is a Generalization.
