For 
<IDAA> stands for Identify Defective Argument Types Applied.

Let's analyze the statement "One cigarette will lead youth to addiction" and apply the defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This could be seen as a hasty generalization, as it suggests that a single instance (one cigarette) will universally lead to a specific outcome (addiction) for all youth, without sufficient evidence to support such a broad claim.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement doesn't consider other factors or scenarios that might influence whether a youth becomes addicted, such as genetic predisposition, peer influence, or frequency of smoking.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasoning provided in the statement is not conclusive. While smoking a cigarette might increase the risk of addiction, it does not necessarily follow that one cigarette alone will definitively lead to addiction in every case.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The statement provides an insufficient causal basis, as it does not explain how one cigarette could definitively lead to addiction. It fails to account for the complexities of addiction and the various contributing factors.

5. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The use of the word "addiction" could be considered ambiguous without a clear definition. Addiction could mean different levels of dependency, and the statement does not specify what level of addiction is being referred to.

In summary, the statement "One cigarette will lead youth to addiction" can be identified as having the defective argument types of Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), and Ambiguous Language (<DEP>).
