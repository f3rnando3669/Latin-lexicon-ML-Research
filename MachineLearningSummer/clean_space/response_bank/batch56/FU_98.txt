For 
The statement "See the movie that everybody's talking about" appears to involve a defective argument type known as <FU>, or Presumptuous Consensus. 

This is because the statement is attempting to persuade the listener to see the movie based on the assumption that widespread discussion or consensus is an indicator of the movie's quality or value, without providing actual evidence or reasoning to support why the movie is worth watching.

Hence, applying <IDAA> (identifying defective argument types) to the statement, we get:

"See the movie that everybody's talking about" <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)
