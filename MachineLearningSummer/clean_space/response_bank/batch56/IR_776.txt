For 
The argument provided is:
"Being mean to others is wrong.
Therefore, it cannot possibly be part of our nature."

To analyze this using the defined defective argument types, let's break down the reasoning in the argument:

1. **Claim:** "Being mean to others is wrong."
2. **Conclusion:** "It cannot possibly be part of our nature."

The argument seems to be assuming that because something is morally wrong, it cannot be a natural human trait. This type of reasoning involves a moral assertion leading directly to a conclusion about human nature, which does not necessarily follow logically. 

This argument can be identified as a defective argument type called **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, because the assertion that something is morally wrong does not logically imply that it cannot be part of human nature. The reasoning used does not provide conclusive support for the conclusion. 

Hence, applying <IDAA>:

**<IR>:** "Being mean to others is wrong.
Therefore, it cannot possibly be part of our nature."
