For 
Certainly! Let's reanalyze the given argument by identifying the potentially defective reasoning type used. The argument you presented is: 

"You can either start using plastic straws or continue killing ocean life with plastic pollution."

This argument type is reminiscent of a false dichotomy or a false dilemma, where it presents two options as the only possible choices, ignoring other alternatives that could mitigate plastic pollution without resorting to using plastic straws. For instance, using metal, paper, or no straws at all could be viable alternatives. 

Therefore, the defective argument type here is not one of the types you provided, but it aligns with a logical fallacy known as a false dilemma.

However, if we need to pin down the closest defective argument type from the list provided, it might loosely fall under <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration), since it incorrectly lists an incomplete set of options. 

So, the argument could be annotated as:
```
"You can either start using plastic straws or continue killing ocean life with plastic pollution." <FE>
```

But be aware that the most precise classification for this particular argument would be the logical fallacy of a false dilemma.
