For 
To accurately apply the definitions of defect arguments to the statement "There aren't enough parking spaces on campus because there are too many cars," we need to analyze the reasoning within the argument. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

- The main claim is "There aren't enough parking spaces on campus."
- The supporting reason is "because there are too many cars."

Let's specify which defective argument types might apply:

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - This suggests that the reasoning provided in the argument is insufficient to establish the stated cause-effect relationship.
   - Applying this: The assertion that "there are too many cars" may not adequately explain why there aren't enough parking spaces, as it fails to consider other potential causes like inefficient use of available space, poor campus planning, or even temporary surges in car numbers.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - This involves presenting a list or collection of causes without considering all relevant possibilities.
   - Applying this: The argument only mentions "too many cars" as the cause of the parking shortage, without enumerating other possible contributing factors, fitting an incomplete enumeration defect.

Thus, the statement "There aren't enough parking spaces on campus because there are too many cars" might most fittingly be tagged with the following defective argument types:
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**

This covers both the potentially weak causal connection and the failure to explore other potential reasons for the problem.
