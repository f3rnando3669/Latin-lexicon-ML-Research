For 
The argument type you are detailing in "You appealed to popularity or the fact that many people do something as an attempted form of validation" can be defined as:

- **<IDAA> Appeal to Popularity**: This is a fallacious argument where the argument bases its validity on the popularity of an idea or practice. It suggests that because many people believe or do something, it must be true or right.

The example you provided is a textbook case of an Appeal to Popularity, also known as an **ad populum** fallacy. This argument assumes that the widespread acceptance or practice of something automatically lends it credibility, without any further evidence or reasoning to back it up.

So applying **<IDAA>** to the statement "You appealed to popularity or the fact that many people do something as an attempted form of validation," you would label this argument as an **<IDAA> Appeal to Popularity**.
