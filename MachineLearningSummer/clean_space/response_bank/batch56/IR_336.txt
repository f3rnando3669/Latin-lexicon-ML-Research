For 
The argument provided is: "I knew him in high school and he almost flunked out. He can't be a good choice for mayor."

To apply the classifications of defective arguments:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument could be seen as a <G> because it makes a broad conclusion about someone's qualifications for being a mayor based on a specific and isolated past event (almost flunking out of high school).

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This argument is also an <FE>, as it makes a judgement based on limited data without considering other relevant factors that could determine someone's suitability for being mayor.

Therefore, the classification IDs that apply are <G> and <FE>. 

The argument suffers from generalizing the candidate's entire capability based on a singular aspect of their past and failing to account for other important qualifications or achievements they might have obtained since high school.
