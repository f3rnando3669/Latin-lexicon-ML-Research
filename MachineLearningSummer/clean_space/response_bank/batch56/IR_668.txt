For 
The argument "A real estate ad shows a happy family moving in to the home of their dreams." can be classified as a defective argument type under <IDAA>:

**Implication:**
The ad implies that moving into the home being advertised will bring happiness to a family, similar to the one depicted.

The primary type of defect in this argument is:

**Defective Argument Type - Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
The argument relies on the assumption that everyone will agree with the portrayal of happiness. It assumes that the visual representation of the happy family is sufficient to persuade potential buyers of the associated benefits, without substantiating why the home itself is responsible for such happiness.

Additionally, another defect found here is:

**Defective Argument Type - Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
The term "home of their dreams" is quite ambiguous. It can mean different things to different people, and the ad capitalizes on this vagueness without providing solid reasons why the specific home meets those varied expectations.

In summary, the argument misleads the audience by projecting a universal desire and dream fulfillment through the imagery and ambiguous terms => <FU> + <DEP>.
