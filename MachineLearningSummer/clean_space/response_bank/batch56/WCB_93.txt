To analyze the argument "I saw John texting yesterday, and then he got in his car and drove away; he must have crashed because he was texting. Therefore, cell phones should be banned." by identifying defective argument types, <IDAA>, we can break it down:

1. **Specific Incident without Broader Evidence:** The argument uses a single incident (John was seen texting and then drove away, leading to an assumption of a crash) to make a general claim (cell phones should be banned).

   **Defective Argument Type:** <G> Generalization – This is a hasty generalization, drawing a broad conclusion from a single example without sufficient evidence.

2. **Lack of Causal Evidence:** The conclusion that John must have crashed because he was texting is drawn without any direct evidence of a crash or proof that texting was the cause.

   **Defective Argument Type:** <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis – Asserts a cause-and-effect relationship without sufficient causal evidence.

3. **No Enumeration of Relevant Cases:** The argument doesn’t consider or discuss other relevant cases or incidents that could provide comprehensive evidence for the conclusion.

   **Defective Argument Type:** <FE> Incomplete Enumeration – The argument does not provide a thorough examination of all relevant instances where texting while driving may not have led to crashes, thus omitting a complete analysis.

4. **Jump to a Consensus without Support:** The conclusion that cell phones should be banned is a significant policy recommendation based on an unsubstantiated premise.

   **Defective Argument Type:** <FU> Presumptuous Consensus – This implies a broader consensus or policy action without adequate backing or widespread agreement.

Applying <IDAA> reveals multiple defective argument types (primarily <G>, <WCB>, <FE>, and <FU>) in this reasoning, indicating its lack of sufficient grounding and evidence to support the conclusion proposed.
