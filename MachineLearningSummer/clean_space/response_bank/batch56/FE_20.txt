For 
The given statement, "Either you are with me or you are against me," can be analyzed using the category you described as <IDAA>, although the acronym <IDAA> itself is not defined in the information provided. However, based on the nature of the argument, it resembles a logical fallacy known as a "false dilemma" or "false dichotomy."

A false dilemma occurs when only two options are presented as the only possibilities when, in reality, there may be other alternatives. In this case, the statement implies that there are only two mutually exclusive options: you are either completely supportive or completely opposed, ignoring the possibility of a middle ground or more nuanced positions.

So, applying <IDAA> to the statement "Either you are with me or you are against me" involves understanding that it is a defective argument due to the false dichotomy it presents. If <IDAA> stands for "Identifying Defective Argument Application," you would identify the statement as containing a generalization fallacy or a false dichotomy, noting that it oversimplifies the range of possible positions.

Let's clarify:

- **Statement:** "Either you are with me or you are against me."
- **Defective Argument Type:** Generalization (similar to the false dilemma in traditional logical fallacies)

**Explanation:** This argument wrongly presents only two possible stances when more nuanced positions likely exist. It forces an either/or choice without acknowledging the complexity of the issue.
