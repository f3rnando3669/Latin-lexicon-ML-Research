For 
To apply the defective argument identification acronym <IDAA> (Identify, Describe, Analyze, and Assess), we would proceed as follows:

### Identify
Identify the possible defective argument types in the statement: "The new vice president has never gone to public school, so he can never connect to the middle and lower class."

### Describe
Describe each identified defective argument type:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**
   - The statement seems to make a broad generalization about the vice president's ability to connect with certain socio-economic classes based solely on his educational background. 

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
   - It may overlook other important factors that contribute to someone's ability to connect with the middle and lower class, such as professional experience, personal relationships, empathy, or other aspects of their background.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
   - The reasoning that not attending public school directly leads to an inability to connect with the middle and lower classes appears inconclusive, as it relies on insufficient evidence.

### Analyze
Analyze how each described defective argument applies to the initial statement:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**
   - The argument infers that just because one specific aspect of the vice president's background (his schooling) is not aligned with that of the majority, he wholly lacks the ability to understand or connect with individuals from differing backgrounds. This is an overgeneralization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
   - By focusing solely on the vice president's schooling, the argument misses other critical factors that could influence his ability to connect with the middle and lower class. Important considerations like life experiences, personal values, and professional endeavors are ignored.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
   - The conclusion drawn from the premise (never attended public school) doesn't logically follow. The reasoning connection between education and the ability to connect with people is unsupported and therefore inconclusive.

### Assess
Assess the overall defective arguments in the statement:

The statement "The new vice president has never gone to public school, so he can never connect to the middle and lower class" is found to be primarily flawed due to:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: The conclusion drawn is overly broad and doesn't account for other ways in which a person might connect with various socio-economic classes.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement fails to consider comprehensive factors beyond just educational background.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The logic connecting the premise to the conclusion is weak and unsupported by concrete evidence.

Thus, the argument made in the statement is defective predominantly due to these identified issues.
