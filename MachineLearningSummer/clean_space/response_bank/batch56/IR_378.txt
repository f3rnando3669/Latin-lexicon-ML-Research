For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application. Let's examine the provided text to identify any defective arguments using the definitions provided:

### Text:
"In 2011, Christian broadcaster, Harold Camping, (once again) predicted the end of the world via Jesus, and managed to get many Christians to join his alarmist campaign. During this time, and especially after the Armageddon date had passed, many Christian groups publicly declared that Camping is not a 'true Christian'. On a personal note, I think Camping was and is as much of a Christian as any other self-proclaimed Christian and religious/political/ethical beliefs aside, I give him credit for having the cojones to make a falsifiable claim about his religious beliefs."

### Analysis:
1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The phrase "many Christians to join his alarmist campaign" could be seen as a generalization. It implies that a significant number of Christians followed Camping without providing concrete evidence for how many Christians actually joined him.
  
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The statement "many Christian groups publicly declared that Camping is not a 'true Christian'" might lack a complete list of those groups and thus can be considered an incomplete enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The personal note "I think Camping was and is as much of a Christian as any other self-proclaimed Christian..." lacks a conclusive reason. The statement relies on the author's personal opinion without providing evidence or logical reasoning to support this view.
  
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - There doesn't appear to be an insufficient causal basis argument directly present in the provided text. The author is not establishing a causal link that is insufficient in this context directly.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - The text does not seem to repetitively assert a proposition without proof.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - By stating "many Christian groups publicly declared," there is an assumption of a widespread consensus without providing evidence that this consensus is representative of the larger Christian community. This may qualify as a presumptuous consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - The term "true Christian" is ambiguous as it can be interpreted in multiple ways and lacks a clear, universally accepted definition. This ambiguity can lead to misunderstandings regarding what qualifies someone as a "true Christian."

### Application Summary:
Here is the identification of defective arguments applied to the text:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: "many Christians to join his alarmist campaign"
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: "many Christian groups publicly declared that Camping is not a 'true Christian'"
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: "I think Camping was and is as much of a Christian as any other self-proclaimed Christian..."
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: "many Christian groups publicly declared"
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: "true Christian"

By applying <IDAA>, we can see that the text contains several defective arguments, including <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <FU>, and <DEP>.
