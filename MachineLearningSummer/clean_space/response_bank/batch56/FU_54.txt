For 
It looks like there is a minor inconsistency in the labeling "^<IDAA>^" that you've mentioned. There are no definitions provided for an <IDAA> argument type. However, since you're defining various defective argument types, I'll proceed under the assumption that <IDAA> might be a type related to incorrect assumptions, perhaps akin to <AU> (Assuming Unproven).

Given the list of defective arguments types provided, I'll attempt to evaluate ", that it must be true" through the lens of these types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument type wouldn't apply directly to the statement ", that it must be true," as generalization refers to making broad claims from a limited set of evidence, and the statement doesnâ€™t provide a broad claim on its own.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This involves listing some causes or consequences but not all, and the statement ", that it must be true," is too vague to fall into this category without additional enumeration context.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This could potentially apply if the argument preceding ", that it must be true" didn't provide enough evidence to justify concluding that it must be true.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: If the statement ", that it must be true" is based on a presumed cause that isn't sufficiently justified, WCB would be a possible label.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This would apply if the truth of the statement was being asserted repeatedly without any additional evidence or reasoning.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This deals with assuming a consensus exists where there is none. If the statement ", that it must be true" implies that everyone agrees on this truth without evidence, FU might apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This would apply if the phrase ", that it must be true" were relying on ambiguous language that could be interpreted in multiple ways. 

Without more context, the statement ", that it must be true" could most closely be associated with **IR** (Inconclusive Reason) if it follows an argument that doesn't sufficiently support the necessity of the truth claim, or **FU** if it implies an unjustified consensus. 

So, feeling that IDAA is likely intended to illustrate the application of discussing the defective nature of the argument, you might say:

Applying **IR** or **FU** to ", that it must be true":

- **IR**: It is an inconclusive reason because the preceding argument does not provide sufficient evidence to definitively state that the conclusion must be true.
- **FU**: It is a presumptuous consensus if it misleadingly implies that there is a universal agreement on the truth of the statement without adequate evidence.

In conclusion, ", that it must be true" potentially could be labeled as **IR** or **FU**, depending on the context in which it is used and the reasoning (or lack thereof) that supports it.
