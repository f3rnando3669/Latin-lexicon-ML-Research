Sure, let's apply the Identified Defective Argument Analysis (IDAA) to the statement "All eighteen-year-olds have the right to vote because it's legal for them to vote."

1. **Statement**: "All eighteen-year-olds have the right to vote because it's legal for them to vote."

2. **Defective Argument Types**:

   - **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: The statement essentially repeats the same idea in different words. The assertion that eighteen-year-olds have the right to vote is justified by stating that it is legal for them to vote, which is a restatement of the original claim without providing any additional substantive reasoning or evidence.

By applying IDAA, we identify that the argument is defective primarily due to **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**. The reasoning fails to move beyond a tautological statement and does not offer a deeper, distinct rationale or evidence supporting the initial claim.
