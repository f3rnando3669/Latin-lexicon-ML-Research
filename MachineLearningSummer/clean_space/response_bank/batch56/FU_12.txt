For 
To apply Identification of Defective Argument Application (<IDAA>) to the statement: "An opinion article in a campus newspaper states that in an all-campus survey 95% of students think that tuition should be lowered and therefore tuition should be lowered immediately," we need to look for potential defective arguments according to the defined types.

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument relies solely on the survey results without providing other sufficient supporting reasons or addressing potential counterarguments and considerations, such as the financial feasibility or the impact on the quality of education. Merely stating that 95% of students want something does not encompass the full spectrum of factors involved in such a decision.
  
2. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument assumes that the consensus (95% of students) is sufficient grounds for immediate action without further deliberation. It bypasses the complexity of the situation, such as budget constraints, the impact on university operations, and the need for balanced decision-making among various stakeholders, not just the surveyed students.
  
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The leap from the survey's findings to the immediate conclusion that tuition should be lowered lacks intermediate reasoning. It does not address how the survey's opinion translates into implementation feasibility or why the surveyed opinion alone justifies immediate action.
  
By applying <IDAA>, we identify that the argument presented in the statement can be classified as:
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**

These classifications help in understanding the potential flaws in the argument made by the opinion article.
