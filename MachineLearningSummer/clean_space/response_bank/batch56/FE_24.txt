For 
<IDAA> stands for "Identify Defective Argument Application."

Let's break down the argument: "I didn’t see you at the charity fundraiser today. I guess you are not a good person after all."

This argument can be assessed for any of the defined defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument generalizes that not attending a specific event (the charity fundraiser) implies that someone is not a good person. It unfairly extrapolates a single instance to make a broad conclusion about someone's character.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This argument may also be considered as an incomplete enumeration because it fails to consider other actions or events that could demonstrate that the person is good. It assumes that attending this one event is an exhaustive test of one's goodness.

Given the defective argument types defined, the most fitting label for this argument is:

<IDAA>: <G> for Generalization and <FE> for Incomplete Enumeration.

So, the argument "I didn’t see you at the charity fundraiser today. I guess you are not a good person after all." is identified as a defective argument of type Generalization (<G>) and Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>).
