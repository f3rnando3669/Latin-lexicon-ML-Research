The argument presented is:
"How do I know the adult film industry is the third largest industry in the United States? Derek Shlongmiester, the adult film star of over 50 years, said it was. That's how I know."

This type of argument can be characterized as <IDAA> (Invalid Deceptive Argumentation Attribution). Let's identify the primary defective arguments at play here:

1. **Appeal to Authority**: The argument relies on the authority of Derek Shlongmiester without providing additional evidence or data to back up the claim. Just because someone, even an experienced individual in the industry, makes a claim does not make it true.

    - This could be classified as <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) because the evidence provided (testimony of an authority figure) is not sufficient to substantiate the broad claim being made.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration**: The argument asserts a fact about the adult film industry without presenting the full scope of industries being compared or data supporting the ranking assertion.

    - This falls under <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration) as it lacks a comprehensive comparison or statistical evidence.

3. **Presumptuous Consensus**: The argument implicitly assumes that because an authority figure claims it, it should be accepted by others without question.

    - This can be seen as <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus) due to the presumption that the authority's statement establishes a consensus.

Based on these identifications, we can conclude that the argument is flawed due to its reliance on a potentially unverified authority, lack of comprehensive evidence, and the presumptuous assumption that the claim should be accepted without proper substantiation.
