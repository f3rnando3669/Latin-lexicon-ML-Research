The argument presented can be critically analyzed for potential defective argument types. Let’s apply each relevant defective argument type one by one to identify which ones, if any, apply to the argument:

1. **<G> Generalization:**
   - This would apply if the argument drew a broad conclusion based on a small, non-representative sample. In this case, Barbara concludes that the office is haunted based on a single incident reported by the cleaning crew. This fits the criteria for a generalization because it bases a broad claim (the office is haunted) on very limited evidence (one incident reported).

2. **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:**
   - This applies when not all relevant evidence is considered, causing an incomplete consideration of the possibilities. Here, Barbara does not consider alternative explanations for the strange noise, such as equipment malfunction, wind, or other natural causes. Hence, this argument is also an example of incomplete enumeration.

3. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:**
   - This occurs when the reasons given do not sufficiently support the conclusion. In this scenario, the cleaning crew’s report of a noise and the inability to disprove it’s a ghost are not sufficient reasons to conclusively claim the office is haunted. This makes the argument an example of inconclusive reason.

4. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:**
   - This argues that there is a lack of causal evidence to support the claim. Here, the "evidence" provided (hearing a noise) is insufficient to establish a causal link to the office being haunted by ghosts. Thus, it fits as an insufficient causal basis as well.

5. **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:**
   - This occurs when a proposition is repeated without providing additional evidence. The argument does not continuously reiterate the same proposition without additional evidence, so this one does not seem to apply.

6. **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:**
   - This would apply if the argument falsely assumed that consensus or agreement implies truth. This argument does not seem to rely on the notion of consensus or general agreement; thus, this type does not apply.

7. **<DEP> Ambiguous Language:**
   - This occurs when language is used ambiguously to mislead or confuse. The language used in the argument here does not seem ambiguous or intended to mislead, so this doesn’t apply.

In summary, the defective argument types that apply to the statement "Barbara believes the marketing agency's office is haunted. The cleaning crew once said they heard an other-worldly noise late at night. Since no one could prove that it wasn't a ghost, the office must be haunted." are:

1. **<G> Generalization**
2. **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**
3. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**
4. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**
