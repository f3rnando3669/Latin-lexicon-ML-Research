For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Applications. Let's analyze the provided statement step-by-step and identify any instances of defective arguments.

Statement: "I have no intention of stopping the use of somatostatin on patients suffering from acute pancreatitis. I consider it to be a very reasonable choice. After all, it has been standard practice in our department for many years and we’ve been quite satisfied with the results we’ve had."

1. **"I have no intention of stopping the use of somatostatin on patients suffering from acute pancreatitis."**
   - This part of the statement expresses the speaker's determination or personal commitment without providing any argument for or against the use of somatostatin.

2. **"I consider it to be a very reasonable choice."**
   - This is a subjective assessment and doesn’t provide evidence or reasoning to support why it is reasonable.

3. **"After all, it has been standard practice in our department for many years and we’ve been quite satisfied with the results we’ve had."**
   - This part provides a reason for continuing the use of somatostatin, but we need to assess the strength and validity of this reason.

### Identified Defective Arguments:

- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**:
  - The argument implies that because it has been practiced for many years and they’ve been satisfied, it must be a reasonable choice. This repetition does not provide new evidence or reasoning but restates satisfaction as justification.
  
- **<G> Generalization**:
  - The satisfaction of the department and the historical use are generalized as sufficient reasons for the continued use. This ignores potential new evidence, advances in medical research, or differing experiences in other departments or studies.
  
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**:
  - The reason given ("we’ve been quite satisfied with the results we’ve had") is inconclusive because it assumes that past satisfaction equates to the best current practice without considering other factors or new evidence.
  
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**:
  - The speaker implies that because somatostatin has been used and they are satisfied, it is the causative justification for continuing its use. This does not adequately address whether somatostatin is the best or most effective treatment, as satisfaction and historical use do not necessarily indicate efficacy.
  
In summary, the key defective arguments identified are <RR>, <G>, <IR>, and <WCB>. These indicate reliance on tradition and satisfaction without substantial evidence or consideration of current best practices or alternative treatments.
