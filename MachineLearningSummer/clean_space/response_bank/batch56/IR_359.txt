For 
The type <IDAA> refers to a defective argument called "Appeal to Authority," which involves justifying support for a position by citing an esteemed or well-known figure who supports it, regardless of whether the authority is relevant to the issue at hand. This type of argument is often fallacious because it relies on the reputation of the figure rather than on substantive evidence or reasoning.

For example:

"To justify support for a position by citing an esteemed or well-known figure who supports it.

Para justificar el apoyo a una posici√≥n citando a una figura estimada o conocida que lo apoya."

Applying <IDAA> would mean highlighting that this argument is an Appeal to Authority:

"This argument is a case of <IDAA> because it relies on the endorsement of a well-known figure rather than presenting concrete evidence or logical reasoning to justify the position."
