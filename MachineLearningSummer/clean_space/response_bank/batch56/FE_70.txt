Certainly! To apply the defective argument types to the statement provided, we need to identify which one fits best based on the nature of the reasoning or evidence presented. Given the statement:

"Because recent polling indicates that no voters in the county are strongly in favor of the proposed amendment, we can expect strong opposition to the amendment when it is voted on next month."

Let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This involves making broad claims based on limited evidence. The statement might not be a generalization since it focuses on specific polling data which, while potentially limited, is not necessarily generalized incorrectly if the entire county was considered in the poll.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This occurs when not all relevant cases are considered. If the polling only included a specific subset of the population and did not cover the entire electorate, this could be a possibility. However, if the polling is comprehensive, this may not apply.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This faulty argument involves conclusions that do not necessarily follow from the premises. The statement, "we can expect strong opposition to the amendment," might suggest an opposition without enough evidence to conclusively predict it.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This means there is not enough evidence to establish a cause-and-effect relationship. If the polling data is interpreted to causally imply strong opposition based solely on the absence of strong favor, it might lack sufficient causal basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This means an assertion is repeated without additional supporting evidence. The statement doesn’t exhibit repetition of the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This would involve assuming all individuals agree when they might not. It doesn't appear this statement assumes a consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This involves the use of language that can be interpreted in multiple ways, leading to confusion. The provided statement is fairly clear and doesn’t seem to contain significant ambiguity.

Given these considerations, the statement most likely fits under **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** because it generalizes based on polling data that may not comprehensively cover all relevant voters. The assertion that there will be "strong opposition" might also fit under **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** due to the lack of sufficient evidence to reach such a definitive conclusion about the future voter behavior. Choosing between these two can be context-dependent, but for the purpose of this exercise, let's apply **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**.

So the final labeling would be:

**Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**

Because the expectation of strong opposition to the amendment is derived from potentially incomplete polling data that might not fully represent the entire voting population.
