For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "If you hadn't vandalized that car, don't you think things would have gone better for you?" we must analyze whether this statement falls under any of the predefined defective argument types. Here's the detailed analysis:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** This type involves drawing a broad conclusion from a limited set of instances. The statement does not seem to be making a broad conclusion based on limited evidence, so this does not apply.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This type involves drawing conclusions without considering all relevant possibilities. The statement presupposes that not vandalizing the car is the only factor that could have led to a better outcome but does not enumerate all relevant possibilities. Therefore, this defective argument type could apply.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This type involves offering a reason that doesnâ€™t logically lead to the conclusion. The reasoning provided in the statement (that things would have gone better if you hadn't vandalized the car) could be considered inconclusive if other factors could have equally influenced the outcome. So, this type might also apply.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This type involves asserting a cause-and-effect relationship without sufficient evidence. The statement assumes a direct causal relationship between vandalizing the car and things not going better, without sufficient evidence for this causality. Hence, this defective argument type applies.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This type reiterates a claim without additional supporting evidence. The statement does not appear to repetitively assert the same proposition without evidence, so this does not apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This type involves assuming that a consensus exists without proof. The statement does not imply any consensus, so this does not apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** This type involves using vague or unclear language to make a point. The language in the statement is relatively clear, so this does not apply.

Therefore, the defective argument types that apply to the statement "If you hadn't vandalized that car, don't you think things would have gone better for you?" are:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement does not consider all other relevant possibilities that could have affected the outcome.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasoning provided is not sufficiently strong to conclusively lead to the suggested outcome.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: It asserts a causal relationship without sufficient evidence.

So, the statement may be marked as: <FE><IR><WCB>.
