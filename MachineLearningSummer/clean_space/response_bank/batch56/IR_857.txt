For 
The argument "But, Dad, I know you had no curfew when you were my age, so how can you give me a curfew?" can be analyzed and identified as a defective argument using the types defined:

This falls under <IR> - Inconclusive Reason. Here's the reasoning:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** A conclusion is drawn based on reasoning that doesn't conclusively support it. In this case, the speaker is claiming that because the Dad didn't have a curfew when he was younger, it is inappropriate or unfair for the Dad to impose a curfew now. This reasoning is inconclusive because circumstances may have changed, or the Dad may have different reasons for imposing a curfew now that are not addressed in the argument. Therefore, the argument uses reasoning that is not sufficient to definitively support the conclusion that the Dad should not impose a curfew.

So, applying the defective argument type:
- Argument: "But, Dad, I know you had no curfew when you were my age, so how can you give me a curfew?‚Äù
- Identified Defective Argument Type: <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)
