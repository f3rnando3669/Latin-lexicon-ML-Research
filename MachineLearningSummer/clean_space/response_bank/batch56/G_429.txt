Sure, let's identify and analyze the defective arguments present in the statement: 

"The anti-terrorist laws that monitor international currency transfers, phone calls, and emails are the first step to turning our fragile democracy into a new Nazi regime."

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - The statement makes a sweeping generalization by suggesting that monitoring international currency transfers, phone calls, and emails is the first step toward becoming a Nazi regime. This is an overreach and exaggeration without substantial evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - The argument suggests a direct progression from anti-terrorist laws to a Nazi regime without considering other possible outcomes or the complexity of political and societal changes.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - The reasons provided (monitoring of various communications) do not conclusively lead to the conclusion (turning into a Nazi regime). There is a gap between the premise and the conclusion that is not sufficiently bridged.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - The argument implies a cause-and-effect relationship without adequate basis or evidence. There's no substantial causal link given between the implementation of anti-terrorist laws and the transformation into a Nazi regime.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - The statement, as it stands, does not present a repetition of any proposition in the argument. Thus, this defective argument type does not apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - The statement does not explicitly rely on assuming that there is already a consensus on the matter. Thus, this defective argument type does not apply here.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - The term "new Nazi regime" is very strong and loaded, potentially leading to ambiguity in understanding exactly what the speaker is referring to. It can stir emotions rather than contribute to a logical, clear argument.

Given the analysis, the primary defective arguments present in the statement are:

- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**
