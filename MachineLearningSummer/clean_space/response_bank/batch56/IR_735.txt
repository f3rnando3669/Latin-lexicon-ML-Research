For 
Certainly! The described argument in the sentence presents a logical fallacy known as an "Ad Hominem Attack." This particular fallacy focuses on attacking an individual's character or personal traits instead of engaging with the actual argument or proposition they have presented. 

However, the defective argument types defined are:

1. Generalization <G>
2. Incomplete Enumeration <FE>
3. Inconclusive Reason <IR>
4. Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>
5. Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>
6. Presumptuous Consensus <FU>
7. Ambiguous Language <DEP>

Since none of these defective argument types directly describe an "Ad Hominem Attack," a new code specifically for this would be more appropriate, like:

- <IDAA>: Irrelevant Disparagement/ Ad Hominem Argument

So applying this new code <IDAA>:
"In the business meeting, she proposed a new advertising plan for the dog food brand, but I found out she actually hates dogs. How can we trust her advertising skills?"

This argument is classified as <IDAA> - Irrelevant Disparagement/ Ad Hominem Argument because it attacks the person's character (hatred of dogs) as irrelevant to the specific action or proposal (the advertising plan).
