Certainly, let's analyze the argument using the specified defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: Generalization occurs when a conclusion about all instances is reached based on a small number of instances. In the argument, "The Omani hospital tested three patients from Abu Dhabi and found they had the disease. They immediately banned all people from Abu Dhabi from entering the hospital," there is a likely generalization. The hospital's decision to ban all people from Abu Dhabi based on testing just three patients is a broad conclusion drawn from insufficient data. 

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Incomplete Enumeration arises when not all relevant instances are considered. In this case, the hospital did not test all patients from Abu Dhabi, only three. There could be more patients from Abu Dhabi who don't have the disease, hence this argument suffers from incomplete enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This happens when the reason provided does not conclusively support the conclusion. Here, testing just three patients from an entire region and finding them positive does not sufficiently support the drastic measure of banning all individuals from that region.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This is the case when there's an assumption of causality without sufficient evidence. The hospital's reasoning that because three patients from Abu Dhabi had the disease, others will too, lacks a robust causal basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This type involves repeating a statement without providing additional evidence. There is no indication of repetitive propositions in the argument provided, so this defective argument type does not apply here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This involves assuming that if a few people or authorities agree, then everyone agrees. Here, this type is not directly applicable since the argument does not involve consensus but a unilateral decision by the hospital.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This refers to the use of vague or unclear language to mislead or confuse. The language in the provided argument is clear about the actions taken and the reasoning behind it, despite the reasoning being flawed.

Based on the above analysis, the argument suffers primarily from:
- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
