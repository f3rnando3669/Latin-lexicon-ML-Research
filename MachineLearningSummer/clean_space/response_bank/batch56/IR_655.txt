For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application.

In the statement "Don't listen to Mr. Fingers when he says walk in the hallways. How can you trust someone who wears bow ties?", the argument presented attempts to discredit advice based on an irrelevant characteristic of the person who gave it. This type of reasoning falls under a defective argument known as Ad Hominem, which isn't explicitly defined in the list, but let's see if we can categorize it more closely with the listed defective arguments.

This argument does not provide a reason why the advice (to walk in the hallways) is flawed; instead, it attacks the personal attire of Mr. Fingers (bow ties). Since none of the provided defective argument types fully capture the nature of this Ad Hominem attack, it cannot be directly applied from the list. However, since it uses irrelevant personal information to discredit the argument, we can note that it:

1. Lacks a sufficient causal basis for disregarding Mr. Fingers' advice (i.e., wearing bow ties doesn't logically connect to the credibility of hall rules). Thus it can be categorized under <WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis.

So, applying <IDAA>, the argument can be identified as having a defect of <WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis. It fails because the cause (wearing a bow tie) is not relevant to the effect (trustworthiness or the validity of advice).
