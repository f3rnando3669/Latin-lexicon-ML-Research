To apply the defective argument analysis approach (IDAA) to the given statement, we need to identify the specific defective arguments (from the defined list) present in the father's reasoning. The statement is:

“A father talking to his daughter on dating a boyfriend he doesn’t like says, 'If you continue dating this guy who doesn’t take his education seriously, you’ll end up dropping out of school, you then won’t be able to get a job, and you will get married too young.'”

Here are the defective arguments present in the statement:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - The father makes a broad assumption that dating someone who doesn't take education seriously will lead to a series of negative outcomes (dropping out of school, unable to get a job, and getting married too young). This is a classic overgeneralization, assuming that one characteristic of the boyfriend will inevitably result in a specific negative life trajectory for the daughter.

2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - The claim that dating this particular boyfriend will cause the daughter to drop out of school and so on lacks a sufficient causal connection. The father does not provide concrete evidence or a detailed argument to support how dating this boyfriend directly causes those specific outcomes.

3. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - The father presumes that the negative outcomes he mentioned (dropping out of school, inability to get a job, and early marriage) are commonly accepted as direct consequences of dating someone who doesn't take education seriously. This presumptive leap ignores individual differences and other influencing factors.

4. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - The father's argument uses terms that can be vague or ambiguous. For instance, what does it mean to "not take his education seriously"? The phrase is subjective and can be interpreted in multiple ways, leading to different conclusions based on different interpretations.

By identifying these defective arguments, we can see that the father's reasoning is built on generalizations, insufficient causal connections, presumptuous assumptions about consensus, and ambiguous language, making his overall argument weak and flawed.
