For 
Applying the defective argument analysis framework to the statement "The teenagers were rude and disrespectful therefore all teenagers are rude and disrespectful," we can identify the type of defective argument present:

**Type:** Generalization (<G>)

**Explanation:** The statement takes the behavior of a specific group of teenagers and extends it to all teenagers. This is a classic example of a hasty generalization, where a conclusion is drawn about an entire group based on insufficient or unrepresentative evidence. 

So, the analysis using <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Analysis) is as follows:

"The teenagers were rude and disrespectful therefore all teenagers are rude and disrespectful." - <G> Generalization
