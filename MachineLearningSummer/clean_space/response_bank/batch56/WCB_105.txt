Sure, let's analyze the given statement using the defective argument types you defined:

Statement: "Our garage sale made lots of money before Joan showed up. Obviously, she scared off all the customers."

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - This argument may involve hasty generalization because it jumps to a conclusion about Joan's effect on the garage sale based on a very limited set of observations.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - The argument doesn't take into account other possible factors that could have contributed to the decrease in customers. It ignores alternatives like weather changes, the time of day, or other events in the area.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The reasoning provided here is inconclusive. Just because something happened before something else does not mean there is a causal relationship. The argument fails to provide sufficient evidence to support the conclusion.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - There is an insufficient causal basis in the argument. Correlation does not imply causation, and no concrete evidence is provided to support the claim that Joan's presence directly caused the decline in customers.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - This type does not seem to apply directly as there isn't a repeated proposition in the argument.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - The argument presumes consensus (that Joan scared off the customers) without any evidence that other people share this belief, thus making a presumptuous leap.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - The language used in the argument is not necessarily ambiguous. The terms are fairly clear, but the logic is flawed for other reasons.

In summary, applying the identified defective arguments to the statement "Our garage sale made lots of money before Joan showed up. Obviously, she scared off all the customers," we recognize it as likely exhibiting the fallacies of Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), and Presumptuous Consensus (FU).
