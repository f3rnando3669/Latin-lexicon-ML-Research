For 
IDAA stands for Identifying Defective Arguments and their Application. Let's analyze the statement given:

**Statement:**
"This persuasive technique is used to make you feel left out if you don't join the group."

**Applying IDAA:**
1. **Generalization (G):**
   - This statement doesn't fall under Generalization as it isn't making a broad conclusion based on limited instances.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - The statement isn't making a flawed list or an incomplete consideration of alternatives.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - It does suggest a reason (the technique makes you feel left out), but whether this reason is inconclusive needs to be judged based on context. In itself, the statement does not directly showcase an inconclusive reason.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - This could be a possibility, as the statement implies a causal relationship (the technique causing feelings of being left out) without providing sufficient evidence to support this causal linkage.
   - **Evaluation:** If there's no evidence backing the claim about the technique's effectiveness, it could be categorized under WCB. (Insufficient Causal Basis).

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - The statement does not repeat a proposition to make it seem true, since it presents it only once.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - The statement does not suggest that everyone agrees or that there's a consensus without actual evidence. So it doesn't fall under Presumptuous Consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - The statement does involve ambiguous terms like "this persuasive technique" and "feel left out" without specifying what kind of technique or what exactly feeling left out means in this context.
   - **Evaluation:** This could fall under DEP (Ambiguous Language).

**Conclusion:**
The statement "This persuasive technique is used to make you feel left out if you don't join the group." can be categorized under Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB) and Ambiguous Language (DEP), depending on the evaluation context and the evidence provided for the claims made.
