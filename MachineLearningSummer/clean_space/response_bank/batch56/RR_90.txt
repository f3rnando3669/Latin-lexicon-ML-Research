For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identify, Define, Analyze, and Address Argument) to the statement "all bachelors are unmarried males," let's follow these steps:

### Identify:
Identify the statement and its inherent argumentative claim or premise.
- Statement: "All bachelors are unmarried males."
- Claim: The term "bachelor" comprehensively includes only those males who are unmarried.

### Define:
Define the key terms and the nature of the argument.
- Key Terms:
  - Bachelor: Traditionally defined as an unmarried man.
  - Unmarried: Not having a spouse.
- Nature of Argument: This is an analytic statement, which is true by definition. The term "bachelor" implies "unmarried male" by its very definition.

### Analyze:
Analyze if the argument falls under any of the defective argument types defined (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP).
- Generalization (G): Not applicable, as it's a definition rather than a generalization.
- Incomplete Enumeration (FE): Not applicable, as it's not listing out examples or cases.
- Inconclusive Reason (IR): Not applicable, as there is no reasoning provided, just a definitional statement.
- Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB): Not applicable, there is no cause-and-effect claim here.
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR): Not applicable, there's no repetition of a proposition.
- Presumptuous Consensus (FU): Not applicable, no assumption of consensus here.
- Ambiguous Language (DEP): Not applicable, the language is clear and unambiguous.

### Address:
Address whether the argument stands or if it needs any clarification or correction.

Since the statement "All bachelors are unmarried males" is a straightforward analytic truth based on the definition of "bachelor," it is not a defective argument and does not fall under any of the defined defective argument types.

#### Conclusion:
The statement "All bachelors are unmarried males" is not a defective argument. It is a tautology that is true by definition and does not exhibit any of the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP>.
