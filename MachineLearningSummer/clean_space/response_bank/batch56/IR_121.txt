For 
Applying the concept of Identifying Defective Argument Analysis (<IDAA>) to the statement "That parking attendant who gave me a ticket is as bad as Hitler," we can identify that it falls into the following defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement takes an extreme and isolated instance (receiving a parking ticket) and generalizes it to an absurd and unrelated comparison (comparing the parking attendant to Hitler). This type of generalization is not only hyperbolic but also unfounded and unreasonable.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasoning provided in the statement is inconclusive because the comparison lacks any sound basis. The responsibilities and actions of a parking attendant issuing a ticket are not analogous to the actions of Hitler, making the comparison logically invalid and emotionally charged rather than based on a rational argument.

3. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The term "as bad as Hitler" is not only hyperbolic but also ambiguous. It can be interpreted in various ways and does not provide a clear, objective standard of comparison. The dramatic language overshadows any factual basis for the comparison, leading to a conclusion that is more emotional than logical.

In summary, the argument presented in the statement "That parking attendant who gave me a ticket is as bad as Hitler" can be identified as having the following defective argument types: **Generalization (<G>)**, **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, and **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**.
