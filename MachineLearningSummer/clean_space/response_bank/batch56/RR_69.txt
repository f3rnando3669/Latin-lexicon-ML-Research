For 
Let's analyze the argument: "We know the virus started in a lab because it's too deadly to have just been the result of basic circumstance. But it hasn't been as deadly for China which proves that it's lab-made. Because it's deadly."

1. **Generalization (G)**: The claim "it's too deadly to have just been the result of basic circumstance" makes a broad assertion without sufficient evidence to support such a sweeping conclusion. It generalizes the nature of the virusâ€™s origin based on its deadliness.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument fails to consider other plausible explanations for the virus's origin, such as natural zoonotic transfer. It doesn't provide a comprehensive list of scenarios and dismisses alternatives implicitly.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument that the virus being "too deadly" suggests lab origin is not substantiated with solid evidence. Many factors could contribute to a virus's deadliness, and the reasoning is inconclusive without further proof.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument claims causation ("the virus started in a lab") based on the observation ("it's too deadly"), which is not a sufficient causal basis. The correlation between deadliness and lab origin is not established.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The conclusion "Because it's deadly" repetitively affirms the initial statement without providing new or independent evidence. It merely echoes the original assertion without adding substantial support.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The sentence "But it hasn't been as deadly for China which proves that it's lab-made" presumes agreement or widespread consensus without demonstrating that such a consensus exists. This appeal to a presumed shared belief lacks verification.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Terms like "too deadly" and "basic circumstance" are vague and open to interpretation. The ambiguity of these terms weakens the clarity and precision of the argument. 

By applying <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Attributes), we can illustrate how this argument is problematic and lacks robust logical foundation. Each identified defective argument type helps highlight specific weaknesses in the reasoning process.
