Applying IDAA (Identifying Defective Argument Types) to the given scenario involving Tasha's study of polar and tropical climates might not be entirely straightforward without additional context or explicit examples of arguments. However, I will attempt to identify any potential defective arguments that might arise from the points presented.

Given the statements:

1. Tropical climates: Summer and winter temperatures are similar.
2. Polar climates: Summer temperature is much higher than winter temperature.
3. Tasha wonders why the tropical climate has the same temperature year-round, but the polar climate temperature differs greatly.

Let's analyze possible faulty arguments:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - If Tasha were to conclude that all tropical climates around the world always have similar temperatures without considering other factors such as altitude or local geography, she might be making an unwarranted generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Tasha might be falling into the incomplete enumeration trap if she doesn't consider all possible factors that influence climate, such as ocean currents, altitude, and local weather patterns, leading to an incomplete understanding of why temperatures might vary differently between tropical and polar climates.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - If Tasha concludes that the polar climate's varying temperature is solely due to its latitude without further evidence or reasoning, her argument might be inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Suppose Tasha claims that the difference in temperature variation is because of the Earth's tilt but doesn't account for other influencing factors like atmospheric circulation patterns or local geographical features. In that case, she presents an argument with an insufficient causal basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - If Tasha simply repeats, "Polar climates have more extreme temperature variations," without providing a reason or explanation for the phenomenon, she’s engaging in faulty repetition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - Assuming that everyone will agree with her assertion about temperature differences because it seems common sense, without presenting proper evidence, Tasha might fall into the trap of presumptuous consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - If Tasha uses ambiguous terms like "similar" and "much higher" without quantifying or clarifying these terms, her argument could be criticized for using ambiguous language. For example, "much higher” might mean different things depending on the context or compared values.

Therefore, while Tasha's observations themselves may be valid, the faulty reasoning or logical pitfalls highlighted by the defective argument types could undermine her understanding or communication of why these climatic differences occur. To strengthen her argument, she should aim to provide detailed reasoning, consider a full range of factors, and use precise language.
