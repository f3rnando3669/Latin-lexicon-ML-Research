For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argumentative Apparatus. To apply <IDAA> to the given statement, we'll identify the types of defective arguments used:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument makes sweeping generalizations about what would follow if the government prohibits drugs. It assumes that banning drugs would inevitably lead to banning alcohol, cigarettes, fatty food, junk food, and even mandating personal habits like brushing teeth and exercising. This assumes a slippery slope without providing substantial evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument lists specific items (alcohol, cigarettes, fatty food, junk food) but doesn't provide a comprehensive list of all factors or considerations that might be involved in the government's regulation decisions. It selectively picks certain items to bolster its point.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasoning provided does not conclusively prove that drug prohibition would lead to the extreme measures mentioned. The connection between banning drugs and subsequently banning other items is not sufficiently established.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument lacks a strong causal basis for how prohibiting drugs would directly lead to the prohibition of other items and personal behaviors. Just because some items are regulated does not logically mean all other similar items or activities would be as well.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: There isn't a direct repetition of the proposition itself in this argument, so this category does not apply here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument presumes that everyone would agree on the absurdity of government overreach in personal habits, without actually establishing that this consensus exists or is warranted. The statement assumes that regulating substances will naturally lead to an extreme consensus on further regulation, which may not be the case.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The phrase "the next thing you know" introduces ambiguity. It is a vague expression that implies inevitability without clear supporting logic.

Based on this analysis, the argument employs multiple defective argumentative techniques:

- Generalization (<G>)
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
- Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)

These faulty argument types collectively weaken the credibility and logical structure of the argument presented.
