For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Arguments in Assertions. To apply <IDAA> to the provided statement, we analyze the argument for any defective reasoning:

Statement: "Kelly is the most selfish, annoying person that I know. She says that we should recycle to help save the Earth, but she only thinks about herself, so she must be wrong."

Defective arguments identified:

1. **<G> Generalization**: The statement makes a broad and unsupported generalization about Kellyâ€™s character ("the most selfish, annoying person that I know"). This does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that her position on recycling is wrong.
  
2. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The argument connects Kelly's character flaw (being selfish and annoying) to the validity of her statement about recycling, which is irrelevant. Whether or not Kelly is selfish does not influence the truth or importance of recycling to save the Earth. 

3. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: The statement implies a causality that isn't justified: because Kelly is selfish, her argument about recycling must be flawed. This is an insufficient causal basis because her personal traits do not determine the correctness of her advocacy for recycling.

By identifying these defective arguments, we can see that the statement relies on irrelevant personal attacks and fallacious reasoning rather than addressing the actual argument about recycling.
