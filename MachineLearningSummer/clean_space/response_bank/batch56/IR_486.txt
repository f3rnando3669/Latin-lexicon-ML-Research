For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Arguments Applied.

The argument "Aristotle thought women were inferior to men. Aristotle is one of the smartest men who ever lived, so he must be right about this." contains the following defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument makes a broad claim about the inferiority of women based on Aristotle's authority without providing sufficient evidence or considering counterarguments and other perspectives.

2. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The argument implicitly repeats the proposition that women are inferior by assuming Aristotle's intelligence alone validates this view, without further substantiation.

3. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument presumes that because Aristotle is widely regarded as intelligent, his views must be correct, assuming a consensus that may not actually exist regarding his specific claims about women.

By identifying these defective argument types, we can see that the argument relies on several logical flaws and unsupported assumptions.
