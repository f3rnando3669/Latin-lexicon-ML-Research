Certainly! Given your definitions of defective argument types, let's determine which type best applies to the statement "All four-year-olds talk too much."

The statement makes a broad claim about all four-year-olds without providing sufficient evidence to support such a generalization. Without evidence or a thorough examination of the population of four-year-olds, the argument appears to be based on a limited set of observations.

The most fitting defective argument type for this statement seems to be <G> (Generalization).

So, applying the type to the statement:

**<G>: "All four-year-olds talk too much."**
