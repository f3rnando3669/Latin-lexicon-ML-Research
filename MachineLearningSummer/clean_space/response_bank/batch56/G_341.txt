For 
<IDAA> typically stands for Identifying Defective Argument Areas, a process to recognize and categorize the defects in an argument. Let's apply this approach to the statement "If you allow the students to redo this one test, they will always want to redo all future tests."

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The statement assumes that allowing students to redo one test will automatically lead to a pattern where they will always want to redo all future tests. This is a hasty generalization, as it doesn't consider the possibility that the policy may remain an exception rather than becoming a rule.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - This argument does not consider other possible outcomes. There may be various other ways in which students might react to being allowed to redo a test, such as valuing the opportunity but not expecting it regularly.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The cause-effect relationship suggested here is not sufficiently supported. There isn't strong evidence to conclude that allowing one retest would inevitably lead to consistent demands for retests in the future.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - Similarly, the causal link between allowing a single retest and future behavior is weak. The statement doesnâ€™t provide sufficient grounds to justify such a sweeping conclusion.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - This does not seem to repeat a faulty proposition, so it doesn't necessarily fall under this category.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - The statement implies a consensus (i.e., that all students will follow this pattern of behavior), presuming that any exception granted once will lead to universal expectations without evidence of such consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - The term "always" can be seen as ambiguous. It creates a black-and-white scenario that unnecessarily simplifies the many potential outcomes and reactions to the policy change.

In summary, the predominant defective argument types identified in this statement are Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), and Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>).
