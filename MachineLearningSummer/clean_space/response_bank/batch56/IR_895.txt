<IDAA>: Identify Defective Argument Attributes

In the statement: "It is ridiculous to have spent thousands of dollars to rescue those two whales trapped in the Arctic ice. Why look at all the people trapped in jobs they donâ€™t like," several defective argument types can be identified:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument makes a broad generalization by equating the rescue of whales to a completely unrelated issue, namely people being trapped in jobs they dislike.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasoning provided (comparing the rescue of whales to people in undesirable jobs) is inconclusive and unrelated. The plight of people in jobs they dislike does not directly correlate to the ethics or necessity of whale rescue efforts.

3. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The term "trapped" is used ambiguously, implying a false equivalence between being physically trapped in ice and being metaphorically trapped in an undesired job.

This breakdown shows that the argument is defective due to using unrelated generalization, inconclusive reasoning, and ambiguous language.
