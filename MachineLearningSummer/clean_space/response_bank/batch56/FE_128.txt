For 
<IDAA> stands for Improper Dichotomy/False Dilemma, which is a type of defective argument where only two choices are presented in a situation where more options exist.

Applying <IDAA> to the statement "It is either you are for the US war on terror or against it.":

This statement is an example of an Improper Dichotomy/False Dilemma because it presents only two extreme options (being either for or against the US war on terror), ignoring the possibility of more nuanced or middle-ground positions. For instance, someone might support certain aspects of the US war on terror while opposing others, or they may have a complex stance that does not fit neatly into either category presented.
