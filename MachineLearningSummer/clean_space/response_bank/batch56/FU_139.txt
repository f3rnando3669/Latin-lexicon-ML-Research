Sure, let's analyze the statement "This type of propaganda implies that since EVERYONE else is buying a product, so should you!" using the definitions of the defective argument types you provided:

1. **Generalization (G):** This might not apply directly as the statement doesn’t make a generalization based on a small sample set; it's an implication based argument.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This could apply if the statement ignores other important factors or options that aren't considered, such as alternative reasons for buying a product.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This might be relevant as the reasoning "since everyone else is doing it" doesn't necessarily provide conclusive evidence of the inherent value or quality of the product.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This doesn’t seem to fit well, as it’s more about making unwarranted causal connections, which isn’t directly the case here.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The statement doesn't seem to involve the mere repetition of a proposition to mislead or create an assumption of certainty.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This is a perfect fit. The argument relies on the assumption that if everyone is buying the product, it must be the right choice, presuming consensus without critical evaluation.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** This doesn’t seem to apply here as the language used isn’t ambiguous.

The notably applicable defective argument type for the statement "This type of propaganda implies that since EVERYONE else is buying a product, so should you!" is **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**. 

So, you could state:

"The statement 'This type of propaganda implies that since EVERYONE else is buying a product, so should you!' suffers from <FU>, also known as Presumptuous Consensus."
