For 
The argument you've presented can be analyzed using the defective argument types defined:

"A is true because B is true, and B is true because A is true."

This argument presents a form of circular reasoning, where the truth of A is dependent on B, and the truth of B is in turn dependent on A. Circular reasoning is a logical fallacy where the conclusion is included in the premise, leading to an argument that doesn't provide any useful information or proof.

Given the definitions provided:

<IDAA> doesn't correspond to any of the defective argument types you have defined. Based on the analysis, this argument falls under the circular reasoning category, which aligns closely with the defined defective argument type <RR>.

Therefore, the analysis would identify the argument as:
<RR>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition

Circular reasoning inherently involves repeating the proposition in a way that the argument supports itself without external evidence or valid reasoning.
