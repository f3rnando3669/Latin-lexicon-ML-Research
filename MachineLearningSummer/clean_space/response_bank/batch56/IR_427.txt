For 
Applying <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Types) to the statement:

"Before he died, poet Allen Ginsberg argued in favor of legalizing pornography. But Ginsberg's arguments are nothing but trash. Ginsberg was a pot-smoking homosexual and a thoroughgoing advocate of the drug culture."

This argument exhibits the following defective argument types:

1. **Irrelevant Personal Attack (Ad Hominem)**:
   - The argument dismisses Allen Ginsberg’s position on legalizing pornography by attacking his character and personal lifestyle, without addressing the substance of his arguments. This is not included in the predefined list but is important to note.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The reasoning provided (Ginsberg’s personal habits and lifestyle) does not logically lead to the conclusion that his arguments are invalid. Ginsberg’s personal attributes do not determine the logical soundness of his arguments for legalizing pornography.

Thus, the argument by dismissing Ginsberg’s views based on his personal habits without addressing the logical content of his arguments is flawed and is primarily an Ad Hominem attack, which falls under the broader category of <IR>.
