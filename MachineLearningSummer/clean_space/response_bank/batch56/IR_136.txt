For 
In this context, <IDAA> likely stands for "Identify, Define, and Assess the Argument." Let's break down the provided argument according to these steps:

### Identify: 
"I ask all employees to vote for my chosen candidate in the upcoming elections. If the other candidate wins, he will raise taxes and many of you will lose your jobs."

### Define: 
This argument seems to be making a claim based on a potential negative consequence without sufficient evidence to support the prediction.

### Assess the Argument:
We can analyze the argument for any defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G):** 
   - The argument does not appear to make a generalization based on insufficient or unrepresentative instances.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - The argument does suggest an outcome (raising taxes and job loss), but it does not necessarily omit other possibilities in this context. However, it does lack a thorough consideration of all possible outcomes.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - This argument might fall under this category because the prediction about job losses from tax increases is not conclusively linked. There is no detailed reasoning provided on how the tax increase would directly result in job losses.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - This fits well. The argument assumes a causal relationship between the other candidate's winning, tax increases, and job losses without providing sufficient evidence to support this causal link.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - The argument does not repeatedly state the same proposition to give it an impression of truth.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - The argument does not seem to suggest that everyone agrees or should agree without providing supporting evidence for that consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - The language used in the argument is relatively clear and does not seem to hinge on any ambiguous terms.

### Conclusion:
The most fitting defective argument types for the provided statement are:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** There is a claim that the other candidate winning will directly cause tax raises and job losses, but no sufficient causal link or supporting evidence is provided.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reasoning for the detrimental effects (job loss due to tax increase) is not conclusively established.

Thus, the argument "I ask all employees to vote for my chosen candidate in the upcoming elections. If the other candidate wins, he will raise taxes and many of you will lose your jobs." can be classified under **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** and **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
