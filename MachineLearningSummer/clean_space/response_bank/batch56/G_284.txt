To apply the argument analysis labels (<IDAA> - Identifying Defective Argument Attributes) to the provided argument, let's break it down and examine the potential defective argument types within each segment of the argument:

**Original Argument Analysis:**
"A person apparently hopelessly ill may be allowed to take his own life. Then he may be permitted to deputize others to do it for him should he no longer be able to act. The judgment of others then becomes the ruling factor. Already at this point euthanasia is not personal and voluntary, for others are acting on behalf of the patient as they see fit. This may well incline them to act on behalf of other patients who have not authorized them to exercise their judgment. It is only a short step, then, from voluntary euthanasia (self-inflicted or authorized), to directed euthanasia administered to a patient who has given no authorization, to involuntary euthanasia conducted as a part of a social policy."

1. "A person apparently hopelessly ill may be allowed to take his own life."
   - This initial statement sets up the premise but doesn't directly indicate a defective argument. The crucial point arises in the subsequent extrapolations.

2. "Then he may be permitted to deputize others to do it for him should he no longer be able to act."
   - This introduces a potential slippery slope (<G> Generalization), assuming that allowing personal decision will naturally extend to deputizing others.

3. "The judgment of others then becomes the ruling factor."
   - This shifts the focus to the judgments of others, potentially an incomplete enumeration (<FE>) because it doesn't consider the controls or legal framework governing such decisions.

4. "Already at this point euthanasia is not personal and voluntary, for others are acting on behalf of the patient as they see fit."
   - This statement presents an inconclusive reason (<IR>), implying a loss of personal voluntariness without a substantiated causal link or detailed reasoning.

5. "This may well incline them to act on behalf of other patients who have not authorized them to exercise their judgment."
   - Here, we see an insufficient causal basis (<WCB>), suggesting a causal link without sufficient evidence to support the behavioral chain.

6. "It is only a short step, then, from voluntary euthanasia (self-inflicted or authorized), to directed euthanasia administered to a patient who has given no authorization, to involuntary euthanasia conducted as a part of a social policy."
   - This is a clear Generalization (<G>) and potentially Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), as it assumes a common agreement about the eventual slide into involuntary euthanasia.

Overall, the argument hinges on a slippery slope logic that suffers from several defective attributes, including generalization, inconclusive reasoning, and insufficient causal basis. Letâ€™s summarize the identified defects:

**Summary of Defective Arguments Identified:**
- **[G] Generalization:** Suggesting that allowing self-euthanasia automatically leads to deputizing others, and eventually to involuntary euthanasia.
- **[FE] Incomplete Enumeration:** Not adequately considering all legal and ethical controls in place.
- **[IR] Inconclusive Reason:** Implying loss of personal voluntariness without strong substantiation.
- **[WCB] Insufficient Causal Basis:** Assuming others will act without authorization based on a weak causal link.
- **[FU] Presumptuous Consensus:** Assuming an agreed progression toward social policy without broad evidence or consensus.

The argument thus relies on several logical leaps and unsupported assumptions, making it highly speculative rather than conclusive.
