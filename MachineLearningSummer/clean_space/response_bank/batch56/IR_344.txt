In the context of the exchange provided:

**Jay:** Dude, where are my car keys?  
**Silent Bob:** (says nothing)  
**Jay:** I KNEW you took them!

We can apply defective argument analysis as follows:

### Defective Arguments Analysis (IDAA):

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - Jay presumes that Silent Bob's silence is an admission of guilt. However, there could be numerous other reasons for Silent Bob's silence (e.g., he didn't hear the question, he doesn't know where the keys are, etc.). Jay's conclusion is drawn from an incomplete consideration of possible explanations for the silence.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - Jay's declaration that Silent Bob took the keys based solely on his silence provides an inconclusive reason. Silence alone does not necessarily imply guilt, thus the reasoning does not conclusively support Jay's claim.

3. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - Jay appears to be making an assumption that everyone (or at least Silent Bob) would agree with his assertion that Silent Bob's silence means he took the keys. This presumption of consensus is unfounded without further evidence or agreement from others.

In summary, the application of certain defective argument types (FE, IR, and FU) reveals that Jay's reasoning is flawed due to a lack of complete enumeration, inconclusive reasoning, and presumptuous consensus.
