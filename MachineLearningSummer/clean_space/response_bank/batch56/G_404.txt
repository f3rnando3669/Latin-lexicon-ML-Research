For 
To apply the identification of defective argument types (IDAA) to the statement "Teenagers are too immature and self-absorbed to understand anything about global issues," let's analyze it for each defined defective argument type:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The statement makes a broad claim about all teenagers based on the characteristics "immature" and "self-absorbed." This is a clear case of overgeneralization, as it doesn't account for the many teenagers who are well-informed and capable of understanding global issues.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The argument assumes that immaturity and self-absorption are the only relevant traits to consider regarding teenagers' abilities to understand global issues. It fails to enumerate other potential factors or characteristics, such as education, interest, or exposure to information, that could influence their understanding.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The reasons provided ("immature and self-absorbed") are not strong enough to conclusively support the claim that teenagers cannot understand global issues. The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - The statement implies a causal relationship between immaturity/self-absorption and an inability to understand global issues. However, this causal link is not sufficiently established; there is no evidence offered to show that these traits directly lead to an inability to understand such issues.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - The statement does not involve repetition of propositions or arguments, so this type does not apply here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - The statement presumes a consensus that teenagers are immature and self-absorbed without evidence or acknowledgment of differing opinions. It assumes agreement where there might be none.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - The terms "immature" and "self-absorbed" can be considered somewhat ambiguous without context, but the central issue is more about generalization than ambiguous language. While "global issues" could encompass a wide range of topics, the primary defect here is not ambiguity.

In summary, the statement "Teenagers are too immature and self-absorbed to understand anything about global issues" primarily exhibits the defective argument types of Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), and Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>).
