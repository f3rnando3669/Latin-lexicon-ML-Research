The argument provided can be analyzed using the defective argument types defined:

Argument: "Russia has a terrible human rights record."
"Well, the United States has done plenty of bad things, but we aren't a bad country, so Russia isn't, either." - the President when confronted about Russia's human rights abuses."

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument type doesn't fit well here because the statement doesn't use a broad generalization to make its claim.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This could be partially relevant if the argument relies on selective examples without considering the entirety of the human rights records of both countries.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The argument might fit here, as the reasoning provided is not sufficient to draw a conclusion about Russia's status based on the United States’ actions. It merely deflects from the original claim.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Not directly applicable, as there is no causality being argued in this context.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This doesn’t quite fit since the argument doesn't involve repeating a proposition to assert its truth.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This could be relevant if it presumes that the speaker's view reflects a broader consensus without providing evidence.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This is not highly applicable as the language used is relatively straightforward, although the argument might be seen as ambiguously equating the morality or status of the two countries.

The most fitting defective argument types for this scenario are **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**, as it selectively addresses only part of the issue by mentioning the United States without thoroughly addressing Russia's record, and **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, as it provides reasoning that doesn’t directly address or refute the initial claim about Russia's human rights record.

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the argument, we can identify:

- <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)
- <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)

These tags demonstrate how the argument fails to comprehensively and conclusively address the initial claim about Russia's human rights record.
