For 
The defective argument type <IDAA>, or "Attack Against Authority," applies to arguments where the authority or credibility of a person is attacked instead of addressing the actual argument or issue at hand.

In the given statement, "You never even finished law school, so why should I trust you to watch my children?" the speaker is attacking the individual's credibility based on their educational background rather than addressing any relevant qualifications or abilities related to child care.

Therefore, the statement can be identified as <IDAA> because it falls under the logical fallacy of attacking the personal credibility of someone by pointing out an unrelated aspect of their background.
