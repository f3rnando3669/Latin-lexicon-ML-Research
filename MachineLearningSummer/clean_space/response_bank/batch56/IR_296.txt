For 
Let's apply <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Attributes) to the given argument:

**Argument:** 
"Adultery, as well as philandering, is wrong. Therefore, we have no biological tendency for multiple sex partners."

**Defective Argument Attributes:**

1. **<IR>: Inconclusive Reason**
   - The statement that adultery and philandering are morally wrong does not provide conclusive evidence about our biological inclinations. The moral judgment does not necessarily lead to a conclusion about biological tendencies.

2. **<WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis**
   - The argument assumes a direct causal relationship between the morality of adultery and the absence of biological tendencies for multiple sex partners. This is an unsupported leap from morality to biological predispositions, lacking sufficient basis.

3. **<FU>: Presumptuous Consensus**
   - The argument implies a consensus on the moral wrongdoing of adultery and philandering as a basis for the biological claim. However, this presumption of consensus does not provide scientific evidence about biological tendencies.

4. **<DEP>: Ambiguous Language**
   - Terms like "wrong" can be subjective and vary based on cultural, religious, or personal values. The ambiguity in the moral judgment contributes to the defective nature of the argument since it does not address biological tendencies comprehensively.

**Summary of IDAA Application**
The argument exhibits multiple defective argument attributes. The assertion that moral wrongness implies a lack of biological tendency is inconclusive (<IR>), lacks a solid causal foundation (<WCB>), presumes a consensus that isn't universally established (<FU>), and employs ambiguous language regarding what is deemed "wrong" (<DEP>).
