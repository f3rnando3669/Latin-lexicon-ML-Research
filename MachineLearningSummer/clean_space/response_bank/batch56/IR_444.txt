For 
The argument "Look, it doesn't matter whether or not you think America should build a wall on the border. The President thinks America should do it, so it's a good idea." can be analyzed with the defined defective argument types. The primary fallacy in this statement is an appeal to authority, implying that because the President thinks it's a good idea, it must inherently be a good idea. Let's break it down:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument fails to consider other perspectives or reasons on whether building a wall is a good idea. It assumes the President's opinion is the only one that matters.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The argument provides no substantial reasons or evidence for why building the wall is a good idea, other than the President's endorsement.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: It presumes that the President's opinion represents the consensus or that his authority is enough to establish the validity of the idea.
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The phrase "a good idea" is vague and subjective, lacking clear parameters for what constitutes "good."

Thus, the argument demonstrates characteristics of **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**, **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**, and **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**.
