For 
Certainly! Let's apply the framework of identifying defective argument types (IDAA) to the statement: 

"You are not a credible resource person. You haven't finished college."

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - This statement appears to generalize the credibility of a person based on a single factor: their educational background. It fails to acknowledge other possible aspects of credibility such as experience, skills, or knowledge.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The argument assumes that the only measure of credibility is the completion of college education, ignoring the possibility of other ways to establish credibility.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The reasoning that not finishing college completely invalidates someone's credibility is inconclusive and does not consider the complete spectrum of what makes someone credible.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The argument suggests a causal relationship between finishing college and being credible, but this causal basis is insufficient. Many credible individuals may not have finished college but possess significant expertise.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - This defective argument doesn't seem to fall under faulty repetition, as it doesn't directly repeat a proposition without justification.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - The argument might imply a common consensus that college graduates are inherently more credible, but this consensus is presumptuous and not universally accepted.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - The words "credible resource person" and "haven't finished college" are clear and specific. Thus, ambiguous language is not a significant issue in this argument.

In conclusion, the argument "You are not a credible resource person. You haven't finished college." predominantly exhibits the defective argument types of Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), and Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).
