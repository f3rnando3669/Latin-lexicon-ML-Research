In this context, an "IDAA" (Identification of Defective Argument Application) involves identifying which of the defined defective argument types apply to the given dialogue. 

Dialogue:
1. Interviewer: "Your resume looks impressive but I need another reference."
2. Bill: "Jill can give me a good reference."
3. Interviewer: "Good. But how do I know that Jill is trustworthy?"
4. Bill: "Certainly. I can vouch for her."

**Analysis and Identification of Defective Argument Types:**

1. **Line 4 (Bill: "Certainly. I can vouch for her.")**
   - Here, Bill is suggesting that Jill is trustworthy because he can vouch for her, which is a circular reasoning. It doesn't provide an independent assurance of Jill's trustworthiness.
   
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The argument is flawed because Bill is using his own credibility to establish Jillâ€™s credibility without providing external evidence. The trustworthiness of Jill is based on Bill's assurance, which does not externally validate Jill's reliability.

Thus, the primary defective argument type applied here is:

**<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**.
