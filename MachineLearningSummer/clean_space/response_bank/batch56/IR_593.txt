For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application. 

Let's analyze the dialogue between Audrey and Fred and identify any defective arguments:

- **Fred: "Prove that you are human! Cyborgs don't pass out when they lose a lot of blood. Here's a knife."**

  Fred's argument contains several defects:

  1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Fred assumes that the only way to prove Audrey is human is through passing out due to blood loss, disregarding other possible methods or evidence of her humanity.
  2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Fred's argument about passing out due to blood loss being a definitive proof of humanity lacks a sufficient causal basis. There are many reasons why a being (human or otherwise) might pass out.
  3. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Fred's assertion might be assuming that everyone agrees with his criteria for identifying a cyborg, which is not necessarily accurate or standard.

- **Audrey: "Get to bed, Freddie. And no more SYFY channel before bed!"**

  Audrey's response does not address the defective arguments directly but deflects by suggesting Fred's ideas come from watching too much SYFY channel.

Given the above analysis:

<IDAA> Audrey's statement acknowledges but does not directly refute the defective arguments presented by Fred, instead choosing to dismiss the situation humorously. 

- Audrey is perhaps implicitly addressing an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** by highlighting the implausibility of Fred's claim, suggesting that his logic is based on unrealistic depictions rather than reality.
