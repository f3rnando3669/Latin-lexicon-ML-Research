For 
<IDAA> references an example of a defective argument. In this case, the argument provided exhibits characteristics of the <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) defective argument type.

Here’s the application:

<**IDAA**>: "Your sister broke her arm, and then you broke your nose. So you assume that a sibling breaking a bone causes you to break one too." — This is an instance of <**WCB**>: Insufficient Causal Basis.

Explanation: The argument suggests that there is a causal relationship between one sibling breaking a bone and another sibling breaking a bone. However, just because one event follows another does not mean the first event caused the second. There could be many other factors involved, and without more evidence establishing a direct causal link, the basis for this assumption is insufficient. Hence, it’s a defective argument of the Insufficient Causal Basis type.
