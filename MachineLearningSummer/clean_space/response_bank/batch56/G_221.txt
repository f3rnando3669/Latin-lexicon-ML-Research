For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Arguments Application. The statement "If we allow a housing development to be built on Sunny Lake, a resort will come next, and soon we won’t have any wilderness left!" can be analyzed for defective argument types as follows:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument assumes that allowing one housing development will necessarily lead to a substantial chain of developments (such as resorts and the loss of all wilderness). This is a hasty generalization because it extrapolates from a single instance or minimal evidence to a broader, more extreme conclusion.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not consider other possible outcomes or intermediate steps between building a housing development and losing all wilderness. It skips over the potential for regulations, conservation efforts, or alternative development plans that might mitigate the impact.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The argument presents a slippery slope without robust evidence that one event will inevitably lead to another. The reasoning is inconclusive because it assumes a sequence of events without substantiating how one would directly cause the next.
   
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal relationship between allowing one development and the loss of all wilderness is insufficiently supported. There is a lack of evidence or reasoning provided to convincingly demonstrate that the stated cause (a housing development) would necessarily result in the stated effect (loss of all wilderness).
   
5. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument might imply that everyone would agree with its dire prediction without offering proper justification or considering dissenting views on the potential impact of development on wilderness areas.
   
6. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The terms "wilderness" and "won't have any" are somewhat ambiguous or unspecified. The argument doesn’t define what constitutes the loss of wilderness or how much development would lead to it, which weakens the clarity and strength of its conclusion.

Given these points, the statement "If we allow a housing development to be built on Sunny Lake, a resort will come next, and soon we won’t have any wilderness left!" demonstrates several defective argument types, including <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

By identifying these defects, we can see that the argument is weakly supported and relies on assumptions, lack of evidence, and overly broad claims.
