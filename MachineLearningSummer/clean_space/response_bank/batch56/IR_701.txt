For 
<IDAA> stands for a defective argument type called Irrelevant Discreditation of an Argument's Advocate.

Here's the analysis:

"Tony wants us to believe that the origin of life was an 'accident'. Tony is a godless SOB who has spent more time in jail than in church, so the only information we should consider from him is the best way to make license plates."

Analysis:
1. **Irrelevant Discreditation of an Argument's Advocate (IDAA):** The argument attempts to discredit Tony's claim about the origin of life by attacking his character and past behavior rather than addressing the substance of his argument. Whether Tony has spent more time in jail than in church has no bearing on the validity of his claim about the origin of life. This is a classic example of an ad hominem attack.
   
   - Tony's personal character and past behavior are presented in a way to discredit his argument.
   - The argument does not tackle the actual claim about the origin of life being an "accident."

In summary, the argument presented is defective because it relies on attacking the person making the claim rather than the claim itself, making it an example of Irrelevant Discreditation of an Argument's Advocate (IDAA).
