For 
<IDAA> stands for "Identify Defective Argument Application."

To apply <IDAA> to the statement "The economy continues to grow as the number of 'likes' on my Instagram account continue to increase. Clearly, the two are linked," we need to identify which defective argument type(s) is/are being used.

Let's analyze the statement:
1. "The economy continues to grow as the number of 'likes' on my Instagram account continue to increase." 
2. "Clearly, the two are linked."

In this argument, the speaker is suggesting that the increase in likes on their Instagram account is related to or even a cause of the growth in the economy. 

We can identify the following defective argument types within this statement:

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The argument suggests a causal relationship between two events (growth in Instagram likes and economic growth) without sufficient evidence to support that one causes the other. The mere correlation does not imply causation.

Therefore, applying <IDAA> to the statement, we identify that it involves the defective argument type <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
