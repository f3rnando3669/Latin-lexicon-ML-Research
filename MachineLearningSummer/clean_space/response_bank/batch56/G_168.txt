For 
The argument presented is:

"I have a red car. My car was in a wreck. Therefore, all red cars get wrecked."

Let's analyze the argument:

- The statement "I have a red car" and "My car was in a wreck" are premises.
- The conclusion drawn from these premises is "Therefore, all red cars get wrecked."

This argument can be classified as using a defective argument type called Generalization <G>.

**Reasoning:**
The argument takes a specific instance of a red car being in a wreck and generalizes this to suggest that all red cars will be in wrecks. This is a hasty generalization based on insufficient evidence.

Using the Identification of Defective Argument Application (IDAA):
- Type of Defective Argument: Generalization <G>
- Explanation: The argument takes a single example (one red car being in a wreck) and generalizes it to all red cars, which is not a valid logical step based on the given evidence. The specific instance cannot sufficiently support the broad conclusion.
