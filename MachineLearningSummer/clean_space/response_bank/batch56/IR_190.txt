The argument in the provided example can be analyzed and identified using the defect types you defined. Let's break it down:

"A man who has cheated on his spouse is confronted by a friend who tells him that it is wrong. The man begins to talk about right versus wrong and who decides."

1. **Shifting Focus**: The man avoids addressing his specific actions (cheating) and instead shifts the conversation to a broader philosophical debate about morality and decision-making. 

Based on your defined defective argument types, this shift to a general discussion about morality could be identified as *Ambiguous Language (DEP)*, since it involves evasive or imprecise treatment of terms like "right" and "wrong" instead of directly addressing the specific issue at hand.

Therefore, applying <DEP>:
"**A man who has cheated on his spouse is confronted by a friend who tells him that it is wrong. The man begins to talk about right versus wrong and who decides.**" **<DEP> Ambiguous Language: The man deflects from the specific issue of his cheating by engaging in a vague discussion about the nature of morality and decision-making, avoiding direct accountability.**
