For 
The argument "SM 7: No global warming happening" can be critically analyzed by applying the defective argument types defined here. Let's break it down:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - **Explanation**: This could be a generalization if the statement is made without considering the broad range of evidence supporting global warming.
   - **Application**: "SM 7: No global warming happening" might be a hasty generalization because it overlooks the large body of scientific data demonstrating global warming trends.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - **Explanation**: This could apply if the statement is based on a limited set of observations or data points that do not represent the full picture.
   - **Application**: "SM 7: No global warming happening" might involve incomplete enumeration if it's based on selective data ignoring comprehensive climate studies and long-term trends.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - **Explanation**: This might apply if the reasons provided to support the statement are not sufficient to draw the conclusion.
   - **Application**: If "SM 7: No global warming happening" is presented without robust evidence or thorough reasoning, it could be labeled as having an inconclusive reason.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - **Explanation**: This type applies if the statement is made without a strong causal argument linking evidence and conclusion.
   - **Application**: If "SM 7: No global warming happening" is declared without establishing proper causative links backed by scientific analysis, this could be due to insufficient causal basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - **Explanation**: The statement could be a repeated proposition lacking substantive evidence.
   - **Application**: If "SM 7: No global warming happening" has been repeated often without new or substantial evidence, this would be an example of a faulty repetition of proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - **Explanation**: This could apply if the statement wrongly assumes a consensus exists against global warming.
   - **Application**: Claiming "SM 7: No global warming happening" could involve presumptuous consensus if it asserts that the majority of experts agree with this conclusion, despite data showing otherwise.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - **Explanation**: The statement may use language that is not clearly defining what is meant by "global warming."
   - **Application**: If "SM 7: No global warming happening" uses terms that are vague or without proper definition, leading to misunderstanding, it would be accused of using ambiguous language.

Based on these analyses, we can conclude that "SM 7: No global warming happening" might fall under several defective argument categories:

- **G** (Generalization)
- **FE** (Incomplete Enumeration)
- **IR** (Inconclusive Reason)
- **WCB** (Insufficient Causal Basis)
- **RR** (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)
- **FU** (Presumptuous Consensus)

Depending on the context and how the argument is framed, each of these types might be applicable.
