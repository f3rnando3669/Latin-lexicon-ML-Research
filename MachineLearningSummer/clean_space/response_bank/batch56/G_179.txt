For 
To apply the identification of defective argument types (IDAA) to the statement "All students are good and all clowns are bad," we will analyze the statement to see which of the defined defective argument types it falls into:

1. **Generalization (G):** This type involves making a broad statement based on a limited set of experiences or data.

    - "All students are good" is a generalization because it assumes that every single student is good without exception.
    - "All clowns are bad" is also a generalization because it assumes that every single clown is bad without exception.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This occurs when the argument claims that certain conditions cover all possible cases, without considering other possibilities or evidence that might contradict the claim.

    - Both parts of the statement ("All students are good" and "All clowns are bad") exhibit incomplete enumeration because they do not consider any counterexamples or the diversity within each group.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This is when an argument presents a reason that does not logically or sufficiently support its conclusion.

    - The given statement does not provide any reasoning or evidence for why all students should be considered good or all clowns bad, making it inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This occurs when a cause is stated without sufficient evidence to back up the causation.

    - If the statement implied a cause-effect relationship (e.g., "Being a student makes someone good" or "Being a clown makes someone bad"), it would fall under this category. However, since it simply makes a blanket assertion without suggesting causation, this type might not directly apply.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This occurs when an argument repeats a proposition without adding any new information or evidence.

    - The statement does not engage in repetition or provide cyclical reasoning, so this defective argument type does not apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This is when an assertion is made based on an assumption that there is a consensus or agreement where none exists.

    - The statement does not suggest that it is backed by a presumed consensus, so this type does not directly apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** This occurs when an argument uses vague or unclear language that can be interpreted in multiple ways.

    - The language used in "All students are good and all clowns are bad" is not inherently ambiguous, so this type does not directly apply.

Given the analysis, the defective argument types that apply to the statement "All students are good and all clowns are bad" are:

- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**

Therefore, we can label the defective argument types of the given statement as: <G>, <FE>, and <IR>.
