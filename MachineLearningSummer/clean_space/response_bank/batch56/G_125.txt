For 
The argument presented is:

"My roommate said her philosophy class was difficult, and the one I’m in is difficult, too. All philosophy classes must be hard."

Let's analyze this argument using the defective argument types defined:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This occurs when a broad conclusion is drawn from limited evidence.
   - The argument generalizes from just two instances (the roommate’s philosophy class and the speaker’s philosophy class) to all philosophy classes. This is a classic case of a generalization because it assumes all philosophy classes are difficult based on very limited data points.

So, we can apply **Generalization (<G>)** to this argument. 

The argument fits the pattern of a defective argument type <G>, as it makes a sweeping conclusion based on insufficient evidence.
