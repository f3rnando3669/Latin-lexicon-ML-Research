For 
<IDAA> is not explicitly defined, but based on the given context, it's likely another defective argument type. However, I'll proceed with the application of the existing defective argument types defined above to "Everyone wants to be an English teacher." 

The statement "Everyone wants to be an English teacher." can be analyzed as follows:

1. **<G> Generalization**: The statement makes a sweeping assertion about everyone wanting to be an English teacher, which is unlikely to be true given the diversity of interests and career aspirations in the population. It generalizes the desires of a vast and varied group without sufficient evidence or consideration of individual differences.

2. **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: The statement ignores the many other career options and aspirations people might have, instead listing only "English teacher" as the desired career for everyone. It fails to enumerate other possibilities or reasons why someone might not want to be an English teacher.

3. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The reason provided (that everyone wants to be an English teacher) is inconclusive because it doesn't offer any supporting evidence or rationale. There's no explanation or justification for why this might be the case.

4. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: There is no causal explanation provided as to why everyone would want to be an English teacher. The assertion lacks a basis in observed facts or logical reasoning about why this specific career would be universally desired.

5. **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: If the statement "Everyone wants to be an English teacher" is reiterated without providing evidence or further explanation, it would be an example of faulty repetition, simply restating the proposition without supporting it.

6. **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: The statement presumes a consensus that doesn't likely exist. It asserts that everyone shares the same desire without evidence, thereby overlooking the diversity of opinions and interests.

7. **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**: The term "everyone" is ambiguous and imprecise. It's unclear who is included in "everyone" â€“ is it all people in the world, all students, all people in a particular country? This lack of clarity makes the statement more questionable and harder to validate.

In sum, the statement "Everyone wants to be an English teacher" could be critiqued based on the following defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, and <DEP>. It generalizes without sufficient evidence, fails to consider other possibilities, provides no supporting rationale, lacks a causal basis, may involve faulty repetition, presumes a non-existent consensus, and uses ambiguous language.
