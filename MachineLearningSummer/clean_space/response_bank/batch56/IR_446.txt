The given statement can be analyzed using the defined defective argument types:

Statement: "If everyone lived his or her life exactly like Jesus lived his life, the world would be a beautiful place!"

Let's break it down using <IDAA> to identify any defective arguments present:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument makes a sweeping claim that if everyone lived exactly like Jesus, the world would inevitably be a beautiful place. It assumes that one specific model of living would universally result in positive outcomes, which may not account for the diverse contexts and complexities of human life.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument may rely on too few examples to support such a broad claim. It doesn't consider other potentially positive ways of living that might also lead to a beautiful world.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The conclusion drawn (a beautiful world) from the premise (living like Jesus) is not sufficiently substantiated. The argument assumes that the correlation between living like Jesus and a beautiful world is obvious and direct without providing supporting evidence or addressing possible counterarguments.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal link between living exactly like Jesus and the resulting beauty of the world is not clearly established. There might be many other factors (social, economic, cultural) influencing the beauty of the world that this argument overlooks.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The statement does not exhibit this type of fallacy as it doesn’t repeat the proposition without providing new information.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This argument suggests that the idea of living like Jesus leading to a beautiful world is a universally accepted notion without presenting evidence for this consensus. It presumes agreement without validation.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The term "beautiful place" is ambiguous. It isn't defined clearly what "beautiful" means in this context—whether it refers to moral beauty, aesthetic beauty, a peaceful society, or some other ideal state.

Thus, the statement "If everyone lived his or her life exactly like Jesus lived his life, the world would be a beautiful place!" exhibits the following defective arguments:

- Generalization (<G>)
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
- Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)

It does not exhibit a Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>).

By recognizing these defects, we can see the need for a more nuanced and evidence-based argument to support the claim.
