To analyze the argument "Only a mentally ill person would kill someone, so anyone who kills someone is automatically mentally ill" using the defective argument types you've defined, we'll examine each part to determine where the argument may fail logically.

The argument seems problematic primarily for a few reasons:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument likely commits a generalization fallacy because it broadly states that only mentally ill people would commit murder, which does not necessarily account for various motives and circumstances that could lead someone to kill another person.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: There could be an element of incomplete enumeration as the argument fails to consider other factors or reasons why someone might commit murder, such as self-defense, extreme stress or duress, or non-mental illness related circumstances.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The conclusion that anyone who kills someone is automatically mentally ill is an inconclusive reason. The premise does not adequately support the conclusion, as the relationship between mental illness and the act of killing is not sufficiently demonstrated or proven.

4. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The term "mentally ill" can be ambiguous (<DEP>). The definition of "mentally ill" is broad and can vary considerably. This ambiguity might obscure the argument and lead to misunderstandings.

Therefore, the argument "Only a mentally ill person would kill someone, so anyone who kills someone is automatically mentally ill" can be identified as primarily suffering from:

- **Generalization (<G>)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**

By applying these labels, we can more clearly see the flaws in this argument.
