For 
<IDAA> stands for the Identification and Analysis of Defective Argument types Applied. Here, we identify the defective arguments present in the statement and analyze them.

Statement:
"Delores is a big supporter for equal pay for equal work. This is the same policy that all those extreme feminist groups support. Extremists like Delores should not be taken seriously -- at least politically."

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The statement makes a broad generalization by equating Delores's support for equal pay with being an extremist because extreme feminist groups also support this policy. Just because certain extreme groups support a policy doesnâ€™t mean everyone who supports that policy is an extremist. Generalizing all supporters as extremists is a defective argument.

2. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - The statement creates a faulty presumption of consensus by suggesting that anyone who supports equal pay must be part of or similar to "extreme feminist groups". This is an unjust assumption that presumes the existence of a consensus among all supporters which may not be the case.

3. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - The term "extremist" is ambiguous. It is used vaguely to discredit Delores without a clear definition or explanation of what constitutes an "extremist" in this context. This ambiguity weakens the argument as it leverages a loaded term open to various interpretations.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - There is an element of <RR> in the statement's repetition of the assertion that Delores's support for equal pay aligns with extremist views without providing substantive reasons for why this alignment is problematic. This repetition is used to reinforce a weak proposition.

Application of <IDAA> results in identifying multiple defective arguments within the statement, specifically Generalization (<G>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), Ambiguous Language (<DEP>), and Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>). These defects collectively undermine the credibility of the argument presented.
