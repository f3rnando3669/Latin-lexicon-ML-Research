For 
To apply <IDAA> (which I assume stands for "Identify Defective Argument Types") to the statement "SM 10: Local talk show host saying we are on the verge of a nuclear war leading to sitting in a basement for months," we'll assess which defective argument types from the defined list can be attributed to this statement.

Hereâ€™s the analysis: 

1. **Generalization (<G>):** The talk show host is making a broad claim about an impending nuclear war. This could be considered a generalization because the host might be basing this assertion on limited or selectively chosen information that doesn't comprehensively represent the actual probability of such an event.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The host warns about the dire consequences (sitting in a basement for months) but potentially overlooks other significant outcomes or possible situations. The enumeration of consequences appears incomplete.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Suggesting that we are on the verge of a nuclear war might be based on speculative or inconclusive reasons that haven't been substantiated with concrete evidence.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** There may be an insufficient causal connection between the talk show host's claims and the actual likelihood of these events unfolding. The assertion may lack a rigorous causal analysis to justify the conclusion.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** If the talk show host continually repeats the assertion of an impending nuclear war without introducing new or corroborating evidence, this might be considered a faulty repetition of the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The talk show host may imply that there is a consensus on the issue (e.g., experts agree we are on the verge of nuclear war) without substantiating that such a consensus actually exists.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** The phrase "on the verge of a nuclear war" could be considered ambiguous as it doesn't precisely define what "on the verge" means in a tangible and measurable way. This can lead to misinterpretation and unnecessary fear.

In summary, the statement "SM 10: Local talk show host saying we are on the verge of a nuclear war leading to sitting in a basement for months" can be associated with the following defective argument types (<IDAA>): 

- Generalization (<G>)
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
- Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
- Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)
