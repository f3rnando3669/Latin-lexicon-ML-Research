For 
Let's unpack the defective argument types in the context of the given statement: "The accident was caused by the taxi parking in the street."

To apply "<IDAA>" (Identify Defective Argument Apply Analysis), I will examine if the statement contains or reflects any of the previously defined defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - This would apply if the statement takes a specific incident and generalizes it to other similar incidents without adequate evidence.
   - Not applicable here; the statement refers only to a specific incident, not a generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - This might be applicable if the statement selectively mentions the cause without considering other possible causes.
   - Applicable: The statement asserts that the accident was caused by the taxi parking in the street, potentially ignoring other contributing factors (e.g., driver inattention, weather conditions).

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - This applies if the supposed cause is presented without sufficient evidence or logical support.
   - Applicable: Without additional details, it is not conclusively demonstrated that the taxi parking in the street was the sole or primary cause of the accident.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - This applies if there is an inadequate basis for establishing causality.
   - Applicable: There might not be enough information to establish a direct causal link between the taxi parking and the accident.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - This is typically a reassertion of the same claim without additional evidence.
   - Not directly applicable based on the one given statement.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - This refers to assuming agreement or consensus without factual support.
   - Not applicable here; the statement doesn't indicate a presumed consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - This might apply if the language or phrasing is unclear or open to multiple interpretations.
   - Not directly applicable; the statement is fairly clear in its assertion.

Based on the analysis, the statement "The accident was caused by the taxi parking in the street" primarily exemplifies:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

The argument makes an incomplete enumeration of potential causes, lacks conclusive reasoning, and does not sufficiently establish the causality to support its claim properly.
