To apply "Identify Defective Argument Types in Example (IDAA)" to the statement "I know that our TV advertisements are more effective than radio. The numbers show that we hit twice the audience with TV, and our focus groups remember the TV commercial 38 percent more than the radio slot," you need to identify if any of the defective argument types we've defined (Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Presumptuous Consensus, Ambiguous Language) are present in the reasoning.

1. **Generalization (<G>):** This argument doesn't fall into the category of generalization since specific data points are given rather than making a broad general statement.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This could partially apply because the statement assumes that hitting twice the audience and a 38% higher recall rate definitively determine effectiveness, without mentioning other potentially relevant factors like conversions or demographic differences.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This applies since hitting twice the audience and having a 38% higher recall in focus groups don't necessarily mean the advertising is more effective in a comprehensive sense, such as in actual sales conversions or long-term brand loyalty.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Yes, this also applies because the cause of increased effectiveness is attributed to TV without sufficient reasoning to rule out other factors or because the relationship between the metrics provided and actual effectiveness is not adequately established.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This argument doesn't involve repeating a proposition in place of providing the evidence.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The argument does not suggest consensus without evidence, so this doesn't apply here.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** The language used is relatively clear and specific (e.g., "twice the audience", "38 percent more"), not ambiguous.

Based on the analysis, the defective argument types present in this statement include:
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Failing to consider all relevant factors.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Assuming that the provided data points irrefutably establish effectiveness.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Not adequately proving that TV advertisement is the definitive cause of the perceived effectiveness.
