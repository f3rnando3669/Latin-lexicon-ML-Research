For 
The defective argument types discussed have specific characteristics that can undermine the validity or soundness of an argument. Given the example:

"I. The Ganges river is flooded due to large sheets of ice coming down from the Himalayas.
II. Many people in the Himalayan ranges lost their houses under huge sheets of ice."

We analyze this using the <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Applications) approach to see if any of the defined defective argument types apply.

1. **<G> (Generalization):**
   - This involves drawing a broad conclusion from a small or unrepresentative sample. The given statements do not seem to engage in generalization explicitly.

2. **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):**
   - This is when an argument presents only some of the evidence while ignoring other pieces that might contradict it. The statements provided do not show signs of this defective type since they aren't listing reasons or pieces of evidence selectively.

3. **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):**
   - This occurs when the reason given does not conclusively support the conclusion. In the provided example, this might be relevant. The reasons given in statements I and II do not link conclusively. Just because there are ice sheets causing problems in the Himalayas (II) does not conclusively explain the flooding of the Ganges (I). Other factors may cause the flooding, so this could be an inconclusive reason.

4. **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):**
   - A claim made without enough basis to firmly establish a causal relationship. The example could fall under this type since the flooding of the Ganges (I) is attributed to ice from the Himalayas (II) without sufficient evidence or basis demonstrating that this is indeed the primary cause.

5. **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):**
   - This is when an argument repeats the proposition without providing additional support or evidence. This defective argument type does not seem applicable to the given example since there is no repetition of the proposition.

6. **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):**
   - It assumes a consensus where none has been proven. This does not appear applicable in this case, as the statements do not claim any sort of consensus.

7. **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language):**
   - This occurs when the argument uses ambiguous or unclear language, leading to misunderstandings. While "large sheets of ice" is somewhat vague, it's not markedly ambiguous to the point of fitting this defective type exhaustively.

**Conclusion of <IDAA> Analysis**:
- The given statements most likely embody the defective arguments types <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis). The reasoning provided does not conclusively link the ice sheets in the Himalayas to the flooding of the Ganges, and there is insufficient causal basis provided to firmly tie these elements together.
