For 
To apply the process of Identifying Defective Argumentation Attributes (IDAA) to the statement "Because Martin Sheen played the president on television, he'd probably make a great president in real life," let's examine the types of defective arguments defined and see which are applicable:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument could be seen as a generalization because it takes Sheen's portrayal of a president and generalizes that he would be good at the actual role. However, it’s more of an incorrect analogy than a generalization.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This argument does not enumerate all the necessary skills or qualities needed to be an actual president, instead relying solely on an acting role, which is an incomplete consideration of required attributes.
  
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason given (acting as a president on television) is inconclusive for establishing one's capability to be an effective president in reality because acting skills and political skills are not necessarily correlated.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There's an insufficient causal basis to claim that acting as a president implies one would be a good president. The skills and environment of acting are entirely different from those required for political leadership.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This type of defective argument doesn’t seem to apply here as there's no repetition inherent to the proposition itself.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument doesn’t imply a broader consensus or assume that others would support this view without evidence, so FU does not seem to apply directly.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language here isn’t particularly vague or ambiguous; it clearly connects the role of an actor to a real-life profession, albeit incorrectly.

Considering these points, the most relevant defective argument types for the statement "Because Martin Sheen played the president on television, he'd probably make a great president in real life" are:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** - because it doesn’t consider the full range of skills required to be an actual president.
   
2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** - because the acting experience is an inconclusive reason for being a good president in reality.

3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** - because there's no sufficient causal link between acting as a president and being a competent president in real life.

Thus, the correct application of IDAA would be as follows: 

"Because Martin Sheen played the president on television, he'd probably make a great president in real life" can be identified as containing defective argumentation due to **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
