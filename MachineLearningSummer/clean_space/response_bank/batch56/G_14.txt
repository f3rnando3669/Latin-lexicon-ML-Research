In the defective argument analysis, <IDAA> stands for "Identify Defective Argument Attributes." Let's apply this process to the given argument: 

"Some students who attend tutoring over the summer are not very intelligent. Since Beth attended summer tutoring, she is not a very good student."

1. **Generalization (<G>):**

   The argument makes a broad generalization based on a subset of students. It implies that because some students who attend tutoring are not very intelligent, this characteristic is true for all students who attend summer tutoring. This is a classic example of overgeneralization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**

   The argument does not provide enough evidence. Just saying "some students" doesn't warrant the conclusion that Beth is not intelligent. It fails to enumerate the relevant factors sufficiently to support this specific conclusion.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**

   The reasoning is inconclusive. The statement that some students who attend tutoring are not very intelligent does not logically lead to the conclusion that Beth, a student who attended summer tutoring, is not intelligent. The premises do not adequately support the conclusion.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**

   There is an insufficient causal basis for the argument. The mere attendance of tutoring does not causally relate to a student's intelligence. No causal link is proven between attending tutoring and lacking intelligence.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**

   While the argument repeats the theme of intelligence and tutoring, it doesn't fit the classic definition of faulty repetition. It primarily suffers from other defects like generalization and incomplete enumeration.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**

   The argument assumes a consensus or common belief without actual evidence. It presumes that attending tutoring over the summer inherently suggests a lack of intelligence, which isn't supported by any consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**

   The term "very intelligent" and "not a very good student" are ambiguous and subjective. They lack clear, precise definitions, making the argument weak and open to multiple interpretations.

By identifying these defective argument attributes, we see multiple flaws in the reasoning provided: generalization, incomplete enumeration, inconclusive reasoning, insufficient causal basis, presumptuous consensus, and ambiguous language, all contribute to the defective nature of the argument.
