For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Applications. Let's identify the defective arguments in the statement:

"We've got to stop them from banning pornography. Once they start banning one form of literature, they will never stop. Next thing you know, they will be burning all the books!"

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - This argument type appears in the implication that banning one type of literature (pornography) will inevitably lead to banning all forms of literature. This overgeneralizes the consequences without sufficient evidence that one ban will lead directly to such an extreme outcome.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The argument suggests that banning pornography will directly lead to the banning of all books. This overlooks other factors or potential checks and balances in place that could prevent such a progression. It simplifies the issue without considering alternative outcomes or intermediate steps.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The reasoning presented is inconclusive because it assumes a slippery slope without providing concrete evidence that one action will definitively lead to the next. The causation between banning pornography and burning all books is asserted but not substantiated.

In summary, the statement relies on <G> (Generalization), <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration), and <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) types of defective arguments.
