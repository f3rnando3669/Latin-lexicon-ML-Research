The argument presented appears to be based on a slippery slope fallacy, in which a relatively small first step is assumed to lead to a chain of related events culminating in a significant (often negative) outcome that is not necessarily supported by evidence.

Given your list of defective argument types, we can find a match for this fallacy under one of the provided definitions. Specifically, this argument type fits well under:

**<IR> Inconclusive Reason**

Here's how it applies:
- The argument claims that not graduating students on time will inevitably lead to increased crime rates and societal collapse. This reasoning is inconclusive because it assumes a direct, inevitable progression from one event to another without providing sufficient evidence to support these connections.

So, applying the defective argument type ID (Inconclusive Reason) to this argument:

"We can’t freeze the academic year because then students won’t graduate on time. Next thing you know most people will be unemployed and will resort to crime. The crime rate will skyrocket and society will collapse.
No podemos congelar el año académico porque entonces los estudiantes no se graduarán a tiempo. Lo siguiente que sabes es que la mayoría de la gente estará desempleada y recurrirá al crimen. La tasa de criminalidad se disparará y la sociedad colapsará."

This argument is classified as:
<IDAA IR>
