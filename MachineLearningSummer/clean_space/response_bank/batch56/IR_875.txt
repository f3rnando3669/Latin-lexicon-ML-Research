For 
Sure, let's analyze the argument "The Tooth Fairy is real because nobody has proven she doesn't exist." using the defective argument types defined:

- The argument is suggesting that something is true simply because it has not been proven false. This is a common logical fallacy known as the **Argument from Ignorance** (or **Argumentum ad Ignorantiam**).

The defective argument types you provided do not explicitly list "Argument from Ignorance," but based on the provided definitions, the most closely related one might be:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This is likely the most relevant category because the argument here relies on a lack of evidence against the claim rather than presenting a conclusive reason for the claim itself.

Therefore, the statement "The Tooth Fairy is real because nobody has proven she doesn't exist" falls under the defective argument type **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
