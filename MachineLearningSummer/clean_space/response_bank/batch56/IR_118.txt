For 
The argument presented by Bob has the characteristics of the following defective argument types:

1. **Defective Argument Type: Generalization (<G>)**
   - Bob is making a broad generalization based on a single example of a scientist who questions evolution. He implies that because one scientist questions evolution, it signifies a widespread issue or a legitimate challenge to the theory.

2. **Defective Argument Type: Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
   - By mentioning only one scientist who questions evolution, Bob is not considering the much larger number of scientists who support the theory of evolution. This is an example of an incomplete enumeration, where relevant cases or data points are omitted.

3. **Defective Argument Type: Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
   - Citing a single scientist's skepticism as evidence for his position that evolution "isn't true" is inconclusive. The reasoning Bob provides does not definitively support his conclusion because the credibility of one scientist alone is not sufficient evidence against a well-supported scientific theory.

4. **Defective Argument Type: Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**
   - Bob's argument might also be seen as a faulty repetition of a proposition since repeating that a scientist questions evolution does not strengthen the argument without additional compelling evidence or context.

5. **Defective Argument Type: Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
   - Bob may be assuming that because he knows a scientist who questions evolution, this reflects a broader consensus or significant dissent within the scientific community, which is an overreach.

Here is the identification in the applied context:

***"Not able to defend his position that evolution 'isn't true' Bob says that he knows a scientist who also questions evolution (and presumably isn't a primate)."***
- <G>: By referring to one scientist's opinion, Bob generalizes it to imply a significant challenge to the theory of evolution.
- <FE>: Bob's reference to one scientist ignores the vast majority of scientists who support evolution, which is an incomplete enumeration.
- <IR>: The reasoning provided by Bob is inconclusive since a single dissenting opinion does not refute the extensive evidence supporting evolution.
- <RR>: Repeating the proposition that a scientist questions evolution does not make the argument stronger or more valid.
- <FU>: Presuming consensus based on one example is unjustified and presumptuous.

Thus, Bob's argument reflects multiple defective argument types, including Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, and Presumptuous Consensus.
