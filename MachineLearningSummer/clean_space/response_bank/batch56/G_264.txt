For 
The sentence in question, "I've never knowingly listened to a Neil Young record all the way through because they all sound like someone strangling a cat (don't they?)," can be analyzed for defective arguments as follows:

**Generalization (G)**:
- The speaker is making a broad assertion that all Neil Young records sound like someone strangling a cat. This is a form of *Generalization* because it jumps to a conclusion about all of Neil Young’s music based on an undefined or potentially very limited experience.

**Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
- The statement doesn’t take into account the variety in Neil Young’s music. Neil Young has a diverse discography, and the assertion doesn’t reflect different albums, songs, or styles he might have.

**Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
- The phrase "they all sound like someone strangling a cat" is repeated without providing evidence or a logical basis for why the speaker believes this about Neil Young’s music.

**Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
- The tag "(don't they?)" suggests that the speaker expects others to share this opinion, implying a consensus without any supporting evidence. This can be seen as attempting to create a presumption that this view is widely accepted or self-evident, which is a *Presumptuous Consensus*.

Let's label the defective argument types for the given sentence:

1. **Generalization (G)**
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
3. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
4. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**

In summary, the statement "I've never knowingly listened to a Neil Young record all the way through because they all sound like someone strangling a cat (don't they?)" embodies multiple defective argument types: *Generalization (G)*, *Incomplete Enumeration (FE)*, *Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)*, and *Presumptuous Consensus (FU)*.
