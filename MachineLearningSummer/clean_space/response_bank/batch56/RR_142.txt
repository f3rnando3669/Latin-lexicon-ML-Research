For 
Let's break down the claim "The Philippines is in poverty because of poor people." using the defined defective argument types:

1. **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**: The phrase "poor people" is ambiguous. It doesn't clarify what is meant by "poor people". Are they contributing to poverty or are they the result of poverty? The term lacks contextual precision.

2. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: The argument makes an assertion about cause (poor people causing poverty) without sufficient causal basis. Poverty is a complex issue influenced by multiple factors such as government policies, economic conditions, and social systems, not merely the presence of poor people.

3. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The reasoning provided is inconclusive. It states that the presence of poor people is the reason for the country's poverty, but does not account for other contributing factors or provide evidence to support this claim.

4. **<G> Generalization**: The statement makes a generalization that poverty in the Philippines is solely due to poor people. This overlooks the diversity of conditions and causes across different regions and populations.

The provided argument can be classified under multiple defective argument types, primarily **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**, **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**, **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**, and **<G> Generalization**.
