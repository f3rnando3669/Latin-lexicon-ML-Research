Applying Defective Arguments Analysis (IDAA) to the given sentence "The Bible is the Word of God because God tells us it is... in the Bible." reveals the following defective arguments:

1. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The statement repeats the premise within the conclusion in a circular manner, i.e., the Bible is claimed to be the Word of God because the Bible itself asserts it.

2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The argument assumes a causal relationship (the Bible is the Word of God because God says so in the Bible), but it doesn't provide adequate justification or causal linkage outside the text itself.

These two types of defective arguments illustrate the primary issues with this reasoning.
