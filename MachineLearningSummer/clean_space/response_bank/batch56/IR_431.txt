For 
<IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Attributes) involves analyzing the given argument to identify any defective argument types present. Let's break down the argument provided:

"The Supreme Court right now is deciding whether it is right to execute insane people who have committed murder. I think it is all right to execute insane people. If we ban executions of insane people, then everybody on death row will suddenly decide they are insane and purposely fail sanity tests. It would result in chaos."

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - **Faulty Generalization**: The assumption is made that if executions of insane people are banned, everyone on death row will suddenly claim insanity. This is a broad and unsupported generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - **Incomplete Analysis of Possible Outcomes**: The argument does not consider other possible measures to verify true insanity, diagnostic improvements, or the fact that not all inmates might feign insanity.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The reasoning provided is highly speculative and not necessarily grounded in evidence. There is no significant proof presented to support the claim that banning executions of insane people will result in chaos.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - The causal link between banning executions of insane people and the ensuing chaos is weak. There is insufficient evidence provided that this outcome will definitely occur.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - While not repetitively stated, the argument reiterates the same conclusion (executing insane people is all right) without substantial differentiation or additional logical support.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - There is an implied assumption that people, in general, would agree with the chaos theory outcome, but this is not substantiated with evidence or consensus from relevant authorities.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - Terms like "chaos" and "fail sanity tests purposely" are used ambiguously without clear definition or elaboration on what specific measures would be in place, how sanity tests can be manipulated, and the systemic checks to prevent such purported chaos.

So, summarizing the identified defective argument attributes:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Making broad, unsupported generalizations about behaviors of death row prisoners.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Failing to consider all possible solutions and outcomes.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Providing speculative reasons without solid evidence.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Weak causal link between the proposed ban and the predicted chaos.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Reaffirming the conclusion without new logical premises.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Assuming general agreement with the chaos prediction without supporting evidence.
7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: Using vague terms like "chaos" and "fail sanity tests" without clear definition.
