For 
<IDI> stands for *Identify and Define Argumentative Approach*. It seems like there might have been a typographical error or confusion in your request, as <IDAA> was not defined among the defective argument types you provided. However, I will analyze the statement "This type of ad taps into a person's desire to be part of a group" using the defective argument types defined:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This statement is not necessarily a generalization because it speaks about a specific type of ad rather than making a broad claim about all advertisements.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement does not attempt to enumerate causes or reasons, so it does not fit this defective argument type.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The statement might partially fit under inconclusive reason without additional evidence or context. It claims that this type of ad affects a person’s desire, but doesn’t provide any justification or proof for why this is the case. 

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This argument type could also be applicable here. The statement suggests a causal relationship (that the ad's effect is due to tapping into the desire to be part of a group), which might be insufficiently supported.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This does not apply, as the statement doesn’t repeat propositions or arguments.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The statement does not imply that there is a consensus or that everyone agrees with it. Therefore, this defective argument type does not apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The phrase "desire to be part of a group" can be somewhat broad and might be interpreted differently depending on the context. This makes the statement potentially ambiguous.

In summary, the statement "This type of ad taps into a person's desire to be part of a group" might fit under the defective argument types of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, and possibly **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**.
