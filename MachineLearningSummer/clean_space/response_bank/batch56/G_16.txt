For 
<IDAA> can be applied to the argument presented. Here's a breakdown:

Argument Statement:
"Jason said that that was all cool and everything, but his grandfather smoked, like, 30 cigarettes a day and lived until 97 - so don't believe everything you read about meta analyses of methodologically sound studies showing proven causal relationships."

Analysis of Defective Arguments:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - **Definition:** This defective argument uses a particular example or small number of examples to draw a general rule.
   - **Application:** Jason’s argument generalizes from the single anecdote of his grandfather living a long life despite heavy smoking to dismiss broad scientific findings. The exceptional case of his grandfather does not invalidate the overall statistical evidence from numerous studies.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - **Definition:** This argument type involves making an assertion based on an incomplete representation of necessary instances or cases.
   - **Application:** The argument does not account for the population as a whole and overlooks numerous other incidences where smoking led to severe health problems and reduced life expectancy. It cherry-picks a single deviant case.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - **Definition:** Using a reason that does not adequately support the conclusion drawn.
   - **Application:** The reason given (the grandfather's long life) does not conclusively prove the overall safety of smoking or refute meta-analyses. It's an isolated event rather than a statistically sound basis to oppose scientific consensus.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - **Definition:** Claiming a causal relationship with insufficient evidence to support it.
   - **Application:** Implicitly suggesting that smoking does not generally cause harm, based on one case, disregards the strong causal relationship established between smoking and health risks via extensive research.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - **Definition:** Repeating a proposition in different words without arguing its merits substantively.
   - **Application:** Jason’s assertion could be seen as reiterating a commonly propagated myth (that individual long-lived smokers disprove scientific findings) rather than presenting new evidence. However, this does not robustly apply if his argument is not circular but merely anecdotal.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - **Definition:** Assuming consensus or agreement without adequate evidence.
   - **Application:** The statement might reflect a presumptive dismissal of the scientific consensus without fair consideration of the evidence. However, it's more about using isolated evidence than presuming consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - **Definition:** Using vague or ambiguous language that leads to confusion or misunderstanding.
   - **Application:** The argument language is relatively straightforward, focusing instead on anecdote versus scientific data. Ambiguity does not heavily feature here.

In conclusion, the argument primarily demonstrates the defective arguments of **Generalization (<G>)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**, **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**. It predominantly misleads by using a particular exceptional case to counter robust scientific analysis and findings.
