For 
The statement "Yesterday, you were late for ten minutes. Today you were late for an hour. You know someday, you will simply cease to show up." can be analyzed to identify the defective argument type. 

Here's the breakdown:
- The argument starts with specific instances of being late (yesterday for ten minutes, today for an hour).
- It then concludes that someday the person will stop showing up entirely.

This conclusion is drawn from very limited specific instances and makes a broad, sweeping prediction about future behavior.

By applying the definitions of defective arguments, this statement is an example of <G> Generalization. This is because it takes a few instances of behavior and generalizes them to predict an extreme outcome without sufficient evidence to support such a conclusion.

Therefore, the logical fallacy used in the statement above is a Generalization (<G>).
