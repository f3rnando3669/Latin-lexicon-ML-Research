For 
The statement "The medicine man rolled into town on his bandwagon offering various natural remedies, such as very special plain water. He said that it was only natural that people should be wary of 'artificial' medicines such as antibiotics." can be analyzed using the defective argument types you've defined.

1. **<G> Generalization**: The argument could be seen as a generalization by suggesting that all natural remedies are inherently better or safer than artificial medicines like antibiotics. This overlooks the fact that many artificial medicines are thoroughly tested and have a clear scientific basis for their efficacy and safety.

2. **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: The argument assumes that all "artificial" medicines such as antibiotics are something people should be wary of, without considering that there are numerous artificial medicines that have been proven effective and safe through rigorous scientific research.

3. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The reason given for being wary of artificial medicines ("it's only natural") is not conclusive. The statement does not provide a solid, evidence-based reason to distrust antibiotics, which are critical drugs in modern medicine.

4. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: The argument lacks a causal basis for claiming that natural remedies are better or safer than artificial medicines. It doesn't provide evidence or a mechanism by which natural remedies outperform scientifically validated treatments like antibiotics.

5. **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: The medicine manâ€™s reiteration that natural remedies are preferable and artificial medicines should be avoided repeats a proposition without substantiating it with concrete evidence. This repetition does not make the argument any stronger.

6. **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: The argument implies a consensus that people should be wary of artificial medicines without supporting this consensus with data or evidence. It presupposes agreement where there might not be any, thus appealing to an assumed but unsupported opinion.

7. **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**: The term "natural" is used ambiguously. What qualifies remedies as "natural" can be subjective and varies greatly. Additionally, saying people should be wary of "artificial" medicines like antibiotics uses the term "artificial" ambiguously, which could unjustly bias people's opinions against scientifically-formulated drugs.

By analyzing the statement using these defective argument types, we can see that the argument presented by the medicine man is flawed in multiple respects, lacking solid evidence, and using ambiguous terms and unfounded generalizations.
