For 
To analyze the argument "My car broke down yesterday. Cars are worthless." in terms of the defective argument types defined:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument takes a single instance (the car breaking down yesterday) and makes a broad, sweeping statement about all cars. This is a classic case of overgeneralizing from insufficient data.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument fails to consider other possible scenarios or instances where cars have been reliable. It jumps to a conclusion based on an incomplete enumeration of all experiences with cars.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument provides an inconclusive reason. The fact that one car broke down does not inherently mean that all cars are worthless. The reason given does not support the conclusion adequately.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Assuming that the breakdown of one car implies a general characteristic of all cars lacks sufficient causal basis. There is no adequate causation established between one breakdown and the worthlessness of all cars.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This argument does not involve repetition of a proposition, so this type does not apply here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There is no claim in the argument that assumes a consensus or majority opinion, so this type does not apply in this case.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The terms used in the argument, such as "worthless," can be quite subjective and ambiguous, leading to different interpretations. However, the primary issue seems to be more related to overgeneralization rather than ambiguity.

Therefore, the argument can primarily be evaluated using the following defective argument types:

- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

Thus, the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, and <WCB> apply most directly to the given statement.
