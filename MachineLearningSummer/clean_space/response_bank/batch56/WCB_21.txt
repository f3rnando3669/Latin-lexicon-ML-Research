For 
To analyze the given argument "I believe in supernatural beings because every time I drive past the cemetery where my grandmother is buried, a light on my dashboard flashes. Her spirit causes this because it never happens otherwise." using the defined defective argument types <IDAA>, we need to identify which specific defective argument types apply to it individually:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This occurs when a broad conclusion is drawn from a small or unrepresentative sample.
   - The argument does not attempt to generalize about all supernatural beings from this single instance, so this type does not apply here.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This happens when the argument overlooks alternative explanations.
   - The argument overlooks numerous potential explanations for why the dashboard light might flash, such as electrical issues or roadway bumps. **<FE> applies here**.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Occurs when the provided evidence does not sufficiently support the conclusion.
   - The argument uses the dashboard light flashing as evidence for the existence of supernatural beings, which is insufficient and inconclusive. **<IR> applies here**.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This occurs when the argument lacks a sufficient causal connection.
   - There is no substantial evidence presented to support the claim that the grandmotherâ€™s spirit causes the dashboard light to flash. **<WCB> applies here**.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This happens when the conclusion is simply repeated without further justification.
   - The argument does not simply repeat itself; it provides specific instances (the light flashing). So, this type does not apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Occurs when it is presumed that a belief is true because many people believe it.
   - The argument does not rely on presumptuous consensus; it relies on personal experience. So, this type does not apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This occurs when the argument uses unclear or vague terms.
   - The argument does not seem to rely heavily on ambiguous language. Therefore, this type does not apply.

Based on the analysis, the defective argument types that apply to "I believe in supernatural beings because every time I drive past the cemetery where my grandmother is buried, a light on my dashboard flashes. Her spirit causes this because it never happens otherwise." are:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
