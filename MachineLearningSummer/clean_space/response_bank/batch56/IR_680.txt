Applying the various defective argument types (DAA) to the conversation between Billy and Marty involves identifying which types of reasoning errors each statement might involve. Here’s an analysis:

**IDAA** stands for **Identifying Defective Argument Application**.

1. **Billy: "How could the universe be 6000 years old when we know the speed of light, the distance of astronomical objects (13+ billion light years away), and the fact that the light has reached us?"**

   **Evaluation:** Billy is pointing out a logical inconsistency between the age of the universe and the astronomical observations.
   
   **Analysis:** This statement does not appear to contain a defective argument; it poses a legitimate scientific inquiry.

2. **Marty: "6000 years is not a firm number. The universe can be as old as about 10,000 years."**

   **Evaluation:** Marty is shifting the goalposts of the argument by changing the specific age from 6000 years to approximately 10,000 years without addressing Billy's scientific points.

   **Analysis:**
   - **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):** Marty doesn’t account for the full range of scientific evidence about the age of the universe, only shifting the range arbitrarily without substantiating the claim.
   - **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** Marty’s assertion lacks sufficient justification and fails to address the astronomical evidence Billy provided.

3. **Billy: "How do you figure that?"**

   **Evaluation:** Billy is asking for Marty to provide evidence or reasoning for his claim.

   **Analysis:** This is a reasonable request for support and does not contain a defective argument.

### Summary of Defective Argument Applications (IDAA):
- **Marty’s statement, "6000 years is not a firm number. The universe can be as old as about 10,000 years," contains:**
  - **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**
  - **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**

In sum, Marty's response seems to include defective argumentative types of <FE> and <WCB> because it modifies the original claim without addressing the underlying scientific evidence and fails to provide a sufficient causal basis for the new claim.
