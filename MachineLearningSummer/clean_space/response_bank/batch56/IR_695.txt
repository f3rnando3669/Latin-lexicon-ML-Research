Applying the classification of defective arguments:

**Argument:** "This theory originally occurred to a scientist in the form of a dream; therefore it cannot be valid."

This argument implies that because the theory originated from a dream, it must be false or invalid. This conclusion doesn't follow logically from the premise. The origin of a theory doesn't necessarily determine its validity; a theory's validity is established through evidence, reasoning, and verification.

**Defective Argument Type:** 

- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: This argument falls under the category of <IR> because it provides a reason ("the theory came from a dream") that is not sufficient to conclusively determine the validity of the theory. The origin of an idea does not inherently affect its truth or falsity; thus, the reason given is inconclusive with respect to the argument's conclusion.
