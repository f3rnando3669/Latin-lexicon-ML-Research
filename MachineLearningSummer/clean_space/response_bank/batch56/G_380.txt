For 
The defective argument type "IDAA" refers to the statement that uses flawed reasoning to reach its conclusion. Since the provided argument states "Major in English in college, start reading poetry, and next thing you know, you will become an unemployed pot-smoking loser," it fits the definition of several defective argument types:

1. Generalization <G>: The argument makes a sweeping generalization by implying that studying English and reading poetry will lead a person to become an "unemployed pot-smoking loser." This is a classic example of overgeneralizing from limited experiences or stereotypes.

2. Inconclusive Reason <IR>: The argument's reasoning is inconclusive because it does not provide any substantive connection or evidence to support the claim that majoring in English and reading poetry will lead to unemployment and drug use. It assumes causation where there is none.

3. Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>: The argument suggests a causal relationship without adequate evidence to support it. Simply majoring in English and reading poetry do not directly cause unemployment or drug use; many other factors contribute to one's career and lifestyle choices, and this connection is unjustified.

Thus, the argument "Major in English in college, start reading poetry, and next thing you know, you will become an unemployed pot-smoking loser" fits the defective argument types of Generalization <G>, Inconclusive Reason <IR>, and Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>.
