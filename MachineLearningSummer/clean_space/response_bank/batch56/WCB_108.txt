For 
When applying the Defective Argument Analysis Approach (<IDAA>) to the statement *"Because I forgot to leave my porch light on, someone robbed my house,"* we need to analyze it in the context of the defined defective argument types. Here’s an analysis of this argument:

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - This argument assumes a direct causal relationship between forgetting to leave the porch light on and the house being robbed. However, while a lit porch might deter some criminals, it is not necessarily a sufficient cause for the robbery. There could be many other factors involved (like neighborhood crime rates, visible valuables, etc.) which are not considered here.
   - Evaluation: *<WCB> applies because the argument lacks a sufficient basis to claim that the absence of the porch light directly caused the robbery.*

2. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The statement might also be seen as a form of generalization, implying that forgetting to leave a porch light on will result in a robbery. This is an oversimplified view that doesn’t account for the numerous other factors that contribute to criminal activity.
   - Evaluation: *<G> applies as the argument makes an overgeneralization by linking a single event (forgetting the porch light) to a specific outcome (robbery).*

By applying these analyses, we identify that the primary defective argument types in the statement *"Because I forgot to leave my porch light on, someone robbed my house"* are *Insufficient Causal Basis* and *Generalization*.

**Conclusion:**
The statement incorrectly assumes a simple cause-effect relationship and overgeneralizes the effect of leaving the porch light off, qualifying it as *<WCB>* and *<G>*.
