The argument mentioned:

"I see no reason to listen to Smith. Anything he says will be influenced by his interest in civil rights. His statements are bound to be distorted and unreliable."

is primarily an example of **Ad Hominem**. An Ad Hominem fallacy attacks the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, rather than addressing the substance of the argument itself.

Here's how it applies in this context: 

1. The statement dismisses Smith's arguments based on Smith's interest in civil rights without addressing the actual content or validity of Smith's arguments.
2. It assumes that Smithâ€™s bias makes any statement he makes distorted and unreliable, without providing evidence that his specific claims are false.

This logical fallacy distracts from the argument by attacking Smith's character or motives rather than engaging with his actual arguments.

Therefore, the logical fallacy made in the statement is **Ad Hominem**.
