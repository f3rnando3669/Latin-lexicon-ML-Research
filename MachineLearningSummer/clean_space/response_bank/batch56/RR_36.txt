For 
IDAA refers to Identifying Defective Argument Archetypes.

Given the argument "This legislation is sinful because it is the wrong thing to do," we can analyze it through the lens of defective argument types:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
    - The argument states that the legislation is sinful without providing concrete reasons or evidence. Simply calling it "the wrong thing to do" doesn't offer a substantial basis for why itâ€™s sinful.
    - **IR** applies because the reasoning is circular and inconclusive, lacking specific support for the claim.

2. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
    - The terms "sinful" and "the wrong thing to do" are vague and carry various interpretations depending on individual belief systems and moral frameworks.
    - **DEP** applies as the argument relies on ambiguous and subjective language, making it less precise and more open to interpretation.

Thus, applying **IDAA** to "This legislation is sinful because it is the wrong thing to do," the argument employs **IR** (Inconclusive Reason) due to its circular nature and **DEP** (Ambiguous Language) due to its use of vague terms.
