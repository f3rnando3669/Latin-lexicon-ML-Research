To evaluate whether the arguments provided are defective and to classify them according to the given defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>), let's analyze each argument one by one.

### Argument 1
"Hydrogen is not wet. Oxygen is not wet. Therefore, water (H2O) is not wet."

1. **Generalization (G):** This argument generalizes the properties of individual components (hydrogen and oxygen) to the compound (water). However, the properties of compounds can be different from those of their individual elements.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This argument assumes only two specific properties (hydrogen being not wet and oxygen being not wet) without considering how they interact to form water, which indeed has different properties.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reasoning here is inconclusive because the conclusion drawn about the nature of water doesnâ€™t necessarily follow from the premises about hydrogen and oxygen.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal relationship between the properties of hydrogen and oxygen and the properties of water lacks sufficient basis because the combination of hydrogen and oxygen creates a new substance with different properties.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Not applicable here, as the argument is not just repeating the initial statement.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Not applicable here, as no consensus or presumption about general belief is employed.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** There is no evident ambiguous language in terms of specific wording, but the leap in logic may create confusion.

**Conclusion:** The argument mainly suffers from <G> - Generalization and <WCB> - Insufficient Causal Basis, because it falsely applies properties of individual components to a compound and does not provide sufficient causal understanding of how combining those elements results in water being wet.

### Argument 2
"Your brain is made of molecules. Molecules are not the source of consciousness. Therefore, your brain cannot be the source of consciousness."

1. **Generalization (G):** The argument improperly generalizes the properties of individual molecules (not being sources of consciousness) to the collective system (the brain), which may have properties not present in the individual components.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This is incomplete because it only considers the property of molecules individually without considering the emergent properties that arise when they work together in a complex system like the brain.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reasoning is inconclusive because it does not sufficiently address how the complex interactions of molecules can give rise to consciousness, a more emergent property.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The argument lacks sufficient causal basis because it assumes that consciousness cannot arise from molecules when combined in a specific structure, without addressing the complexities of such combinations.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Not applicable here, as the argument is not simply repeating the initial premise.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Not applicable here, as no consensus or presumption about general belief is employed.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** There is no evident ambiguous language in terms of specific wording, but the leap in logic may create confusion.

**Conclusion:** The argument mainly suffers from <G> - Generalization and <WCB> - Insufficient Causal Basis, because it incorrectly applies the properties of individual molecules to the brain as a whole and does not provide enough causal reasoning regarding the emergence of consciousness.

Thus, both arguments suffer predominantly from <G> (Generalization) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis), along with elements of <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration) and <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
