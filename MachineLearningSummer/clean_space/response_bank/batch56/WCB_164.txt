For 
The argument in question is: “Every time I wash my car it rains, therefore, washing my car makes it rain.”

To apply the analysis, we will evaluate if this argument fits any of the defective argument types defined earlier:

1. **Generalization (<G>)** - This argument doesn't necessarily fit the definition of a generalization. It doesn't apply a broad statement to a specific case from isolated instances. Instead, it's making a causal claim.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** - This argument considers only instances where washing the car preceded rainfall and ignores all other instances where washing the car either did not occur or did not lead to rain, making an incomplete conclusion based on selective evidence.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** - The correlation between washing the car and rain does not establish a conclusive reason for causation, making this argument inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** - The argument claims a causal relationship without sufficient evidence to support it. There’s no clear mechanism shown for why washing a car would cause rain.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)** - The argument does not repeatedly assert the same proposition for proof. Thus, it does not fall under this category.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)** - The argument does not appeal to a consensus or general opinion to claim its validity, so this category isn’t relevant.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)** - The argument does not employ ambiguous language; the terms "wash my car" and "it rains" are clear.

So, evaluating the argument:
"Every time I wash my car it rains, therefore, washing my car makes it rain."

We can categorize it primarily under:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The arguer selectively looks at instances where car washing coincides with rain and ignores other instances.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument asserts a cause-and-effect relationship without sufficient justification for such a conclusion.

Therefore, the defective argument types for the given statement would be <FE> and <WCB>.
