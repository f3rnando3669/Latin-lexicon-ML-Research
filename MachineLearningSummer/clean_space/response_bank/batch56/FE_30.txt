For 
To analyze the given argument by applying <IDAA> (Identification of Defective Argument Application), we need to look for instances of the defective argument types defined earlier. Let's break down the argument step by step:

1. "You've got to teach the boys logic! If you don't teach them logic, they won't learn how to think! And they'll become hobos and die in prison! Don't you care about your sons?"

From there, we can identify the following defects:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - The claim that not teaching logic will necessarily lead to becoming hobos and dying in prison is a sweeping generalization. Not learning logic doesn't universally result in such extreme outcomes.
     - Example: "If you don't teach them logic, they won't learn how to think! And they'll become hobos and die in prison!"

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (IE)**:
   - The argument assumes the only way to learn how to think is by being taught logic explicitly, ignoring other methods or educational subjects that can develop critical thinking skills.
     - Example: "If you don't teach them logic, they won't learn how to think!"

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - There's no definitive evidence presented that ties not learning logic directly to becoming hobos and dying in prison. The reasoning is not substantiated.
     - Example: There is no direct evidence supporting the claim that lack of logic instruction leads to being a hobo and dying in prison.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - The argument implies a direct causation between not learning logic and dire consequences like becoming a hobo or dying in prison, which is not sufficiently supported by causal reasoning.
     - Example: "If you don't teach them logic, they won't learn how to think!" and the subsequent outcomes.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - The argument doesn’t seem to fall into faulty repetition within the provided text itself.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - There are no indications in the argument that a consensus is presumed or cited to support the claims.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - The language used in the argument isn't ambiguous; it’s hyperbolic but clear in intent.

In summary, the argument contains the following defective argument types:

- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (IE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
