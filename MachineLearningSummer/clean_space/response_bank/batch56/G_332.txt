For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Types Applied.

Now let's analyze the given statement:

"An NSA whistle-blower, William Binney, said last week that the agency’s surveillance activities put us on 'a slippery slope toward a totalitarian state'"

1. **Defective Argument Analysis:**

   **- Generalization (G):** This could be considered a Generalization because it extrapolates the potential progression from surveillance activities to a totalitarian state without necessarily providing sufficient evidence for such a sweeping conclusion. However, "Generalization" tends to be used when a small sample is used to make a broad conclusion, whereas this statement is more a slippery slope.

   **- Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This does not seem like an Incomplete Enumeration, as it doesn’t list multiple factors; it focuses solely on surveillance activities.

   **- Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This could be an Inconclusive Reason since it presents a drastic potential outcome ("totalitarian state") as a logical progression based on an interpretation or opinion without presenting a firm basis or evidence connecting each step in the progression.

   **- Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This might be Insufficient Causal Basis, as the statement suggests a causal relationship between surveillance activities and the development of a totalitarian state without providing detailed causal mechanisms or evidence for such a connection.

   **- Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This does not seem to be a Faulty Repetition of a Proposition, as it presents a single statement rather than repeating an invalid or misleading proposition.

   **- Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This is not claiming any consensus, so it does not fall under Presumptuous Consensus.

   **- Ambiguous Language (DEP):** There is an element of Ambiguous Language with the phrase "slippery slope," which is metaphorical and could be considered overly vague or emotionally charged rather than precise.

2. **Application of IDAA:**

   - The argument can be primarily classified under **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because it suggests a severe outcome without sufficiently connecting each step of the argument thoroughly.
   - It may also fall under **Ambiguous Language (DEP)** due to the use of the phrase "slippery slope," which introduces vagueness and emotional connotation rather than clear, precise reasoning.
   - Lastly, it involves an **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** as it lacks a detailed explanation of how surveillance directly leads to totalitarianism.

Therefore, the statement can be marked as IR, DEP, and WCB.
