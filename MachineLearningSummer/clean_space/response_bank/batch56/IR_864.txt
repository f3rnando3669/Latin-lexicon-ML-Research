For 
<IDAA> refers to a defective argument type called "Irrelevant Discreditation of the Argument's Advocate." Here's the application of <IDAA> to the given argument:

The son argues that the father's advice against smoking is invalid because the father himself is a smoker. This argument attempts to discredit the father's advice by pointing out an inconsistency in the father's behavior rather than addressing the substance of the advice itself. Therefore, this is an example of <IDAA>.

For clarity:
"A father tells his son not to start smoking as he will regret it when he is older, and the son points out that his father is a smoker. This does not alter the fact that his son may regret smoking when he is older." This scenario illustrates <IDAA> because the son's response is an attempt to discredit the father's argument by attacking the father's credibility, without addressing the actual merits or evidence of the argument itself.
