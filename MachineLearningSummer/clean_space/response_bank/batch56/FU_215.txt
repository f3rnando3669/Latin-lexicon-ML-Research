For 
To apply the <IDAA> analysis to the statement "That politician wants you to think he loves America. His last rally had 20 American flags flying behind him" and identify which type of defective argument it represents, let's break down and analyze the assertion:

1. **Generalization (G):** This involves making a broad conclusion based on limited evidence. There may be a hasty conclusion that the politician loves America solely because of the presence of flags.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This involves selectively presenting evidence and ignoring other relevant factors. The conclusion is based only on the number of flags but does not consider other actions or statements of the politician.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This is when the provided reason does not necessarily lead to the conclusion. Having many flags does not conclusively prove love for the country.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This involves assuming a causal relationship without sufficient evidence. The presence of flags does not necessarily cause one to believe the politician loves America.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This is repeating a proposition without valid argument. The flags are essentially used to repeat the idea that he loves America without additional evidence.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This assumes a consensus or agreement without proper support. Assuming that everyone believes he loves America because of the flags is presumptuous.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** This involves using vague or ambiguous terms. The use of flags can symbolize many things and can be interpreted differently by various audiences.

Given the analysis, the statement “That politician wants you to think he loves America. His last rally had 20 American flags flying behind him” IS an example of:

- **<G> Generalization:** This statement makes a broad conclusion that the display of American flags directly correlates with the politician’s patriotism without sufficient evidence.

However, elements of **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** and **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** are also evident as the argument relies on a limited and inconclusive basis to draw a conclusion.

In summary, the predominant defect in this argument could be identified as **<G> Generalization**, though it also reflects the defects of **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration** and **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**.
