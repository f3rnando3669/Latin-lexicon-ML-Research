For 
To categorize and analyze the argument provided using the framework of defective argument types, we'll consider whether and how each type might apply to the statement:

**Argument Statement:**
"We should move to the Midwest because Mujtaba from the Wall Street Journal says the cost of living is cheaper there."

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - This type of defective argument involves making broad statements based on a few instances. The statement here seems to imply a generalization that the cost of living is universally cheaper in the Midwest based on Mujtaba’s comment, without considering regional variations or specific contexts within the Midwest.
   
   Application: The argument might be suggesting a generalization that the Midwest, in its entirety, has a lower cost of living, which may not be universally true across all areas.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - This involves drawing a conclusion based on an incomplete list of factors or options. The argument relies solely on Mujtaba's statement without considering other potential factors (e.g., individual financial situations, job market, lifestyle changes) that are essential for such a major decision.
   
   Application: The argument does not enumerate all necessary considerations for moving and relies only on the cost of living as mentioned by one source.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - An argument falls under this type when the reasoning provided does not adequately support the conclusion. Although Mujtaba's claim about the cost of living might be valid, it doesn't sufficiently support the necessity for moving to the Midwest without additional evidence or reasoning.
   
   Application: Mujtaba’s statement alone is not enough to conclusively warrant the decision to move; more comprehensive analysis and sources are needed.
 
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - This defective argument involves attributing a cause without sufficient evidence that the cause effectively leads to the effect. In this case, moving to the Midwest is presented as a solution based solely on the cost of living claim, without sufficient causal evidence linking Mujtaba's statement directly to improved living conditions.

   Application: The argument does not sufficiently establish that the cost of living is indeed lower everywhere in the Midwest or that it will beneficially impact one's personal situation if they move.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - This involves repeating a proposition without providing new evidence or reasoning to support it. If the statement had reiterated the same claim by Mujtaba multiple times without adding information, it would be an example. However, within the given statement, faulty repetition doesn't seem to apply.
   
   Application: Not applicable as there is no repetitive element in the provided statement.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - This involves assuming that a consensus exists based on an authority's claim or an individual's opinion. The statement leans on Mujtaba from the Wall Street Journal as an authority without presenting broader consensus or data.
   
   Application: The argument presumes consensus by citing Mujtaba's authority, potentially overstating the general agreement on the matter.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - This type involves using vague or unclear terms that can be interpreted in different ways. The statement uses "cost of living" and "Midwest" but does not specify which parts of the Midwest or what aspects of cost of living are considered (e.g., housing, food, healthcare).
   
   Application: The ambiguous nature of "Midwest" and "cost of living" without specifics makes the argument less clear and more susceptible to misinterpretation.

Given the list and the structure of the argument, this statement seems to predominantly fall under:

- **<G> Generalization**: Broad statement about the Midwest’s cost of living.
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: Lack of comprehensive factors considered in the decision.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: Insufficient reasoning to support the conclusion.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: Weak link between Mujtaba's statement and the need to move.
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: Reliance on an authority’s opinion as a consensus.

Conclusively, the argument about moving to the Midwest primarily involves generalization, incomplete enumeration, inconclusive reasoning, insufficient causal basis, and presumptuous consensus.
