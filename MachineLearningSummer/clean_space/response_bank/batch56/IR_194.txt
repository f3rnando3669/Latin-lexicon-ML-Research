For 
<Helga: You should not be eating that... it has been scientifically proven that eating fat burgers are no good for your health.

Hugh: You eat fat burgers all the time so that canâ€™t be true.>

In this conversation, Hugh's response is an example of a defective argument called <IDAA>, which stands for "Inconsistent Argument by Ad Hominem."

**Upon applying <IDAA>, Hugh's argument can be identified as:**

**<IDAA>:** Hugh attacks the person rather than addressing the argument. Helga's personal eating habits do not invalidate the scientific evidence she presents.

To break it down:

1. **Person-focused:** Hugh's response focuses on Helga's behavior rather than the actual claim about fat burgers being unhealthy.
2. **His point:** Hugh argues that since Helga eats fat burgers, Helga's claim must be false.
3. **Defective argument:** This is logically flawed because the truth of Helga's claim is independent of Helga's behavior. Helga's habits don't affect the scientific data about the health impacts of eating fat burgers.

Thus, Hugh's argument is defective due to its ad hominem nature, where he attacks the proponent of the argument instead of addressing the argument itself.
