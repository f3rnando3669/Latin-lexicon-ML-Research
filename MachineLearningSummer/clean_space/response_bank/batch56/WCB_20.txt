For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application.

Letâ€™s analyze the statement "assumes that short-term deviations will correct themselves" using the defective argument types defined:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This assumes that short-term deviations will always correct themselves in all situations based on limited instances or skewed observation. A generalization might ignore cases where deviations do not correct themselves.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Similar to Generalization, this argument might be incomplete if it fails to consider all possible outcomes. It assumes correction without enumerating scenarios where short-term deviations might persist or worsen.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The assumption here might stem from an inconclusive reason, where there is not enough evidence to confidently assert that short-term deviations will indeed correct themselves.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This argument may lack a solid causal foundation. Simply assuming that deviations correct themselves doesn't provide an adequate causal explanation for why or how this correction happens.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: It could involve repeating the idea without substantiating evidence. For example, the assertion might be circular, simply restating that short-term deviations correct without explaining why.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This argument assumes a consensus where it may not exist. It presumes that everyone agrees short-term deviations self-correct, which might not be the case.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The statement might use vague terms like "short-term" and "correct themselves" without clear definitions, leaving interpretation open and the argument ambiguous.

Applying these definitions to your statement, the argument "assumes that short-term deviations will correct themselves" can potentially be identified as:

- **Generalization (G)**: Assumes all short-term deviations correct themselves based on potentially insufficient or selective examples.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Doesn't consider all scenarios where deviations might persist or lead to longer-term issues.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Might lack definitive evidence proving that deviations always get corrected.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Doesn't provide a clear causal mechanism for why the deviations will correct themselves.

Hence, the statement "assumes that short-term deviations will correct themselves" is defective as it potentially makes use of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, and <WCB> argument types.
