"IDAA" could be interpreted as Identifying Defective Argument Attributes (if that's what you're going for based on the context given).

"Saying that a compromise between two extremes is the truth" is a common type of argument often referred to as the "Golden Mean Fallacy" or "Argumentum ad Temperantiam." This fallacy assumes that the middle ground between two opposing arguments is always the correct one. Now let's analyze it in terms of the defective argument types defined:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument involves making a broad generalization that the truth always lies in the middle, ignoring the specifics of the situation.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: It fails to consider all possible options or the fact that one of the extremes could be the actual truth.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning is inconclusive as it doesn't provide solid evidence for why the compromise is the truth, merely asserting it is due to its position between two extremes.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is an insufficient causal basis to claim that the middle ground between two extremes leads to the truth in all instances.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: If the argument is repeatedly asserted without evidence, it could be seen as a faulty repetition of the proposition that the truth is always in the middle.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: It presumes that a consensus should be found in the middle, assuming this consensus necessarily equates to truth.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: It may also involve ambiguous language by vaguely defining 'extremes' and 'middle ground' without clear parameters.

Thus, "Saying that a compromise between two extremes is the truth" primarily showcases <G>, <FE>, and <IR> with potential elements of <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, and <DEP> depending on the context and how the argument is presented.
