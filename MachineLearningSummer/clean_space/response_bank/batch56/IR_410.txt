Applying the various defective argument types (denoted by <IDAA>) to the statement:

"Lisa was brainwashed as a child into thinking that people are generally good. Therefore, people are not generally good."

We can identify the flaws in the argument as follows:

1. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The argument repeats an assertion (that people are generally good or not) without providing new evidence. It simply states that because Lisa was brainwashed, the opposite must be true, which is a repetition without substance.

2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The argument claims that because Lisa was brainwashed, it implies that people are not generally good. This is an insufficient causal link. Brainwashing one person does not prove or disprove the general nature of people.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason given (Lisa being brainwashed) is not sufficient evidence to conclusively determine the nature of people in general. It does not follow logically.

4. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** The term "brainwashed" can be ambiguous. It is not precisely clear what is meant by "brainwashed" and how that affects the general goodness of people.

None of the other defective arguments precisely apply, but these four (RR, WCB, IR, DEP) capture the main issues with the reasoning presented in the statement.
