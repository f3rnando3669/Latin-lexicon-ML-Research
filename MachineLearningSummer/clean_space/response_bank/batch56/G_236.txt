For 
To apply the categorization of defective arguments to the statement "Broccoli has significantly less fat than the leading candy bar!", we need to examine the potential issues in reasoning. Let's consider the definitions of each defective argument type:

- Generalization (<G>): Applying a finding from a limited sample to a broader population without sufficient evidence.
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>): Citing incomplete or non-exhaustive lists of reasons or instances to draw a conclusion.
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>): Providing premises that don't sufficiently support the conclusion.
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>): Asserting a causal relationship without adequate justification.
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>): Repeating a proposition without new evidence or support.
- Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>): Claiming that something is true because it is believed by many without proper evidence.
- Ambiguous Language (<DEP>): Using vague or unclear language that can lead to various interpretations.

The statement "Broccoli has significantly less fat than the leading candy bar!" does not directly fall into most of these categories but does have potential issues due to its comparison.

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement cites only one specific comparison (fat content) between broccoli and "the leading candy bar" without considering other nutritional factors (such as sugar, vitamins, minerals, etc.). This single comparison may lead to an incomplete picture of the overall nutritional value.

2. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The phrase "leading candy bar" is ambiguous since it doesn't specify which candy bar is being compared or why it qualifies as the "leading" one (e.g., by sales, popularity, marketing, etc.).

Based on this analysis, the statement can be labeled as:

- <FE>: Incomplete Enumeration, due to its narrow comparison focusing solely on fat content.
- <DEP>: Ambiguous Language, due to the unclear identification of what is meant by "leading candy bar."

Therefore, we can apply these defective argument types as follows:

**Statement**: "Broccoli has significantly less fat than the leading candy bar!"
- **Defective Argument Types**: <FE>, <DEP>
