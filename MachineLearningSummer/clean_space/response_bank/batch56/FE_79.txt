For 
The argument "You can either support our police or Black Lives Matter" can be evaluated using the defective argument types defined:

- **<IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Types in an Analysis Argument):**

Upon analyzing this statement, it appears to present a false dilemma or false dichotomy, which is a fallacy where only two options are given, ignoring other possible alternatives. However, based on the provided defective argument types, it can be most closely associated with:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This statement suggests that the only two choices are supporting the police or supporting Black Lives Matter, which is not necessarily true. There are many nuances and positions that people may take which support or critique both institutions in varying ways or that advocate for reform and accountability without being rigidly binary.

None of the other defective argument types defined directly match the false dichotomy fallacy as closely as Incomplete Enumeration does. Therefore:

"This argument suffers from **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**, as it fails to consider other possible stances and presents an overly simplistic binary choice."
