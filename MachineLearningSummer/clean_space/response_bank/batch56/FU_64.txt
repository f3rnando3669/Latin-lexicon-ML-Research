For 
To apply a defective argument type, let's first recap what "<IDAA>" stands for in this context. Since it wasn't defined in the previous message, I'll assign a likely meaning to this acronym, assuming it stands for "Identifying Defective Argument Application."

Now, I'll examine the provided statement: "I didn't want to the only one not listening to music while I completed my Achieve article, so I listened to music too."

Based on the context and defective argument types defined earlier:

- **<G> Generalization**: This doesn't seem to apply, as the statement doesn't generalize beyond the specific context.
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: This doesn't apply, as the argument isn't listing options or elements incompletely.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The reasoning ("so I listened to music too") might appear inconclusive when scrutinized more deeply.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: The reasoning might imply a weak causal relationship, but it's more about a preference or social conformity.
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: No repeated proposition is present.
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: This fits because the reasoning implies the consensus that others listening to music necessitates the speaker doing the same, which might not be sound.
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**: The language is relatively clear, so ambiguity isn't a primary issue.

The most fitting defective argument type seems to be **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**. The argument assumes that since others are listening to music, the speaker should conform, which is an implicit presumption of a consensus that might not necessitate the speakerâ€™s action.

Therefore, applying the defective argument type:

**<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: "I didn't want to be the only one not listening to music while I completed my Achieve article, so I listened to music too." This implies an uncritical acceptance of what others are doing as a necessary condition for the speaker's action, which is a form of presumptuous consensus.
