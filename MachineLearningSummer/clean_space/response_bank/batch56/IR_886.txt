For 
<IDAA> stands for "Irrelevant Dismissal of a Argument Appeal." This term wasn't provided in the list of defective argument types that you defined. Let's assume that <IDAA> is an implicit reference to a situation where the main issue is avoided or the argument is diverted without proper engagement with the initial point.

In the dialogue you provided:

**Mike**: It is morally wrong to cheat on your spouse, why on earth would you have done that?

**Ken**: But what is morality exactly?

**Mike**: Itâ€™s a code of conduct shared by cultures.

**Ken**: But who creates this code?...

Here is how the conversations can be analyzed:

1. Mike brings up a moral assertion and seeks an explanation from Ken about his behavior.
2. Ken deflects the issue by questioning the very nature of morality.
3. Mike provides a generalized answer implying cultures create moral codes.
4. Ken further deflects by questioning the origin of these codes.

Ken's responses seem to serve the purpose of steering the conversation away from the specific issue of his personal behavior to a broader philosophical debate about morality. This can be interpreted as an instance where the original argument or accusation is not directly addressed, thus creating an irrelevant diversion.

Therefore, applying <IDAA> to this could suggest that Ken's responses are an attempt at Irrelevant Dismissal of Mike's argument and concern. Instead of addressing the moral issue of cheating, Ken is bringing up larger philosophical questions to divert the conversation.
