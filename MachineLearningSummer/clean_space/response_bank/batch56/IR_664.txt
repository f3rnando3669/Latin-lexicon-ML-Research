Certainly! To apply <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Attributes) to the given argument, we need to analyze it to identify which defective argument types it belongs to:

Argument: "Teachers claim that cell phones distract students, but they only say that because teachers have no lives."

1. **Generalization (<G>):** This argument does not show evidence of taking a specific instance and generalizing to a broader conclusion.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This argument does not appear to be presenting a range of possibilities and stopping short of a complete list.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The argument dismisses the claim made by teachers not on the basis of the validity of the claim but rather attacks the character of teachers, which doesn't engage with the actual point being made.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** There is no claim of causation with insufficient basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** There is no faulty repetition of a proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The argument does not rely on a supposed consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** The language used isn’t ambiguous; it’s fairly clear in what is being implied.

By evaluating the argument, we can identify that it contains an **Ad Hominem** (a type of Inconclusive Reason) attack. The statement dismisses the teachers' claim by attacking their character rather than addressing the actual distraction issue with cell phones.

Therefore, the defective argument type for this statement is: **<IR>—Inconclusive Reason**.
