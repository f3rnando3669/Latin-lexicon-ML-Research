It seems you've defined various types of defective arguments. However, I notice that <IDAA> hasn't been assigned a specific type of defective argument in your definitions. 

Based on the context, it seems like you want to identify the type of defect in the argument "Running a marathon is very tiring because it is so exhausting."

The statement "Running a marathon is very tiring because it is so exhausting" appears to be a tautology or circular reasoning, where the conclusion is restated in different words but no additional information or evidence is provided. In the context of standard logical fallacies, this would be considered "Begging the Question."

For the purposes of your defined defective argument types, this could fit under <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition) since it involves repeating the proposition without providing new evidence or reasoning.

Thus:
Apply <RR> to "Running a marathon is very tiring because it is so exhausting."
