For 
<IDAA> refers to Identifying Defective Argument Applications. Let's analyze the conversation for defective arguments.

**Conversation:**

dude #1: "I support Black Lives Matter's mission to establish and put into better practice restorative justice..."
- This statement is focused on expressing support for a specific mission of the Black Lives Matter movement.

dude #2: "But don't all lives matter?"
- This statement deflects from dude #1's specific point about restorative justice by introducing the broader statement that "all lives matter."

dude #1: "Of course, but I'm telling you about the mission of BLM."
- This response acknowledges the broader truth but redirects to the original topic of discussion.

**Identifying Defective Argument Applications (IDAA):**

1. **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>:** Dude #2's response "But don't all lives matter?" could be critiqued as an Incomplete Enumeration. It ignores the specific issues addressed by restorative justice within the context of the Black Lives Matter movement and recoils to a more general and inclusive statement that does not directly engage with the specifics that dude #1 is discussing.

2. **Inconclusive Reason <IR>:** Dude #2's question doesn't provide a conclusive reason that addresses the specifics of what dude #1 is talking about. Instead, it introduces an inconclusive and broad statement, which doesn't necessarily negate or engage with the original point made by dude #1.

By identifying these defective arguments, we can see that dude #2 diverted the discussion away from the specific mission of the Black Lives Matter movement and employed a broader, less focused argument that doesn't directly confront or consider dude #1's point properly.
