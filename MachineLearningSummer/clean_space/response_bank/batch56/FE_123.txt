The argument presented is:

"Every person is either my enemy or my friend. If they are my enemy I should hate them. If they are my friend I should love them. So I should either love them or hate them."

Let's apply the Defective Arguments Analysis (<IDAA>), specifically identifying where and which defections occur in the argument. 

1. **Generalization (G):** 
   This argument generalizes the relationship dynamics and simplifies them into two extreme categories â€” enemy or friend. The spectrum of human relationships is far more complex and includes neutral, acquaintance, and other forms of relationships.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   The argument commits an incomplete enumeration by only considering "enemy" and "friend" as the only possible categories for all people. It overlooks other possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   The argument does not provide conclusive reasoning for why one must hate an enemy or love a friend. It assumes these emotional responses without substantiating why they should follow from the given categories.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   There is an insufficient causal basis linking the categories of "enemy" and "friend" to the emotional responses of "hate" and "love." The cause is too simplistic for the complex feelings humans have.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   The repetition in the conclusion that one should "either love them or hate them" is faulty as it does not consider the nuanced feelings and relationships in real-world scenarios.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   The argument presumes a consensus on the emotional responses of love and hate based on the binary categorization which might not hold true universally.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   The terms "enemy" and "friend" are used ambiguously. People might have different interpretations of who qualifies as an enemy or a friend, leading to different conclusions.

Given this, we can outline the defects in the argument as follows:

- **Generalization (G):** Simplifies relationships into two categories.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Omits other possible categories besides enemy and friend.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Assumes emotional responses without reasoning.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Simplistic cause and effect for emotions.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Reiterates flawed dichotomy.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Assumes universal acceptance of emotional responses.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** Uses vague terms with multiple interpretations.

By identifying these defective argument types, we can better understand the shortcomings in the reasoning provided.
