For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application. Let's apply <IDAA> to the phrases "tax relief instead of tax cut" and "death tax instead of estate tax":

When politicians or advocates use phrases like "tax relief" instead of "tax cut" or "death tax" instead of "estate tax," they are typically engaging in a type of argument that might be designed to evoke certain emotional responses or biases. 

- "Tax relief" suggests a beneficial action, something needed to alleviate a burden, whereas "tax cut" is a more neutral term.
- "Death tax" is framed negatively to invoke emotional opposition, whereas "estate tax" is a more neutral, technical term.

The defective argument type that best applies to these phrases is:

<DEP> Ambiguous Language: The use of loaded or emotionally charged terms can create ambiguity and sway opinions based not on clear, logical argumentation but on the emotional connotations of the terms used.

By framing policy issues with these emotionally charged terms, the speaker might obscure the actual policy details and foster a presumptive consensus based on the manipulated language rather than on informed, reasoned debate.
