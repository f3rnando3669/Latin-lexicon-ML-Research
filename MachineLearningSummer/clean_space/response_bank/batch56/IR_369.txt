For 
Formalizing the issue of the argument provided under Identifying Defective Argument Application (IDAA), let's categorize the type of defective argument it represents based on the types we defined.

Argument: "You oppose a senator's proposal to extend government-funded health care to poor minority children because that senator is a liberal Democrat."

First, letâ€™s break down the argument to its core components:
- **Proposal**: Extending government-funded health care to poor minority children.
- **Opposition Reason**: The proposing senator's political affiliation (liberal Democrat).

By examining the reasoning used for the opposition, we can identify that the argument does not address the merits or downsides of the proposal itself. Instead, it dismisses the proposal solely based on the senator's political affiliation.

This type of defective argument is a **Faulty Repetition of Proposition**. It assumes that any proposal from a liberal Democrat is inherently wrong without providing a basis specific to the proposal. 

Thus, applying the IDAA, the argument:
"You oppose a senator's proposal to extend government-funded health care to poor minority children because that senator is a liberal Democrat," is an example of <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
