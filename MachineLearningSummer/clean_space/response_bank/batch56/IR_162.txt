The argument presented in the statement "Why would you trust Paris Hilton to sell health food? She drinks and parties and has multiple partners." can be identified as defective for multiple reasons.

The use of <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Application) suggests that we should analyze and identify specific defective argument types that apply to this statement.

Here is an analysis:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - This is a broad generalization about Paris Hilton's ability to sell health food based on her lifestyle choices. It does not necessarily follow that because she drinks, parties, and has multiple partners, she is incapable of selling health food. This makes it a broad, and thus defective, generalization.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The argument provides reasons that are not directly related to Hilton's qualifications or credibility in selling health food. Her personal behaviors (drinking, partying, and having multiple partners) do not conclusively determine her ability to promote or sell health food effectively.

3. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - Words like "drinks and parties" and "multiple partners" are used to evoke negative connotations without clear definitions or context. This ambiguity in language could mislead the argument by creating a biased perception without substantive evidence concerning her capability to sell health food.

Combining these observations, the statement employs defective reasoning primarily through the use of **Generalization (<G>)**, **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, and **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**. These defects collectively undermine the validity of the argument against Paris Hilton's potential as a health food salesperson.
