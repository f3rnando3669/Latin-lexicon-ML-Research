For 
The argument "Shakira is the best singer in the world because she is the most talented singer there is." fits within the defective argument schema and could be defined as follows:

**<IDAA> Insufficient Definition, Assertion, and Argumentation**:
This argument might be critiqued under IDAA for not sufficiently defining what makes someone the "best singer" or the "most talented singer." The concepts of "best" and "most talented" are subjective and can vary greatly depending on individual opinions and criteria.

So, applying IDAA to this argument:

- **Insufficient Definition**: The terms "best singer" and "most talented singer" are vague and not clearly defined, making it difficult to evaluate the claim.
- **Insufficient Assertion**: The assertion that Shakira is the best singer simply because she is the most talented lacks sufficient evidence or reasoning. It assumes that talent alone determines who is the best singer without considering other potential factors.
- **Insufficient Argumentation**: The argument does not provide adequate support or evidence for the claim. It relies on a single premise that is not sufficiently substantiated.

Thus, under IDAA, the reasoning behind the statement is found to be defective due to insufficient definition, assertion, and argumentation.
