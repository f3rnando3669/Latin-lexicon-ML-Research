Sure, let's apply the process of Identifying Defective Argument Attributes (IDAA) to the given statement:

**Argument:**
"There is a global recession and more people are becoming hungry and desperate. Crimes of theft and robbery have been increasing at an alarming rate lately. The only way to solve this problem is by reinstating the death penalty."

1. **Generalization (G):** 
   - The argument suggests that because there is an increase in crimes of theft and robbery, this general trend is sufficient to justify an extreme measure like the death penalty. This is a generalization drawing a broad conclusion from a specific context.
   - Indicator: "The only way to solve this problem is by reinstating the death penalty."

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - The argument claims that the death penalty is the *only* solution without considering or listing other possible solutions to reduce crime (e.g., poverty alleviation, better law enforcement, etc.).
   - Indicator: "The only way to solve this problem..."

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - The argument presents premises (global recession, increasing theft and robbery) but fails to conclusively link them to the necessity of the death penalty, as increased crime rates do not necessarily mean reinstating the death penalty is effective or justified.
   - Indicator: Lack of direct causal connection between the stated problems and the proposed solution.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - The argument assumes a direct causal relationship between the death penalty and the reduction of the specific types of crimes mentioned (theft and robbery), without providing sufficient evidence that such a causal relationship exists.
   - Indicator: "The only way to solve this problem..."

5. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - The argument presumes that there is a general consensus on the efficacy of the death penalty as the solution without acknowledging or addressing differing viewpoints or the complex nature of the issue.
   - Indicator: Implied assumption that reinstating the death penalty is universally agreed upon as a solution.

6. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - The phrase "solve this problem" is relatively ambiguous as it does not clearly define what is meant by "solve" (lower crime rates, deter certain types of crimes, etc). Also, "alarming rate" can be subjective and open to interpretation.
   - Indicator: Terms like "solve this problem" and "alarming rate."

Considering this detailed analysis, the argument predominantly shows the following defective attributes:
- Generalization (G)
- Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
- Inconclusive Reason (IR)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
- Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
- Ambiguous Language (DEP)

By identifying these defective attributes, we can see that the argument lacks strong logical foundation and presents several logical fallacies.
