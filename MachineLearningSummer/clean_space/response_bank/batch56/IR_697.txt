For 
Certainly! Let's analyze the statement using the defective argument types defined earlier and identify if any of them apply:

"The Supreme Court has just flinched from its responsibility to stop the unjust jailing of two journalists―not charged with any wrongdoing―by a runaway prosecutor who will go to any lengths to use the government's contempt power to force them to betray their confidential sources."

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - The statement doesn’t seem to make a broad generalization based on limited evidence, so this defective argument type does not apply.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - The statement provides specific details about the Supreme Court's action (or inaction) and the situation with the journalists, but it does not suggest that this is one example of a broader trend without sufficient evidence. Therefore, this defective argument type does not apply.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - The argument may suggest that the Supreme Court’s action was incorrect by labeling it as a "flinch" and by stating the jailings are "unjust." If there isn’t sufficient evidence provided within the context (evidence about the Supreme Court’s decision process, legal considerations, etc.), this could fall under IR. Hence, IR might apply here.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - This defective argument type concerns a lack of strong causal evidence. The statement accuses the Supreme Court of flinching and accuses the prosecutor of misusing power. Without evidence of a direct causal link between the Court’s decision and an obligatory responsibility that it's failing to meet, WCB could apply. Therefore, WCB might apply as well.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - This involves repeating a proposition without sufficient justification or evidence. The statement makes a bold claim but does not repeatedly assert it in different ways. Therefore, this defective argument type does not apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - This type would involve assuming a consensus without any evidence for it. The statement doesn't seem to rely on an assumed consensus, so FU does not apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - Terms like "flinched," "unjust," "runaway prosecutor," and "betray" could be considered ambiguous or loaded with emotional appeal without specific definitions or context. This can make the argument less clear and more based on emotional appeal. Thus, DEP might apply.

In summary, the potential defective argument types applied to the statement are:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**
