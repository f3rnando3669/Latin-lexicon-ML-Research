For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Applications. Let's analyze the given dialogue based on the defective argument types provided:

---

**Employer:** It says here on your resume that you are a hard worker, you pay attention to detail, and you don’t mind working long hours.
**Andy:** Yes sir.
**Employer:** I spoke to your previous employer. He says that you constantly change things that should not be changed, you could care less about other people’s privacy, and you had the lowest score in customer relations.
**Andy:** Yes, that is all true, as well.
**Employer:** Great then. Welcome to our social media team!

1. **Generalization (<G>):** This argument type involves making a broad statement based on limited evidence. This defective argument does not seem to apply directly to the dialogue as there is no broad sweeping statement with insufficient evidence made by the employer directly impacting decision making.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This involves presenting an incomplete list of alternatives. In this dialogue, the employer is not listing alternatives, so this argument type does not directly apply.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This involves drawing a conclusion that does not necessarily follow from the premises. The employer's reasoning for hiring Andy is inconclusive because the negative feedback should logically disqualify Andy, but instead, the employer welcomes him to the team despite the feedback. Thus, the reasoning is inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This is when a causal relationship is presumed without sufficient evidence. There’s no presumed causal relationship being discussed explicitly, making this defective argument type inapplicable here.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This is reiterating a point without providing new evidence. The statements in the dialogue do not repeat propositions without new evidence.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This involves assuming that everyone agrees on a point without supporting evidence. No consensus is presumed or stated in the dialogue.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** Using unclear language that can be interpreted in more than one way. The language here is clear and direct, hence this defective argument type does not apply.

---

Based on the above analysis, the dialogue showcases an **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**. The employer's conclusion of hiring Andy is not adequately supported by the premises laid out, especially considering the negative feedback juxtaposed against the initial positive self-assessment.
