For 
<IDAA> stands for "Identify Defective Argument Application." Let's analyze the argument provided to identify any defective argument types:

"Latin should not be taught in school since it is not spoken anywhere in the world. All learning should have some use to be of value, and a dead language has no practical use."

Here's a breakdown of potential defects:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The argument generalizes the value of all learning based solely on practical use, ignoring other potential benefits of learning Latin (e.g., understanding historical texts, improving understanding of other languages, etc.).

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The argument does not consider other possible reasons for teaching Latin, such as its role in understanding the roots of many modern languages or its historical significance.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The reasoning that "a dead language has no practical use" is not conclusively tied to the value of teaching it. There are multiple dimensions of value (e.g., cognitive enhancement, cultural knowledge) that are not addressed.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - The assertion that all valuable learning must have immediate practical use lacks a thorough causal basis. Education can have intrinsic value beyond immediate practicality.

5. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - The term "practical use" is ambiguous. Practicality can be interpreted in various ways (e.g., pragmatic daily use vs. intellectual enrichment). This ambiguity weakens the argument.

Applying <IDAA> to the argument, we find these defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, and <DEP>. 

Thus, a revised summary would be: "The argument against teaching Latin in school exemplifies Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reasoning, Insufficient Causal Basis, and Ambiguous Language, thereby weakening its validity."
