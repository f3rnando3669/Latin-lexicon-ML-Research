For 
<IDAA> is an identifier for defective arguments "If you forget to floss, you will get cavities, and if you get cavities, you will lose all your teeth by the time you're 30."

Let's analyze the argument:

1. "If you forget to floss, you will get cavities."
2. "If you get cavities, you will lose all your teeth by the time you're 30."

**Potential Defective Arguments:**

- **Generalization <G>:** This argument could be seen as a generalization because it assumes that forgetting to floss will always lead to cavities, and cavities will invariably result in the loss of all teeth by age 30. However, numerous factors contribute to dental health, including diet, genetics, and overall hygiene practices.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>:** The argument assumes a direct causal relationship between forgetting to floss and ultimately losing all teeth by age 30 without sufficient evidence. Cavities can be treated, and losing all teeth by age 30 is an extreme consequence that typically involves multiple factors, not just flossing habits.

- **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>:** The argument might also be considered an incomplete enumeration, as it simplifies the causes of cavities and tooth loss to just one or two factors, overlooking the complexity of dental health.

- **Inconclusive Reason <IR>:** This argument could display an inconclusive reason because it suggests a severe outcome based on a premise that doesn't necessarily lead to such an extreme conclusion.

Using the defective argument types defined:

- **Generalization (G):** The claim that forgetting to floss will lead to cavities and ultimately losing all teeth by 30 is a wide-reaching generalization that lacks nuance and ignores individual differences.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The argument fails to establish a strong enough causal link between each step, leading to an exaggerated conclusion.

Therefore, the argument "If you forget to floss, you will get cavities, and if you get cavities, you will lose all your teeth by the time you're 30." mainly falls under **<G> Generalization** and **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**.
