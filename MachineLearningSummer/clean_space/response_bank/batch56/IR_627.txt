In this scenario, the radio talk show host is providing a rebuttal to the critical thinking professors by focusing on their smaller audience size compared to his large listenership. He suggests that their criticism is irrelevant or invalid because they do not command the same level of public attention that he does.

This argument can be analyzed using the defective argument types defined:

1. **<G> Generalization**: The host is generalizing that audience size equates to the validity of one's arguments. Just because he has a larger audience does not logically mean his arguments are better or less fallacious.

2. **<EE> Incomplete Enumeration**: The host's argument assumes that audience size is the only significant factor in determining the quality of one's reasoning. He ignores other valuable aspects such as the depth of analysis or expertise in critical thinking.

3. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The argument presented by the host does not logically address the accusation of fallacious reasoning. Number of listeners does not provide conclusive evidence for or against the fallacious nature of his arguments.

4. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: The host implies that being able to reach a large audience is causally related to being free from fallacious reasoning. However, this is an insufficient basis to conclude that there is no fallacy in his show.

5. **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: The host repetitively emphasizes his large audience size as if continuously repeating it strengthens his stance against the criticism. Repeating this fact does not inherently make his argument against the professors' claims stronger.

6. **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: By emphasizing his large audience, the host implies that his popularity or the common consensus among his listeners validates his arguments. This is presumptuous because widespread agreement doesn't necessarily eliminate fallacies in reasoning.

7. **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**: The term "gnats flying around getting in the way" is ambiguous and used pejoratively, without clear reasoning or specific refutation of the professors' claims. It clouds the substantive issue of whether his show uses fallacious reasoning.

By using these defective argument types to break down the host's response, it becomes apparent that his rebuttal is founded on several logically flawed principles that do not adequately address the professors' criticism regarding the presence of fallacious reasoning in his show.
