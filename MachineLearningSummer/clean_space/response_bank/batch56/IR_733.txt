For 
\<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Applications. Let's analyze the given statement using the defined defective argument types:

**Statement**: "My uncle is a mechanic and he says you shouldn't spank children. He says it's ineffective."

1. **Generalization (\<G>)**: This argument doesn't make a broad generalization based on limited data, so it doesn't fit \<G>.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE>)**: The argument provides a single perspective (your uncle's) without considering other potential viewpoints or evidence. Hence, it does involve incomplete consideration of relevant factors.
   - Applied Defective Argument Type: \<FE>

3. **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>)**: The argument relies on your uncle's opinion without presenting sufficient evidence or a strong logical basis for the conclusion that spanking is ineffective. The connection between his expertise (mechanic) and the argument's conclusion is weak and inconclusive.
   - Applied Defective Argument Type: \<IR>

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB>)**: There is no causation argument presented here, so \<WCB> is not applicable.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR>)**: The argument does not involve the repetition of the same proposition as proof of itself. Thus, \<RR> is not applicable.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU>)**: This argument does not claim a consensus or presume a widespread agreement, so it doesn't fit \<FU>.

7. **Ambiguous Language (\<DEP>)**: The language in this argument is quite clear and not ambiguous, so \<DEP> does not apply.

**Conclusion**: The original argument employs the following defective argument types:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE>)**: It only considers your uncle's opinion without presenting a full enumeration of relevant viewpoints or evidence.
- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>)**: The rationale provided (your uncleâ€™s opinion) does not conclusively support the argument's claim about spanking's ineffectiveness.

Therefore, the statement "My uncle is a mechanic and he says you shouldn't spank children. He says it's ineffective." can be identified as incorporating the defective argument types \<FE> and \<IR>.
