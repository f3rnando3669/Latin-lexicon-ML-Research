For 
To apply the Identifying Defective Argument Analysis (<IDAA>) to the statement "Whatever is less dense than water will float, because such objects won't sink in water," we need to analyze the structure and logic of the argument and determine if it falls into any of the predefined defective argument types.

The argument presented is:

1. Premise: Objects less dense than water won't sink in water.
2. Conclusion: Therefore, whatever is less dense than water will float.

The conclusion is essentially restating the premise in a different way, without introducing any new evidence or reasoning to support the claim beyond what was already stated. Hence, it can be seen as a form of circular reasoning or faulty repetition.

Upon reviewing the defective argument types defined:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: This type does not apply here as the argument does not draw a broad conclusion from specific cases.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This type does not apply here as the argument does not list possibilities and erroneously conclude completeness.
  
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This type could potentially apply if the reasoning provided was insufficient to reach the conclusion. The insufficiency here is mainly due to repetition rather than providing additional or incomplete evidence.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This type does not apply here as there is no causal relationship being inadequately established.
  
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This type fits as the argument simply restates the premise in a slightly different form as the conclusion without providing additional justification.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This type does not apply here as there is no indication of assuming an agreement or consensus that is not actually established.
  
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This type does not apply as the terms used in the argument are clear and not ambiguous.

Given the analysis, the defective argument type that best applies to the statement provided is:

- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**
