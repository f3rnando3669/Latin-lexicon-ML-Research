For 
<IDAA> stands for "Identify Defective Argument Application." To apply <IDAA> to the statement "Albert Einstein was extremely impressed with this theory," we need to determine if the statement contains one of the defective argument types defined.

Here’s a breakdown considering the defective argument types:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument is not a broad generalization based on limited information.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement does not imply a list of examples that pretends to be complete.
  
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: While the statement might imply that Einstein's approval is a reason to accept the theory, it doesn't provide sufficient reasoning on its own. This is a potential fit.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The statement is making a claim about opinion rather than causation.
  
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The statement does not repeat a proposition without adding new information.
  
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This statement might be seen as an attempt to imply that because a respected figure (Einstein) was impressed, others should also hold the same view without independent evaluation.
  
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The statement is straightforward without ambiguous terms.

After evaluating the statement, it seems "Albert Einstein was extremely impressed with this theory." could be categorized under:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Because it suggests Einstein's impression alone is enough to find the theory credible without further evidence.
2. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: It's suggesting that consensus should be based merely on Einstein’s opinion.

Therefore, <IDAA> for "Albert Einstein was extremely impressed with this theory." identifies the defective argument types as:

<IDAA: <IR>, <FU>>
