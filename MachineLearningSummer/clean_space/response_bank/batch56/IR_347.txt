Sure, let's analyze the provided argument using "<IDAA>" which I assume is a shorthand for identifying the defective argument types that may apply according to your definitions. The argument is: 

"We should abolish the death penalty. Many respected people, such as actor Guy Handsome, have publicly stated their opposition to it."

First, let's break down the argument:
1. **Conclusion**: We should abolish the death penalty.
2. **Premise**: Many respected people, such as actor Guy Handsome, have publicly stated their opposition to it.

Now, let's identify any defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This type of defective argument involves making a broad statement based on limited evidence. While the statement does mention "many respected people," it is not inherently a generalization in the context provided.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This defective argument involves presenting a list that is not comprehensive. The mention of "many respected people" and specifically "actor Guy Handsome" implies that the list of those who oppose the death penalty is not exhaustive but influential. However, this might be leaning towards incomplete representation depending on context.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This occurs when the premises provided do not logically lead to the conclusion. In this case, the opposition of "many respected people" doesn't necessarily constitute a logical reason to abolish the death penalty. 

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This argument type would involve a lack of evidence to support a causal relationship. The argument presented doesn’t attempt to establish a causal relationship, so this doesn't seem to apply here.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This error involves repeating the proposition without adding new information. The argument doesn’t restate the proposition repeatedly, so this doesn’t apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This defective argument relies on the assumption that the consensus of certain people implies correctness or validity, which is precisely what is being done here. The argument assumes that because "many respected people" oppose the death penalty, it should be abolished.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This involves the use of vague or unclear terms. The argument doesn’t rely on ambiguous language, so this doesn’t apply.

So, applying <IDAA> to the given argument, we identify the following defective argument types:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The premise that many respected people oppose the death penalty does not definitively support the conclusion that it should be abolished.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument assumes that because certain respected people believe in the abolition, it is thereby the correct course of action.

Thus, the primary defective argument types present in "We should abolish the death penalty. Many respected people, such as actor Guy Handsome, have publicly stated their opposition to it." are **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.
