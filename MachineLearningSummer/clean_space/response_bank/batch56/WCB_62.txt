For 
The argument provided is "I ate Oreos, and then I was sick the next day. It must have been the Oreos that caused my sickness."

Applying the definitions of defective argument types:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This type of defective argument occurs when there is an insufficient basis to establish a causal relationship between two events.

In this case, the argument suggests a direct causal link between eating Oreos and becoming sick without sufficient evidence to support this claim. There could be many other factors that contributed to the sickness, and simply noting the temporal sequence (Oreos first, sickness next) is not enough to establish a causal connection.

Thus, the argument "I ate Oreos, and then I was sick the next day. It must have been the Oreos that caused my sickness." can be identified as having an <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
