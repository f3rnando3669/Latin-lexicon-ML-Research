For 
<IDAA> usually stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application. It's an approach where we can analyze statements to identify whether they contain any logical fallacies or defective arguments.

Let's apply this to the argument:

"Dr. McKenzie said all kids can fly, so it must be true!"

This statement is defective based on several possible categories:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The statement "all kids can fly" is an overgeneralization without evidence or logical basis, making it a generalization fallacy.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The fact that Dr. McKenzie said something does not inherently provide conclusive evidence that the statement is true. The argument relies on the authority of Dr. McKenzie without substantive proof.

3. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - The argument implies that because Dr. McKenzie said it, presumably everyone should accept it without question. This is a fallacy of appealing to authority or consensus without critical evaluation.

Therefore, the statement can be identified as defective due to multiple argument types, where Generalization and Inconclusive Reason are especially prominent.
