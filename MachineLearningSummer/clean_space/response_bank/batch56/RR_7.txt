Certainly! Let's apply the defective argument types to analyze the statement:

"When my parents talk to me about how important it is to learn a second language, I remind them they didn't learn another language."

This argument seems designed to dismiss the importance of learning a second language based on the fact that the parents themselves did not do so. Here's a breakdown using the defined defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This statement does not seem to be a generalization, given it is a specific personal scenario.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not mention all possible reasons for why learning a second language might be important, and instead focuses solely on the parents' example.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: It uses the parents' personal history as an inconclusive reason to undermine their advice. Personal anecdotes don't provide a solid foundation against the established benefits of learning a second language.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is no causal relationship provided that shows how the parents not learning another language directly invalidates their advice or the practice itself.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The argument doesn't involve repeating the proposition; it contrasts advice with personal action.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument does not seem to rely on an assumed consensus, though it improperly leverages the parents' experience as representative.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The argument is clear in its phrasing and does not utilize ambiguous language.

Given these considerations, the applied defective argument type (<IDAA>) would be **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. The argument dismisses the importance of learning a second language based on a non-validating, isolated personal example, rather than addressing the broader, evidence-based reasons for its importance.
