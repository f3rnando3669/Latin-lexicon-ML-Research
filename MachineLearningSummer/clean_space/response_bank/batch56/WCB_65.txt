For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application. Given the argument:

P1: Smoking has been empirically proven to cause lung cancer.
C: Therefore, if we eradicate smoking, we will eradicate lung cancer.

Let's apply the defective argument types to determine if any are present:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This doesn't seem to be a case of generalization as it doesn't overextend a property of a sample to the entire population.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not seem to leave out other possible causes or instances of lung cancer explicitly, so it likely doesn't fit this category.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This might be the most fitting defective argument type here. The premise establishes a causal relationship between smoking and lung cancer, but concluding that eradicating smoking will completely eradicate lung cancer is inconclusive. There are other causes of lung cancer, such as genetic factors, exposure to radon gas, asbestos, etc.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This might also apply, as the argument lacks consideration of the multifaceted causes of lung cancer, thus having an insufficient causal basis for concluding complete eradication of the disease.
   
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: There is no faulty repetition of the same proposition here. The conclusion introduces a new aspect.
   
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument does not rely on a presumed consensus, so this type doesn't seem applicable.
   
7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: There is no evident use of ambiguous language in terms like "eradicating smoking" or "lung cancer."

Given the analysis, the most appropriate defective argument types to apply to this argument are:

- <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), as the conclusion that eradicating smoking will eradicate lung cancer does not necessarily follow from the premise since other causes of lung cancer exist.
- <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis), because the argument does not take into account the complex causal web contributing to lung cancer.

Hence, the argument can be critiqued for employing <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
