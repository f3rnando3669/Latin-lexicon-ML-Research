For 
Applying the **Identification of Defective Argument Analysis** (IDAA) to the given statement:

"Mormonism is one of the fastest growing sects of Christianity today so that whole story about Joseph Smith getting the golden plates that, unfortunately, disappeared back into heaven, must be true!"

1. **Identify the Components**:
   - Claim 1: Mormonism is one of the fastest growing sects of Christianity today.
   - Claim 2: The story about Joseph Smith getting the golden plates that disappeared back into heaven must be true.

2. **Determine the Logical Structure**:
   - The argument implies that the growth of Mormonism (Claim 1) is evidence or justification for the truth of the story about Joseph Smith (Claim 2).

3. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument type is not directly relevant here as it does not make a broad conclusion from specific instances.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This argument type is not directly relevant here as it does not omit necessary parts of a list or sets to prove a point.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This reasoning type might apply because the argument connects the popularity of a religion to the truth of its foundational stories, which is not logically conclusive. A sect growing in numbers does not inherently validate the truth of its foundational myths.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This might also apply, as the argument suggests a causal link between the growth of Mormonism and the truth of its stories without sufficient justification.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This isn't directly applicable as there is no repetition of a faulty proposition in this argument.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This applies as the argument presumes that because a large number of people adhere to Mormonism, the story must be true. It assumes that a consensus (growth of the sect) implies validity.
   - **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This does not seem to be a primary issue here as the language isn't particularly vague or ambiguous.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The primary defective arguments present in the statement are Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), and Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>).

So, the analysis results in highlighting three defective argument types: <IR>, <WCB>, and <FU>.
