The phrase "Ninety percent of all people surveyed said that McDonalds is better than Burger King so it must be true." represents the defective argument type called **Presumptuous Consensus** (<FU>).

Here's how:

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This fallacy occurs when someone assumes that because a majority of people hold a certain belief, that belief must be true. In this case, the argument assumes that because 90% of surveyed individuals believe McDonald's is better than Burger King, it must indeed be better. However, the truth of the matter does not necessarily follow from the number of people who believe it.
