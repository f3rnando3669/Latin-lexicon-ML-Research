For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argumentation Analysis. Let's analyze the statement "Joseph can’t be class president, he’s poor!” and identify any potential defective argument types from the list provided.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument doesn't seem to be a generalization of a broader claim but rather a specific statement about Joseph.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement doesn't involve listing options or possibilities, so it’s not an issue of incomplete enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This category could be relevant if the reason given doesn't logically support the conclusion. Claiming Joseph can't be class president because he is poor is an inconclusive reason, as financial status does not inherently determine leadership ability.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument might also fit here, given that it lacks a sufficient causal link between being poor and being unable to serve as class president. Poverty in itself does not cause incapability of leadership.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: There's no repetition in this argument.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: There's no indication that the argument is assuming a consensus without evidence.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The language used in the argument is quite clear and direct, albeit flawed.

Based on the analysis above, the statement "Joseph can’t be class president, he’s poor!” fits the defective argument types:

- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The reasoning that Joseph can't be class president because he is poor is inconclusive and doesn’t logically support the claim.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: There is an insufficient causal link between being poor and being disqualified from class presidency.

Thus, the <IDAA> analysis identifies the statement as suffering primarily from <IR> and <WCB> defective argument types.
