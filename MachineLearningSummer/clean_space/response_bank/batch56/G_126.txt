It seems that you're asking to identify the defective argument type in the statement: "Running in the halls at school is against the rules. Therefore, the indoor track team should be written up."

The argument makes a leap in reasoning that doesn't take into account significant contextual differences between running in the halls and running as part of an authorized activity like an indoor track team. This kind of leap can be tagged under <IR> for Inconclusive Reason, as the conclusion doesn't logically follow from the premise due to missing contextual considerations. 

So, the statement can be tagged as follows:

**<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** "Running in the halls at school is against the rules. Therefore, the indoor track team should be written up."
