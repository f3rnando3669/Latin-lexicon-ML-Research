For 
<IDAA> stands for Irrelevant Diversion from the Actual Argument. It occurs when the second speaker introduces an unrelated issue to divert attention from the original topic. This tactic often shifts focus from one argument to another, without addressing the substantive points of the initial argument. 

In the given exchange:

Speaker 1: I think itâ€™s terrible that a game hunter killed Cecil the lion.
Speaker 2: What about all the babies that are killed every day by abortion?

Speaker 2 employs an <IDAA> type of defective argument. Instead of addressing the points raised by Speaker 1 regarding the game hunter and Cecil the lion, Speaker 2 introduces the topic of abortions, which is unrelated to the issue of game hunting and animal rights being discussed by Speaker 1. This diversion does not provide a relevant counter-argument but rather deflects from the original topic to a completely separate and emotionally charged issue.
