The argument presented is:

"The meteorologist predicted the wrong amount of rain for May. Obviously, the meteorologist is unreliable."

To identify the defective argument type (IDAA), let's analyze the structure and reasoning:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument takes a single instance (one incorrect prediction) and generalizes it to conclude that the meteorologist is overall unreliable. Generalizing based on one example is not logically sound.

Thus, the relevant defective argument type here is:

**Generalization (<G>)****

Explanation: Failing a single forecast does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that a meteorologist is unreliable in all predictions. To make such a conclusion, one would need more comprehensive data showing a consistent pattern of inaccuracy. Hence, the argument suffers from a generalization fallacy.
