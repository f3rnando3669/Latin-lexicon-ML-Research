For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application, the method you are using to apply the classification system to specific arguments.

For the statement "Pain-Away worked for me, so it’s sure to work for you, too.":

1. **Generalization (G)**: This statement could be categorized as a Generalization because it assumes that if Pain-Away worked for the speaker, it will necessarily work for the listener. This oversimplifies reality by ignoring individual differences and specific conditions.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement might also fall under Incomplete Enumeration because it implicitly presents a limited set of data points (in this case, just one) and draws a conclusion from it without considering a broader range of evidence.

Thus, using <IDAA>, the statement "Pain-Away worked for me, so it’s sure to work for you, too." can be identified as examples of <G> (Generalization) and <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration).
