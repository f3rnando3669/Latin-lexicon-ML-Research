Let’s break down the statement to identify and apply the defective argument types as defined:

"The Americans I know say they elected the new president because they were tired of having their jobs sent overseas. This question of jobs brought this president into office."

1. **Generalization (<G>):** This argument type is applied because the statement is making a broad conclusion about why the president was elected based on the opinions of a small, unspecified group of Americans. The speaker generalizes the reason from a limited sample to the whole population.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This argument type can also apply here, as the statement implies that jobs being sent overseas is the sole or primary reason for electing the president without considering or acknowledging other possible factors or reasons.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This statement might not necessarily fall under IR directly since it attempts to give a reason (jobs being sent overseas). However, if the implication is that this is the conclusive reason without sufficient evidence to prove its predominance, it might indirectly touch upon this defect.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The statement could potentially be categorized under this argument type as well. It assumes a causal relationship between the Americans’ concern for job outsourcing and the election results without providing sufficient evidence to support this causation.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This argument type doesn't seem directly relevant here, as the proposition is stated once without unnecessary repetition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This argument assumes a consensus—that most or all Americans elected the president for this reason—without evidence to support that such a widespread agreement exists.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** The statement doesn't involve particularly ambiguous language; it is relatively straightforward in its wording.

Based on these identifications, the defective argument types that apply include Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), and Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>).

The revised IDAA (Identification and Application of Defective Argument Types) summary for the statement is as follows:

- **Generalization (<G>):** The speaker makes a broad conclusion based on the opinions of a limited group.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The speaker suggests a single reason for the election without considering other factors.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The speaker assumes causality without sufficient evidence.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The speaker presumes a widespread agreement without adequate support.
