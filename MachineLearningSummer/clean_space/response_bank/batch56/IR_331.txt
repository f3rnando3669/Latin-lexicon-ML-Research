<IDAA> stands for Identify Defective Argument Application.

When someone argues that something isn't true simply because they find it difficult to understand, it could be identified as a defective argument type known as Inconclusive Reason (<IR>).

Inconclusive Reason (IR): This type of argument is defective because it draws a conclusion without sufficient evidence or reasoning. Just because someone personally finds something hard to grasp does not logically imply that the thing in question is false. The truth of a proposition is independent of someone's ability to understand it. Hence, this argument type lacks a conclusive basis for its claim.
