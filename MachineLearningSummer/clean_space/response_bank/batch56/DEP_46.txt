For 
<IDAA> refers to "Identify the Defective Argument Types Applied."

Let's analyze the provided statement for defective argument types based on the defined categories:

"His political party wants to spend your precious tax dollars on big government. But my political party is planning strategic federal investment in critical programs."

1. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The phrase "big government" is ambiguous and laden with negative connotations, while "strategic federal investment in critical programs" is phrased positively and somewhat vaguely. This creates an unfair contrast without clear definitions of what each entails.

2. **Generalization (G)**: The statement makes a blanket generalization about the opposing political party's intentions ("wants to spend your precious tax dollars on big government") without detailed evidence or nuance.

3. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The argument implies that "strategic federal investment in critical programs" is inherently different and better than "big government" spending, but it doesn't provide specific evidence to support this claim. It repeats a proposition that one is good and the other is bad without a thorough comparison.

4. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument presumes that the audience will agree with the negative view of "big government" and the positive view of "strategic federal investment" without providing sufficient evidence or reasoning.

Based on these observations, the defective argument types applied to the statement are:

<IDAA>: <DEP>, <G>, <RR>, <FU>
