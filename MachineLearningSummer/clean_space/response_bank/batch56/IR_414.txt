For 
Applying the specified defective argument types to the statement:

"The logic teacher was hired to fill the new computer animation class. He is a great admirer of Pixar's work and will do a great job."

1. **<G> (Generalization)**: The statement assumes that because the logic teacher admires Pixar's work, he will do a great job teaching computer animation. This is a generalization because admiration for a company's work does not necessarily translate to the ability to teach a completely different subject effectively.

2. **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: The statement does not consider other important qualifications or skills that might be necessary for teaching a computer animation class. It only focuses on the teacher's admiration for Pixar, omitting other potential factors.

3. **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: The claim that the teacher will do a great job is based on the inconclusive reason of his admiration for Pixar's work. Admiring Pixar does not sufficiently support the conclusion that he will excel in teaching computer animation.

4. **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: There is an insufficient causal basis for believing that admiration for Pixar's work translates to teaching competence in computer animation. The causal link between these two aspects is weak or unsupported.

5. **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: This defective argument type does not seem to apply directly to this statement, as there is no repetition of a proposition in this context.

6. **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: There is an implicit assumption that everyone would agree that admiration for Pixar is a sufficient qualification for teaching computer animation. This presumption may not be justified and is fallacious.

7. **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language)**: The term "great job" is somewhat ambiguous and subjective. What constitutes a "great job" can vary widely depending on individual interpretations and standards.

Overall, the statement can be criticized for using Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), and Ambiguous Language (<DEP>).
