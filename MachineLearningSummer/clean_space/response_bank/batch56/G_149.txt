To analyze the argument in question under the heading of Defective Arguments, we need to classify it according to the types defined:

**Argument Analysis:**
"Religion may have been wrong about a few things, but science has been wrong about many more things!"

**Argument Application:**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument suggests that because science has been wrong many times, it is less reliable or less valid. However, this overlooks the numerous instances where science has been right and the self-correcting nature of the scientific method. The argument fails to consider the complete context and relevant details, exaggerating the faults of science while minimizing those of religion.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reasoning here is inconclusive. Just because science has made mistakes does not inherently make it less credible; the argument does not provide a logical conclusion linking the number of mistakes directly to the validity or reliability of science versus religion.

**Defective Argument Application (IDAA):**
1. **FE:** The argument commits the error of Incomplete Enumeration by not fully accounting for all evidence and instances of correctness from science, while vaguely referencing the failures.
2. **IR:** The argument provides an inconclusive reason. It doesn't factually connect the premise (science being wrong) with the conclusion implying science is less trustworthy than religion.

Thus, the argument: "Religion may have been wrong about a few things, but science has been wrong about many more things!" exhibits both **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** and **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** as defective argument types.
