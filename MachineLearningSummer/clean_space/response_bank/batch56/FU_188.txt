For 
In the given statement, "when evidence boils down to 'everybody's doing it, so it must be a good thing to do," we are dealing with a defective argument type. This type of argument relies on the presumption that the popularity of an action or belief inherently validates its goodness or correctness. 

Let's apply the defective argument type definitions to this statement:

- Generalization (<G>): This involves drawing a broad conclusion based on limited evidence. However, this doesn't directly apply to the statement, which is about drawing a conclusion based on popularity rather than limited examples.

- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>): This involves considering only some evidence or factors while ignoring others. While this can be relevant in some contexts, it is not the primary issue with the provided statement.

- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>): This means reaching a conclusion that is not sufficiently supported by the reasons given. Although the popularity of an action is presented as evidence, it isn't a conclusive reason for its goodness.

- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>): This involves claiming a causal relationship without sufficient evidence to prove it. While the argument implies causation between popularity and goodness, it doesn't fit perfectly here.

- Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>): This involves repeatedly asserting a proposition without providing new evidence or reasoning. The statement does repeat an idea but doesn’t necessarily fit the definition's repetition aspect.

- Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>): This involves assuming that widespread agreement or participation validates the correctness of a claim. This is an exact match for the argument presented. The statement assumes that "everybody's doing it" is sufficient evidence that it is "a good thing to do."

- Ambiguous Language (<DEP>): This refers to the use of unclear or ambiguous terms. The language in the statement is relatively clear, so this doesn’t apply.

Therefore, the defective argument type that applies to "when evidence boils down to 'everybody's doing it, so it must be a good thing to do" is <FU>—Presumptuous Consensus. Similarly, in Spanish:

"cuando la evidencia se reduce a "todo el mundo lo está haciendo, por lo que debe ser algo bueno"" también encaja en <FU>, que es el Consenso Presuntuoso.
