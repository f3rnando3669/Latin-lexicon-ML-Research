To analyze the given argument using the defined defective argument types, let's break down the statement and identify any logical flaws present:

**Argument:**
"Based on a survey of 1000 American homeowners, 99% of those surveyed have two or more automobiles worth on average $100,000 each. Therefore, Americans are very wealthy."

**Possible Identification of Defective Argument Types (IDAAs):**

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - This argument generalizes the financial status of all Americans based on a survey of just 1000 homeowners. This is too small and not representative of the entire American population.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The survey results are based on a specific group of homeowners, not considering renters, people who do not own homes, or those outside the surveyed demographic.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - Owning multiple expensive automobiles does not necessarily equate to overall wealth or reflect the financial status of Americans holistically.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - The argument assumes causation or a direct link between owning expensive cars and being wealthy without addressing other factors that contribute to overall wealth.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - There is no faulty repetition in this argument; it does not repeat the proposition unnecessarily.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - The argument presumes that the survey results represent a common consensus about American wealth without substantial evidence.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - The term "very wealthy" is subjective and ambiguous, thus making the argument less precise.

Most applicable defective argument types:
- **<G> (Generalization)**: Assuming that the wealth status of 1000 homeowners represents all Americans.
- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: The argument fails to include the entire demographic of Americans, only focusing on a subset.
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: Equating car ownership with overall wealth without sufficient reasoning.
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: Assuming car ownership is a direct and sufficient indicator of wealth.
- **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language)**: The term "very wealthy" is not specifically defined.

Conclusively, the argument is flawed due to <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, and <DEP>.
