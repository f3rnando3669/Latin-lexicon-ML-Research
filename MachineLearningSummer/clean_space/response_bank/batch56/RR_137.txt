Certainly, using the defective argument type definitions provided:

- **Generalization (G)**: Making a broad statement based on a small or unrepresentative sample.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Failing to consider all possible options or evidence.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Using evidence that does not definitively support the conclusion.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Asserting causation without sufficient evidence.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Repeating the same proposition without adding new evidence.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assuming that a belief is true because many people believe it.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Using vague or ambiguous language to make an argument.

Applying the defective argument analysis:

### Argument Analysis:
"The Bible is the Word of God because God tells us it is... in the Bible.
X is true because of Y.
Y is true because of X."

### Applied Defective Argument Type:
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**

#### Explanation:
The argument is an example of **circular reasoning**, where the proposition that "The Bible is the Word of God" is supported by the claim that "God tells us it is" and the evidence for this claim is found in the Bible itself. This forms a circle where X (the Bible is the Word of God) is justified by Y (God tells us it is the Word of God), and Y is in turn justified by X (the Bible).

This constitutes a **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** because the proposition (Bible = Word of God) is essentially being repeated without any independent or new evidence. The conclusion depends on the same premise it aims to prove, thus failing to provide any external validation.

---

This analysis shows that the primary issue with the argument is the reliance on circular logic, classified here as **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**.
