For 
Your request appears to involve identifying defective argument types in a statement or argument, and applying a certain designation, <IDAA>, to the statement given.

First, let's clarify the given statement:
"A lifelong Republican who was against Obamacare until it saved his life."

To apply the defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This would involve making a broad, sweeping statement based on limited evidence. 
   
   Example (if it existed in the given statement): 
   - "All Republicans are against Obamacare." (This is a generalization, but it's not explicitly in the given sentence.)

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This pertains to failing to consider all relevant possibilities or factors.
   
   Example (if it existed in the given statement):
   - Ignoring other Republicans who might support Obamacare would be a <FE>, but the sentence doesn't enumerate all Republicans' viewpoints.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This means providing a reason that does not conclusively support the conclusion.
   
   Example (if it existed in the given statement):
   - "Being against Obamacare makes one a lifelong Republican." (Not a valid/logical conclusion reflected here.)

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This involves attributing a cause without sufficient evidence.
   
   Example (if it existed in the given statement):
   - "Opposing Obamacare saved his life." (This incorrectly attributes a cause-effect relationship.)

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This involves repeating a proposition in a faulty or misleading way.
   
   Example (if it existed in the given statement):
   - Repeatedly implying that "lifelong Republicans always oppose Obamacare" without further context.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This means assuming a consensus that might not exist.
   
   Example (if it existed in the given statement):
   - "Everyone knows Republicans are against Obamacare." (An unwarranted assumption not in the statement.)

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This involves using unclear or vague language.
   
   Example: 
   - The term "saved his life" could be considered ambiguous, depending on the context, but generally here it is clear.

Finally, let’s apply the designation: <IDAA>

It looks like <IDAA> might be an identifier or a label applied based on the analysis.

In the given statement, a potential defect could be found if you infer a generalization or a presumptuous consensus, but because the argument is personal and specific to an individual's experience, it does not necessarily fit these types directly.

Therefore, applying an analysis, I wouldn't designate any explicit defective argument types from your list directly to the given sentence.

However, if interpreting hidden assumptions:
- There could be a **Generalization (<G>)** in play if one assumes that being a “lifelong Republican” and opposing Obamacare are causally related beyond personal experience.

Annotated Designation: **<IDAA> - Potential G**

Thus, the statement:
**"A lifelong Republican who was against Obamacare until it saved his life."** (Potential generalization when interpreting the relationship between political affiliation and healthcare stance.)

I hope this addresses the application adequately based on your criteria!
