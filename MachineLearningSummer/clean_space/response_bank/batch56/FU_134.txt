The question "What type of appeal taps into the desire to belong to a group?" is seeking to identify a persuasive technique that capitalizes on an individual's inherent need for social belonging. This type of appeal is commonly known as an **appeal to social belonging** or often referred to under the umbrella of **bandwagon appeal** in persuasive contexts. 

Bandwagon appeal works by suggesting that one should adopt a particular behavior, belief, or product because "everyone else" is doing it, triggering the psychological inclination to conform to group norms.

For the purposes of this exercise, here is the corresponding defective argument type identification and application (**IDAA**):

1. **Defective Argument Type**:
   None of the listed defective argument types specifically relate to the concept by name. However, one might often find faulty reasoning along similar lines under these classifications in other contexts:
   - **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: If the argument incorrectly assumes or misrepresents the consensus of a group to make someone feel they must conform.

2. **Explain How It Could Apply**:
   - **<FU>: Presumptuous Consensus**: If an argument insists that because "everyone is doing it" or believing it, one should too, it can sometimes ignore genuine diversity of opinion or the credibility of the consensus being invoked.

In summary, the correct type of appeal is the **bandwagon appeal**, and it can be prone to defects akin to **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus** if the consensus is not genuinely established or is falsely represented.
