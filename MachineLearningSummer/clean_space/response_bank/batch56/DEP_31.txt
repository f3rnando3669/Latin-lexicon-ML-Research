For 
The argument type <IDAA> denotes "Insufficient Documentation or Attestation of Argument." In this context, it can be applied to the statement as follows:

The given statement asserts the existence and empirical verification of leprechauns by referring to a book that purportedly provided the evidence. However, the claim is undermined by the lack of verifiable documentation:

- The book mentioned is not named.
- The author of the book is not recalled.
- The person does not have the book anymore to provide any further proof or reference.

Therefore, this statement is a prime example of <IDAA>—Insufficient Documentation or Attestation of Argument—because the claim relies on an unverified and unverifiable source. The lack of specific, accessible, and verifiable information makes the argument defective.
