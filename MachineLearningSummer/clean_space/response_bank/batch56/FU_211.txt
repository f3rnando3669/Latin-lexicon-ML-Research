For 
To apply the Identifying Defective Argument Analysis (IDAA) to the statement "Now that the Chiefs are going to the Super Bowl, everybody is suddenly a fan," we need to examine if any predefined defective argument types are present in the statement.

Let's break down the possible defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: The statement says "everybody" is suddenly a fan, which is an overgeneralization. It's unlikely that every single person has suddenly become a fan of the Chiefs just because they are going to the Super Bowl.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This defect isn't apparent here as the statement isn't attempting to list all instances or categories incomplete. 

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning provided (the Chiefs going to the Super Bowl causing everyone to become fans) is not definitive and lacks solid evidence supporting that it applies universally.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This may partially apply because the statement implies causation without sufficient evidence. However, the primary defect seems to be more related to overgeneralization.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The argument isn't repeating propositions, so this doesn't apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The statement presumes a consensus (that "everybody" is now a fan), which isn't supported by evidence.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: "Everybody" is a term here that potentially adds ambiguity since "everybody" is rarely literal and often used hyperbolically.

Upon analyzing the statement:

- The primary defective argument type appears to be **Generalization (G)** because it makes a sweeping claim without sufficient evidence.
  
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** is also relevant because the reasoning lacks conclusive support.
  
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** since it presumes an agreed-upon and universally accepted change in fandom without substantiation.

Thus, the defective arguments identified in the statement "Now that the Chiefs are going to the Super Bowl, everybody is suddenly a fan" can be classified as follows:

**<G>** - Generalization: The assertion that "everybody" is suddenly a fan is an overgeneralization.

**<IR>** - Inconclusive Reason: The claim that the Chiefs going to the Super Bowl is the reason for this supposed universal fandom lacks conclusive evidence.

**<FU>** - Presumptuous Consensus: The statement presumes that there's a unanimous and widespread change in support without concrete evidence.
