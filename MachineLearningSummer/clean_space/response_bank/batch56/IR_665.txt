For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application. 
Given the argument "Compares minor problems with much more serious crimes":

This argument is comparing two things that differ significantly in terms of their severity and impact, leading to a false equivalence. This kind of defective argument could be classified as **Faulty Comparison (FC)**.

Faulty Comparison (FC) is when someone draws a conclusion by comparing two things that are not sufficiently alike or are incomparable in significant ways.

So the application of <IDAA> to "Compares minor problems with much more serious crimes" would be:

<IDAA><FC>"Compares minor problems with much more serious crimes"</FC></IDAA>

However, if we stick strictly to the provided defective argument types, none of them distinctly encompasses the notion of faulty comparison. Therefore, a more generalized classification could be used:

<IDAA><IR>"Compares minor problems with much more serious crimes"</IR></IDAA>

This places the argument under **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the comparison made is misleading and does not lead to a sound conclusion.
