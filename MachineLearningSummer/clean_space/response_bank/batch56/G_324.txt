For 
To apply "Identify Defective Argument Type Applied" (<IDAA>) to the statement "If you vote for her, the government as we know it will fall apart," we need to analyze it based on the defective argument types defined:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This involves making a broad claim based on limited evidence. The statement doesn’t fit this category as it makes a specific prediction about the singular action of voting for her.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This is when not all relevant options are considered or presented. The statement doesn’t list options but makes a direct cause-and-effect claim, which doesn’t fit this type.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This involves presenting reasons that don't strongly support the conclusion. The statement can potentially fit here as it assumes a direct and dramatic outcome from a single action without offering sufficient reasons or evidence to support the claim.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This is when a cause-and-effect relationship is claimed without enough evidence. The statement fits well into this category since it implies that voting for a particular candidate will result in a drastic change without providing evidence for such a causal connection.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This is when a claim is repeated to make it more believable without addressing its validity. The statement is a singular occurrence and doesn’t exhibit repetitive argumentation.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This is assuming without support that everyone would agree. The statement doesn’t allude to a consensus, so it’s not FU.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This involves using vague or unclear terminology. The statement could be seen to fit this type if "the government as we know it" is considered ambiguous, but it is more specific than what this defect usually implies.

Based on the analysis, the most fitting defective argument types for the statement "If you vote for her, the government as we know it will fall apart" are:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, since it claims a significant cause-and-effect relationship without supporting evidence.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, since it provides a dramatic conclusion without strong supporting reasons.
