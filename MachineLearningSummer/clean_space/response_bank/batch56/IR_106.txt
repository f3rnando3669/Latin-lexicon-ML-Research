To analyze the argument "I think scientists are wrong. There is no such thing as global warming. I just finished talking to my boss, and he thought the idea was ridiculous." using the defective argument types defined, we can break it down to see which types apply:

- **Generalization (<G>):** This type is applied when a broad conclusion is drawn from a small or unrepresentative sample of evidence. In this case, the speaker generalizes the opinion of their boss to the broader scientific consensus on global warming.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This type involves considering only a subset of evidence, ignoring other relevant data. Here, the person relies solely on the opinion of their boss without acknowledging the extensive research and data supporting global warming.
  
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This type refers to drawing a conclusion that isn’t justified by the evidence provided. The boss’s opinion is not a conclusive reason to deny global warming since it lacks empirical support.
  
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This type involves assuming agreement from a group without sufficient basis. The speaker implies that their boss's opinion casts doubt on the scientific community's consensus, which is not justified.
  
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** Here, there may be some ambiguity in terms like "ridiculous," which are subjective and not specific or scientific.

Therefore, the argument predominantly falls under:
  
1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Generalizing the opinion of one person (the boss) to dismiss the scientific consensus on global warming.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Ignoring vast scientific evidence and relying on a single opinion.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The boss’s opinion is insufficient and unjustified to conclude the non-existence of global warming.
4. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Assuming that one contrary opinion discredits the scientific consensus.

These defective argument types undermine the validity of the argument presented.
