For 
The argument "Trump won't release his tax returns and prove he's clean, therefore he must have something to hide" can be analyzed for defective arguments as follows:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument assumes that the only possible reason for not releasing the tax returns is that there is something to hide. However, there could be other reasons such as privacy concerns or procedural considerations. This type of argument falls under <FE> because it fails to consider all possible reasons and thus provides an incomplete enumeration of potential explanations.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Even if Trump does not release his tax returns, it does not logically follow with certainty that he must have something to hide. The refusal to release could be due to a multitude of reasons as mentioned above. Therefore, the reasoning provided is inconclusive, which falls under <IR>.

Given these points, the application of the argument type <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Analysis) leads to identifying the argument as containing both <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration) and <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) defective argument types.
