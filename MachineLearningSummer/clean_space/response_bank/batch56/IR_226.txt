For 
<IDAA>, short for "Identifying Defective Argument Types", involves determining which, if any, fallacies or defective argument types are present in a given statement.

Let's analyze the given statement: "Robert Downey Jr. thinks everyone should vote. However, Robert Downey Jr. once went to prison for drug use. So, he's obviously wrong."

Here are the types of defective arguments defined:

- **<G> Generalization**
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**

In this case, the reasoning appears faulty because it's attacking Robert Downey Jr.'s character rather than addressing the merit of his argument about voting. This is known as an ad hominem fallacy, which isn't listed explicitly in the defective argument types provided, but it could be seen as a subtype of <IR> Inconclusive Reason because the reason for dismissing his argument (his past criminal record) is irrelevant to the truth of the argument itself.

Therefore, the defective argument type applicable here is:

<IR> Inconclusive Reason

The statement dismisses Robert Downey Jr.'s point about voting due to an irrelevant reason (his past drug use and imprisonment), which does not logically affect the validity of his viewpoint on voting.
