For 
The argument provided is:

"How can you tell me I should exercise to lose weight? All you do is sit behind a desk all day. I've never seen you do a lick of exercise."

This argument commits the **Ad Hominem** fallacy. The person dismisses the advice to exercise by attacking the character or behavior of the one providing the advice, rather than addressing the merits of the advice itself. They argue that because the advice-giver is perceived as not following their own advice, their recommendation is invalid. This does not logically follow because the truth or falsity of a statement (that exercise helps with weight loss) is independent of the person making the statement.

### Explanation with the Defective Argument Types:

None of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>) directly describe the Ad Hominem fallacy present here. However, identifying it as an Ad Hominem falls under identifying irrelevant attacks which discredit the person rather than the argument itself. 

To explicitly show how it does not fit into each defective argument type defined:
- **<G> Generalization**: The argument does not overgeneralize a small sample.
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: The argument does not ignore part of the evidence.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The argument does not base its conclusion on inconclusive evidence.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: The argument does not claim an insufficiently established causal connection.
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: The argument does not repeatedly state a proposition without support.
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: The argument does not claim agreement among experts where none exists.
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**: The argument does not rely on ambiguous terms or language.

Therefore, the logical fallacy committed here is Ad Hominem.
