For 
To analyze the given statement "Paranormal activity is real because I've seen a ghost" using the aforementioned defective argument types, we should determine which categories, if any, it falls into. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument does not collect data from a set and extrapolate to a broader conclusion, so it does not fit Generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not list a set of instances to reach its conclusion. It’s based on a singular occurrence rather than an enumerated list of experiences.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The statement does offer a reason ("I've seen a ghost"), but it’s not a definitively conclusive reason for the claim being made (that paranormal activity is real). Seeing something that looks like a ghost does not necessarily prove paranormal activity conclusively. Therefore, this could be considered an Inconclusive Reason.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument suggests a causal relationship (seeing a ghost = paranormal activity is real) but does so without sufficient evidence to establish this causation definitively. Hence, "Insufficient Causal Basis" may apply.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This argument does not contain repeated propositions, so it does not meet the criteria for Faulty Repetition of Proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This argument does not rely on a claim that a consensus exists or presume that the belief is widely accepted, so it does not qualify as Presumptuous Consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This argument does not appear to rely on ambiguous terminology. The terms used (paranormal activity and ghost) may have different interpretations but the structure of the argument itself does not hinge on ambiguity in language. So, it is not Ambiguous Language.

After analyzing, the defective argument types that best apply to the given statement are:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

So, we can apply the following labels:
\[ \text{IR, WCB} \]
