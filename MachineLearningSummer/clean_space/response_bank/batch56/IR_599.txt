For 
The term "<IDAA>" was not defined in your list of defective argument types. Therefore, I cannot directly apply it to the given scenario without further information on its meaning.

However, I can analyze the given argument to see if it fits any of the defined defective argument types:

"You don’t have to do this. My grandmother is in the hospital. I need my salary to support her medication. She’s dying."

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument is not making a broad generalization about a group or situation based on limited evidence, so it doesn't fit the criteria for <G>.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument doesn't provide a limited list of options or scenarios without considering all possibilities; hence, it doesn't fit <FE>.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: There could be an argument here that the premise (grandmother in the hospital) doesn't logically justify the conclusion (you don't have to do this), but it depends on the context of "this."

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This might apply if the argument is suggesting that someone's actions directly cause or affect the grandmother's condition without sufficient causal explanation. However, this exact argument doesn't seem to fit under <WCB>.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This argument does not seem to involve repeating a proposition to make it seem more valid, so <RR> does not apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument doesn't assume that everyone agrees with the sentiment being expressed, so it doesn't fit <FU>.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language used is quite clear in expressing the situation, so <DEP> doesn't seem to fit either.

Without knowing what <IDAA> specifically refers to, it's difficult to apply it accurately. However, given the context, you might argue that this argument is appealing to emotion (a type of logical fallacy known as "appeal to pity"), where the speaker's personal circumstances are being used to sway the listener’s decision. If <IDAA> relates to this type of fallacy, then it could potentially be applied here.
