For 
<IR> - Inconclusive Reason.

The argument "We must eliminate affirmative action. We canâ€™t rely on laws to end racial prejudice." attempts to draw a conclusion (that affirmative action should be eliminated) based on a premise (that laws cannot end racial prejudice). However, the premise does not necessarily lead to the conclusion. The inability of laws to end racial prejudice does not automatically imply that affirmative action should be eliminated; the rationale is incomplete and does not directly support the given conclusion. Hence, there is an inconclusive reason for eliminating affirmative action based on the provided premise.
