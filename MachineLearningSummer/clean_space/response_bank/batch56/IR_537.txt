For 
It appears that you defined several defective argument types but didn't define <IDAA>. However, "If you don’t agree to sign the labor agreement, we’ll fire you," can be categorized in argumentation theory as an example of the appeal to force, also known as argumentum ad baculum (appeal to the stick).

Since the missing <IDAA> designation is not clear, let's tentatively define it as:

**<IDAA> - Appeal to Force (Argumentum ad Baculum)**

Now, applying <IDAA> to the statement:

"If you don’t agree to sign the labor agreement, we’ll fire you." <IDAA>

This indicates the use of coercion or threats as a means to compel agreement, rather than providing a logical or reasonable argument to agree to the labor agreement.
