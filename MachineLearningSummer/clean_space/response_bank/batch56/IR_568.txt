For 
The argument presented can be analyzed as follows:

"My opponent in this debate wants all of you to increase taxes for a recycling program, but his own company has been fined over a dozen times for pollution and environmental damage."

To apply <IDAA> (Indentify Defective Argument Attributes):

1. **Identify the Argument**:
   - The main argument is attempting to discredit the opponent's proposal to increase taxes for a recycling program by pointing out the opponent's company's past fines for pollution.

2. **Determine if the Argument is Defective**:
   - This argument might be attempting to undermine the opponent's credibility rather than addressing the merits of the recycling program itself.

3. **Attribute the Defective Type**:
   - **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The fines against the opponent's company are unrelated to the merits or demerits of the proposed tax increase for a recycling program. It introduces information that does not conclusively impact the proposal itself.
   - **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**: The phrase "fined over a dozen times" might be used ambiguously to invoke a negative impression without offering specifics that would allow for a direct and relevant comparison to the proposal under debate.

4. **Assign the Attributes**:
   - The argument contains aspects of both <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <DEP> (Ambiguous Language). 

Summary: The argument "My opponent in this debate wants all of you to increase taxes for a recycling program, but his own company has been fined over a dozen times for pollution and environmental damage." demonstrates traits of <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) because the fines are not directly relevant to the merit of the tax increase for recycling and <DEP> (Ambiguous Language) due to the nonspecific nature of the alleged fines.
