The argument you've provided can be analyzed for defective reasoning as follows:

"Jimmy stole Tommy’s lunch in the past. Therefore, it is acceptable for Tommy to steal Jimmy’s lunch today."

Upon inspection, this argument seems to revolve around a form of reasoning related to justice or retribution. Let's identify possible defects in the logical structure using the defined defective argument types.

1. **Generalization (<G>):** This type of defective argument involves making a broad conclusion based on limited evidence. However, the scenario provided does not extend beyond the specific situation between Jimmy and Tommy, so this might not be the most fitting defect here.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** In involves making a conclusion by only considering part of the relevant evidence. This argument doesn’t seem to be defective because it fails to consider all relevant instances or cases. It's focused on a single event.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This involves a conclusion that doesn't necessarily follow from the reasons given. In this case, stating that an action (stealing lunch) is acceptable today because it happened in the past is faulty reasoning. This could be categorized under <IR>, as the past act does not logically justify a similar future act.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Refers to conclusions about cause and effect that aren't sufficiently supported by evidence. The argument doesn't make a causal claim, so this defect doesn’t apply here.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This involves repeatedly stating a proposition without providing evidence or a logical basis for it. Since the argument does not repeat its proposition or restate it without further justification, this defect does not apply here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Assuming that something is correct or acceptable just because everyone believes or agrees with it. This argument doesn’t rely on a consensus or widespread belief, so it doesn't apply here.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** If the argument employed ambiguous terms leading to confusion or misinterpretation, this defect would be applicable. The language in this argument is straightforward, so this defect also doesn’t seem to apply here.

Based on this analysis, the best fit for a defective argument type here is:

**<IR> Inconclusive Reason**

The argument that "because Jimmy stole Tommy’s lunch in the past, it is acceptable for Tommy to steal Jimmy’s lunch today" is logically flawed because it draws a conclusion about what is acceptable that doesn’t follow from the given reason. This type of reasoning is also commonly known as a "tu quoque" fallacy, where an attempt to justify an action by pointing to another wrong action is inherently flawed.
