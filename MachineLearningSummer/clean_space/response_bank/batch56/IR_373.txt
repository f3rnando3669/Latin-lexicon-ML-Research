For 
<IDAA> stands for Identify Defective Argument Analysis. Let's analyze the argument presented by Charlie and Bob using the defective argument types defined:

**Argument:**
- **Charlie:** Fast food is filled with salt, fat, and added sugars. We need better regulation of the industry.
- **Bob:** That may be, but you're such a hypocrite! I saw you devour a Triple-Baconator, super-sized fries, and 64oz of soda yesterday!

**Application of <IDAA>:**

1. **Argument Analysis:**
   - Charlie makes a statement about the nutritional quality of fast food and suggests the need for better regulation.
   - Bob responds by attacking Charlie's character and behavior instead of addressing the merits of Charlie's argument.

2. **Defective Argument Identification:**
   - Bob's response seems to contain a defect known as Ad Hominem. However, since it wasn't among the defective argument types initially defined, let's instead consider if any of the defined types apply.
   - Bob's rebuttal focuses on Charlie's personal behavior rather than the content of Charlie's argument. This implies an attempt to discredit Charlie's point by attacking him personally.

3. **Applying the Defined Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** Not applicable here, as Bob's argument doesn't generalize from specific cases.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Not applicable, as the argument doesn’t list an incomplete set of possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Not applicable, as the response isn't based on an inconclusive reason.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Not applicable, as no causal argument is presented.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Not applicable, as there is no repetitive proposition in Bob's statement.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Not applicable, as the response doesn’t rely on assumed agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** Not applicable, as Bob's language isn't ambiguous.

Given that none of the provided defective argument types directly match the Ad Hominem fallacy displayed by Bob, it's evident that we might need to consider Ad Hominem as its own defective type if we were expanding our list. However, based on the provided types, Bob's response doesn't fit any of the specified defective arguments.

**Conclusion:**
Bob's response is an Ad Hominem attack, which is not explicitly listed in the defined defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>). Therefore, although it's clear that Bob's argument is defective, it doesn't neatly fit into one of the defined categories. 

To more accurately classify it within our schema, the definition list could be expanded to include Ad Hominem or similar personal attack arguments.
