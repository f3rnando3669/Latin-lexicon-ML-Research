For 
Based on Representative Gutierrez's argument in the provided passage, we can identify and apply the defective argument types to analyze its potential flaws. Here is the analysis using the defined defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G):**
   Gutierrez overgeneralizes the intentions of Republicans by saying they aren't serious about limiting federal interference or promoting family values. This sweeping statement does not necessarily represent the views of all Republicans and thus may be considered an overgeneralization.

2. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   By attributing certain hypocritical motives to Republicans (e.g., joking about family values), the argument seems to presume a consensus about their insincerity without sufficient evidence. The statement implies that everyone understands Republicans as being hypocritical, which presumes a consensus that may not exist.

3. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   There is potential ambiguity in phrases like "how important it is for the federal government not to interfere" and "family values." These phrases can have different interpretations and may lack the precision needed for a clear, logical argument.

After applying the defective argument analysis, the identified defective arguments within the passage are:

1. **Generalization (G):** Overgeneralizes the Republicans' intentions.
2. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Implies a broad agreement on Republicans' insincerity without concrete evidence.
3. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** Uses vague expressions that can lead to misinterpretation.

Therefore, the passage contains instances of Generalization, Presumptuous Consensus, and Ambiguous Language.
