To analyze the sentence "Filthy and polluting coal should be banned" using the framework of defective arguments, let's break down the reasoning and identify any potential weaknesses or argumentative flaws.

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - The statement labels coal as "filthy and polluting," which is a generalization. While coal does have substantial environmental drawbacks, not all uses of coal are uniformly "filthy" since there can be varying levels of emissions and different technologies in place to mitigate pollution.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - The argument does not enumerate other potential sources of pollution or alternative solutions for reducing pollution. It isolates coal without considering a comprehensive approach to environmental policy.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The term "should be banned" suggests a straightforward conclusion, but it doesn't provide a detailed reasoning. It assumes that banning coal is the only or the best solution without exploring other measures or their implications.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - The statement implies that banning coal will solve the pollution problem, but it does not establish a sufficient causal connection between banning coal and achieving the desired reduction in pollution. It ignores other contributing factors and potential negative consequences of such a ban (e.g., economic impact, energy supply issues).

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - There is no evident repetition of the proposition in this single statement. This flaw does not appear to be applicable here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - The argument presumes a consensus by implicitly relying on a common belief that coal is "filthy and polluting." It assumes the audience agrees with this characterization without presenting concrete evidence or allowing for complexity.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - The terms "filthy" and "polluting" are somewhat ambiguous. They evoke a negative image but are not scientifically precise. This ambiguity can lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of the argument's strength and implications.

In conclusion, the argument "Filthy and polluting coal should be banned" primarily relies on a **generalization (G)** with **incomplete enumeration (FE)**, fails to present a thorough **causal basis (WCB)**, assumes **presumptuous consensus (FU)**, and uses **ambiguous language (DEP)**. Addressing these flaws would require a more nuanced discussion of coal's environmental impact, consideration of alternative strategies, and a clearer, evidence-based presentation of the issues involved.
