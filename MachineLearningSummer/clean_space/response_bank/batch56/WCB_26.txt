For 
To identify the type of defective argument in the statement "President Kumail raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up. Kumail is responsible for the rise in crime," let's apply the definitions of defective arguments provided:

**Generalization (<G>):** Drawing a general conclusion from a small or unrepresentative sample.
- This does not seem to apply, as the statement does not generalize from a sample.

**Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Failing to consider all possible explanations or variables.
- This could apply, as the statement does not consider other factors that might explain the rise in violent crime besides the tax increase.

**Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The evidence provided does not adequately support the conclusion drawn.
- This seems relevant, as the statement directly links tax increases to the rise in crime without conclusive proof.

**Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Claiming a causal relationship without sufficient evidence.
- This is highly applicable, as the statement implies a causal relationship between raising taxes and the increase in crime without sufficient evidence to establish this causality.

**Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Repeating a proposition in different words without providing new evidence.
- This does not apply to the statement.

**Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Assuming general agreement or consensus without evidence.
- This does not seem to fit the statement, as it does not imply general agreement.

**Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** Using language that can be interpreted in multiple ways, leading to confusion or misunderstanding.
- This does not appear to be the case here, as the language is clear.

Given the definitions and the analysis, the defective argument types that apply most directly to the statement are:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The statement does not consider other factors that might have caused the rise in violent crime.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The evidence given (the tax raise) does not adequately support the conclusion (increase in violent crime).
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The claim of a causal relationship between raising taxes and increased violent crime is made without sufficient evidence.

Thus, the primary defective argument type you could assign here is **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**, with possible secondary considerations of **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** and **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**.
