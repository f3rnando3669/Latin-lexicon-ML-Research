Certainly! The given statement appears to divert attention from the original question about the unemployment rate increasing. Instead of directly addressing the concern, it shifts the focus to a different issue, which can be classified as a type of defective argument known as "Ignoring or Diverting the Argument at Issue" (<IDAA>).

Here's the application:

Statement: "You asked me why the unemployment rate has increased once more, but I'm going to tell you what has an even worse effect on morale in this country."

Analysis: The speaker avoids answering the specific question about the unemployment rate and instead introduces a new topic. This evasive maneuver effectively shifts the discussion away from the original issue, thus employing the Defective Argument type <IDAA>.

Conclusion: The statement "You asked me why the unemployment rate has increased once more, but I'm going to tell you what has an even worse effect on morale in this country" utilizes <IDAA> (Ignoring or Diverting the Argument at Issue) as a defective argument technique.
