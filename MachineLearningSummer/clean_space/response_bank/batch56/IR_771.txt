Let's analyze the argument given using the defective argument types you've defined:

Argument: "My dad is a mechanic and he says that brushing your teeth twice a day is good for you. Since he is a mechanic, he knows best."

Looking at the nature of the argument, the main issue here is that the expertise of being a mechanic is irrelevant to the topic of dental hygiene. This falls into the category of using an inconclusive reason or irrelevant authority to support the claim.

Type of Defective Argument: **Inconclusive Reason** (IR)

Hereâ€™s why:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The conclusion that brushing your teeth twice a day is good for you is being supported by an authority (the dad) whose expertise does not pertain to dental hygiene. Being a mechanic does not provide any special knowledge or insight into dental health, so the reason given is not logically relevant to the conclusion.
  
Therefore, according to your definitions, this argument exemplifies an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
