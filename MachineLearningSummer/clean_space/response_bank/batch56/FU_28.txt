The statement "use of people's desire to be part of the group to convince them" refers to a type of argument that leverages social pressure to persuade individuals. This method is defective because it relies on people's need for acceptance rather than on valid evidence or logical reasoning.

To apply <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Attribute), we break down the statement and identify the relevant type of defective argument from the list provided:

- Generalization (<G>): This type might be relevant if the argument assumes that everyone has the same desire to be part of the group.
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>): This doesn't seem to apply here, as the argument isn't about listing options.
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>): This could be relevant if the desire to be part of a group is not directly related to the argument's conclusion.
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>): This might apply if the argument assumes without sufficient evidence that group membership will cause a behavior change.
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>): Not applicable here, as this argument doesn't rely on repetitive assertions.
- Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>): This is the most relevant defective argument type here. The argument presumes that consensus or a group norm is sufficient without providing independent justification.
- Ambiguous Language (<DEP>): Not directly applicable unless the argument uses vague terms to describe group dynamics.

Based on the analysis, the most fitting defective argument attribute here is:

> **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The argument leverages the assumption that because a group believes something or because there is a perceived group consensus, the conclusion must be correct, without independently validating the claim. 

This matches the idea of using social pressure or the desire for group acceptance to convince people, which is presumptively attributing the correctness of a position to its popularity within a group.
