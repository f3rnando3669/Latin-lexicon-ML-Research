To apply these definitions to the argument "You should drive on the right side of the road because that is what the law says, and the law is the law":

This argument can be considered an example of <RR> -- Faulty Repetition of Proposition. The reason is that the argument essentially repeats the statement "the law is the law" without providing additional justification or reasoning. It's merely asserting a proposition in a circular manner without further support. 

Here is the analysis:

- The initial proposition is: "You should drive on the right side of the road."
- The justification given is: "because that is what the law says."
- This justification is then supported by another proposition that is essentially the same as itself: "the law is the law."

The repetition of the statement "the law is the law" does not provide any new information or reasoning; it merely reiterates the same point. Hence, it falls under <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
