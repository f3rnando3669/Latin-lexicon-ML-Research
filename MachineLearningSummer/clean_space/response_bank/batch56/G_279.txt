For 
<IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Application):

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - The statement "White men can't jump" makes a sweeping generalization about an entire group based on race. This type of defect occurs when a broad conclusion is drawn from a limited sample.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - The claim does not provide any evidence or specific instances to support the conclusion. It fails to enumerate all cases or provide comprehensive data.

3. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - The assertion "No, really, they can't!" implies a consensus or common agreement that might not exist. It presumes that everyone agrees with the statement without evidence.

4. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - The phrase "can't jump" is ambiguous and could be interpreted in different ways. Does it mean physically unable to jump at all, or does it mean not jumping as high as others? The ambiguity affects the clarity of the argument.
