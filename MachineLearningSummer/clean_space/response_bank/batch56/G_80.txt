For 
The provided statement can be analyzed for defective arguments under the defined categories. Here's how it can be broken down:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The statement makes a broad generalization about the values in New York City, assuming that everyone in the city shares socially liberal, pro-abortion, and pro-gay marriage values. This overlooks the diversity of opinions among the population.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The statement lists specific values ("socially liberal," "pro-abortion," "pro-gay marriage") but does not provide a comprehensive or balanced enumeration of the values people in New York City might hold. Other values or opinions are omitted.

3. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - The phrase "Everybody understands" implicitly assumes a consensus among all people, disregarding the possibility that not everyone may agree with the described values.

While "Inconclusive Reason" (IR), "Insufficient Causal Basis" (WCB), "Faulty Repetition of Proposition" (RR), and "Ambiguous Language" (DEP) might also relate to certain arguments, they are less directly applicable to this particular statement. Hereâ€™s why:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
  - The statement does not provide any evidence or reasoning to support the claims made about the values in New York City.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
  - There is no causal relationship claimed or implied in the statement.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
  - The statement does not involve a repetition of propositions or arguments.

- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
  - The language used in the statement is relatively clear and specific, without obvious ambiguity.

Therefore, the primary defective argument types observable in the statement are Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), and Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>).
