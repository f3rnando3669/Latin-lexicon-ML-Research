For 
The defective argument type <IDAA> refers to Ignoring Disputable Assumption by Asserting Assertion. Applying this to the statement "Companies that make huge profits must be exploiting their customers because the only way a company could make large profits is by taking advantage of their customers," we can analyze why this argument is defective:

The statement assumes that the only method for a company to achieve large profits is by exploiting customers, which is a disputable assumption. This assertion is presented without addressing other possible reasons for a company's success, such as innovation, efficiency, excellent service, or competitive pricing strategies.

Here is a breakdown:

- **Ignoring Disputable Assumption**: The argument hinges on the assumption that exploitation of customers is the sole way to achieve large profits, which is contestable.
- **Assertion**: It asserts this assumption as if it were an undeniable fact without providing evidence or considering alternative explanations.

Therefore, this argument is defective since it relies on a disputable assumption and asserts it without proper justification.
