To apply the defective argument analysis to the statement "My roommate said her Debate class was hard, and the one that I'm in right now is hard, too. All Debate classes must be hard!" let's break it down and see which categories apply.

1. **Generalization (<G>):** The statement makes a broad conclusion based on a limited set of examples (two debate classes). The person is generalizing the difficulty of all debate classes based on this limited experience.
   
   **Applied:** Yes. This is a clear case of a Generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The statement overlooks other possible examples that might exist but are not considered. The person has not accounted for classes that might not be hard.
   
   **Applied:** Yes. This is an Incomplete Enumeration by not considering other Debate classes that could be easy.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reasoning may not necessarily lead to the conclusion. The difficulty of two classes does not conclusively prove that all Debate classes are hard.
   
   **Applied:** Yes. The reasoning does not conclusively support the conclusion.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The conclusion is drawn without sufficient evidence to establish a causal connection.
   
   **Applied:** Not applicable. The argument is more about drawing a general conclusion rather than establishing a causal connection.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** There is no repetition of the proposition in the argument.
   
   **Applied:** Not applicable.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This doesnâ€™t involve assuming a consensus; rather, it reflects a personal experience.
   
   **Applied:** Not applicable.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** The language used is not ambiguous; it's about the perceived difficulty of the classes.
   
   **Applied:** Not applicable.

Therefore, we identify the following types of defective arguments in the statement:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**

The complete identification would be: <G>, <FE>, <IR>.
