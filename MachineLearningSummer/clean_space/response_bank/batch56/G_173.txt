For 
Applying <IDAA> involves analyzing the argument using specified defective argument types. Let's break down the medieval proverb provided:

- "For want of a nail the shoe was lost."
- "For want of a shoe the horse was lost."
- "For want of a horse the rider was lost."
- "For want of a rider the battle was lost."
- "For want of a battle the kingdom was lost."
- "And all for the want of a nail."

This proverb is essentially creating a chain of causal relationships to argue that a small event (the loss of a nail) can lead to a great consequence (the loss of a kingdom).

### Possible Defective Argument Types:

1. **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**:
   - This argument type could apply here because the proverb presumes a direct causal link between each event (a lost nail leads to a lost shoe, which leads to a lost horse, etc.) without sufficient evidence to support each transition. Each step in the chain is not necessarily supported by clear and robust causal reasoning.

2. **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**:
   - Another defective argument could be that the reasons provided for each loss do not conclusively establish the chain reaction. For example, the loss of a shoe does not necessarily result in the loss of a horse.

3. **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**:
   - The structure of the proverb could be seen as a repetition of causality without fresh or solid evidence, relying on repetition to build a presumption of truth (this isn't a perfect fit but has a partial element of fault here).

### Conclusion:
In applying the defective argument analysis, we primarily see:

- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The proverb makes a series of causal claims that lack sufficient evidence for the causality it posits. It assumes each loss directly leads to the next loss without sufficient backing.

- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: The reasons provided for each event leading to the next are not comprehensive and explanatory enough to be conclusive. The connections between the events are assumed rather than rigorously demonstrated.

The proverb, while illustrative, relies on a series of unverified causal links which fall under the defective arguments of insufficient causal basis and inconclusive reasons.
