For 
The argument provided is: "A baseball pitcher bought new socks before he pitched a winning game. The new socks caused a pitcher to throw faster! He will wear the new socks for EVERY game now."

To apply the definitions of defective argument types to this argument, let's analyze it:

- The statement is suggesting a causal relationship between buying new socks and the pitcherâ€™s performance improvement.
- It concludes that the new socks caused the pitcher to throw faster and plans to wear them every game based on this performance.

Considering the definitions:
- This appears to be an example of <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis), since it assumes a direct cause-effect relationship between the new socks and the pitcher's improved performance without providing sufficient evidence to substantiate such a causal connection. 

Therefore, the argument: "A baseball pitcher bought new socks before he pitched a winning game. The new socks caused a pitcher to throw faster! He will wear the new socks for EVERY game now." is an example of <WCB>, Insufficient Causal Basis.
