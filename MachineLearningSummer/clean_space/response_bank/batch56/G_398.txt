For 
The fallacy being committed in the argument "If you don’t eat breakfast, you’ll slouch in your desk. If you slouch in your desk, you’ll hurt your back. If you hurt your back, you’ll never become President." can be identified using the definitions provided. This argument type falls under the umbrella of <IDAA>:

<IDAA> - If you don’t eat breakfast, you’ll slouch in your desk. If you slouch in your desk, you’ll hurt your back. If you hurt your back, you’ll never become President.

This argument commits the fallacy of:

### Chain of Conditional Fallacy (also known as Slippery Slope Fallacy)
A chain of conditional fallacy or slippery slope fallacy assumes that a relatively small first step will inevitably lead to a chain of related (negative) events. It is based on the premise that if one event occurs, then other events will follow without proper justification for such speculation.

In this argument:
1. It is suggested that not eating breakfast will inevitably lead to slouching in the desk.
2. It further implies that slouching will unavoidably cause back injuries.
3. Finally, it makes an unjustified leap to assert that back injuries will prevent someone from ever becoming President.

Each step from not eating breakfast leading to failing to become President is tenuous at best and lacks sufficient causal basis, thereby fitting perfectly under the fallacy of a slippery slope.
