For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application, which entails analyzing the given statement to determine whether any of the predefined defective argument types apply to it. Let's apply <IDAA> to the statement "Invoke shared values and principles. They call upon the audience’s sense of right and wrong."

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument doesn't seem to involve making overly broad generalizations based on limited evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement does not seem to provide an incomplete list or suggest that an incomplete list is the full list.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: It appears somewhat related to this type as it assumes invoking shared values and principles automatically means the argument is sound, but it does not give a complete reason or proof. However, it is more about the technique rather than an argument presenting inconclusive reasoning.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The statement does not imply causation in a way that can be critiqued for insufficient basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Although the idea is repeated ("Invoke shared values" and "call upon the audience’s sense of right and wrong" essentially mean the same thing), it doesn't exactly argue a proposition through faulty repetition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This might be applicable if the argument assumes that the audience inherently shares the same values and principles without establishing consensus, leading to the presumption that these values are universally accepted.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: Words like "shared values and principles" and "sense of right and wrong" can be seen as somewhat ambiguous, as different audiences might interpret these phrases differently based on their specific cultural, social, and personal contexts.

### Summary:
The statement "Invoke shared values and principles. They call upon the audience’s sense of right and wrong." seems to align most closely with **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**, as it assumes consensus on shared values and principles without specific validation. Additionally, **<DEP> Ambiguous Language** could also apply due to the vague and potentially subjective nature of terms used.
