To analyze the argument "Boris is not qualified to make suggestions about our penal system. As an ex-convict, he would always take the criminals’ side." using the defective argument types defined (Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Presumptuous Consensus, and Ambiguous Language), let's break it down:

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The statement suggests that Boris’s status as an ex-convict automatically disqualifies him from making valuable suggestions about the penal system. This presumes a causal connection between being an ex-convict and always siding with criminals without sufficient basis. The argument fails to consider that having experience might provide valuable insights into the penal system that others might lack.

2. **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement generalized that all ex-convicts will take the criminals' side. This is a form of hasty generalization because it assumes Boris’s recommendations are biased or invalid solely based on his past, without considering his specific opinions, skills, or experiences.

This argument could also potentially involve other defective argument types, but these two are the most fitting in this case:

- **<WCB>** (Insufficient Causal Basis): As it incorrectly assumes that Boris's background as an ex-convict would necessarily lead him to always side with criminals.
- **<G>** (Generalization): Because it makes a sweeping statement about all ex-convicts based on Boris's situation.

A more concise application of <IDAA> would highlight these defective arguments:

**Defective Argument Type(s)**: 
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
- **Generalization (<G>)**

By identifying these defects, the primary issues in the argument against Boris’s qualifications are clarified.
