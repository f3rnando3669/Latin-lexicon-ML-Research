For 
<IDAA stands for Identifying Defective Argument Analysis. Let's apply it to the given argument step by step to identify any defective argument types present. 

Argument: "I think that the use of marijuana as a medical treatment shouldn't even be considered. If we make drugs legal in a few cases, then we might eventually have to completely legalize them - which is even crazier than Proposition 215. If we want to help people out by letting them do illegal things, then let's just get rid of all our laws."

1. **"I think that the use of marijuana as a medical treatment shouldn't even be considered."**
   - This is a statement of opinion but does not necessarily fall into one of the defective argument types as presented.

2. **"If we make drugs legal in a few cases, then we might eventually have to completely legalize them - which is even crazier than Proposition 215."**
   - <IR> Inconclusive Reason: The argument here is working on a slippery slope assumption without sufficient evidence. It assumes that legalizing marijuana for medical use would inevitably lead to the legalization of all drugs, which is not necessarily a logical or evidence-based conclusion.

3. **"If we want to help people out by letting them do illegal things, then let's just get rid of all our laws."**
   - <G> Generalization: The argument makes an overly broad generalization that helping people by legalizing marijuana for medical purposes is equivalent to allowing all illegal activities and getting rid of all laws, which is an unreasonable and exaggerated comparison.
   - <FE> Incomplete Enumeration: This part of the argument doesn't consider all possible ways we can help people within the framework of the law. Instead, it jumps to the extreme conclusion without considering intermediate steps or solutions.

Summary of Defective Argument Types Identified:
- <IR> Inconclusive Reason: Slippery slope leading to an unlikely extreme.
- <G> Generalization: Equating legalized medical marijuana with the removal of all laws.
- <FE> Incomplete Enumeration: Ignoring potential legal frameworks for addressing medical marijuana.
