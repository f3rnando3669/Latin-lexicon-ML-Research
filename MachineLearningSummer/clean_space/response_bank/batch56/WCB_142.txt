For 
<IDAA> stands for identifying the defective argument type for the statement given. Let's analyze the statement "Believing that the cause of the Reformation was simply Martin Luther posting his theses".

This statement appears to imply a simplistic cause for a complex historical event, overlooking numerous other factors and influences that contributed to the Reformation. 

Applying <IDAA> to the statement:

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This seems to fit because the statement attributes the entire Reformation to a single act by Martin Luther, ignoring the broader social, political, and theological contexts that contributed to the movement.

Thus, the defective argument type for the statement "Believing that the cause of the Reformation was simply Martin Luther posting his theses" is <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
