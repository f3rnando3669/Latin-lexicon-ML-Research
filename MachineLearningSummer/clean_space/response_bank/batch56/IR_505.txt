Let's clarify the task and the defective argument types first. Here are the definitions:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Making a broad conclusion based on limited or unrepresentative evidence.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Claiming something based on an incomplete list of possibilities or instances.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Providing reasoning or evidence that does not conclusively support the conclusion.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Assuming a causal relationship when there is insufficient evidence to support such a conclusion.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Repeating a claim or proposition without adding new evidence or reasoning.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Assuming that agreement among a group necessarily implies the truth of a proposition.
7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: Using language that is unclear or can be interpreted in multiple ways, leading to confusion.

Now, let's apply these to the provided argument: "A politician arguing that his opponent cannot possibly be a good choice for women because he has been married and divorced five times."

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This argument may fall under <FE> because it assumes that marital history alone defines suitability for women voters, without considering other crucial factors like policies or behavior.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The argument could also be an <IR> because the conclusion that the opponent is a bad choice for women does not necessarily follow from the fact of having been divorced five times. Other factors more directly related to womenâ€™s issues should be considered.
- **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument could be seen as a <G> as it generalizes that someone who has been divorced multiple times is inherently a poor choice for women voters, which may not necessarily be true or representative.
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: There might be an element of <DEP> if terms like "good choice for women" are not clearly defined, leaving the argument open to interpretation.

Given these explanations, the argument is best categorized under **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** and **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** because it fails to consider a comprehensive set of factors and provides reasoning that does not conclusively support the conclusion. There's also a hint of Generalization (<G>) and possibly Ambiguous Language (<DEP>) if we scrutinize the definitions of key phrases used.
