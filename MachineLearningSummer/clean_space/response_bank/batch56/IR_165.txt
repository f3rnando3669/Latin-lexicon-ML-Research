For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application, and it involves analyzing the argument to identify specific types of defective argumentation present.

In the given exchange:

**Dustin:** "Why do you always deflect the argument by insulting me?"
**Ann:** "You're ugly and poor!"

Here's the analysis:

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - There's no evidence of generalization. The argument doesn't extend a specific case to a broader conclusion without proper support.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - This isn't relevant because the argument doesn't involve failing to list all possibilities or options.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - Ann’s response does not provide a reason that attempts to address Dustin's concern or the argument's main point.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - Ann's statement doesn't involve a causal claim, so this type of defective argument doesn't apply here.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - There’s no repetition of a proposition that could be deemed faulty.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - There's no assumption of general agreement without evidence. Ann’s statement is purely derogatory.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - Ann’s insult isn't ambiguous; it's clear and direct in its derogatory nature.

However, Ann’s response does indeed exhibit a defective argumentative tactic often classified as an **ad hominem attack**, which is not one of the specific defective arguments listed but is well-known in informal logic for shifting focus from the argument to the person.

IDAA analysis for this exchange:
- **Defective Argument Type: Ad Hominem Attack**

This type of attack falls outside the list given but is crucial for identifying poor argumentative strategies.

Thus, Ann's response to Dustin constitutes an **Ad Hominem** and diverges from reasonable argumentation by focusing on personal insults rather than addressing the substance of the argument.
