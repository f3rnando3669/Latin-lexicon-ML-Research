For 
The statement "The students in my sixth-grade class listen to a lot of reggaeton music. I usually hear reggaeton when they have their headphones or earphones on while working on NoRedInk. All sixth graders must listen to reggaeton." demonstrates faulty reasoning.

Let's break it down:

1. **Observation**: The students in my sixth-grade class listen to a lot of reggaeton music.
2. **Observation**: When the students have their headphones or earphones on while working on NoRedInk, reggaeton music is playing.
3. **Conclusion**: All sixth graders must listen to reggaeton.

This conclusion is drawn from a specific sample (the sixth-grade students in one particular classroom) and generalized to all sixth graders. The reasoning falls into the category of **<G> (Generalization)**.

**Generalization** is when a conclusion is drawn about a whole group based on a sample that may not be representative or sufficiently large. In this case, the sample is just one sixth-grade class, which is not enough to conclude that all sixth graders listen to reggaeton.

Therefore, the type of faulty reasoning used here is **<G> (Generalization)**.
