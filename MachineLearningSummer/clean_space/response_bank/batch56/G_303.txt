For 
<IDAA> stands for the "Identification and Analysis of Defective Argumentation." Let's apply this to the statement "IBM is a reputable organization, so all of its employees must be reputable."

1. **Statement Examination**: 
   - **Premise**: "IBM is a reputable organization."
   - **Conclusion**: "All of its employees must be reputable."

2. **Identify Potential Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument makes a broad generalization that because IBM is reputable, all of its employees must also be reputable. This is assuming that the qualities of the organization necessarily apply to all individuals within it, which is not logically sound.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This defect occurs when the argument fails to consider all possibilities. In this case, it does not account for the fact that in any large organization, there will be variability among employees in terms of reputation.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasoning that IBM's reputation as an organization directly implies the reputability of all its employees is inconclusive. An organization’s reputation is determined by many factors, including but not limited to the behavior of its employees. However, it does not automatically follow that every individual employee is reputable.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument implies a causal relationship between the organization's reputation and the reputation of every employee without sufficient evidence to support this causation.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Not applicable in this case as it doesn't involve repeating the same proposition in a faulty manner.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This defect is not directly relevant here, as the argument does not rely on an assumed consensus.
   - **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The language of the argument is quite clear and unambiguous in this context.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The primary defects here appear to be Generalization (<G>) and Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), with a significant component of Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), and to some extent Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).
   - By making a sweeping generalization, the argument fails to consider the diverse nature of the organization’s workforce (<G>, <FE>).
   - The reasoning is inconclusive as it does not firmly establish that the overall reputation of an organization directly equates to the reputability of each individual employee (<IR>).
   - The causal basis for claiming all employees are reputable because the organization is reputable is insufficient (<WCB>).

**Result of <IDAA>**: The argument "IBM is a reputable organization, so all of its employees must be reputable" primarily suffers from the defects of Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), and Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).
