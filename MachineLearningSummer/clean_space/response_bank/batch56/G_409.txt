For 
It seems there was a small typographical error in your request. You mentioned several defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP) but then referred to "<IDAA>" which wasn't defined earlier. 

Assuming "<IDAA>" was intended to refer to one or more of the defective argument types you defined, I'll consider the phrase "That new home looks great! Let's buy it!" and identify any potential defective argument types that apply.

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This argument jumps from the home's appearance to the decision to buy it without considering other important factors. This could be seen as an incomplete enumeration because it fails to include essential elements like location, price, structural integrity, etc.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason provided ("looks great") is subjective and insufficient to support the conclusion ("Let's buy it!") as many other significant aspects of buying a home are ignored.

3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal link between the home looking great and it being a suitable purchase is weak or insufficient. A great appearance does not necessarily mean the home fulfills all other requirements for purchase.

4. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The term "looks great" is ambiguous and can be interpreted in many ways. What looks great to one person may not look great to another, making the argument based on a subjective and unclear basis.

In summary, the argument "That new home looks great! Let's buy it!" appears to suffer from the following defective argument types:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** by omitting other factors.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** by providing an inadequate basis for the conclusion.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** by an insufficient link between appearance and purchase suitability.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** by relying on a subjective and unclear term ("looks great").
