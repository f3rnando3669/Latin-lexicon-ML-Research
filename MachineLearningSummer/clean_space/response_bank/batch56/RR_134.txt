For 
To apply <IDAA>, which stands for Identification and Diagnosis of the Argumentative Error, to the statement "Plagiarism is deceitful because it is dishonest," we need to identify and diagnose the specific type of defective argument being used in this case. Let's break down the statement and assess which defective argument type it fits into based on your definitions.

1. **Generalization (G)**: This involves making a broad conclusion based on limited or select evidence.
   - This does not fit because the statement does not involve drawing a general conclusion from specific instances.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This involves presenting a list as though it is complete when it is not.
   - This does not fit because the statement doesn't list examples or instances.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This indicates support for a conclusion that is not sufficiently warranted by the premises.
   - This might be applicable since the justification for "deceitful" by using a similar term "dishonest" is essentially restating the same idea without offering an independent reason.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This involves making a causal claim without sufficient evidence to support it.
   - This does not fit since the argument does not involve any causal claims.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Repeating the same proposition in different words without actually providing additional support.
   - This closely fits because the argument is essentially repeating the same idea ("deceitful" and "dishonest" are synonyms) rather than providing substantive evidence or reasoning.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This involves assuming agreement or consensus without sufficient basis.
   - This does not fit because the argument is not claiming consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This involves using vague or unclear terms that cause confusion.
   - This does not fit because the terms "deceitful" and "dishonest" are not ambiguous in this context.

Upon closer inspection, the statement "Plagiarism is deceitful because it is dishonest" is primarily an example of the defective argument type <RR>:

**Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The argument is using the synonym "dishonest" as a restatement of "deceitful" without providing any additional proof or reasoning. Essentially, it is attempting to define or justify one term with a term that means the same thing, which does not add to the argument's strength.

Thus, the appropriate diagnosis (<IDAA>) is:
"The argument commits the error of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)** by attempting to support the claim that plagiarism is deceitful using a synonymous term 'dishonest' without offering further substantive reasoning or evidence."
