For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identification and Diagnosis of Argumentative Appeals) to the given statement, we would identify specific defective arguments within the statement. Here's the breakdown:

Statement: "Just give me a chance to prove it to you. I can’t live this life if you will leave me. My world will stop to turn around. I will not be able to eat nor drink."

1. **Appeal to Emotion**:
   - The speaker attempts to invoke pity and sympathy to persuade the other person. This is not necessarily a defective argument type on its own, but it sets the context for several of the defective arguments identified below.

2. **Generalization** (<G>):
   - "I can’t live this life if you will leave me. My world will stop to turn around."
   - This statement generalizes the impact of the person's departure to an extreme, encompassing all aspects of the speaker's life.

3. **Incomplete Enumeration** (<FE>):
   - "I will not be able to eat nor drink."
   - This suggests that without the other person, survival activities will be impossible, which is an incomplete enumeration of potential outcomes. 

4. **Inconclusive Reason** (<IR>):
   - "Just give me a chance to prove it to you."
   - This is an inconclusive reason that lacks detail or evidence about what is to be proven and how it would be proven. 

5. **Ambiguous Language** (<DEP>):
   - "My world will stop to turn around."
   - This phrase is ambiguous and unclear, making it difficult to understand the exact implication or extent of the impact.

Given these observations, the defects within the argument can be coded as follows:

- Generalization (<G>)
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)

In summary, the statement employs a variety of emotional and vague appeals to make its case, fitting multiple defective argument categories.
