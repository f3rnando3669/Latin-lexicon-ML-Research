For 
The argument "Because everybody thinks this way, it must be right" can be analyzed as follows:

1. **Generalization (G)**: The argument relies on the broad generalization that the many (everybody) are correct, which may not necessarily be the case.

2. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument assumes that the consensus (everybody thinking this way) is sufficient evidence for the correctness of the belief, which is presumptuous.

Of these defective argument types, <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus) seems the most applicable. The argument primarily rests on the assumption that a widespread belief inherently validates the truth of the belief.

Therefore, applying <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Analysis), the argument "Because everybody thinks this way, it must be right" exhibits the defect of <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).
