For 
The argument "You can’t prove your candidate will win, so I assume he won’t" fits the defective argument type known as Inconclusive Reason (<IR>). This type of argument is characterized by drawing a conclusion based on insufficient evidence or from an assumption that the lack of proof of one claim proves the opposite claim. In this case, the lack of proof that the candidate will win is used to assume that he won't win, which is a non-sequitur and logically fallacious.
