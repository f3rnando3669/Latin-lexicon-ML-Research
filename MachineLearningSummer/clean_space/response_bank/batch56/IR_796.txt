For 
The argument type known as **<IDAA>** (I Don't Address Argument, but Attack) appears to be an example of an ad hominem fallacy, where one party ignores the actual arguments presented and instead attacks the character, motives, or other attributes of the person making the claim. 

In the given exchange, Dave dismisses Bill's arguments solely on the basis that Bill is a priest, without addressing the merits of the arguments themselves.

So applying **<IDAA>** to the exchange:

**Bill:** “I believe that abortion is morally wrong.”
**Dave:** “Of course you would say that, you’re a priest.”
**Bill:** “What about the arguments I gave to support my position?”
**Dave:** “Those don’t count. Like I said, you’re a priest, so you have to say that abortion is wrong. Further, you are just a lackey to the Pope, so I can’t believe what you say.”
 
In this conversation, Dave employs **<IDAA>** by attacking Bill's role and possible biases without addressing or refuting the arguments Bill presented.
