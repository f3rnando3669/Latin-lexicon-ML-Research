To address the prompt, we first need to understand the meaning of each defective argument type defined:

1. **Generalization (G)**: Drawing a broad conclusion from a small or unrepresentative sample.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Making a conclusion based on an incomplete list of possibilities or causes.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Using premises that do not sufficiently support the conclusion.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Asserting a causal relationship without enough evidence to support it.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Repeating a claim as if it were evidence or proof.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assuming consensus or common agreement when there is none.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Using language that is unclear or has multiple interpretations.

Let's examine the statement: "Michael is part of the Jackson Five. Without Tito and company, he will never make it."

1. **Generalization (G)**: The statement could be seen as a generalization if it draws an overly broad conclusion about Michael's potential based solely on his association with the Jackson Five.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument may be ignoring other factors or support that Michael might receive for his solo career.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason given ("Michael is part of the Jackson Five") does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that he will "never make it" without them.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is an implied causal relationship (Michael's success is only because of the Jackson Five) without sufficient evidence.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The statement does not really repeat a proposition in a faulty manner in this context.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: It assumes that everyone agrees that Michael can’t make it without the group, without providing evidence for this consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The phrase "make it" could be ambiguous, as it is unclear what "making it" specifically means—commercial success, critical acclaim, personal satisfaction, etc.

Now, applying these definitions to identify defective argument types in the statement:

- **<WCB>**: The argument "Without Tito and company, he will never make it" suggests a causal relationship without enough evidence to back it up.
- **<IR>**: The premise does not conclusively lead to the conclusion; being part of the Jackson Five doesn’t logically exclude solo success.
- **<FE>**: The argument doesn’t consider other supportive factors or possibilities that could contribute to Michael's success.

Therefore, the appropriate defective argument types for the statement "Michael is part of the Jackson Five. Without Tito and company, he will never make it." would be:

1. **<WCB>** - Insufficient Causal Basis
2. **<IR>**  - Inconclusive Reason
3. **<FE>**  - Incomplete Enumeration
