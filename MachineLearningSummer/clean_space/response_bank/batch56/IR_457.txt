For 
Let's analyze the argument "There is definitely a link between dementia and drinking energy drinks. I read about it on Wikipedia." using the taxonomy of defective argument types provided:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This would apply if the argument is making a broad conclusion based on insufficient evidence or a small sample size. While the statement is conclusory, it doesn't explicitly state its scope or representativeness, so it doesn't fit this type directly.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This would apply if the argument lists some evidence but omits other relevant evidence that weakens the conclusion. The argument doesn't list multiple pieces of evidence, just a single source, so it doesn't fall here directly either.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This applies if the reason given doesn't adequately support the conclusion. Stating that something is true because it was read on Wikipedia is an example of inconclusive reasoning, as Wikipedia is a tertiary source that can be edited by anyone and may not always be reliable or comprehensive. Therefore, this argument type fits well.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This would apply if the argument claims a cause-and-effect relationship without sufficient evidence. The statement suggests a causal relationship between drinking energy drinks and dementia without any substantive evidence, so this fits here too.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This would apply if repeating a proposition is taken as evidence for its truth. The statement doesn't repeat the proposition, so it doesn't fit here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This involves assuming a consensus exists without specifying who or what the consensus represents. Since no consensus is cited, just a Wikipedia article, this doesn't apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This would apply if the language in the argument is unclear or can have multiple meanings. The language here isn't particularly ambiguous.

In conclusion, the defective argument types that apply to the statement "There is definitely a link between dementia and drinking energy drinks. I read about it on Wikipedia." are **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. 

**IR** because the reliance on a single Wikipedia source is not a strong basis for such a definitive conclusion, and **WCB** because the claim of a causal link is made without providing sufficient evidence.
