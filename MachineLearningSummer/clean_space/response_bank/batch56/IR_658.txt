For 
<IR> Inconclusive Reason: Walter's response doesn't address whether cheating on income tax is wrong. Instead, he deflects by pointing out Wilma's past behavior. This does not provide a reason why cheating on income tax might be right or wrong; it merely redirects the accusation back to Wilma without engaging with her argument.
