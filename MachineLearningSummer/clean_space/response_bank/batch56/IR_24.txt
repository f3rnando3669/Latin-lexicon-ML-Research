Sure, let's break down and apply the identified defective argument types to the statement:

Statement: "I hold a doctorate in theology, have written 12 books, and personally met the Pope. Therefore, when I say that Jesus’ favorite snack was raisins dipped in wine, you should believe me."

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - This argument type seems to generalize the authority of the speaker in religious matters to an unverifiable and specific historical claim.
   - Application: The speaker’s expertise in theology is generalized to assert a specific fact about Jesus without offering direct evidence for that specific claim.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - This type does not seem to apply directly, as there’s no indication of other possible alternatives presented or omitted.
   - Application: Not applicable here.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - This argument type is present because the reasons provided (doctorate, books, meeting the Pope) do not directly prove the specific claim about Jesus' favorite snack.
   - Application: The speaker’s credentials are inconclusive reasons for the truth of the specific historical claim.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - The causal relationship between the speaker’s credentials and the historical fact being asserted is insufficient.
   - Application: The speaker's credentials do not establish a causal basis for the claim about Jesus' favorite snack.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - This type entails reiterating a claim without additional support, which isn't exactly depicted in this statement.
   - Application: Not directly applicable here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - This is where it is presumed that because certain authorities or a consensus (theology degree, book authorship, meeting the Pope) back the speaker, their further unsupported claims should be accepted.
   - Application: It’s presumptuous to assume consensus-based acceptance of the specific historical claim about Jesus' favorite snack based on the speaker’s credentials.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - The language in the statement is relatively clear and explicit.
   - Application: Not directly applicable here.

In conclusion, the argument "I hold a doctorate in theology, have written 12 books, and personally met the Pope. Therefore, when I say that Jesus’ favorite snack was raisins dipped in wine, you should believe me." displays the following defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**
2. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
4. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
