For 
It looks like <IDAA> might refer to the identification and application of defective argument types to the given passage. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the passage applying the defined defective arguments:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - "The researchers are people who are not methodologically sophisticated" 
     - This claim generalizes all the researchers involved without providing specific evidence or details about their methodology.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - "There have been rumors--I have no idea whether they're true or not--that they faked some of the data."
     - This is an incomplete examination as it relies on unverified rumors rather than concrete evidence, failing to enumerate specific instances or facts.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - "The advocates (or opponents) of this intervention are the worst kind of sloppy thinkers."
     - This statement does not provide a concrete reason or evidence to support the accusation, making it inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - "They are fanatical adherents who already have their minds made up."
     - A causal relationship is implied (fanaticism leads to poor reasoning) with insufficient basis to establish that the cause (fanaticism) leads to the effect (poor reasoning).

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - "They make arguments only a stupid person would accept, and mistakes in reasoning that would make an undergrad psych major blush."
     - This repeatedly dismisses the opposition's arguments by labeling them as something "a stupid person would accept" or mistakes obvious to an "undergrad psych major." It is a repetitive dismissal without addressing the actual arguments.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - "They have their minds made up; they've become true believers in their cause."
     - The passage presumes consensus among a group ("true believers") without evidence that all members have the same rigid mindset.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - "The research and reasoning that supposedly supports (or that supposedly discredits) this intervention are a joke."
     - The term "a joke" is ambiguous and lacks clarity in context, making it open to interpretation without defining what specifically is deficient about the research or reasoning.

The passage exemplifies several defective argument types, undermining the credibility of its claims through generalization, incomplete examination, inconclusive reasoning, insufficient causal basis, faulty repetition, presumptuous consensus, and ambiguous language.
