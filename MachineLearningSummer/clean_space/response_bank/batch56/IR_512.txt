Certainly! Let's identify the defective argument types applied in the given statement:

Statement: "You can't believe that theory. No one would believe that. It's too unbelievable."

1. **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**:
   The argument assumes that no one would believe the theory without providing evidence to support that claim. This assumes a consensus that may not exist.

2. **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**:
   The statement claims that the theory is "too unbelievable" without providing any concrete reasons. The term "unbelievable" is subjective and doesn't offer a solid basis for rejecting the theory.

Overall, the statement lacks robust reasoning and relies on presumptive consensus and inconclusive reasons to dismiss the theory.
