For 
<IDAA>, which stands for Identify Defective Argument Assignment, can be applied to the statement "Don't listen to Eddie's arguments on education. He didn't even finish high school." 

This is an example of a *defective argument type* generally known as an ad hominem attack. An ad hominem attack diverts attention from the argument's merits by attacking the character or personal traits of the person making the argument. 

However, in the context of the defective argument types provided, none of them directly correspond to ad hominem attacks. A more appropriate classification among the provided types could be exposed through their definitions:

- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**

Since none of these explicitly includes "attack on the person" or "ad hominem," it might be best categorized as follows:

**Incorrect Reasoning (IR)**: The reasoning is flawed because it assumes Eddie's educational background completely invalidates any arguments he might have on education without addressing the content of his arguments themselves. This fits the spirit of "Inconclusive Reason" since the conclusion drawn (not to listen to Eddie) is based on insufficient reasoning (his lack of a high school diploma). 

Thus, the correct classification could be <IR>.
