For 
The notation "<IDAA>" was not defined in your initial list of defective argument types, so I'll focus instead on analyzing the argument given using the types defined:

**Statement:** "Besides charities, comfort, community cohesion, rehabilitation, and helping children learn values, religion poisons everything."

Here’s a breakdown of how some of the defective argument types may apply:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   This statement might be considered an example of a generalization, assuming that religion universally "poisons everything." The term "everything" is highly expansive and suggests a lack of nuance, failing to account for instances where religion may not have harmful consequences or where its positive impacts may outweigh its negative ones.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   The statement lists several positive aspects of religion but follows with a sweeping negative conclusion. By saying, "religion poisons everything," it seems to ignore any other potential positive contributions religion might offer beyond those listed. This might be seen as an incomplete enumeration because it doesn't attempt to list or consider all possible positive and negative aspects comprehensively.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   The phrase "religion poisons everything" is a broad claim that isn't substantively supported or expanded upon in the statement. Without further reasoning or evidence explaining why religion supposedly "poisons everything," this can be considered inconclusive.

4. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   The word "poisons" is ambiguous and emotionally charged. It could mean a range of things—from ethical corruption to societal harm—but isn't clearly defined in the context of this statement. This ambiguity can lead to different interpretations, making the argument less effective.

Each of these defective argument types could apply to the statement in different and overlapping ways, highlighting various issues in the argument's structure and clarity.
