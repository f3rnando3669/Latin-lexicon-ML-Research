To determine the type of defective argument in the statement: "The makers of Sugarette Candy Drinks point to research showing that of the five countries where Sugarette drinks sell the most units, three of them are in the top ten healthiest countries on Earth, therefore Sugarette drinks are healthy," we need to analyze the reasoning used in the statement.

1. The argument is asserting that because some of the countries where Sugarette drinks are sold the most are also among the healthiest countries, Sugarette drinks themselves must be healthy.

2. This is a problematic argument because it assumes a causal relationship between the sale of Sugarette drinks and the healthiness of the countries without providing sufficient evidence to support this causal link.

3. The healthiness of a country is influenced by many factors, and the argument presents an incomplete picture without considering these factors.

Given these points, the defective argument type applied to this statement is:
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This argument is defective because it fails to establish a causal relationship between the consumption of Sugarette drinks and the healthiness of the countries. The data presented does not justify the conclusion that Sugarette drinks are healthy, as it does not account for other factors that contribute to the overall healthiness of a country.
