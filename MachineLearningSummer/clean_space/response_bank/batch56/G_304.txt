For 
Let's apply the defective argument types, referred to collectively as <IDAA>, to the provided statement: "You smoke pot? If you keep doing that, you’ll be a heroin addict within two years."

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement assumes a progression from smoking pot to becoming a heroin addict without considering individual differences or other factors. It generalizes the experience of one or a few individuals to all people who smoke pot.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement implies that the only possible outcome of smoking pot is becoming a heroin addict. This overlooks other possible outcomes and does not account for people who smoke pot and do not progress to harder drugs.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The argument lacks sufficient evidence to support the claim that smoking pot will necessarily lead to heroin addiction. The reasoning is inconclusive and does not establish a direct causal link.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The statement claims a causal relationship between smoking pot and becoming a heroin addict without providing adequate evidence or a substantial causal mechanism linking the two.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This isn't directly applicable as the statement does not repeat the proposition in a faulty manner. It makes a singular, albeit flawed, causal claim.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument might imply a supposed consensus that smoking pot leads to heroin addiction, but it presumes this consensus without providing evidence that such a consensus genuinely exists.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The language in the statement is not particularly ambiguous; it makes a direct but unfounded prediction. However, terms like "pot" and "heroin addict" could potentially have different interpretations in different contexts, leading to some ambiguity about what exactly is meant.

In summary, the statement "You smoke pot? If you keep doing that, you’ll be a heroin addict within two years." primarily exemplifies **Generalization (<G>)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**, **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
