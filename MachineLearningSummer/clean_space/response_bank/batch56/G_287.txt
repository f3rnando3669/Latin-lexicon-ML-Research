For 
To apply the identification of defective argument types (IDAA) to the statement "Victor, the company you work for just filed for bankruptcy! How can I trust you with our money?", let's analyze the argument for any potential defects:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument appears to make a sweeping generalization about Victor's reliability based on the bankruptcy of the company. It assumes that because his employer faced financial issues, Victor himself cannot be trusted with money, which is an overgeneralization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: There is no incomplete enumeration here as the argument does not list multiple examples or possibilities. It’s focusing solely on a single issue.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument gives an inconclusive reason for mistrusting Victor. The bankruptcy of the company where Victor works does not conclusively prove that he is personally responsible or that he is untrustworthy with money.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This argument suggests a causal link between the company’s bankruptcy and Victor’s trustworthiness without providing sufficient evidence to support this causal connection. The company’s financial state does not necessarily reflect Victor’s financial management skills.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: There is no repetition of the proposition within the argument.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument does not appeal to a consensus or suggest that everyone believes Victor is untrustworthy due to the company's bankruptcy.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language used in the argument is not ambiguous; it directly addresses a specific concern about trust based on a specific event.

Based on the analysis, the argument "Victor, the company you work for just filed for bankruptcy! How can I trust you with our money?" primarily suffers from:

- **Generalization (G)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

These defects highlight that the conclusion drawn about Victor's trustworthiness is unfounded based on the given information about his employer's financial status.
