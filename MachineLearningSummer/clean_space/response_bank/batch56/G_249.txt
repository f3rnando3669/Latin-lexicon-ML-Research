For 
<IDAA> stands for Identify Defective Argument Attribute. Given the argument:

"Exercise is good. Therefore everybody should exercise."
'I agree,' said Polly earnestly. 'I mean exercise is wonderful. I mean it builds the body and everything.'"

Let's identify the defective argument attributes:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The statement "Exercise is good. Therefore everybody should exercise." is a generalization because it assumes that what is good for some people (exercise) is good for everyone, without considering individual differences or potential exceptions (e.g., people with certain health conditions). This fits the definition of <G>.

2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The reasoning provided, "Exercise is wonderful. I mean it builds the body and everything," does not sufficiently establish a causal link between exercise being generally good and the blanket recommendation that everyone should exercise. It disregards other factors and contexts where exercise might not be beneficial, thus falling under <WCB>.

3. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - The phrases "exercise is wonderful" and "it builds the body and everything" are quite vague and unspecific. This ambiguous language does not clearly convey the reasons or evidence supporting the recommendation that everyone should exercise, making it fall under <DEP>.

So, we have identified three defective argument attributes for this example:
- Generalization (<G>)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)
