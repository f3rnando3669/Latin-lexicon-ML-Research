For 
The argument provided, "I had a bad teacher once; therefore, all teachers must be bad," can be classified using the <G> defective argument type: Generalization.

Here is the application of the <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Application):

- **Type:** <G> (Generalization)
- **Argument:** "I had a bad teacher once; therefore, all teachers must be bad."
- **Explanation:** This argument generalizes from a single instance of a bad teacher to an entire group, asserting that all teachers are bad based on insufficient evidence. This is a classic case of a hasty generalization, where the conclusion is drawn from a sample that is not representative of the entire population.
