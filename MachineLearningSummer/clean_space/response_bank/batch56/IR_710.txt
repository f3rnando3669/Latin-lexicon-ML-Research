For 
<IDAA>: Inconclusive Deflection Against An Argument.

Applying <IDAA> to the given passage:

"Some of you have objected to the new test batteries that were purchased for our program, alleging that they have no demonstrable validity, were not adequately normed for the kind of clients we see, and are unusable for clients who are physically disabled. What you have conveniently failed to mention, however, is that they cost less than a third of the price for the other tests we had been using, are much easier to learn, and can be administered and scored in less than half the time of the tests we used to use."

In this passage, the response to the objections does not directly address the concerns raised about the validity, norming, and usability of the new test batteries. Instead, it deflects the focus to their lower cost, ease of learning, and quicker administration time. This is an inconclusive response to the original concerns because it does not provide evidence or arguments that counter the specific claims made about the test batteries' effectiveness and appropriateness. Hence, it qualifies as <IDAA>: Inconclusive Deflection Against An Argument.
