For 
Sure, to apply the defective argument type framework to the given persuasive technique ("a persuasive technique used in media messages that appeals to the 'everyone is doing it' mentality"), we need to analyze it through the lens of the provided argument defect types. 

It seems this persuasive technique is often referred to as the "bandwagon effect" or "bandwagon appeal." Now let’s categorize it based on the given types:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - This is not primarily about generalizing an attribute or behavior to a broader group based on limited evidence, so it doesn’t quite fit Generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - This might partially apply, as the argument might suggest that a particular consensus exists without adequately surveying the full range of opinions. But it’s not the best fit.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The technique does not necessarily provide a weak reason that's inconclusive on its own. Instead, it's more about the assumption of widespread acceptance as a reason.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - There is no causality being incorrectly inferred in this context. Therefore, insufficient causal basis doesn’t apply here.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - The argument is not flawed due to repetitive assertion without proof. Therefore, this defect does not apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - This is where it fits perfectly. The bandwagon technique relies on the assumption that something is true or correct because it is believed or done by many people. This presumption of consensus aligns well with <FU>.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - This doesn’t fit as the defect isn’t about ambiguous language in this case. 

Thus, the persuasive technique "a persuasive technique used in media messages that appeals to the 'everyone is doing it' mentality" would be best categorized under **<FU> - Presumptuous Consensus**.
