For 
To apply the framework for Identifying Defective Argumentation Analysis (<IDAA>) to the given passage, let's examine each part of the argument and determine which, if any, of the predefined defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>) apply.

The argument presented is:
"If voluntary euthanasia were to be legalized it would prove impossible to avoid the legislation, or, at least, toleration, of non-voluntary euthanasia. Even if the former can be justified, the latter clearly cannot. Hence, it is better that the first step (legalizing voluntary euthanasia) not be taken so as to prevent a slide into non-voluntary euthanasia."

1. **Generalization (G)**: The argument suggests that legalizing voluntary euthanasia will inevitably lead to non-voluntary euthanasia. This assumption is a broad generalization and may not account for possible regulatory and legal safeguards that can be put in place to prevent such a progression.

   - **Identification**: <G>

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not consider alternative possibilities or outcomes that could result from legalizing voluntary euthanasia. It assumes a direct and unavoidable progression to non-voluntary euthanasia without considering other scenarios or potential interventions.

   - **Identification**: <FE>

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument claims that legalizing voluntary euthanasia will lead to non-voluntary euthanasia without providing convincing evidence or a strong causal link. The reasoning is not fully conclusive and may rely on fears or assumptions rather than solid evidence.

   - **Identification**: <IR>

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument posits a causal relationship between legalizing voluntary euthanasia and an increase in non-voluntary euthanasia. However, it does not provide sufficient causal evidence to support this claim. The causal reasoning is weak and speculative.

   - **Identification**: <WCB>

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This doesn’t seem to apply because the argument isn't repetitively restating an unproven proposition; rather, it is advancing a hypothetical scenario.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument does not assume an undue consensus. It doesn’t rely on the idea that everyone already agrees with the point being made, so this defective type does not apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The argument uses fairly clear and specific terms and doesn’t seem to hinge on any ambiguous language that might be misinterpreted, so DEP does not apply here.

**Summary of Identified Defective Argument Types**:
- **Generalization (G)**: Broad and possibly misleading generalization is made about the consequences of legalizing voluntary euthanasia.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument fails to consider other possible outcomes or regulatory measures.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The conclusion is drawn without strong supporting evidence.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument does not provide a solid causal link between voluntary and non-voluntary euthanasia.

Thus, the given argument can be characterized by the following defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, and <WCB>.
