For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Arguments Analysis.

In the given statement: "While I think most people shouldn't be allowed to falsely claim they need a support animal on airplanes, I really do need my dog to calm me down. It's not my fault my doctor won't give me authorization."

Let's analyze the statement for defective arguments:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The speaker claims that "most people shouldn't be allowed to falsely claim they need a support animal" without providing a thorough enumeration or considering all possible scenarios. The argument is based on an incomplete consideration of the issue, making a broad statement without sufficient evidence.

2. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The speaker mentions needing their dog to calm them down, considering it as a valid support animal without sufficient reasoning or new evidence beyond the assertion itself. It repeats the need without substantiation.

3. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The statement "While I think most people shouldn't be allowed to falsely claim they need a support animal on airplanes" presumes consensus and sets the speaker apart without considering or addressing the broader context of why policies or exceptions might be in place. 

So, the defective arguments identified in the statement are <FE> Incomplete Enumeration, <RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition, and <FU> Presumptuous Consensus.
