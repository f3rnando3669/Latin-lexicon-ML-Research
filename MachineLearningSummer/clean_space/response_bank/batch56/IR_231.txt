To apply the concept of identifying defective argument types (IDAA) to the statement "You should choose to work more overtime at the same rate of pay. After all, you wouldn’t want to lose your job, would you?", we need to analyze the argument and identify any fallacies or defective types present.

1. **Generalization (G)**: Although this argument does not seem to be a broad generalization based on limited or insufficient evidence, let's see if there is another fit.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not list out multiple reasons or cases incompletely.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument suggests that one should work more overtime to avoid losing the job, but it does not conclusively prove that working overtime will secure the job. Also, it does not consider other factors that might affect job security, such as job performance or company policies, making it an inconclusive reason.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument implies a cause-and-effect relationship, suggesting that choosing not to work more overtime could lead to job loss. However, it doesn't provide sufficient evidence to establish this causal link, making it reliant on an insufficient causal basis.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The argument does not repeat the same statement or proposition in a faulty manner.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument does not seem to appeal to a consensus or widely held belief without justification.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language used in the argument is not particularly ambiguous or unclear.

Based on this analysis, the most applicable defective argument types to the statement are:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument implies a potential but unconfirmed outcome (losing the job) without conclusive proof that the solution (working more overtime) will prevent it.
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument assumes a direct causal relationship between working overtime and not losing the job without sufficient evidence to support this claim.

Therefore, the statement "You should choose to work more overtime at the same rate of pay. After all, you wouldn’t want to lose your job, would you?" can be identified as having defective argument types IR (Inconclusive Reason) and WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis).
