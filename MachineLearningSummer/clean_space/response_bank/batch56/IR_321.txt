For 
<IDAA>: Appeal to emotion (specifically appeal to pity)

When applying <IDAA> to the statement "It occurs when someone makes an appeal to emotion of pity instead of addressing the argument," it indicates identifying a specific type of defective argument where an emotional appeal is made, in this case, an appeal to pity, rather than engaging with the actual merits of the argument. Using an appeal to emotion of pity can be seen as a tactic to divert attention from the substantive issues at hand, making it a fallacy that weakens the argument. 

In essence, an appeal to pity seeks to elicit sympathy from the audience to force them into agreeing with a position instead of focusing on logical evidence or reasoned discussion. The person making such an appeal might describe difficult circumstances or hardships to manipulate the audience's feelings and distract from the lack of substantive support for their argument.
