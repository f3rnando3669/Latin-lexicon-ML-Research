For 
<IDAA> appears to be shorthand for applying the 'Identification and Analysis of Argumentative Defects' to a given statement. Let's identify and analyze the defective arguments within the statement:

Statement: "If we don’t teach teens to work harder, the human race is doomed."

1. **Generalization (G)**: This statement seems to be making a sweeping generalization. It implies that all teens need to work harder, and if not, the entire human race will face doom. This is an overly broad conclusion based on insufficient evidence.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement doesn't consider other factors that might contribute to the survival or doom of the human race. It simplifies a complex issue to just one variable (teen work ethic).
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The cause-and-effect relationship implied here is not conclusively established. There is no definite evidence provided that links teens working harder directly to the survival of the human race.
   
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This argument doesn't provide a sufficient causal basis for the claim. What are the mechanisms by which teens working harder would prevent the doom of humanity? The causal relationship is not clear or explained.
   
5. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument might presume that there is a consensus that this is the only way to avoid doom for the human race, which is not evidently the case.
   
6. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The phrase "work harder" is ambiguous. It is unclear what specific actions or behaviors are required from teens to satisfy this criterion.

In conclusion, the statement "If we don’t teach teens to work harder, the human race is doomed" contains several defective argument types, notably <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.
