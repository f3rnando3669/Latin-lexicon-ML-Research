<IDAA> stands for Identify Defective Argument Attributes. Let's apply <IDAA> to the given argument.

Statement: "The majority of students are in favor of changing the colors of the graduation gowns to a single color to not exclude those that are non-binary, but a few people complained it wasn't 'tradition', so let's meet in the middle and just allow students to not attend graduation if they don't want to wear the traditional black and gold."

1. **<G> (Generalization)**: The argument states that "the majority of students are in favor" without providing any concrete statistics or data to back this general claim. It assumes that the opinion of the majority is well-known and accurately represented.

2. **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: The argument only considers two options: changing the gown colors to a single one or keeping the traditional black and gold colors. It fails to explore other possible solutions that might address the concerns of both groups, such as offering a range of acceptable colors.

3. **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: The argument mentions that a "few people" complained it wasn't "tradition" but does not delve into why tradition should take precedence or whether this concern outweighs the goal of inclusivity. The reasoning here is insufficiently explored and justified.

4. **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The proposal to let students who do not want to wear the traditional colors simply not attend graduation lacks a clear causal relationship with the initial problem of inclusivity. It does not address how this solution effectively solves the problem and may introduce new issues related to student participation and fairness.

5. **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: The argument does not appear to exhibit this defect directly, as there is no repeated proposition being emphasized as truth.

6. **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: The argument presumes that everyone either falls into the category of favoring the change or upholding tradition, without considering that there might be a diversity of opinions and potential for common ground beyond the "meet in the middle" approach that essentially excludes non-binary students from the traditional practice.

7. **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language)**: The term "tradition" is used ambiguously without specifying why it should matter in this context, leaving room for misinterpretation. What constitutes "tradition" and why it is critical is not clarified, contributing to a vague and unsupported argument.

Conclusively, the argument exhibits several defective attributes, chiefly Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Presumptuous Consensus, and Ambiguous Language.
