For 
To apply IDAA (Identify, Describe, Analyze, and Assess) to the provided argument concerning speakers discussing social injustice, follow these steps:

**Identify:**

- **Speaker 1's statement:** "We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change."
- **Speaker 2's (or Speaker) response:** "Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."

**Describe:**

- **Speaker 1's claim:** Speaker 1 suggests that a large number of people are involved in spreading information about social injustice and advocating for change through direct action (door-to-door).
- **Speaker 2's response:** Speaker 2 rejects involvement in the campaign based on a moral principle against 'using people,' possibly interpreting 'using' as exploitation or manipulation.

**Analyze:**

- **Speaker 2's argument type:** The response seems to involve **Ambiguous Language** (<DEP>), particularly around the term "using." Speaker 2 may be interpreting "using" in a morally negative sense (exploitation), while Speaker 1 likely meant it more neutrally (engaging people in a cause).

**Assess:**

- **Is Speaker 2's argument valid?** Speaker 2's refusal is based on an interpretation of the word "using" that may not align with Speaker 1's intended meaning. This demonstrates a defect in the argument, as it hinges on ambiguity in language rather than addressing the core issue of whether participation in the campaign is ethically or morally sound.
  
- **Application of <DEP>:** Speaker 2's argument contains ambiguity due to the interpretation of "using." Without clarifying what "using" means in this context (engagement versus exploitation), the argument remains unclear and potentially misleading.

Therefore, Speaker 2's argument can be identified as a defective argument type called **Ambiguous Language** (<DEP>). 

In conclusion, Speaker 2's rejection of participation based on the term "using" does not directly address the intention behind Speaker 1's claim, leading to a misunderstanding rooted in ambiguous language.
