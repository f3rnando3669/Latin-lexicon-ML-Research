For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Assignments) to the given statement:

“Every society is, of course, repressive to some extent – as Sigmund Freud pointed out, repression is the price we pay for civilization”

Let's analyze the argument for any defective types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - **Definition**: Making a broad statement based on a limited set of examples.
   - **Analysis**: The statement claims that "every society is repressive to some extent". This could be seen as a generalization because it applies a characteristic to all societies without providing evidence for each individual case.
   - **Conclusion**: This could be a case of <G>.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - **Definition**: Drawing a conclusion based on an incomplete list of possibilities or examples.
   - **Analysis**: The statement does not list or examine varying degrees or types of repression in different societies, assuming all societies exhibit the same phenomenon uniformly.
   - **Conclusion**: This could fall under <FE>.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - **Definition**: Using premises that do not provide sufficient support for the conclusion.
   - **Analysis**: The reference to Sigmund Freud's point provides a historical perspective but might not conclusively support the modern and universal claim about all societies.
   - **Conclusion**: This could be identified as <IR>.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - **Definition**: Asserting a causal relationship without adequate evidence.
   - **Analysis**: The argument links repression directly to the price of civilization without exploring other potential influencing factors.
   - **Conclusion**: This might be seen as <WCB>.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - **Definition**: Repeating a proposition to establish its validity without new evidence.
   - **Analysis**: The statement does not appear to repeat itself in a faulty manner, thus does not seem applicable.
   - **Conclusion**: <RR> is not present here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - **Definition**: Assuming that because some people believe in a proposition, it must be true.
   - **Analysis**: If the argument relies solely on Freud’s authority or on an assumed agreement with Freud’s statements, it might suggest a presumptuous consensus.
   - **Conclusion**: This might involve <FU>, but it is not strongly evident.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - **Definition**: Using language that is unclear or open to multiple interpretations.
   - **Analysis**: Terms like "repressive" and "repression" may have varying interpretations. The extent and nature of repression can be seen differently across different societies.
   - **Conclusion**: This could be identified as <DEP>.

Based on the analysis, the statement can exhibit the following defective argument types:
- Generalization (<G>)
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)

So, the final assignment would be:
**<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <DEP>**

These labels highlight the several ways the argument might be flawed or lacking in thorough support.
