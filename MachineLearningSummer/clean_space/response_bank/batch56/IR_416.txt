For 
<IDAA>, which stands for Identifying Defective Argument Attributes, can be applied to the statement "How can you tell me I should exercise to lose weight? All you do is sit behind a desk all day. I've never seen you do a lick of exercise." to determine which defective argument types are present. Let's break down this statement to see if any of the defined defective arguments apply:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** This argument does not make a broad generalization based on limited evidence, so <G> does not apply.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This argument does not attempt to enumerate instances in an incomplete manner, so <FE> does not apply.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reasoning here is based on the personal behavior of the person giving advice rather than the merits of the advice itself. The conclusion drawn from this reasoning is inconclusive because it does not address the validity of the advice. Therefore, <IR> does apply.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This argument does not attempt to establish a causal relationship with insufficient evidence. The focus is on discrediting the advisor based on their behavior. So <WCB> does not apply.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** There is no repetition of a proposition in this statement, so <RR> does not apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This argument does not appeal to the idea that a consensus or general belief is presumptively correct, so <FU> does not apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** The language used in the argument is clear and not ambiguous in its meaning, so <DEP> does not apply.

Based on the analysis, the defective argument type that applies to the statement is:

- <IR> (Inconclusive Reason): The argument is attempting to discredit the advice to exercise based on the advisor's personal behavior, which is not relevant to whether the advice is sound.

Thus, the application of <IDAA> to the given statement results in identifying the use of an **Inconclusive Reason** (<IR>).
