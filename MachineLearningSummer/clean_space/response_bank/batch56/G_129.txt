Sure, let's break down the argument "People who read are smart." and identify any defective arguments present according to the defined types.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument can be seen as a generalization because it takes a quality observed in some individuals (people who read being smart) and applies it to a whole group without sufficient evidence to support the universal claim. Not all people who read are necessarily smart, and not all smart people necessarily read.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument "People who read are smart" could also suffer from incomplete enumeration because it fails to consider other scenarios or factors. For instance, there might be people who engage in other activities (besides reading) that also contribute to their intelligence.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The argument does not provide enough information to firmly establish a causal connection between reading and being smart. There might be many other factors contributing to a person's intelligence that are not accounted for here.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Claiming that reading alone causes someone to be smart without demonstrating a clear causal mechanism also makes this argument fall under insufficient causal basis. Intelligence can be influenced by many factors, such as education, life experiences, and innate capabilities.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: If the argument is simply repeating a common belief without substantial evidence or proper reasoning, it could be considered a faulty repetition of a proposition. However, in this context, the statement is not repetitive but rather a standalone assertion.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument might falsely assume that the majority believes reading makes people smart, which can be a type of presumptuous consensus. It assumes a general agreement without providing evidence for such an agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The terms "smart" and "people who read" might be ambiguous. "Smart" can have many definitions and reading can encompass a wide variety of materials, from academic texts to casual reading materials, which doesn't specify the context enough.

Therefore, "People who read are smart." primarily falls under the categories of **Generalization (<G>)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**, **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
