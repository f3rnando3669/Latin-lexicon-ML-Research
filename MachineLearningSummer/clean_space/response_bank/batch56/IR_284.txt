To identify defective arguments in the given statement using the provided abbreviations:

"Don't be out-dated and un-fashionable! Buy the new, modern double-lined heavy duty jeans - the old ripped jeans of the past are out!"

Here are the defective arguments that can be identified:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The statement broadly implies that *all* old ripped jeans are out of fashion and *all* new, modern double-lined heavy duty jeans are fashionable. This kind of generalization does not account for varying fashion trends and personal preferences.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - By presenting only the new double-lined heavy duty jeans as the alternative to old ripped jeans, the statement ignores the full range of other fashionable options available. This is an incomplete enumeration of choices.

3. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - The phrase "the old ripped jeans of the past are out" implies a consensus or common agreement that these jeans are unfashionable, without providing evidence that everyone agrees with this view.

4. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - Terms such as "out-dated," "un-fashionable," "modern," and "out" are subjective and can be interpreted differently by different people. Without clear definitions, these terms can lead to ambiguity in understanding the argument.

So applying <IDAA> to the statement reveals multiple defective argument types, namely Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), and Ambiguous Language (<DEP>).
