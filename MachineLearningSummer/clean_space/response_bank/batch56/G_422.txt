The argument presented can be categorized under the defective argument type known as **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. This is an example of a slippery slope fallacy, where it is assumed that one action will inevitably lead to a series of other undesirable actions without sufficient justification for why each subsequent step would necessarily follow. Here's the breakdown:

**If we let the government ban SUVs, then they're going to want to ban trucks! Then they'll want to ban sports cars! Then they'll want to ban all cars!**

- The argument jumps from banning SUVs directly to a series of increasingly drastic bans without providing conclusive evidence or reasoning for why each step would follow.
- The chain reaction implied is not supported by detailed, logical connections between the steps.

Thus, the argument relies on an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, as it draws a conclusion based on a sequence of events that are suggested to follow one another without firm grounds.
