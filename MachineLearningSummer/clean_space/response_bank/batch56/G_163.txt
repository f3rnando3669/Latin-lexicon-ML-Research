You've provided a structured way to identify and categorize defective arguments. Let's use these categories to analyze the argument provided.

**Argument:** "Kevin's grandparents do not know how to use a computer. Kevin thinks that all older people must be computer illiterate."

Given the definitions:
- <G> Generalization
- <FE> Incomplete Enumeration
- <IR> Inconclusive Reason
- <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis
- <RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition
- <FU> Presumptuous Consensus
- <DEP> Ambiguous Language

In this case, Kevin's reasoning is a **Generalization** based on limited observations about his grandparents. He is taking the experience of a few (his grandparents) and applying it to a whole group (all older people).

Therefore, this argument can be classified as:

**<G> Generalization**

Thus, "Kevin's grandparents do not know how to use a computer. Kevin thinks that all older people must be computer illiterate." is an example of a defective argument type called **Generalization** (<G>).
