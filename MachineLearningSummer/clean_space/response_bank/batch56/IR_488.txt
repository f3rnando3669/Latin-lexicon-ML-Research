For 
Certainly! Let's break down and identify the defective argument in the exchange:

**Teacher**: Why donâ€™t you have your homework today?

**Student**: Well, I did my homework. I was actually really interested in all that info about the quadratic formula. Would you like to hear the song that I wrote to memorize it?

Here, the student's response does not address the teacher's question directly. The teacher's question is about the absence of the homework, not about the student's interest in the quadratic formula or the song they wrote. This is an example of **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** because the student provides information that is irrelevant to the specific question asked by the teacher.

**Identification of Defective Argument (IDAA):**
Type: **<IR> - Inconclusive Reason**

The student's response does not give a satisfactory reason for not having the homework and instead provides information that does not directly address the teacher's concern.
