For 
It seems that you have not defined a defective argument type called <IDAA>. However, based on the context, it appears that you might be asking for an analysis or identification of potentially defective argument types in the statement, "If you don't say the Pledge of Allegiance you are a traitor." Hereâ€™s an evaluation using the defective argument types you defined:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This sentence could be seen as a form of overgeneralization. The conclusion that not saying the Pledge of Allegiance makes someone a traitor is overly broad and doesn't take into account various reasons someone might choose not to say it (G).

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement seems to ignore other reasons or factors for someone not saying the Pledge of Allegiance. It's possible there are numerous reasons why someone might not participate that do not equate to being a traitor (FE).

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning provided ("If you don't say the Pledge of Allegiance, then you are a traitor") is not conclusively supported. There's no definitive link between the action and the label being assigned (IR).

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is insufficient causal basis to state that not saying the Pledge of Allegiance causes one to be a traitor. This causal link isn't adequately supported (WCB).

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: There's no repetition in this statement, so this defective argument type would not apply here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The statement might imply that there is a consensus or shared belief that not saying the Pledge of Allegiance makes someone a traitor, which may not necessarily be true. This can be seen as presumptuous (FU).

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language here is not particularly ambiguous, so this defective argument type wouldn't apply in this context (DEP).

Based on these definitions, the argument "If you don't say the Pledge of Allegiance you are a traitor" can be mainly identified as having issues with Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), and possibly Presumptuous Consensus (FU).
