The argument presented can be analyzed for being defective through the lens of a specific type of defective argument. Based on the definitions provided:

1. **Generalization (G):** This argument might be generalizing the notion of what is "normal" and applying it universally to moral properties without sufficient basis or understanding of the intricacies involved.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This does not seem to fit, as the argument is not listing cases or instances incompletely but rather making a broad statement.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The argument does rely on an inconclusive reason. Just because something is "not normal" (which itself is subjective and varies between cultures and time periods), it does not logically follow that it is morally wrong.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** There is an insufficient causal basis here. The link between something being "normal" or "not normal" and it being morally right or wrong is not clearly established or justified.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This does not seem to fit since the argument doesn't repetitively restate the same proposition without new evidence but instead relates two different properties (natural and moral).

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument could imply a presumptuous consensus, assuming that everyone agrees on what is considered "normal" and that anything not fitting that norm is morally wrong, although this is not explicitly stated.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The term "normal" is ambiguous and can have multiple interpretations, leading to confusion and lack of clarity in the argument’s logical structure.

Given the definitions and the nature of the argument, this particular defective argument type is best represented by:

**<IR> Inconclusive Reason** - The argument assumes a moral property (rightness or wrongness) based on a natural property (normality) without providing conclusive reasoning to bridge the two distinct concepts. Thus, applying <IR> would be appropriate.

Here’s the application of <IR>:

**<IDAA>:** In conclusive reasoning fallacy.

"Homosexuality is/ought to be morally wrong (moral property) because it is not normal (natural property)" applies an inconclusive reason. The argument assumes a direct relationship between being 'not normal' and being 'morally wrong,' which is not logically conclusive or substantiated. Therefore, it falls under the defective argument type <IR> Inconclusive Reason.
