For 
The acronym <IDAA> appears not to be defined in your instructions. Assuming it is meant to apply a certain category or analysis to the given dialogue, I'll proceed to identify defective argument types based on the definitions provided. 

In the given dialogue:

**Speaker 1** states: "I think the idea of a moral law requires the existence of a lawgiver (i.e. God)."
**Speaker 2** responds: "Of course you would say that. Youâ€™re a Christian. Why should we listen to you?"

Here are the possible defective arguments:

- **Speaker 2's response** can fall under a defective argument type:
  - It is mainly an *ad hominem* attack, as it dismisses Speaker 1's argument based on their identity as a Christian rather than engaging with the actual argument. This fallacy is a type of Inconclusive Reason (<IR>) because it does not provide a substantive counter-argument to Speaker 1's claim. Instead, it attempts to undermine Speaker 1's credibility based on personal characteristics.

Therefore, the dialogue contains an Inconclusive Reason (<IR>) in Speaker 2's argument.
