In this context, <IDAA> refers to identifying the defective argument type in the given statement. Let's analyze the provided statement:

"We have to stop the tuition increase! The next thing you know, they'll be charging $40,000 a semester!"

The structure of this argument is a slippery slope, where it suggests that if one event (tuition increase) happens, it will inevitably lead to a much more extreme and undesirable event (charging $40,000 a semester).

This type of argument can be classified under:

**Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This is because the statement relies on a chain of events that may not occur. The argument does not provide sufficient evidence that a tuition increase will lead directly to such an extreme outcome.

Therefore, the defective argument type for this statement is <IR>: Inconclusive Reason.
