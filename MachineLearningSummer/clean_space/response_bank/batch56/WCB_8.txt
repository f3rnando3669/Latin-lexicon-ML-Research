In order to analyze the argument presented using the defective argument types we have defined, let's break down the statement:

"Pointing to a fancy chart, Roger shows how temperatures have been rising over the past few centuries, whilst at the same time the numbers of pirates have been decreasing; thus pirates cool the world and global warming is a hoax."

This argument appears to be making a causal claim based on a correlation observed between two variables: the rise in temperatures and the decline in the number of pirates. However, the conclusion that pirates cool the world and that global warming is a hoax is not logically supported by the evidence provided.

To specifically apply the defective arguments:

1. **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The argument makes a causal claim without sufficient evidence to support it. Just because two trends occur simultaneously does not mean there is a causal relationship between them. Correlation does not imply causation.

2. **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: The reasoning provided is not conclusive. The argument fails to establish a valid or logical link between the number of pirates and global temperatures. The data provided (a fancy chart) is inconclusive and does not offer a solid foundation for the conclusion drawn.

These two defective argument types help identify the issues in Roger's reasoning.

So, applying <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Analysis) to the argument, we find:

The argument is flawed because it relies on **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)** and **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**, resulting in an invalid conclusion that pirates cooling the world or disproving global warming is not supported by the evidence.
