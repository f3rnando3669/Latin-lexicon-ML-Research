For 
<IDAA> can be defined as a defective argument type called Irrelevant Diversion of Attention, where the focus is shifted away from the main issue to avoid addressing it.

In the given situation:

"You call your cell phone provider to complain about how poor your cell phone battery life is after the recent software update. The representative, instead of responding to your concern, praises the providerâ€™s new unlimited text-messaging plans that are due to be released in the next month."

This argument exhibits <IDAA> because the representative diverts attention from the customer's concern about the poor battery life following the software update by instead discussing the new unlimited text-messaging plans. The representative fails to address the battery issue, thus providing an irrelevant diversion of attention.
