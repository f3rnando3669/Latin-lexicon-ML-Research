It looks like you want to analyze the given argument using specific types of defective arguments (fallacies). Let's break it down according to the defective argument types defined:

Original Argument: "French people are great at kissing. Julie is French. Get me a date!"

1. **Generalization (G):** 
   - The statement "French people are great at kissing" is a generalization. It draws a broad conclusion about an entire group based on limited evidence or stereotypes.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - The argument assumes that being French implies being great at kissing without considering individual differences. It fails to enumerate all necessary criteria or variations among people.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - The reason given ("French people are great at kissing") is not sufficient to conclude that Julie, who is French, will be great at kissing. This connection is not conclusively reasoned.

4. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - The leap from "Julie is French" to "Get me a date!" is based on an inconclusive reason. It makes several unsupported assumptions, including that Julie would be interested, that being interested equates to being great at kissing, and that all French people are uniformly skilled in the same area.

Using the defined defective arguments, the argument could be tagged primarily by:

1. **Generalization (G)**
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** 

So, the argument "French people are great at kissing. Julie is French. Get me a date!" could be annotated with these defective argument types, reflecting its reliance on stereotypes, incomplete reasoning, and inconclusive connections.
