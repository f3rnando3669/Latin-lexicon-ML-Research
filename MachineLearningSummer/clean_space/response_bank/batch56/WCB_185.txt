For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Attributes. Let's apply <IDAA> to the statement "Students are poor writers because they watch too much TV" using the defined defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument generalizes about all students based on a presumed characteristic ("poor writers"). It assumes that watching too much TV is the cause for poor writing across a broad group without considering other factors.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument attributes poor writing skill solely to watching TV without considering other potential causes. It does not enumerate other factors such as teaching quality, curriculum, individual effort, or other distractions that might affect writing skills.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasoning that watching too much TV leads to poor writing skills is not conclusively supported. There may be a correlation, but correlation does not imply causation. The argument lacks solid evidence linking TV watching directly to poor writing skills.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: There is an insufficient causal basis for the claim. The argument assumes a direct cause-and-effect relationship without providing comprehensive evidence or considering intermediate variables that might influence writing ability.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This defective attribute does not apply here since the argument does not rely on the repetition of the same proposition to make its point.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument presumes that a consensus exists that watching TV causes poor writing skills. It implies a commonly accepted belief without substantiating this belief with research or data.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The language in the argument is not particularly ambiguous; however, terms like "poor writers" and "too much TV" could be subjective and open to interpretation, making the argument less precise.

In summary, applying <IDAA> to the statement "Students are poor writers because they watch too much TV" reveals several defective argument attributes: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, and <FU>.
