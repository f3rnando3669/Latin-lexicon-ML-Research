For 
It seems you want to apply a type of defective argument identification system (potentially "<IDAA>") to the argument presented in the statement: "If you allow one student to take an online course, soon everyone will want to, and the schools will be empty."

Here’s how various defective argument types might apply to this statement:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The argument jumps to a broad conclusion with insufficient evidence. Just because one student takes an online course does not mean that all students will follow suit, leading to empty schools.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The argument bypasses other potential outcomes, narrowly forecasting that every student will opt for online classes, ignoring that some might prefer in-person learning or that hybrid models might be more common.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The reasoning behind the conclusion ("schools will be empty") isn't fully substantiated. The effect of one student taking an online course on the entire school's attendance isn't conclusively established.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - There is an insufficient causal link between one student taking an online course and the subsequent mass exodus from schools. Other factors would influence students' decisions to remain in physical classrooms or shift online.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - While this might not precisely fit, if the argument recurrently emphasizes or restates that "everyone will switch to online" without new supporting evidence, <RR> could apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - The argument presumes that consensus will naturally follow one student's decision to switch to online courses, which might not be the case. There’s an assumption that all students will act similarly without considering individual preferences.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - The argument could be using vague terms such as "soon" and "everyone," which are unclear and open to various interpretations, thereby weakening the argument's strength.

In summary, to use the identifier <IDAA> (possibly meaning Identifying Defective Argument Types Analysis) on the given statement, we find that multiple defective argument types could apply, particularly Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), and Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).
