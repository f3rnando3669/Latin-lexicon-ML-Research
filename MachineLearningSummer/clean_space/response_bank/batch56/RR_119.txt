For 
<I am athletic because I run, and I run because I'm athletic.> is an example of a defective argument type called Faulty Repetition of Proposition (Faulty Repetition of Proposition). This type of defect involves circular reasoning where the conclusion is repetitively stated in the premises, essentially restating the proposition without providing any external proof or reasoning.

Therefore, the classification of the argument would be:

<IDAA>: <RR>

Explanation: The argument states that "I am athletic because I run" and then essentially repeats the conclusion by stating "I run because I'm athletic," thereby not providing any additional supportive reasoning outside of restating the initial claim.
