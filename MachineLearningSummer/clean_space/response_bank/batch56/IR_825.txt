Certainly! Applying the defective argument type "<IDAA>" (Identify and Describe Argument's Defective Aspects) to the given statement:

Statement: "When you are late getting home past curfew, you distract your parents by talking to them about the weatherâ€”how cold it is, or how rainy it is."

### Identify and Describe Argument's Defective Aspects (<IDAA>):

1. **Defective Arguments Present:**
   - **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**: The statement uses an ambiguous shift in focus from the main issue (being late past curfew) to a random topic (the weather). This ambiguity distracts from the actual concern without addressing it directly.

2. **Explanation:**
   - **Ambiguity and Diversion**: Instead of directly dealing with the issue of being late, the argument redirects focus to an unrelated topic, which is a classic example of using ambiguous language to avoid the main point.
   - **Incomplete Strategy**: The argument does not thoroughly address the parent's concern, thus not delivering a sufficient or valid reasoning for why one was late.

By using the <IDAA> method, we identify that the argument contains ambiguous language intended to divert attention away from the main issue of being late, which can be categorized under the defective argument type <DEP>.
