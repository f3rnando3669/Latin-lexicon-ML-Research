To analyze the argument using <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Application), we can break down the argument presented and determine which of the defined defective argument types apply.

The argument in question is:

"Michael Jackson, Kurt Cobain, and Jimi Hendrix were rock stars who died young. Therefore, if you become a rock star, don’t expect to live a long life."

Let's apply <IDAA> step-by-step:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   This argument suggests that because a few specific rock stars died young, all rock stars are likely to have short lives. This is a clear case of a Hasty Generalization, which assumes that a specific instance (or a few instances) can be generalized to all cases without sufficient evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   The argument fails to mention other rock stars who have lived long lives, thus presenting an incomplete list to make a point. This is a type of Incomplete Enumeration where only selective examples are chosen to support the conclusion.

Given these points, the defective argument types <G> (Generalization) and <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration) are relevant and apply directly.

### Conclusion:
The argument "Michael Jackson, Kurt Cobain, and Jimi Hendrix were rock stars who died young. Therefore, if you become a rock star, don’t expect to live a long life." is identified as being defective primarily due to:
- **<G> Generalization**: Hasty generalization based on few examples.
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: Failure to consider all relevant instances (many rock stars who lived long lives).

By identifying these defective argument types, we reveal the logical flaws in the reasoning presented.
