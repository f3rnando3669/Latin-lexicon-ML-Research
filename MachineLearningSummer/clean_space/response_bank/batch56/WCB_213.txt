To analyze the argument "President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up. Jones is responsible for the rise in crime," we will apply the definitions of the defective argument types to identify any that might be relevant.

**Identified Defective Argument Types (IDAA):**

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This argument type applies here. The argument suggests that since one event (raising taxes) preceded another (rise in violent crime), the first event caused the second. However, it does not provide sufficient causal evidence to support this connection. There could be numerous other factors contributing to the rise in crime, and the mere temporal sequence is insufficient to establish causality.

Using <WCB> as the most fitting defective argument type in this context, we have:

"WCB: The argument posits that President Jones raising taxes caused the rise in violent crime solely based on the sequence of events, without providing adequate causal evidence."
