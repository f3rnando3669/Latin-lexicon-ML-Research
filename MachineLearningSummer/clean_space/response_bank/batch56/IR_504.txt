For 
<IDAA>, or identifying defective arguments by annotation, involves examining the argument and determining which type of defective argument it exemplifies. Let's break down the given statement:

"Have you accepted the fact that most environmental studies don’t support global warming?"

This statement can be analyzed for potential defective arguments:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This type of argument might involve making broad statements based on limited evidence.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This happens when not all relevant instances are considered, leading to a misleading conclusion.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This arises when the reasons given do not sufficiently support the conclusion.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This occurs when a causal relationship is asserted without enough evidence.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This type of argument involves repeating a claim without providing additional support.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This implies that a consensus exists without sufficient evidence.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This involves using language that is not clear or precise, leading to misunderstandings.

Applying **IDAA** to the statement "Have you accepted the fact that most environmental studies don’t support global warming?", it seems to fit the type called **Generalization (G)**, as it makes a broad statement about "most environmental studies" without providing specific evidence to substantiate this claim. Additionally, it also fits **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** because it implies a conclusion without reviewing all relevant studies on global warming, thus potentially misleading the recipient of the message.

Hence, we can annotate this statement as follows:
**<G, FE>** "Have you accepted the fact that most environmental studies don’t support global warming?"

This annotation identifies the defective arguments present in the statement.
