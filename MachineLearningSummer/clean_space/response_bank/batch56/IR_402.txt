It seems there might be a slight confusion regarding the term "<IDAA>". If you meant to apply a defective argument type to the given statement, we can analyze it using the defined defective argument types to determine which one applies best. Let's analyze the argument you provided:

"Ms. Baker assigned me a lot of homework because she’s a witch!"

To determine the defective argument type, we should assess the reasoning given for the conclusion.

1. **Generalization (G)**: This type refers to making a broad generalization based on limited evidence. The statement does not seem to generalize from limited instances, so it does not fit.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This argument type involves failing to consider all possible options or causes. This does not seem fitting, as the statement doesn't list incomplete causes but directly attributes Ms. Baker's actions to her being a witch.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This relates to providing a reason that does not adequately support the conclusion. "She's a witch" does not logically explain why she would assign a lot of homework. Thus, "Inconclusive Reason" seems applicable here.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This argument type occurs when the cause cited is insufficient to explain the effect. The statement suggests causation ("she's a witch" causes "assigning a lot of homework"), but being a witch is an insufficient and irrelevant cause for assigning homework. So, this also fits.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This involves the repetition of a statement or premise without adding any new logical support. The statement does not repeat a proposition, so it doesn't apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This type involves assuming consensus or agreement without evidence. The statement does not imply consensus, so it's not applicable.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This occurs when vague or ambiguous language confuses the argument. The language here is quite clear, so this does not apply.

Considering the above analysis, the defective argument types that fit the statement "Ms. Baker assigned me a lot of homework because she’s a witch!" best are:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

So, the application of defective argument types to "Ms. Baker assigned me a lot of homework because she’s a witch!" would be:

**<IR (Inconclusive Reason)> and <WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)>**
