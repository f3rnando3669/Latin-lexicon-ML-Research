For 
To understand and apply the defective argument type <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Application) to the statement, "No one in your family surfs? But I thought you said you lived in California before this," we must first identify which defective argument type best fits this scenario. Let's consider the list of defective argument types provided:

1. **Generalization (G)**
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**

Upon reviewing the statement, it seems that the assertion is making an assumption based on a stereotype or generalization about people living in California. The assumption here is that anyone who lives in California would naturally surf, which is a broad and often inaccurate generalization. People live in California for numerous reasons, and surfing is just one of many possible activities someone might engage in.

Thus, the defective argument type that best describes this scenario is Generalization (<G>).

So, the application <IDAA> to the given statement would be:

**IDAA:** The argument "No one in your family surfs? But I thought you said you lived in California before this." is an instance of the defective argument type Generalization (<G>), because it wrongly assumes that living in California implies that someone must surf.
