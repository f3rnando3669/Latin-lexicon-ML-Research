Sure, I can help you analyze the argument using the defined defective argument types.

The argument provided is: "Everyone seems to support the changes in the vacation policy, and if everyone likes them, they must be good."

This argument can be scrutinized based on the defective argument types defined:

1. **Generalization (G)**: The argument claims that everyone supports the changes, which may be an over-generalization. It's not likely that *everyone* supports the changes.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument assumes that a consensus exists without providing an exhaustive list of opinions or evidence to confirm that everyone actually supports the changes.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument suggests that the popularity of the policy changes implies their goodness, but this is not a conclusive reason. Popularity alone does not necessarily equate to quality or goodness.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument lacks a causal link between the support for the changes and their actual quality. Just because people support something does not mean it is inherently good.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This argument doesn't primarily rely on repeating a proposition, so this defect is not applicable here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument assumes a consensus ("everyone seems to support the changes") without adequate evidence for such a wide-reaching agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The phrase “everyone seems to support” is ambiguous as it doesn't clarify who "everyone" is. It could mean a small group or the entire company, making the argument unclear.

From these analyses, the defective argument types that most closely apply to this argument are:

- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**

In summary, the argument "Everyone seems to support the changes in the vacation policy, and if everyone likes them, they must be good." contains several defects, specifically Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Presumptuous Consensus, and Ambiguous Language.
