For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument and Analyzing its Application) to the statement "All Greek food causes illness; when I traveled through Greece, I got food poisoning," we'll identify the type of defective argument used and analyze its flaws.

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - **Identification:** The argument claims that all Greek food causes illness based on a single incident of the arguer getting food poisoning.
   - **Analysis:** This is a hasty generalization. One instance of food poisoning does not justify the conclusion that all Greek food causes illness. Other factors could have contributed to the food poisoning, and one experience cannot reasonably represent the entire category of Greek food.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - **Identification:** The argument fails to consider other instances of eating Greek food that did not result in illness.
   - **Analysis:** The conclusion is drawn without considering a comprehensive set of examples. A single case where the arguer got food poisoning doesn't account for the myriad of times people might have eaten Greek food without any issues.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - **Identification:** The argument gives an insufficient reason to support the conclusion.
   - **Analysis:** The fact that the arguer got food poisoning once does not conclusively prove that all Greek food causes illness. There could be many other reasons for the food poisoning, such as the condition of a particular restaurant or specific ingredients used in that meal.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - **Identification:** The argument lacks a sufficient causal link between eating Greek food and getting food poisoning.
   - **Analysis:** The argument assumes causation based on a single correlation. Just because the arguer got food poisoning after eating Greek food once doesnâ€™t mean that Greek food was the cause. Other variables, such as personal health conditions or unrelated external factors, are not considered.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - **Identification:** The argument may give a flawed repetition of the proposition.
   - **Analysis:** This type is less applicable here, as the argument does not involve repeating the proposition in an erroneous manner.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - **Identification:** The argument erroneously assumes a consensus without evidence.
   - **Analysis:** By claiming that "all Greek food causes illness," the arguer presumes a consensus that does not likely exist, without actual supporting data or general agreement in the population.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - **Identification:** The argument may involve ambiguous terms or language.
   - **Analysis:** The term "Greek food" could be considered vague because it encompasses a wide range of dishes and preparations. However, in this particular argument, ambiguous language is not a primary flaw.

### Conclusion
The primary defective argument types applicable to "All Greek food causes illness; when I traveled through Greece, I got food poisoning" are:

- Generalization (<G>)
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)

The argument commits a hasty generalization by extrapolating a broad conclusion from a single experience. It also insufficiently accounts for other instances and fails to establish a solid causal relationship.
