For 
<IDAA>: Identify Defective Argument Application.

The argument presented is:

"Yesterday, I walked under a ladder with an open umbrella indoors while spilling salt in front of a black cat. And I forgot to knock on wood with my lucky dice. That must be why I’m having such a bad day today. It’s bad luck."

Let's identify the defective argument types applied here:

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>**:
   - The argument assumes that walking under a ladder, carrying an open umbrella indoors, and other superstitious actions directly caused the bad day. There is no sufficient causal basis to prove that these specific actions resulted in the bad day.

Therefore, applying <IDAA>, the argument predominantly displays the defective argument type:

<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
