For 
Applying the Identifying Defective Argument Analysis (<IDAA>) to Bill Clinton's statement:

**Statement**:
"But when Joe McCarthy went around this country attacking people’s patriotism, he was wrong. He was wrong. And a senator from Connecticut stood up to him named Prescott Bush. Your father was right to stand up to Joe McCarthy, you were wrong to attack my patriotism. I was opposed to the war but I loved my country…"

**Analysis**:
1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Clinton could be seen as generalizing from the specific instance of Joe McCarthy's actions to a broader claim that attacking someone's patriotism is inherently wrong. However, he does provide an example to support his claim.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Clinton doesn't list all possible reasons someone might attack patriotism or all scenarios in which such an attack might be justified or unjustified.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Clinton’s argument might be seen as inconclusive if the listener does not see the parallel between Joe McCarthy’s actions and the actions of the person he is addressing.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Clinton suggests a causal connection between standing up to Joe McCarthy and being correct, and compares it to attacking his patriotism. The causal relationship might not fully support his conclusion due to different contexts and individuals involved.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Clinton repeats that McCarthy was wrong and that the other person was also wrong without providing new reasons in the argument.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Clinton implies that standing up to McCarthy was an unequivocal good, thus attacking him is wrong, assuming that his audience shares this view without direct evidence.
7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: There is not much ambiguity in the terminology he uses, making this defective argument less applicable.

Given the diverse elements in the analysis, the most fitting defective argument type Clinton’s statement likely employs is a combination of **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** and **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**. Clinton presumes the incorrectness of attacking patriotism based on an analogous yet contextually different historical example without sufficiently establishing a causal link between the two situations.
