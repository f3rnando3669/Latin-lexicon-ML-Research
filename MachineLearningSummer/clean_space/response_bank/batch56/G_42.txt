For 
The concluding statement within the argument specifies a general assertion about all Ohio drivers based on a single incident. 

This is a prime example of a hasty generalizationâ€”where a broad conclusion is drawn from a small sample size or insufficient evidence. Therefore, this argument contains a defective argument type <G>, which stands for Generalization.

More specifically:

The argument involves Sam encountering one incident with a rude driver from Ohio and then generalizing that behavior to all drivers from Ohio. This jumps to a broad conclusion without sufficient support or evidence to substantiate such a claim.

Thus, the defective argument type implicated here is:
- **Generalization (<G>)**

Final annotation:
"Sam is riding her bike in her home town in Maine, minding her own business. A station wagon comes up behind her and the driver starts beeping his horn and then tries to force her off the road. As he goes by, the driver yells 'get on the sidewalk where you belong!' Sam sees that the car has Ohio plates and concludes that all Ohio drivers are jerks." <G>
