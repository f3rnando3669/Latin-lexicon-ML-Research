For 
<IDAA> is not defined in your provided list of defective argument types. However, I can analyze the argument and apply the relevant defective argument types you've defined, if suitable.

"Fish are the easiest pets to keep; they are inexpensive and require no maintenance at all. Plus, they are really pretty and soothing to watch."

1. **Generalization (G)**: The statement "Fish are the easiest pets to keep" is a generalization. While fish may indeed be easy to maintain for some people, this claim does not consider variations in fish species, tank sizes, and individual circumstances that might make some fish more difficult to care for than others.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument mentions that fish are inexpensive and require no maintenance. This overlooks some important factors such as the cost of an aquarium, water treatment, food, and the actual maintenance tasks required like cleaning the tank and monitoring water quality.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument does not conclusively establish that fish are the easiest pets to keep. "They are inexpensive and require no maintenance at all" might be true for some, but it doesn't necessarily prove that fish are easier compared to other pets, which might also have their own set of advantages.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The statement "they are really pretty and soothing to watch" does not provide a causal basis for fish being the easiest pets to keep. The aesthetic and soothing properties of fish do not contribute to their ease of care.

Based on the definitions provided, the defective argument types that apply to this argument are:

- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

Thus, this argument could be marked with <G>, <FE>, <IR>, and <WCB> to highlight its defects.
