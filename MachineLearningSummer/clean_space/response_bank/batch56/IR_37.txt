For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Arguments and Analysis. 

The statement "My opponent raises a good point, but can we really trust him? I mean, he moved to this town two years ago and everyone knows that his wife left him." needs to be analyzed for possible defective arguments:

1. **Ad Hominem** (Attacking the person instead of addressing their argument): This statement attacks the opponent's character by mentioning irrelevant personal details such as their recent relocation and marital status. It attempts to undermine their credibility without addressing the actual point they raised.

Since an "Ad Hominem" fallacy hasn't been defined in the defective argument types you provided, we can note that it doesn't specifically fit any of the provided types such as Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Presumptuous Consensus, or Ambiguous Language.

Therefore, we can identify this argument as containing elements of an **Ad Hominem** fallacy, rather than fitting into the specific categories defined.
