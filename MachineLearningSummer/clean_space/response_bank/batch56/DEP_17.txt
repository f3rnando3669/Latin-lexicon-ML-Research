For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Attributes. Let's apply <IDAA> to the argument:

"According to the Supreme Court, we have a right to abortion. Therefore, it is right to have an abortion."

In this case, the argument's structure reveals a key weakness. The statement conflates a legal right with a moral right.

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument fails to consider other perspectives or moral arguments regarding the issue. It assumes that because there is a legal right, the moral question is resolved, which is an incomplete enumeration of the arguments for and against abortion.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The argument presents the legal decision as a conclusive reason for the moral rightness of abortion, but legality does not inherently equate to moral rightness. The Supreme Court decision only addresses the legal permissibility, not the ethical dimensions.

3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument seems to suggest that the Supreme Court's ruling causes abortion to be morally right, but the causal connection is not sufficiently established. Legal rulings and moral rightness are not inherently causally linked.

4. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The term "right" is used ambiguously, conflating legal rights with moral rights, which can lead to confusion about what kind of "rightness" is being asserted.

By identifying and classifying these defective argument attributes, we can see how the argument is structurally weak and logically flawed.
