For 
<IDAA> stands for "Identify Defective Arguments and Assign". Let's analyze the argument and identify any defective argument types, applying the definitions provided:

The argument is: "If we don't control Covid-19, it could lead to millions of deaths. Wouldn't it make you sad to live in a country where that had happened?"

1. **Generalization (G)**: The argument does not appear to make a hasty generalization based on limited evidence.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: There is no claim here that all possible outcomes have been listed or even implied, so this type does not apply.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument seems to be using a hypothetical outcome to evoke an emotional response rather than providing a conclusive reason. It implies that the emotional impact of the hypothetical deaths is a good reason to control Covid-19, which is more about emotional appeal than solid reasoning. This can be categorized as an Inconclusive Reason.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument suggests a potential causal link between not controlling Covid-19 and millions of deaths, but it does not delve into the actual mechanisms or provide sufficient evidence for the causal link. This could be seen as having an Insufficient Causal Basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: There is no repetition of the proposition to create the illusion of evidence.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument doesn't imply that everyone agrees with the statement, so this does not apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: There does not seem to be any ambiguous language used in the statement.

Applying these:

- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The argument relies on an emotional appeal rather than providing solid evidence or reasoning that controlling Covid-19 will actually prevent millions of deaths.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: The argument suggests a causal link between not controlling Covid-19 and millions of deaths without sufficient evidence.

So, the defective arguments identified in this statement are:

- <IR> Inconclusive Reason
- <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis
