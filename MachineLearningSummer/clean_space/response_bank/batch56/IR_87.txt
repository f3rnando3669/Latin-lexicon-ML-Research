Applying the concept of Identifying Defective Argument Attributes (<IDAA>) to the statement "I know Joe Bob’s my boss, but I’m not going to take orders from someone who can’t even dress professionally for work," we can identify several potential defective argument types:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The speaker is rejecting authority (not taking orders) based on Joe Bob’s attire, which is not directly related to his capability or legitimacy as a boss. The conclusion about not taking orders from him is not strongly supported by the premise regarding his dressing style.

2. **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement makes a generalization that someone who doesn't dress professionally is not worthy of giving orders, which may not hold true in all cases. Professional attire is not the sole indicator of one’s ability to perform a job or hold a position of authority.

This statement primarily fits into these two defective argument types, indicating flaws in reasoning based on imply an irrelevant or weak connection between dressing style and professional authority and through generalizing a specific characteristic to overall competency.
