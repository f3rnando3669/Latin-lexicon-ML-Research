For 
To analyze the provided statement using the defined defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: Assuming something about a group based on limited evidence.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Presenting a conclusion without considering all relevant evidence.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Reasoning that does not sufficiently support the conclusion.
   
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Asserting a cause-and-effect relationship without enough evidence.
   
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Repeating an argument without adding new support.
   
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assuming everyone shares a particular view without sufficient evidence.
   
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Using language with multiple meanings to mislead.

Now, applying these to analyze the argument:

"Paige wants to play a guitar solo on our next recording. Her father is a horrible musician, though, so I doubt that Paula's any good either."

This statement can be analyzed and identified as:
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument asserts a causal link between her father's musical abilities and Paige's potential talent without sufficient evidence. Just because her father is a horrible musician doesn't mean Paige will be as well.
  
- **Generalization (G)**: Making a broad conclusion about Paige's musical abilities based on limited evidence (the musical abilities of her father).

Thus, the primary defective argument types applied here are **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** and **Generalization (G)**.
