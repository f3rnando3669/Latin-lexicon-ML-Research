For 
The statement "I shouldn't have flunked the test because I never get F's" can be categorized as an example of defective argument <IR>, Inconclusive Reason. 

This argument is based on an inconclusive reason because the assertion that one has never gotten F's before does not conclusively support the claim that the test result should not be an F. Past performance does not necessarily determine the outcome of a single event unless additional evidence is provided to support a consistent reason behind previous successes or the current failure.
