For 
In the sentence "Unless you can close your eyes to abuse, write a check to save this puppy," we can examine for specific defective argument types, if any, that might be present:

1. **Generalization (G)** - This is when a conclusion is drawn from an unrepresentative sample. The sentence does not seem to generalize from a specific instance, so this does not apply here.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** - This is when not all possible options are considered or enumerated. The sentence presents a binary choice: either you can close your eyes to abuse or you must write a check. However, this ignores other possible responses (volunteering, advocating, etc.). Therefore, it could be seen as an Incomplete Enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** - This occurs when the reasons offered do not necessarily lead to the conclusion. The reason given ("Unless you can close your eyes to abuse, write a check") may not be conclusive, as witnessing abuse alone might not be sufficient reason for someone to write a check. Still, it's a subjective measure and could be debated.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** - This is when the cause cited is insufficient to produce the effect cited. There's no causal link being proposed necessarily in the sentence, so this doesn't directly apply.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** - This involves a circular argument or repetition that doesnâ€™t add new information. The sentence does not repeat itself, so this does not apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** - This is when it's assumed that everyone agrees with the proposition. The argument might implicitly assume that everyone agrees that writing a check is the correct action unless they are indifferent to abuse. This might be applicable depending on interpretation.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)** - This involves using vague or ambiguous terms. The terms "abuse" and "save this puppy" are quite clear in their meaning. Hence, this does not apply.

Given this analysis, the most applicable defective argument types for the given sentence could be:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** (depending on interpretation)

Therefore, the associated labels for this argument might be:

"Unless you can close your eyes to abuse, write a check to save this puppy." <FE, FU>
