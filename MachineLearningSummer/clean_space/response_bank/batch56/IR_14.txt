Certainly. Here is the analysis of the argument using the specified defective argument types:

**Argument**: "Andy states that a Scotsman would never put sugar on his porridge. Dougal replies that he is a Scotsman and he does put sugar on his porridge. Andy counters that no true Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge. Andy thus changes the terms of the argument, implying that Dougal is not a 'true' Scotsman in order to support his own position."

**Defective Argument Types (IDAA)**:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE**): Andy's initial claim that a Scotsman would never put sugar on his porridge assumes he has considered every possible Scotsman when clearly Dougal as a counterexample disproves this. Andy fails to include all instances of Scotsmen in his consideration.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Andy's reasoning hinges on the notion of what a "true Scotsman" would do. This reasoning is inconclusive because the characteristic of being a "true Scotsman" is not well-defined or universally accepted. Therefore, Andy's argument is based on an insufficient standard.

3. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Andy's argument presumes a consensus about what behavior defines a "true Scotsman" without providing evidence that the consensus exists or is meaningful.

4. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The use of the term "true Scotsman" introduces ambiguous language. What qualifies as a "true Scotsman" is subjective and can shift depending on the argument's needs, which weakens the strength of Andy's argument.

By shifting the argument to define Dougal out of the category of "true Scotsman" based on an arbitrary characteristic, Andy's argument exemplifies the "No true Scotsman" fallacy. This fallacious tactic avoids addressing the counterexample by redefining the categorization in an exclusive and self-serving manner.

In brief, Andy's argument demonstrates defects in reasoning by making an **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, relying on an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, assuming a **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**, and using **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**.
