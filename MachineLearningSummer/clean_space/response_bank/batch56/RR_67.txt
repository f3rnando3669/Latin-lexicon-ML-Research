For 
Let's analyze the argument "You can't give me a C! I'm an A student, a C is just wrong!" using the defined defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument does not seem to involve an overgeneralization. It's specific to the individual's situation.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not show an enumeration of possibilities. 

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The phrase does present an inconclusive reason. Just claiming to be an "A student" doesn't inherently justify that receiving a C is incorrect without supporting evidence or context. Therefore, this argument can be classified as <IR>.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is no causal relationship presented in the argument, so this defective type does not apply.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The argument does not merely repeat a claim without further justification.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument does not appeal to a consensus or common opinion to establish the claim.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The argument uses straightforward language without any notable ambiguity.

Given this analysis, the appropriate defective argument type to apply would be:

"You can't give me a C! I'm an A student, a C is just wrong!" <IR>
