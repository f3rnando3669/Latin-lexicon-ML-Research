Applying the structure of identifying and classifying defective arguments to the statement "Having come from the same political party, he is sure to communicate biased and untrue claims about his party-mates," let's classify it into one of the defined defective argument types. Here's a step-by-step analysis for <IDAA> (Identify, Define, Analyze, and Apply):

**Identify:**
We first identify the nature of the argument being presented here. The statement suggests that a person's affiliation with a political party guarantees them to communicate biased and untrue claims. 

**Define:**
Next, we map the nature of this argument onto our definitions of defective argument types:

- **Generalization (G):** This is when a conclusion is drawn about all instances based on only a few instances.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This involves overlooking relevant cases or evidence.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This is when the reason given does not sufficiently support the conclusion.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This suggests that the cause given does not adequately explain the effect.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This involves the repeated assertion of the same proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This implies a claim is accepted because many people believe it.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** This arises when unclear or equivocal language causes confusion.

**Analyze:**
Analyzing the statement:
- The assertion "Having come from the same political party" automatically qualifies someone to communicate biased and untrue claims about their party-mates.
- This assertion makes a generalized prediction about behavior purely based on party affiliation without considering individual differences.

**Apply:**
The most fitting defective argument type here appears to be **Generalization (G)**. This is because the statement makes a broad assertion about an individual's behavior based solely on their political party affiliation, without accounting for other variables or the possibility that not all individuals will act in the same manner.

Therefore, applying <IDAA> to the given statement leads to the conclusion that the argument type is **Generalization (G)**.
