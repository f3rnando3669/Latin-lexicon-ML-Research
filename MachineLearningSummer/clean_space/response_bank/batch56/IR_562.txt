For 
Let's decode the argument exchange provided between A and B using the defective argument types defined. 

Argument:
A: "The Government should enact minimum-wage legislation so that workers are not exploited."
B: "Nonsense. You say that only because you cannot find a good job."

First, identify and analyze the faulty aspect(s) in the response from B.

1. **Analysis of B's Argument**:
   - **Red Herring**: Instead of addressing the substance of argument A, B diverts attention to a personal attack on A's motivations.
   - **Ad Hominem**: B attacks A’s character or circumstances rather than addressing the argument.

Applying <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Analysis) specific to the given types defined:

- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: B's response does not provide any actual reason against the minimum-wage legislation proposal. It only questions A's motivations, which doesn't address the argument’s validity or substance. 
- **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language)**: Consider if there's any ambiguous language; however, it doesn't seem to apply directly here since the issue is more with irrelevance than ambiguity.

Thus, the primary defective argument type in B's response seems to fit **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** as it doesn't present a relevant or substantive counter-argument.

**Applied <IDAA>:**
B’s response primarily commits an <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) by failing to engage with the actual argument and instead attacking the arguer’s motivations, which is irrelevant to the validity of the initial argument concerning minimum-wage legislation.
