For 
<IDAA> stands for "Identify Defective Argument and Assign Annotations."

To apply <IDAA> to the statement "Pay taxes or go to jail," we'll examine whether it fits any of the defective argument types defined:

1. **Generalization (<G>)** - The statement does not seem to rely on broad or sweeping assertions made from a specific instance, so it isn't a generalization.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** - This might apply if the argument presents the options of paying taxes or jail as exhaustive, ignoring other possibilities (like fines, community service, payment plans, or legal disputes). Thus, the statement might reflect an incomplete enumeration. <FE>

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** - The statement asserts a direct consequence without justifying it thoroughly (e.g., legal explanations or other justifications), so it might also be seen as having an inconclusive reason. <IR>
   
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** - The connection between paying taxes and going to jail can be deemed oversimplified, as not paying taxes doesn't always result directly in jail timeâ€”it could involve other legal actions or processes first. Thus, this argument could be insufficiently founded on causal terms. <WCB>
   
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)** - There is no evident repetition of the same argument or idea in this statement.
   
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)** - This statement does not rely on the assumption that a consensus exists.
   
7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)** - The language here is quite clear and specific about the consequences, so it probably doesn't fit this type.

The statement "Pay taxes or go to jail" might be assigned multiple defective arguments based on the analysis:

<IDAA> "Pay taxes or go to jail": <FE> <IR> <WCB>
