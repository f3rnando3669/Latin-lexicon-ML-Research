For 
<IDAA>, an acronym for Identifying Defective Argument Analysis, involves pinpointing the specific types of defective arguments in a statement. Let's analyze the provided argument:

**Statement:**
"We can’t freeze the academic year because then students won’t graduate on time. Next thing you know most people will be unemployed and will resort to crime. The crime rate will skyrocket and society will collapse."

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The claim that freezing the academic year will lead directly to society collapsing is an overgeneralization. The argument makes broad, sweeping conclusions from a single premise without sufficient evidence to support such a drastic outcome.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The claim doesn't consider other possible outcomes or factors. It presents a narrow view by jumping from students not graduating on time to the collapse of society, ignoring other variables that could mitigate or alter this chain of events.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The steps in the argument lack strong causal connections. There's an assumption that graduating late will directly lead to unemployment, crime, and societal collapse, but these are not conclusively or logically linked by the evidence provided.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The argument fails to establish a direct causal relationship between freezing the academic year and the extreme outcomes mentioned. The causal links are speculative and not adequately supported.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - The argument does not seem to contain a case of faulty repetition of the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - The argument implies that everyone will agree that these negative outcomes are the inevitable result of freezing the academic year, without providing any consensus or evidence to support this assumption.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - The terms used, such as "society will collapse," are ambiguous and hyperbolic. They lack precision and clarity, making the argument less reliable and more sensational.

**Analysis Summary:**
The argument about freezing the academic year leading to societal collapse contains several defective argument types:
- **Generalization (<G>)**: The conclusion drawn is too broad and unsupported by the evidence.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Fails to consider a variety of potential outcomes and factors.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Lacks strong causal linkage between steps in the argument.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Fails to establish a direct causal link between freezing the academic year and the predicted extreme outcomes.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Assumes universal agreement on the catastrophic impact without evidence.
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: Uses unclear and exaggerated terms to describe the consequences.
