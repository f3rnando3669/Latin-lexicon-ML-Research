For 
Certainly, applying the provided defective argument types to the given statement "The time that children are vaccinated and the time they're diagnosed do closely correlate, however, leading upset parents to assign blame to the immunizations, for lack of a better explanation." could involve multiple types, but let's analyze it systematically:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The statement seems to suggest that because the diagnosis of certain conditions for children coincides with the time they are vaccinated, vaccination is to blame. This does not consider other possible explanations for the diagnosis and hence does not enumerate all potential factors.

2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Correlation does not imply causation. The statement correlates the timing of vaccinations and diagnoses but fails to establish a causal link between the two.

3. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The term "for lack of a better explanation" is ambiguous and does not provide clarity on why other explanations have been discounted or ignored.

Thus, the statement could be categorized under multiple defective argument types:
1. <FE>: Incomplete Enumeration
2. <WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis
3. <DEP>: Ambiguous Language
