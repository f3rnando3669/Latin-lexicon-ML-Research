For 
Applying the Defective Argument Type Analysis (<IDAA>) to the statement:

"The nuthatch was discovered by Tilly Turnow in the woods, while hopping from branch to branch of an elm tree, singing happily."

we can assess different aspects to identify potential defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** 
   - The statement does not appear to broadly generalize any concepts; it focuses on a specific event involving a nuthatch and Tilly Turnow. Therefore, it doesn't represent a Generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** 
   - The statement does not enumerate examples or cases, so it does not fall under Incomplete Enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - This statement presents a factual description rather than an argument with a reason. Hence, it does not involve Inconclusive Reason.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - No causal relationship is posited in the statement. It merely describes an observation without attributing causes, so it does not have an Insufficient Causal Basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - The statement only mentions the nuthatch once, without repetitive propositions. Thus, Faulty Repetition of Proposition is not applicable here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - There is no suggestion that a consensus or opinion is being presumed or referenced. It is purely a descriptive statement.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - The term "singing happily" may be considered somewhat ambiguous, as attributing human emotions to a bird's song can lead to misinterpretation. This phrase could be seen as adding ambiguity to the language.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate defective argument type that might apply to the statement is:

**Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** The phrase "singing happily" introduces ambiguity by attributing human emotions to the bird's actions, which could lead to varying interpretations of what is actually being described.
