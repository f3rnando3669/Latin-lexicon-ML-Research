For 
It looks like you want to apply an identifier for Argument Defect Analysis to the statement: "You were late tonight. You must be cheating!"

Given the context of the definition you've provided for various defective argument types, I will suggest how each type (if applicable) might relate to the argument deficiency in the statement:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This type involves making sweeping conclusions based on limited evidence. For instance:
   - **Application**: "You were late tonight" is a single instance, and concluding from this single event that "You must be cheating!" could be considered a generalization.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This entails making a conclusion without considering all possible factors.
   - **Application**: The statement jumps to a conclusion without considering other reasons why someone might be late, such as traffic, work, or personal issues.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This reflects reasoning that does not sufficiently support the conclusion.
   - **Application**: Being late does not logically or conclusively lead to cheating, making the reason provided inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This type involves asserting a cause without sufficient evidence for a causal relationship.
   - **Application**: The argument lacks sufficient evidence that lateness is caused by cheating.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This involves repetitively asserting a proposition without substantiation.
   - **Application**: This doesn’t seem to apply here as the argument is not repetitively restating without evidence.
   
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This involves assuming that a conclusion is true because it is believed by a group or consensus without actual evidence.
   - **Application**: This doesn’t seem to fit as the argument isn’t based on presumed consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This reflects the use of ambiguous or unclear language that leads to a faulty argument.
   - **Application**: The language in the statement is quite direct and it does not seem to hinge on ambiguity.

Based on the definitions provided and the statement in question, the most applicable defective argument types would likely be:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**

Therefore, the identified defective argument types (<IDAA>) for the statement "You were late tonight. You must be cheating!" could be <FE>, <IR>, and <WCB>.
