The argument presented is as follows:

"Jimmy has a fever, sinus congestion, a cough, and can’t come to school, so he probably has a test later today."

To apply IDAA (Identify Defective Argument Types) to this argument, let's break it down:

1. **Statement & Conclusion:**
   - **Premise:** Jimmy has a fever, sinus congestion, a cough, and can’t come to school.
   - **Conclusion:** He probably has a test later today.

2. **Analysis of the Reasoning:**
   - The symptoms listed (fever, sinus congestion, a cough) are medical conditions that reasonably explain Jimmy's inability to come to school.
   - There is no direct connection stated or implied between having these symptoms and the likelihood of having a test later today.

3. **Identifying Defective Argument Types:**
   - This argument seems to portray a non sequitur, where the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.

4. **Applying the Definitions:**
   - **<G> Generalization:** Not applicable since there is no broad generalization made.
   - **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:** Not applicable as there is no incomplete list.
   - **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** Yes, Jimmy’s medical conditions do not provide a basis for a conclusion about a test.
   - **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** Yes, there is no cause-and-effect relationship between being sick and having a test.
   - **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** Not applicable as the argument doesn't repeat the proposition.
   - **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** Not applicable as there is no appeal to common consent.
   - **<DEP> Ambiguous Language:** Not applicable since the language used is clear and specific.

Therefore, the argument can be classified under two defective argument types:

- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**

In the context of your question and applied to the provided statement, the IDAA process identifies both <IR> and <WCB> as the relevant defective argument types.
