For 
Applying <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Analysis) to the argument presented in the statement:

"Brad's mother asked him why he wasn't trying out for the school play. He responded: ''Because if Tom gets the male lead, which he always does, then I'll only be in the chorus, and it's not worth being in the play if I'm only going to be in the chorus.''"

This response can be broken down to see which defective argument type it might correspond to:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument assumes that simply because Tom has always gotten the male lead in the past, he will definitely get it this time as well. This is a generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Brad does not consider other possible outcomes, such as the chance that Tom might not get the male lead or that other roles might be available apart from the male lead and chorus.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Brad's reasoning is that it is not worth participating if he is in the chorus, which may not be a strong or conclusive reason because there could be other benefits to participating in the play.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Brad assumes there’s a direct causal relationship between Tom getting the lead and the play not being worth his time, which may not have sufficient causal basis. 

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This isn't clearly applicable as there is no repetition of an unverified proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Brad’s argument isn’t built on what others think or agree upon, so this also doesn’t fit.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The argument is quite straightforward and does not rely on ambiguous language. 

Given these choices, the most fitting categories are **Generalization (G)** because of the assumption that Tom will definitely get the lead role based on past events, and **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** because Brad overlooks other potential roles and outcomes of participating in the play.

Therefore, the given argument best exemplifies the fallacies of **Generalization (G)** and **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**.
