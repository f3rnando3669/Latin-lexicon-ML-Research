For 
<IDAA> stands for Identification and Analysis of Defective Arguments. Let's apply it step-by-step to the dialogue between Steve and Ed.

**Step 1: Identify the Arguments**
- Steve’s argument: "In Sweden, college is free for citizens. How come we can't do that here?"
  - Steve is implying that the United States should consider making college free for its citizens, similar to Sweden.
- Ed’s argument: "If you like Sweden so much, move there. The USA would be glad to be rid of your liberal ass!"
  - Ed is making a personal attack and avoiding the question raised by Steve, suggesting Steve should leave the country instead of engaging with the policy issue.

**Step 2: Identify Defective Arguments Present**
1. **Steve’s Argument**
   - This seems to be a straightforward question rather than a complete argument that is defective, so no defective argument type is directly relevant to Steve's question itself.
   
2. **Ed’s Argument**
   - Ed's response contains a couple of defective argument types:
     1. **<G>: Generalization**
        - Ed generalizes Steve's stance and labels him as a “liberal,” making an overarching assumption without addressing the specific subject of tuition fees.
     2. **<FU>: Presumptuous Consensus**
        - By stating, "The USA would be glad to be rid of your liberal ass," Ed presumes that everyone in the USA would agree with his standpoint, which is a presumptuous consensus. 
     3. **<DEP>: Ambiguous Language**
        - Ed uses the aggressive and vague phrase “liberal ass” to dismiss Steve without a rational discussion, which relies on emotionally charged ambiguous language.

**Step 3: Analyze the Impact of Defective Arguments**
- **Generalization (<G>)**
  - Deflects the subject by making an unwarranted stereotype about Steve’s political views without engaging with the original argument about education policy.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
  - Misrepresents the views of others and shifts the dialogue from a policy discussion to a broader, unsupported societal generalization.
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**
  - Avoids engaging meaningfully with the argument and instead aims to shut down discussion through an inappropriate and hostile remark.

**Conclusion**
- Ed's response does not address Steve's question on a rational basis and instead leverages multiple defective arguments to avoid the issue and disparage Steve personally. This kind of response is argumentative malpractice as it does not contribute to a constructive debate about policy differences.
