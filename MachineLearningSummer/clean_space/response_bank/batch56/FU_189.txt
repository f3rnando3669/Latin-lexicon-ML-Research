For 
<IDAA>, referred to as Incomplete Defective Argument Analysis, can be applied to the argument "Everybody else is doing it, why don't you?" by identifying and categorizing the defects according to the predefined defective argument types.

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The argument assumes that because "everybody else" is doing it, it is a justified action for anyone to do it. This is a generalization because it takes the behavior of a group and applies it as a standard for individual action without consideration of individual circumstances or reasons.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The argument does not consider all possible reasons why someone might choose not to do something, nor does it enumerate potential consequences or differing contexts that might make the action inappropriate or undesirable for others.

3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The argument implies a causal relationship between "everybody else doing it" and the appropriateness or benefit of you doing it, without providing sufficient causal links or reasoning to support this relationship.

4. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - The argument presumes consensus by asserting that "everybody else" is doing it, implying that the majority's behavior validates the action without demonstrating true consensus or addressing dissenting views.

5. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - The phrase "everybody else" is ambiguous. It does not specify who "everybody else" refers to, nor the context or nature of what "doing it" entails.

By applying <IDAA>, the argument is found to be defective. Identifying these defects provides a clearer understanding of the weaknesses in the argument, demonstrating it is not sufficiently robust or logically sound.

Therefore, the analysis of "Everybody else is doing it, why don't you?" reveals multiple defective argument types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), and Ambiguous Language (<DEP>).
