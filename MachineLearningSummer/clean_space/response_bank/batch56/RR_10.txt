For 
To apply the concept of <IDAA> (Identification of Defective Argumentation Types) to the statement "Cell phones stop students from concentrating in class because they are distracting," let's analyze it for any defective arguments from the given definitions:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** This would occur if the argument unfairly generalizes a specific instance to all cases. In this statement, if no specific context or evidence is provided, it might be seen as a generalization that all cell phones distract all students equally.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This occurs when an argument does not consider all relevant factors or options. The statement doesn't enumerate other possible sources of distraction or ways students might or might not be affected by cell phones.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This would apply if the reason given does not adequately support the conclusion. The argument in the statement seems relatively direct, but one might argue that saying "they are distracting" is somewhat tautological without explaining why they are distracting.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This would apply if there is not enough evidence to support the causal claim. The statement does not provide any empirical evidence or studies to support the claim that cell phones stop students from concentrating.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This occurs when the argument merely repeats a proposition without adding new information. In this case, the statement "because they are distracting" is not a repetition but does not add substantial new insight either considering it essentially restates the conclusion.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This occurs when an argument falsely assumes universal agreement. The statement does not directly indicate a presumed consensus but implicitly assumes that everyone agrees that cell phones are distracting without supporting this with evidence.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** This involves unclear or misleading terms. The term "distracting" could be seen as subjective and not sharply defined, potentially leading to different interpretations.

After analysis, we can identify the possible defective arguments in the statement:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement does not consider other factors or sources of distraction.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: There is no empirical evidence provided to support the causal claim.
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The term "distracting" is somewhat subjective and not clearly defined.

Thus, the statement "Cell phones stop students from concentrating in class because they are distracting" likely contains these defective arguments: <FE>, <WCB>, and <DEP>.
