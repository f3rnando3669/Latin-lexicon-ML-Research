For 
<IDAA>: Identify and Diagnose Argumentative Abnormality

In the given exchange:
Person 1:
"I am for raising the minimum wage in our state."
Person 2:
"She is for raising the minimum wage, but she is not smart enough to even run a business."

Diagnosis:
This argument from Person 2 is an ad hominem attack. Instead of addressing the merits of raising the minimum wage, Person 2 attacks Person 1's intelligence and capability. This is a logical fallacy because it does not provide any substantive argument against the policy being discussed. It's an attempt to discredit Person 1 by focusing on an unrelated personal characteristic.

Hence, the identified defective argument type here can be categorized broadly under a variant of Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument provides a personal attack rather than addressing the policy argument itself, leading to an irrelevant and logically defective counterargument.

Additionally, this argument also fails to contribute any relevant or factual basis to the discussion about the minimum wage, making it an example of a defective argumentative tactic.
