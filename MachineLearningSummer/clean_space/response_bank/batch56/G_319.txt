For 
Let's apply the defined defective argument types to the assertion "People who wear glasses are smarter."

***

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument type applies because the statement makes a broad and sweeping conclusion about all people who wear glasses, based on possibly limited or anecdotal evidence. It's an overgeneralization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This argument type is relevant because the statement fails to consider all the factors that contribute to a person's intelligence. It oversimplifies by flagging only one characteristic (wearing glasses) and ignoring others.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This applies since there is no conclusive evidence or logical reasoning provided that wearing glasses directly correlates with being smarter. The argument lacks a solid foundation of proof.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The statement attempts to imply a causal relationship between wearing glasses and being smarter without sufficient causal evidence to support this link. There could be various underlying factors that are not addressed.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: If this assertion were continuously repeated without evidence, it would become a faulty repetition of the proposition. However, the original statement provided does not exhibit repetition on its own.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The statement presumes a general consensus or widely accepted fact without verifying if such a consensus actually exists. It assumes that most people believe this to be true without justification.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The term "smarter" is ambiguous and could mean different things to different people. It lacks specificity and clarity, making the argument unclear and open to multiple interpretations.

***

In conclusion, the assertion "People who wear glasses are smarter" primarily exhibits these defective argument types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), and Ambiguous Language (<DEP>).
