For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application, where we analyze and identify any defective argument types present in a given statement.

Given the statement: "If I go to the bathroom, I will miss the notes, then I'll do poorly on a test, then I won't get into college, so I won't go to the bathroom."

Let's break down and identify the defective argument types.

First, it appears to employ a chain of events that leads to an extreme conclusion. This often relates to a slippery slope argument, but as per our defined defective argument types, it might involve:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The connection between going to the bathroom and not getting into college is weak. Missing notes does not conclusively lead to performing poorly on a test, and performing poorly on a test does not conclusively lead to not getting into college. Each step in the chain of reasoning is inconclusive.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal relationship between each step is not thoroughly substantiated. The idea that missing notes for a short time could result in a cascade of dire consequences all the way to not getting into college is not sufficiently supported.

Therefore, the defective argument application would result in:

<IDAA>: The statement employs both <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis), making it a flawed or defective argument.
