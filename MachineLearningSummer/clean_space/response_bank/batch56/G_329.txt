In analyzing the given argument, we utilize the IDAA (Identify Defective Argument Application) to determine if and where any defective arguments are present. Here is the breakdown:

**Argument Analysis:**
*Premise 1:* Animal experimentation reduces our respect for life.
*Premise 2:* If we don't respect life, we are likely to be more and more tolerant of violent acts like war and murder.
*Premise 3:* Soon our society will become a battlefield in which everyone constantly fears for their lives.
*Conclusion:* We should make animal experimentation illegal right now to prevent this terrible consequence.

Let's identify the possible defective arguments present in this argument:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The argument may be seen as too broadly assuming that animal experimentation reduces respect for life for everyone without providing sufficient evidence or considering other factors.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - This argument does not consider other possible causes for the decline in respect for life or increases in violent acts, and it jumps to conclusions based purely on the practice of animal experimentation.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The causation between animal experimentation and societal collapse is not clearly established or logically sound, making the reasons presented inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The argument assumes a direct causation between animal experimentation and an increase in societal violence without adequate empirical support for such a causal relationship.

5. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - There is an implicit assumption that everyone would agree that animal experimentation directly leads to a loss of respect for life, which presumes a consensus that may not exist.

6. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - The term "respect for life" is quite ambiguous and not clearly defined. This ambiguity could make the argument weaker since it relies on an unclear concept.

Given these points, the argument indeed contains several defective elements:

**<G>:** The argument generalizes that animal experimentation will universally lead to a reduced respect for life.
**<FE>:** It does not consider other factors or causes for the loss of respect for life and increased violence.
**<IR>:** It fails to establish a conclusive reason linking the premises to the dramatic conclusion.
**<WCB>:** There is no sufficient causal basis provided that directly connects animal experimentation to societal collapse.
**<FU>:** It assumes a consensus about the negative impact of animal experimentation on respect for life.
**<DEP>:** The term "respect for life" is used ambiguously without clear definition.

In conclusion, this argument is indeed riddled with defective arguments, making it, overall, unconvincing in its current form.
