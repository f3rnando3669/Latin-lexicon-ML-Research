For 
To address the statement "You're too ugly to be class president!" with respect to defective argument types, we can analyze the nature of the argument and identify which defective argument classifications, if any, it falls under. Here's the application:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** This might apply if the argument implies that all individuals who are deemed "ugly" are unfit to be class presidents, thus making a broad and unfounded generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This applies if the statement ignores other qualities or factors necessary for being class president, such as leadership skills, intelligence, and popularity.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason provided ("ugliness") is not logically connected to the conclusion (inability to be class president). This is a classic case of a non sequitur.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Suggesting that physical appearance has a causal effect on presidential capability without any evidence to support this link falls under this defective argument type.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This may not directly apply here if the statement is made once without repetitive assertions.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This might apply if the statement is made on the presumption that it reflects a widely held, but unsubstantiated, belief.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** The term “ugly” is subjective and not clearly defined, making the argument ambiguous.

After considering these, the primary defective argument types that "You're too ugly to be class president!" likely fall under are:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The statement neglects to consider other relevant factors that contribute to someone's capability to serve as class president.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** There is no logical connection between being "ugly" and the ability to fulfill the role of class president.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The argument suggests a causal relationship without sufficient evidence.

None of the defective argument types directly corresponding to <IDAA> (which you haven't defined yet) were applicable in the provided context. If <IDAA> stands for a different argument type not listed above, please define it for a more accurate application.
