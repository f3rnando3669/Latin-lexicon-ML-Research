For 
The statement provided, "But I saw you eat a burger and fries for lunch only a few hours ago!" in response to the claim that "Eating fast food is unhealthy," can be categorized as a defective argument type. Let's apply the given types of defective arguments:

This statement seems to challenge the credibility of the person making the claim about fast food being unhealthy, rather than addressing the actual claim itself. It implies that because the person ate fast food, their argument about fast food being unhealthy is invalid. 

This kind of argument is generally referred to as a type of ad hominem fallacy, where the focus is shifted to the person instead of the argument.

However, looking at the provided defective argument types:
- <G> (Generalization)
- <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)
- <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)
- <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)
- <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)
- <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)
- <DEP> (Ambiguous Language)

The most fitting category seems to be <IR> (Inconclusive Reason): The fact that someone saw another person eat fast food does not directly address or refute the claim that eating fast food is unhealthy. The act of seeing someone eat fast food does not provide a sufficient basis to conclusively argue against the claim; it merely attempts to discredit the speaker rather than the argument.

So, we categorize it as:
**<IR> Inconclusive Reason.**
