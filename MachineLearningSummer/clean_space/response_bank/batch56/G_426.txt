For 
<IDAA> stands for identifying defective argument aspects within a given statement. When applied to "All people who live in England have bad teeth," we can identify the following defective arguments:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** The statement makes a sweeping generalization about all people who live in England based on a characteristic (bad teeth). It does not account for individual differences and lacks evidence to support such a broad claim.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The statement implies a universal trait without providing a comprehensive review of evidence or sufficient enumeration of the population. It overlooks the variability within the population of England.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The statement does not provide a reason or evidence to justify the conclusion that all people in England have bad teeth. Therefore, the reasoning behind the claim is inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The statement suggests an underlying cause (living in England) for having bad teeth without offering any causal evidence or exploring alternative explanations.

By applying <IDAA> to the statement, we have identified that it contains elements of Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, and Insufficient Causal Basis.
