For 
<IDAA> refers to the process of identifying and categorizing defective arguments. Based on the argument "Conclude that because A happens then B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L… will inevitably happen," the most appropriate classification from the provided defective argument types would be as follows:

<G> Generalization:
This argument can be categorized as a Generalization because it suggests that a single event (A) will lead to a broad and sweeping series of outcomes (B, C, D, etc.) without providing sufficient justification for such an extensive consequence chain. This is often a type of slippery slope argument, where one event is assumed to lead inevitably to a string of other events, leading to a broad generalization without sufficient evidence to support each step in the chain.

So to apply <IDAA>:

1. Argument: "Conclude that because A happens then B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L… will inevitably happen."
2. Defective Argument Type: Generalization (<G>)

Thus, the classification of the argument is:

<IDAA> <G> Generalization
