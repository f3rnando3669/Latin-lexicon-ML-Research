Certainly! To analyze the argument using the concept of **IDAA** (Identify, Define, Apply, and Assess), let's proceed through each step:

### 1. Identify

First, identify the argument and the key components:

**Argument in English:**
"If you allow one student to take an online course, soon everyone will want to, and the schools will be empty."

**Argument in Spanish:**
"Si permite que un estudiante tome un curso en línea, pronto todos querrán, y las escuelas estarán vacías."

### 2. Define

Define the reasoning behind the argument and identify potential defective arguments from the list provided:

- **Generalization (G)**: Making a broad statement based on limited evidence.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Assuming a limited list contains all possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Drawing a conclusion without sufficient evidence.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Assuming causation without sufficient basis.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Repeating a proposition as if it gives support.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assuming consensus without sufficient evidence.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Using unclear or vague terms.

### 3. Apply

Now, examine the argument for each possible defective type:

- **Generalization (G)**: The argument assumes that if one student takes an online course, then everyone will follow, which is a broad assumption.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: It overlooks alternative scenarios where only some students might prefer online courses, not all.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The statement draws a dramatic conclusion (schools will be empty) without sufficient evidence.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: It assumes a direct cause and effect relationship between allowing one student and schools becoming empty without sufficient proof.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The phrase "soon everyone will want to" is vague and lacks specificity.

### 4. Assess

Assess which defective argument types are most applicable:

- **Generalization (G)**: There is a broad and unsupported generalization that if one student is allowed to take an online course, all will follow.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument assumes a direct causal link between allowing one student to take an online course and schools becoming empty, which is not substantiated by evidence.

The argument exhibits significant weakness due to broad generalization and an unsupported causal link.

### Conclusion

This argument can be identified as exhibiting **Generalization (G)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. These defective argument types undermine the validity of the claim by making broad assumptions and lacking sufficient evidence to support the causal relationship presented.
