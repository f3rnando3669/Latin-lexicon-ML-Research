For 
The argument "John says that Kentucky will beat Florida, but John sometimes lies, so I'm not sure." can be classified as a defective argument type known as <IR> - **Inconclusive Reason**.

This argument suggests that John's occasional dishonesty casts doubt on his prediction, but it doesn't provide a solid logical basis for doubting this specific claim. The fact that someone lies *sometimes* doesn't necessarily discredit every statement they make. Therefore, the reason given (John's occasional dishonesty) is inconclusive in determining the truth of the specific claim (Kentucky will beat Florida).
