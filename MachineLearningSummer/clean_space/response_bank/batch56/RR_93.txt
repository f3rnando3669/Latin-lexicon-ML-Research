For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application.

Let's analyze the given statement to identify any defective argument types present:

"Free speech is good not just for the individual, but for all of society. After all, it's in the interest of the community that everyone should be at liberty to express his or her beliefs."

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement generalizes free speech being beneficial for all of society without providing specific examples or evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: There is no exhaustive list of reasons or examples provided to support the claim that free speech benefits society.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided for the main claim is that it's in the interest of the community, but this is not sufficiently detailed or conclusive. It assumes rather than demonstrates the benefits.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The statement does not establish a clear causal relationship between free speech and societal benefit; it assumes a beneficial outcome without detailed explanation.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The second sentence repeats the idea of free speech being in the community's interest without adding new information or reasoning.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument presumes that the community's interest in liberty is universally accepted without providing evidence that this consensus exists.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The term "good" is ambiguous and requires clarification. What constitutes "good" for society is not clearly defined.

In conclusion, the statement contains multiple defective arguments:
- <G>: Generalizes the benefit of free speech.
- <FE>: Fails to enumerate specific supporting reasons.
- <IR>: Provides an inconclusive reason for the claim.
- <WCB>: Lacks a sufficient causal basis.
- <RR>: Repeats the idea without new information.
- <FU>: Assumes a consensus without evidence.
- <DEP>: Uses ambiguous language, specifically the term “good.”
