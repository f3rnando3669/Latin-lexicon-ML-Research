For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Analysis) to the statement "I met a tall man who loved to eat cheese. Now I believe that all tall people like cheese," we must determine which defective argument types are present in the statement.

Let's break down the argument and identify any defects:

1. Generalization (<G>): The statement takes an observation about a single tall individual who likes to eat cheese and generalizes it to all tall people. This is a classic example of overgeneralization because it assumes that one case can represent an entire group without sufficient evidence.

2. Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>): The statement is based on meeting just one tall person who likes cheese. It fails to consider other tall people who may not like cheese, making the enumeration incomplete and therefore misleading.

3. Inconclusive Reason (<IR>): The conclusion drawn from the premise (that one tall man likes cheese) is inconclusive because it doesnâ€™t logically follow that all tall people must like cheese.

Based on the analysis:

- The statement primarily suffers from **Generalization (<G>)**.
- Additionally, it presents **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**.
- The reasoning is also **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** due to the lack of logical coherence between the premise and the conclusion.

Therefore, the defective argument types present in this statement are **Generalization (<G>)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**, and **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**.
