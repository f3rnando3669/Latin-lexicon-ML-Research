For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Application) to the provided conversation between David and Sam, we'll assess the defective arguments used in the discussion.

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argumentative defect involves making a broad statement based on limited evidence.
   - Not directly applicable in this case.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This occurs when not all relevant alternatives or options are considered.
   - Not directly applicable in this case.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: An argument that provides reasons that do not conclusively support the conclusion.
   - Not directly applicable in this case.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: An argument that assumes a cause without sufficient evidence.
   - Not directly applicable in this case.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Repeating a proposition without providing additional support.
   - Not directly applicable in this case.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assuming consensus without proper validation.
   - Not directly applicable in this case.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Using vague or unclear terms that lead to misunderstanding.
   - Applicable here: David's statement ("the president said 'fat people are losers'") involves **Ambiguous Language** because it misrepresents what the president actually said. The president’s statement was more nuanced and did not simply call fat people losers; rather, he condemned the act of calling fat people losers.

Summarizing the application:

- David's initial statement can be identified as using **Ambiguous Language (DEP)** because it misrepresents the president’s actual words, leading to a misunderstanding. David eliminates crucial context which changes the meaning entirely.
  
By correctly identifying the defective argument types used or not used in this conversation, we can clearly see where the logical fallacies or misrepresentations occur. In this case, <DEP> due to ambiguous language is the primary defective argument.
