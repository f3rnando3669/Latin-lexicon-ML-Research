For 
The argument "All stars are exploding balls of gas. Miley Cyrus is a star. Therefore, Miley Cyrus is an exploding ball of gas" can be analyzed for defective arguments as follows:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The term "star" is used in a general sense for celestial objects, but then it is switched to a metaphorical sense for a celebrity. This creates a false generalization.

2. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The word "star" here is ambiguous because it has multiple meanings. It can refer to a celestial body or a famous person. This ambiguous use leads to confusion and a faulty conclusion.

Applying <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Analysis):

- Premise 1: All stars are exploding balls of gas.
  - This is generally true if we are talking about celestial stars.
- Premise 2: Miley Cyrus is a star.
  - This is true if we are talking about a famous person, but not in the same context as celestial stars.

The issue arises in the conclusion that conflates the two different meanings of "star." Therefore, this argument is defective due to:

1. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The term "star" is used in two different contexts without clarifying which one applies, leading to confusion.

2. **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument assumes the general property of "star" (as in an astronomical body) applies in a different context (a celebrity), which is a false generalization.

So, the argument presented can be characterized as having defects due to <G> (Generalization) and <DEP> (Ambiguous Language).
