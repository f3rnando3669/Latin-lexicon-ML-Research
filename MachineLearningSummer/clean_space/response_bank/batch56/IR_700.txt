Sure, I'll apply <IDAA> (Identification and Diagnosis of Argumentative Aspects) to the given dialogue:

**Steve:** "In Sweden, college is free for citizens. How come we can't do that here?"

Here, Steve introduces a proposition suggesting that the United States should consider a policy similar to Sweden’s, where college education is funded by the state and free for citizens. This can be seen as invoking a cross-cultural comparison and implying a potential benefit if applied in the USA.

**Ed:** "If you like Sweden so much, move there. The USA would be glad to be rid of your liberal ass!"

Ed's response doesn't directly address Steve’s argument about free college education. Instead, it dismisses Steve's point via an ad hominem attack and offers no constructive counter-argument or engagement with the policy discussion raised by Steve.

Based on the definitions provided for defective argument types:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Ed does not address Steve's point about the feasibility of free college by considering the broader context or by listing reasons why such a policy could or could not work in the USA.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Ed gives no reason related to the topic of free college. Instead, he diverts the discussion away from the argument about educational policy.

3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This applies to arguments that present ill-supported cause-effect propositions. While Ed does not make a direct causal argument, the ending assertion “the USA would be glad to be rid of your liberal ass!” is a baseless claim about general consensus which he doesn’t support with any evidence.

4. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** Ed’s response contains terms like “liberal ass” which might carry different connotations and be understood variably by different listeners, but it is largely just an insult rather than ambiguous.

5. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Ed presumes that there is a consensus that the USA would be glad to be rid of Steve and others who think like him without presenting any evidence or polling data to justify this claim.

Overall, Ed’s argument is largely an ad hominem attack and fails to engage logically or factually with Steve’s initial point. This shows elements of multiple defective argument types, but especially **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, and **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.

The effect of this dismissive, hostile engagement is that it stifles constructive discourse and redirects the discussion into an unproductive, non-argumentative space.
