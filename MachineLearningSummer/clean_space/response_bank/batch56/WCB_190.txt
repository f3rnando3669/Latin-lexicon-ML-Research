For 
Certainly! Let's apply the labeling of defective arguments (<IDAA>) to the statement:

"Since Samantha got that new apron, she hasn't burned any cookies. That new apron sure does help her cooking!"

This statement can be analyzed and identified as an instance of <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis). Hereâ€™s why:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** means there is a lack of sufficient evidence to establish a causal relationship between two events.
- In this case, the statement assumes that the new apron is the cause of Samantha not burning any cookies. However, there are no details provided to establish that the apron is indeed responsible for the improvement in her cooking.

Therefore, the correct label for the defective argument in this statement is **<WCB>**.
