The argument can be analyzed and categorized as follows:

- **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>**: The argument indicates that all surveyed customers agreed with the idea of staying open for 24 hours. However, this enumeration is incomplete because it only considers the customers present in the store at a given time and not the entire customer base or potential future customers who might have other opinions.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>**: The conclusion that the store should put together a 24-hour schedule based on the survey of current customers suggests a causal relationship between customer approval and business success. This relationship might be insufficiently supported, as other factors such as operational costs, employee availability, and overall market demand need to be considered.

Therefore, the argument "We surveyed all the customers in the store and they all agreed that staying open 24 hours would be a great idea. We need to put together a 24-hour schedule as soon as possible." can be tagged with the defective argument types <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
