For 
<IDAA> stands for the Identification of Defective Argumentation Application, where the argument is scrutinized for various recognized defects.

Let's apply <IDAA> to the statement: "There must be objective rights and wrongs in the universe. If not, how can you possibly say that torturing babies for fun could ever be right?"

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - This argument involves a broad generalization about the existence of objective rights and wrongs based on a single, extreme example (torturing babies for fun). It improperly extends the conclusion from a specific scenario to a universal principle.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - The argument assumes that the only alternative to objective moral standards is the acceptance of torturing babies for fun. It fails to consider a range of other possibilities like subjective morality or cultural relativism.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The reasoning provided does not conclusively prove the existence of objective rights and wrongs. The emotional appeal to an extreme case is an attempt to bypass a more rigorous philosophical discussion about morality.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - The argument does not provide a sufficient causal link between the existence of objective rights and wrongs and the rejection of torturing babies for fun. It assumes a causal relationship without adequate justification.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - The statement does not explicitly repeat a proposition faultily, so this defect does not seem to apply here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - The argument assumes a consensus that torturing babies for fun is wrong and uses this assumed consensus to support its claim. It presupposes that this widespread agreement underpins the existence of objective moral standards.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - Terms like "objective rights and wrongs" are not clearly defined, leading to potential ambiguity. The argument operates under the assumption that the readers and the author share the same understanding of these terms.

By analyzing the statement with the <IDAA> framework, we can identify that the argument suffers from defects such as Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Presumptuous Consensus, and Ambiguous Language. Each of these defects highlights the flawed reasoning and assumptions within the argument.
