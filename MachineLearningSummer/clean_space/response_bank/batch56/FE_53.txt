For 
The argument "You are either with me or against me!" is an example of the False Dichotomy fallacy.

Applying the defined defective argument types <IDAA> to this example:

- **Generalization (G)**: This argument does not necessarily represent a generalization where broad conclusions are drawn from specific instances.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument presents an incomplete consideration of all available options, forcing a binary choice, fitting this defective argument type well.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument doesn't provide conclusive reasoning for why there are only two possible stances, which touches on this fallacy.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument doesn’t hinge on causal relationships, so this doesn’t apply here.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: There isn’t a repeated proposition here, so this type doesn't apply.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There's no presumption of agreement by the collective here, so this doesn’t apply.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language in this argument isn't ambiguous; it's just overly simplistic.

Thus, among the defective argument types listed, "You are either with me or against me!" is primarily an example of **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, as it offers a limited and binary perspective without considering additional possibilities.
