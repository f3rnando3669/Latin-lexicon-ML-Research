For 
The situation described involves Lindsay's mom expressing a concern that escalates dramatically from skipping a single class to a series of severe consequences (dropping out of school, never graduating, not getting into college, ending up unemployed and living at home for the rest of her life). The type of fallacy exhibited here is a slippery slope argument.

However, based on the defined defective argument types provided:
- Generalization (<G>)
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
- Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
- Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)

The closest match to the fallacy committed by Lindsay's mom would be:

**Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This fallacy type occurs when a conclusion is drawn about causation based on weak or insufficient evidence. Lindsay's mom is attributing a series of severe consequences to the act of skipping one class without sufficient causal evidence to support such a chain of events.

So, the type of fallacy Lindsay's mom has committed is <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis.
