For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Attributes. Let's analyze the argument "I canâ€™t take home a B in this course. My parents will be angry with me." by identifying the defective argument types:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This argument assumes that anger from parents is the only possible consequence of getting a B in the course, neglecting other potential outcomes or considerations, such as understanding the material better or maintaining academic integrity.

2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument suggests a direct causal link between receiving a B and parental anger without providing sufficient evidence that this outcome is inevitable or even the most likely.

After applying <IDAA>, we identify the defective argument types as follows:
- <FE>: Incomplete Enumeration
- <WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis
