To apply the defective argument types to the provided dialogue, we need to identify how each statement might be flawed or problematic according to the defined categories. The dialogue consists of two parts:

1. "Of course I can read Spanish! Look, I just finished this book by Jorge Luis Borges!"
2. "You lie! Borges isn't Spanish. He's from Argentina."

Let's analyze each segment:

### Part 1: "Of course I can read Spanish! Look, I just finished this book by Jorge Luis Borges!"

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The speaker is making a generalization that finishing a book by Jorge Luis Borges is sufficient proof of their ability to read Spanish. This doesn't account for nuances such as the reader's level of comprehension or whether they used tools like translations or dictionaries.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The argument assumes that reading a single book represents the ability to read Spanish. This is not comprehensive as it does not consider other factors like understanding, speed, or proficiency across different texts.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The justification provided (finishing a book by Borges) is inconclusive as reading one book does not conclusively prove proficiency in Spanish.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - There is a causal assumption that because they read Borges, they can read Spanish generally. This leap is unwarranted without more evidence that ties the specific instance to the general skill.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - There is no repetition here, so this defective argument type does not apply directly.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - The speaker might be presuming that finishing a book by Borges is universally accepted as evidence of reading Spanish, which is not necessarily the case.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - The term "finished this book" can be ambiguous. It may not clearly convey whether they comprehended it or simply completed reading words on the pages.

### Part 2: "You lie! Borges isn't Spanish. He's from Argentina."

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The respondent makes an implicit generalization that if Borges isn't Spanish, the original speaker cannot use his books to prove they can read Spanish. This ignores the fact that Borges wrote in Spanish, the language being discussed.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - This statement overlooks the fact that language proficiency is about reading the language itself (Spanish), not necessarily the nationality of the author.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The argument that Borges's nationality (Argentinian) refutes the claim about reading Spanish is inconclusive. It doesn't logically follow since the language of the book is what matters.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The causal relationship between Borges's nationality and the claimant's ability to read Spanish is unsupported. Just because Borges is Argentinian does not mean his works aren’t written in Spanish.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - No repetition is present in this response, so this does not apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - The statement presumes that everyone would agree that the author’s nationality is intrinsically tied to the original argument about language proficiency, which is presumptive and not a consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - The phrase "You lie!" is strong and accusative, but it's not ambiguous. However, the assertion might stem from a misunderstanding of the context of 'Spanish' referring to the language, not the nationality. The misinterpretation might be tied to an ambiguous understanding but is not strictly a case of ambiguous language.

Overall, both parts of the dialogue exhibit several defective argument types which undermine the strength and clarity of the arguments being made. Identifying and understanding these defective arguments can help clarify the actual points and assess the validity of the claims.
