In order to apply the defective argument analysis <IDAA> to the statement "This new test seemed so promising, but the 3 studies that supported its validity turned out to have critical methodological flaws, so the test is probably not valid," we need to identify if any of the defined defective argument types apply.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This applies when making broad generalizations based on insufficient evidence. In the given statement, the judgment on the validity of the test is based on only three studies. If these three studies are not representative of the wider body of evidence, it could be seen as a Generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This involves making a conclusion based on an incomplete or non-exhaustive list of instances. The statement only considers three studies and does not account for any other potential studies that might support the validity of the test. This could be seen as Incomplete Enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This occurs when the reasons given do not sufficiently support the conclusion. The statement implies that because the three studies had flaws, the test is probably not valid. However, there may be other valid studies or other evidence supporting the test which have not been considered.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This involves asserting a causal relationship based on insufficient evidence. The statement does not directly claim a causal relationship but suggests a likelihood ("probably not valid") without sufficient basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This involves repeating a proposition without adequate substantiating evidence. The statement does not seem to repeat any proposition, so this does not seem to apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This involves assuming a consensus or agreement that may not exist. The statement does not imply a consensus about the test's validity, so this does not seem to apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This involves using ambiguous language to make an argument. The statement is quite clear in its contention and does not seem to rely on ambiguity for its reasoning.

### Analysis
The argument provided can be dissected as follows:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: The conclusion about the test's validity is based on just three studies, which may not properly represent the full body of evidence.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Only considering three studies without mentioning the wider context or any other possible studies indicates a potential incomplete enumeration.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Assuming the test is probably not valid solely on the basis of three flawed studies may not be a strong enough reason, especially if there could be other studies or evidence out there.

Given these considerations, the statement seems to primarily exhibit traits of:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: It only discusses three studies, which suggests it may not be adequately considering the full range of evidence.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The conclusion drawn about the test's validity is based on evidence that might be insufficient to definitively support that conclusion.

Thus, the defective argument analysis labels <FE> and <IR> are most relevant to the statement provided.
