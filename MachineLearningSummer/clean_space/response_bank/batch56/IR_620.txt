For 
The term IDAA is not provided in the definitions above. However, if we consider IDAA to refer to "Identify Defective Argument Type Applying Argumentation," we can analyze the given sentence for potential logical fallacies or defective argument types.

The sentence provided—"This is an example of what logic fallacy?"—is a question rather than an argument. Therefore, it doesn't inherently fit into any of the defective argument categories (Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Presumptuous Consensus, Ambiguous Language).

However, if we were to consider a more complete argument or context in which this question is asked and analyze for potential defective argument types, we might find that none of the predefined types apply directly to a single question. Instead, it could potentially lead to ambiguous language (<DEP>) if the context of the fallacy is not well-defined or clearly understood.

For example:
- "Everyone in our study believes this, so it must be true. What type of logic fallacy is this?" could be categorized under <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration).
- "All politicians are corrupt because I've seen a few documentaries about it. What kind of fallacy is this?" could be categorized under <G> (Generalization).
- "We have never found evidence against it, so it must be true. What fallacy is that?" could be categorized under <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).

Given the sentence alone as it stands, without additional context or argument, it doesn’t constitute a logical fallacy on its own.
