For 
<IDAA>: Identify Defective Argument Types in the Argument

In the given scenario, we have the following conversation:

**Bill:** "I think that some people have psychic powers."  
**Jill:** "What is your proof?"  
**Bill:** "No one has been able to prove that people do not have psychic powers."

Let's analyze Bill's reasoning:

1. **Fallacious Reasoning**: The basic premise of Bill's argument is that because it has not been disproven that people have psychic powers, it must therefore be true that some people have psychic powers. This is a type of defective argument that relies on the absence of disproof as a form of proof, which is not logically valid.

2. **Defective Argument Types**:
    - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Bill's argument provides an inconclusive reason for his claim. The lack of evidence against psychic powers does not constitute evidence for their existence.

Thus, the argument contains the defective argument type:
- **<IR>: Inconclusive Reason**

Therefore, the identified defective argument type in Bill's argument is:
<IDAA: <IR>>
