The argument provided can be analyzed as follows:

"I guess I should buy my 12 year old daughter an iPhone. Everyone at her school has one, and I want her to fit in with the other kids."

This argument suggests that the decision to buy an iPhone is based primarily on the fact that others already have one, with the underlying goal of social integration. Applying the defective argument types defined:

1. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This argument assumes that because "everyone" at the school has an iPhone, it is necessary or correct to follow suit. The generalization that "everyone" has an iPhone is likely exaggerated and unverified, and it presumes a collective consensus that may not actually exist or be justified.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument overlooks other potential considerations, such as financial implications, the child's actual need for an iPhone, the potential downsides of smartphone use at a young age, or alternatives that could also help the child fit in without the financial and social burdens of an iPhone.

By identifying these defective argument types, we see that the reasoning behind the decision is weak because it both presumes an unverified consensus and fails to comprehensively consider other relevant factors.
