The argument regarding the University of Virginia professor Charlotte Patterson and her study on the offspring of gays can be analyzed for defective argument types.

Firstly, let's break down the components of the argument:

1. Professor Charlotte Patterson is a leading researcher in the field.
2. She reviewed 22 studies involving offspring of gays, ranging from toddlers to adults.
3. She found none convincing that the children had suffered or were more than normally inclined to be gay.
4. Conservatives discredit Patterson by pointing out that she is an acknowledged lesbian with a presumed ideological interest in the subject she studies.

Now, apply the principles of defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - There is no evident generalization fallacy directly based on the information provided. The critique focuses on Patterson's alleged bias rather than making broad generalizations.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - This might apply if Patterson's studies are assumed to represent the entire body of research on the subject. However, it isn't explicitly stated that these 22 studies are the only pertinent studies available.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The argument that because Patterson is a lesbian, her research findings are automatically suspect doesn't provide a definitive reason why her findings should be discredited. This is an ad hominem fallacy and can be categorized under inconclusive reasoning.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - This would apply if the argument tried to draw conclusions about causation without sufficient evidence. However, the main issue here is with credibility, not causality.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - There's no repetition of the proposition identified in this specific argument.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - There is an implied bid to discredit the consensus that Patterson's research could potentially form. This is based on presumed ideological bias which can also veer into ad hominem rather than genuinely questioning the research consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - Thereâ€™s no ambiguity in the language used here; the argument's language is quite clear in its intent to discredit based on personal characteristics.

Summing up, the primary defective argument type exhibited in the conservatives' attempt to discredit Patterson is **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. They rely on her sexual orientation and presumed ideological interest to question her credibility, which is not a sufficient or valid basis to refute her research findings.

Thus, the application of defective argument types identifies that the main issue in the example provided is: 

IDAA: **<IR>**
