Certainly! To analyze the argument "Annie must like Starbucks because all girls like Starbucks." using <IDAA> with the given defective argument types, we can break down the argument as follows:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument makes a sweeping generalization about all girls liking Starbucks. This type of reasoning is faulty because it assumes that what might be true for some girls is true for all, without evidence.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument fails to consider exceptions or variations among individuals. Not all girls necessarily like Starbucks, and the argument does not account for this possibility. 

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasoning provided is weak and insufficient to definitively conclude that Annie likes Starbucks. The premise that "all girls like Starbucks" is itself not conclusively proven, rendering the conclusion about Annie uncertain.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The statement assumes a causal relationship between being a girl and liking Starbucks without a supporting basis. There is no sufficient causal connection presented to justify why being a girl would cause someone to like Starbucks.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This argument doesn't repetitively assert the same proposition, so <RR> does not apply in this case.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument may implicitly rely on the presumption that there is a consensus (i.e., a common belief) that all girls like Starbucks, without evidence to support that such a consensus exists or is valid.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The argument does not appear to suffer from ambiguous language issues. The terms used ("Annie," "must like," "Starbucks," "all girls") are relatively clear in this context.

In summary, the primary defective argument types applicable here are **Generalization (<G>)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**, **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**, and **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**.
