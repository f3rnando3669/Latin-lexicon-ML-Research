For 
To apply the definitions to the phrase "It is an example of," we'd typically look at how the phrase is used in context to determine if it embodies any of the defective argument types. Since no specific context is provided, I'll create illustrative examples for each defective argument type.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   "It is an example of how all teenagers are irresponsible."
   - Here, one instance is used to incorrectly generalize about all teenagers.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   "It is an example of the few times we've succeeded, proving our methods are flawless."
   - This overlooks other counterexamples or failures, thus providing an incomplete enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   "It is an example of how something can happen, therefore it will always happen."
   - The reasoning is inconclusive because just knowing that something can happen doesn't guarantee it always will.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   "It is an example of why people are tired because they drank coffee in the afternoon."
   - This suggests a causal relationship without sufficient evidence to support that drinking coffee is the primary reason for being tired.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   "It is an example of why running is the best exercise because so many people say running is the best exercise."
   - This relies on repetitive assertion rather than providing new supporting evidence.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   "It is an example of why everyone knows that global warming is a hoax."
   - This presumes a consensus without providing proof that everyone agrees or without acknowledging the many who disagree.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   "It is an example of the freedom we offer our employees." 
   - The term "freedom" is ambiguous and could be interpreted in various ways, such as freedom in work hours, dress code, or decision making.

In each case, the phrase "It is an example of" is used to illustrate a defect in the argument based on the type defined.
