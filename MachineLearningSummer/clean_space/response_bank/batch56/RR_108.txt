In the context of identifying defective arguments, the statement "Global warming doesn’t exist because the earth is not getting warmer" can be critiqued using the following defective argument types:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The statement takes the observation that the earth is not getting warmer (which itself could be an unfounded assertion) as a conclusive reason to deny global warming. This is an inconclusive reason because the phenomenon of global warming involves complex climatic changes over time, and short-term observations are not sufficient to draw such a broad conclusion.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The statement reduces a complex issue (global warming) to a single factor (earth getting warmer) without considering other evidence or factors that contribute to the understanding of global warming, such as rising ocean temperatures, shrinking ice sheets, or increasing frequency of extreme weather events. It thus fails to enumerate all relevant factors.

3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - The statement implicitly assumes a direct causal relationship between the lack of warming (which is not substantiated) and the non-existence of global warming. This assertion overlooks the nuanced nature of climate science, where various factors and data points are taken into account to understand global warming.

To apply the concept of **Identifying Defective Arguments and Analysis (<IDAA>)** to this statement:
- **Identify the argument**: "Global warming doesn’t exist because the earth is not getting warmer."
- **Classify the Defective Argument Types**:
  - <IR> - Inconclusive Reason.
  - <FE> - Incomplete Enumeration.
  - <WCB> - Insufficient Causal Basis.
- **Analyze the Defects**: 
  - The argument is based on an oversimplification (IR) and ignores a vast array of data and contributing factors (FE).
  - It presumes a direct causal relationship without supporting evidence (WCB).

By breaking down the argument in this way, we can see that it suffers from multiple defective arguments, making it weak and unconvincing.
