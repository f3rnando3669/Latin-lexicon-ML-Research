For 
<IDAA> stands for "Identify Defective Argument Attributes." Here, we will identify the various defective argument types present in the given statement:

"I want to have myself a merry little Christmas, but I refuse to do as the song suggests and make the yuletide gay. I don't think sexual preference should have anything to do with enjoying the holiday."

1. **Ambiguous Language <DEP>**: The word "gay" in the context of the song traditionally means "happy" or "joyful," but it is also colloquially used to refer to sexual orientation. The argument exploits this ambiguity to create confusion, which leads to a misunderstanding of the song's message.

2. **Generalization <G>**: The speaker generalizes the meaning of the word "gay" solely to sexual preference without considering its broader or historical usage as meaning "joyful" or "merry."

Identifying these defective argument types helps to clarify the misunderstandings and fallacies present in the given statement.
