For 
Applying <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Application) to the given statement:

"A rainbow appeared in the sky the day before basketball tryouts, and I made the team! If there's a rainbow when I try out in the spring, I'm sure I'll make the team again."

- <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis): This argument relies on a presumed causal relationship between the appearance of a rainbow and the success in making the basketball team. There's no logical or empirical basis provided to support the idea that the rainbow caused or influenced the tryout outcome.

- <IR> (Inconclusive Reason): The reasoning provided is incomplete and does not sufficiently support the conclusion. The presence of a rainbow and making the team could be entirely coincidental, and no additional reasoning is given to substantiate the claim.

Thus, the statement contains at least these two defective argument types:
1. <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)
2. <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)
