The argument falls into the defective argument type called Irrelevant Deduction Affecting Acceptability (IDAA). This type of argument involves premises that, even if true, do not logically support the conclusion.

Let's break down the statement: "They cannot take her to jail even if she did rob the bank and take millions of pesosâ€¦ She is already too old and weak to be locked up."

The argument's premise is that the person in question is "too old and weak to be locked up." The conclusion drawn from this premise is that they "cannot take her to jail" even if she did commit the crime of robbing the bank and taking millions of pesos.

However, the age and physical condition of the person do not logically negate the legal obligation or capacity to take someone to jail for committing a crime. The criminal justice system frequently figures out ways to accommodate people with physical limitations. Therefore, the condition of being old and weak is irrelevant to the conclusion that she cannot be jailed if guilty of the crime. 

In essence, the strong emphasis on the age and physical condition distracts from the fact that the person has, by admission, committed a serious crime, which typically warrants imprisonment regardless of the physical condition of the perpetrator. Thus, the argument is defective due to the inclusion of irrelevant premises affecting the acceptability of the conclusion.
