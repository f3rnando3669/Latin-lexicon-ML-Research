The argument provided can be broken down as follows:

"I am a great leader because I make great leadership decisions. The proof that I make great leadership decisions is that I am a great leader, and that's what leaders do."

This argument type can be identified as a defective argument by the repetitions and lack of external substantiation. The statement is essentially using itself as the only proof for both claims.

Applying the taxonomy of defective argument types provided, this falls under the category of:

**<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**

This is because the argument is circular; it repeats the proposition without adding any new evidence or reasoning outside of the assertion itself. It relies on repetition to imply validity but fails to introduce independent verification for the claims it makes.
