For 
The argument given is:

"If we allow students to have cell phones, it will lead to chaos in the classroom. If we have chaos in the classroom, the students will fail to learn. If they fail to learn, their lives will be ruined forever!"

To apply <IDAA> (Identification and Definition of Argumentative Anomalies), we need to identify the types of defective arguments present in the statement:

1. **Slippery Slope Fallacy**: The argument assumes a chain reaction of events leading to a dire outcome without sufficient evidence that such a progression is inevitable. This is related to an insufficient causal basis.
   - **Type**: WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)

2. **Generalization**: The argument makes a broad and unfounded generalization about the impact of chaos on all students' learning and the ultimate consequence of their lives being ruined.
   - **Type**: G (Generalization)

3. **Inconclusive Reason**: The argument's assumptions about how cell phones in classrooms inevitably lead to chaos and then to life-long ruination are not sufficiently supported by evidence or logical reasoning.
   - **Type**: IR (Inconclusive Reason)

4. **Fear Mongering**: The argument uses fear to drive its point across by suggesting that students' lives will be ruined forever without concrete evidence.
   - Although not one of the types defined in the prompt, it's worth noting as a common argumentative flaw.

So, we can classify the argument as containing the following defective argument types:

**WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The assumption that allowing cell phones will inevitably lead to chaos and then to irreversible life-long consequences lacks a sufficient causal basis.

**G (Generalization)**: It makes broad generalizations about classroom chaos leading to learning failure and life ruination for all students.

**IR (Inconclusive Reason)**: The reasoning is not conclusive and lacks concrete evidence to support the extreme consequences claimed.
