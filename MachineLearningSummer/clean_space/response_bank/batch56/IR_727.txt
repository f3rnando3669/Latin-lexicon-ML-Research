For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application. Applying <IDAA> to the statement "Are you one of those stupid religious people that reject science?" involves analyzing and identifying which types of defective arguments are present in the statement. Let's break it down:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - **Definition**: Leaping from specific instances to a broad conclusion without sufficient evidence.
   - **Application**: The phrase "stupid religious people that reject science" generalizes all religious people as being stupid and science-rejecting, which is an overgeneralization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - **Definition**: Presenting a limited set of options or instances as if they are the only ones available.
   - **Application**: This particular statement does not explicitly enumerate options, so this defective argument type might not apply here.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - **Definition**: Presenting reasons that do not sufficiently support the conclusion.
   - **Application**: The statement implies that being religious equates to rejecting science without providing solid reasoning or evidence to support this correlation.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - **Definition**: Claiming a cause-and-effect relationship without enough evidence.
   - **Application**: The statement suggests that being religious is the cause of rejecting science, without providing adequate evidence to establish this causal relationship.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - **Definition**: Repeating the same proposition in different words without adding any new evidence or reasoning.
   - **Application**: This argument type is not explicitly present in the one-liner statement.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - **Definition**: Assuming that a belief or opinion is unanimously held without evidence.
   - **Application**: The statement presumes a consensus that religious people reject science, without evidence to back up this presumption.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - **Definition**: Using vague or ambiguous terms that can be interpreted in different ways.
   - **Application**: The term "stupid" is subjective and pejorative, creating ambiguity and undermining a clear, logical argument.

In summary, the statement "Are you one of those stupid religious people that reject science?" can be seen as having the following defective argument types:
- **Generalization (G)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**
