The argument in the statement "I guess I should buy my 12-year-old daughter an iPhone. Everyone at her new school has one and I want her to fit in with the other kids." exhibits a defective argument type known as **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**.

Explanation: This argument assumes that because "everyone" at her new school has an iPhone, it is necessary or beneficial to buy one for the speaker's daughter to ensure she fits in. The fallacy here is assuming a consensus (that everyone has an iPhone) justifies the decision, without considering if this consensus is accurate, necessary, or if it aligns with other factors such as individual needs, financial constraints, or values.

Additionally, it can be argued there is a component of **Generalization (<G>)** because the argument relies on the unstated premise that having an iPhone is necessary for fitting in; it generalizes that what is true for some or even many students at the school must be true for all.
