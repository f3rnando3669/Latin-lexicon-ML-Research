For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Approach, which involves analyzing an argument to identify potential logical fallacies or weaknesses.

Let's apply <IDAA> to the statement: "President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up. Jones is responsible for the rise in crime."

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This argument assumes a causal relationship between two events (taxes being raised and the rise in violent crime) without sufficient evidence. Just because one event follows another does not mean that the first event caused the second.

2. **Generalization (G)**: The argument might also be seen as a type of generalization if it implies that any instance of raising taxes will result in an increase in violent crime. This conclusion is too broad and not sufficiently supported by specific evidence.

To summarize, the primary defective argument type identified in this statement is:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument lacks sufficient evidence to establish a direct causal link between raising taxes and the increase in violent crime.
