The term <IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument and Applying Annotations. Let's identify and annotate the defective arguments in the statement:

**Statement:** "Lebron James, one of the most decorated basketball players of all time, says you need to eat breakfast so you need to eat breakfast."

Upon analysis, this statement primarily relies on an appeal to authority without providing substantive reasoning or evidence on why one should eat breakfast, which suggests that it has a defective argument type. In this case, the statement can be seen as attempting to use Lebron James's authority in basketball to validate a claim outside his domain of expertise. This is commonly known as an appeal to authority fallacy. Additionally, the assertion simply repeats the proposition without providing any additional reasoning.

Given the definitions provided, here's the defective argument annotation for the statement:

**Annotation:** [<RR>] - Faulty Repetition of Proposition

**Explanation:** The statement ends with a restatement of the initial claim ("you need to eat breakfast") without providing additional reasoning or evidence. Thus, it repeats the proposition rather than justifying it through logical argumentation.

We could also consider:

**Annotation:** [<FU>] - Presumptuous Consensus

**Explanation:** It presumes consensus based solely on Lebron James's endorsement, which is outside his domain of expertise regarding nutrition.

By applying <IDAA>, we annotate the statement primarily with [<RR>], noting that it duplicates the proposition without substantiation, and potentially [<FU>] if we consider the reliance on authority as attempting to create a presumptuous consensus.
