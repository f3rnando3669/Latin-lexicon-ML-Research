For 
The argument provided can be broken down into the following structure:

1. The priest told me I should have faith.
2. I have faith that my son will do well in school this year.
3. Therefore, the priest should be happy with me.

Applying the defective argument types defined earlier, we need to identify any logical flaws in the argument. It appears to contain multiple possible defects. Here are the prominent ones:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - Just because you have faith, it doesn't necessarily follow that the priest should be happy with you. The term "faith" is used in two different contexts without explicitly linking them in a meaningful way. The priest's definition of "faith" might be more specific and not related to your son's performance.

2. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - The term "faith" is ambiguous in this context. In the first premise, "faith" likely refers to religious or spiritual faith as advised by the priest. In the second premise, "faith" refers to confidence in your son's academic abilities. The argument conflates these two different meanings of "faith".

Combining these insights, the argument exhibits defects under both <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <DEP> (Ambiguous Language).

Hence, the application of <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Application) results in identifying the fallacies as:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**

These issues undermine the validity of the conclusion that the priest should be happy based on the given premises.
