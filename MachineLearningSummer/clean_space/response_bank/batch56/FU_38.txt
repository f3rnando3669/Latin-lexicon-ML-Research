For 
The argument provided contains a logical fallacy, and it can be identified using the defined defective argument types. Let's analyze the reasoning presented in the argument:

"Everyone is selfish; everyone is doing what he believes will make himself happier. The recognition of that can take most of the sting out of accusations that you're being 'selfish.' Why should you feel guilty for seeking your own happiness when that's what everyone else is doing, too?"

This argument makes a sweeping claim about human behavior ("Everyone is selfish") based on a presumption without providing substantial evidence. It generalizes the behavior of all individuals from this unsubstantiated claim.

Let's apply the definitions provided:

- **Generalization (<G>):** The argument makes a broad assertion that everyone is selfish without sufficient evidence to support such a universal claim. It assumes this behavior applies universally based on a limited or anecdotal observation.

Therefore, the logical fallacy present in the argument is **Generalization (<G>)**.
