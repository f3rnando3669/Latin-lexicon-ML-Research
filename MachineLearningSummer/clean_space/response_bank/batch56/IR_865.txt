For 
The argument provided is:

"Bill claims that tax breaks for corporations increases development. Of course, Bill is the CEO of a corporation."

To apply <IDAA> (which seems to stand for the identification of a defective argument type) to this statement, we need to identify the specific defective argument type present in the argument.

This statement seems to imply that Bill's claim about tax breaks is suspect or untrustworthy solely because of his position as the CEO of a corporation. This type of reasoning is commonly known as an ad hominem fallacy, where the argument attacks the person making the claim rather than addressing the claim itself.

Given our defined defective argument types, none specifically mention an ad hominem attack. However, the closest match might be <IR>—Inconclusive Reason. This is because the reasoning provided (Bill’s position as a CEO) does not conclusively address the validity of the claim about tax breaks increasing development.

Therefore, the argument can be identified as:

<IDAA>: The argument can be classified under <IR> - Inconclusive Reason, as the provided reasoning (Bill's role as a CEO) does not truly engage with the actual argument about the impact of tax breaks on development.
