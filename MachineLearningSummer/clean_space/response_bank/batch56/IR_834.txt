For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying a Defective Argument According to Argument type.

In the given statement: "Nicole identified that Hannah had committed a logical fallacy, but instead of addressing the substance of her claim, Hannah accused Nicole of committing a fallacy earlier on in the conversation."

This situation describes a classic example of the "Tu Quoque" fallacy, which is when someone attempts to discredit their opponent’s argument by asserting their opponent’s failure to act consistently with its conclusion.

We can apply the IDAA as follows:

1. **Identify that a defective argument is being used**: Hannah is engaging in a logical fallacy.
2. **Determine the nature of the defect**: The defect here is that, instead of addressing Nicole's identification of a fallacy, Hannah deflects by pointing out an earlier fallacy committed by Nicole, which does not address the current argument's substance.

This type of response does not fall under any of the predefined defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>). Therefore, while we can identify it as a fallacious argument (Tu Quoque), it does not fit one of the predefined defective argument types provided.
