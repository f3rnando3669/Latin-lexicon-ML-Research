The argument provided can be evaluated for defective argument types using the definitions you've listed. The statement, "If we let the government implant tracking devices in criminals, it's not going to stop there! They're going to want to track school children and eventually everyone!" appears to suggest a slippery slope without providing sufficient evidence that one event will inevitably lead to the other extreme events described.

This can be classified under <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), which indicates that the argument is drawing a conclusion that is not sufficiently supported by the premises. In this case, there's a lack of direct causal evidence or a logical basis to convincingly argue that allowing tracking devices in criminals will necessarily lead to tracking school children and eventually everyone.

So, the argument can be tagged as:
- <IR> (Inconclusive Reason): The claim lacks sufficient logical connection and evidence to show that tracking criminals will lead to the tracking of school children and eventually everyone else.
