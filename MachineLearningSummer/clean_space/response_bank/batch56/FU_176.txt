For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Attributes. This process involves analyzing the statement to identify any defective argument types present. Let's apply <IDAA> to the statement: "Everyone is going to get the new smartphone when it comes out this weekend. Why arenâ€™t you?"

1. **Generalization (G)**: The statement makes a broad claim that "everyone" will get the new smartphone, which is likely not true. This kind of absolute statement is a generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement does not provide any evidence or data to support the claim that "everyone" will get the smartphone. It fails to enumerate or consider those who might not be interested, those who can't afford it, or those who are simply not aware of it.

3. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The statement assumes a consensus that "everyone" will get the smartphone, without verifying if such a consensus actually exists. It presumes that social pressure or the opinions of others are enough to convince someone to follow along.

Therefore, the defective argument types present in this statement would be <G>, <FE>, and <FU>.
