For 
<IDAA> stands for the defective argument type known as Irrelevant Distraction from Actual Argument.

Let's apply it to the given statement:

**Statement**: "Mom, I know you're upset that I went over my cell limit this month. The important issue here, though, is that I got an A on my algebra exam."

**Analysis**:

This statement utilizes <IDAA> by diverting attention away from the main issue of having exceeded the cell limit and introducing an unrelated, though positive, achievement (getting an A on an algebra exam). The new information does not address or resolve the original concern about the cell usage limit, but rather attempts to distract from it by bringing up a different subject entirely.

So, applying <IDAA> to the statement highlights how the argument shifts focus away from the actual issue to something irrelevant, albeit positive.
