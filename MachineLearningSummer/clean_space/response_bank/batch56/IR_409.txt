Applying the Identifying Defective Argument Types Analysis (IDAA) to the argument "To this very day (at the time of this writing), science has been unable to create life from non-life; therefore, life must be a result of divine intervention," we can break down and identify the potential defective argument types present.

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - The argument assumes that because science has not yet created life from non-life, the only possible explanation is divine intervention. This disregards other possible explanations or future scientific developments in the field of abiogenesis.
  
2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The evidence provided (science has been unable to create life) is insufficient to conclusively support the conclusion (life must be a result of divine intervention). Just because something has not been achieved by science yet does not logically lead to the conclusion of divine intervention.
  
3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - The argument implies a causal relationship between the current limitations of scientific capabilities and the necessity of divine intervention without sufficient evidence to establish this causal link. The inability of science to create life from non-life does not necessarily imply divine causation.
  
Therefore, the given argument can be identified with the following defective argument types:
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**

These classifications help to reveal the weaknesses in the argument's logic and provide a clearer understanding of where it fails to make a robust case.
