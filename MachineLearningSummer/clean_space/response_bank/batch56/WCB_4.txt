Applying the definitions of defective argument types provided:

The argument in the statement "Red had come up six times in a row on the roulette wheel, so Greg knew that it was close to certain that black would be next up" is an example of a specific type of defective reasoning. This fallacy is known as the **Gambler's Fallacy**. The argument assumes that past events (having six reds in a row) affect the likelihood of future independent events (the next result on the roulette wheel), which is incorrect because each spin is an independent event with an equal probability of landing on black or red.

In terms of categorizing this defective argument using the given definitions:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This fits because there is no causal basis for past events (previous outcomes of red) to affect future independent events (next spin). Each spin of the roulette wheel is independent of the previous spins.

So, the labeled defective argument type for this statement would be:

**Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
