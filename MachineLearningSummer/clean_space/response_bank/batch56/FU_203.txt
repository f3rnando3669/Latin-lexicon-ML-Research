For 
<IDAA> stands for Identify Defective Argument Application. Applying <IDAA> to the given statement:

"In the court trial deliberations, Juror Seven says, 'There are still eleven of us who think he's guilty. You're alone.' His attempt to use numbers to persuade Eight is:"

The statement appears to be attempting to use the consensus of the majority (eleven jurors) to convince the minority (one juror) of the defendant's guilt.
