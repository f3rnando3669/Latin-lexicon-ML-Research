For 
Applying the method <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Attributes) to the statement "The reason our company never makes any money is because we have a buffoon running it," we can identify potential defective argument types:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The statement attributes the company's lack of profitability solely to the person running it, without providing any evidence or considering other possible factors. This reasoning is incomplete and fails to conclusively support the argument.

2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This may also fall under <WCB> because it asserts a causal relationship without sufficient evidence. It doesn't establish a clear causal link between the leader's competence and the company's financial performance.

3. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The term "buffoon" is subjective and lacks a clear, objective definition. Its use here creates ambiguity as to what exactly is meant by the term and how it directly impacts the company's financial outcomes.

In summary, the statement exhibits the defective argument types <IR>, <WCB>, and <DEP>.
