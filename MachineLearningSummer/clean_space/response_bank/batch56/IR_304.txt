Based on the defined defective argument types, the statement "Same-sex marriage must be prohibited, or the family structure as we know it will collapse." can be analyzed for potential defects. Let's break it down:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The statement presents a cause-and-effect relationship without providing sufficient evidence that one necessarily leads to the other. There is no demonstrated link between the prohibition of same-sex marriage and the preservation of family structures as they are known.

2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is a claim that prohibiting same-sex marriage will prevent the collapse of family structures, but this cause-and-effect relationship lacks a solid basis or evidence. The assertion is presented without empirical support showing how one action leads to the other specifically.

3. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Terms like "family structure as we know it" can be ambiguous and open to various interpretations. What constitutes "family structure" is not clearly defined, leaving room for multiple interpretations about what is meant to "collapse."

Through <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Attributes), the statement primarily appears to contain elements of:

### 1. **IR (Inconclusive Reason):**
- The reason given is not conclusively linked to the outcome asserted; thus, it fails to provide a convincing argument.

### 2. **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis):**
- The purported cause (prohibiting same-sex marriage) is not shown to have a direct or adequately supported impact on the supposed effect (family structure collapsing).

### 3. **DEP (Ambiguous Language):**
- Use of ambiguous terms like "family structure" and "collapse" weakens the argument by leaving key concepts undefined. 

Conclusively, applying <IDAA> reveals that the argument suffers from IR, WCB, and DEP defects.
