For 
The argument in the statement "You're a Westerner and you're an idiot" can be classified under several defective argument types. Here's the application of your defined arguments to this statement:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement implies that being a Westerner is indicative of being an idiot. This is a broad generalization without any individual evidence to support it.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument fails to consider all the different attributes and actions that define a person. It jumps to the conclusion based only on one characteristic, which is being a Westerner.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: There is no solid reasoning or evidence provided that directly links being a Westerner to being an idiot, making the conclusion inconclusive.

4. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The term "idiot" is highly ambiguous and subjective, which can be interpreted in many ways. Also, "Westerner" can have varied interpretations depending on the context, leading to ambiguous conclusions.

Having analyzed the statement, it incorporates elements of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, and <DEP> defective argument types. There's no clear causal basis (related to <WCB>), faulty repetition, or presumptuous consensus involved in this specific case.
