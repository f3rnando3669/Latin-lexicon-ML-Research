For 
To apply the IDAA (Identify Defective Argument Attributes) framework to the argument "My parents are vegetarians, and they are good people. Therefore, all vegetarians must be good people," we will assess the argument for any of the defective argument types defined earlier:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This occurs when a broad conclusion is drawn from a limited number of examples. In this case, the argument is drawing a broad conclusion about all vegetarians based on the characteristics of just two individuals (the parents).

   - Identification: The statement attempts to generalize the goodness of all vegetarians from the specific example of the parents.
   - Attribute: **<G>** (Generalization)

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This happens when the argument presents an incomplete list of cases or evidence. The argument does not claim to provide a complete list but instead references a specific instance.

   - Identification: The argument does not commit this fallacy as such; it focuses on a generalization rather than an incomplete enumeration of vegetarians.
   - Attribute: Not Applicable

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This occurs when the premises provided do not logically lead to the conclusion. While the goodness of the parents might be true, it does not necessarily follow that all vegetarians are good people.

   - Identification: The goodness of a few individuals cannot be logically extended to an entire group without more substantial support.
   - Attribute: **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason)

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This is when a causal relationship is assumed without adequate basis. This argument is not directly claiming a causal link but rather a categorical generalization.

   - Identification: The argument does not imply a causal relationship between being a vegetarian and being a good person.
   - Attribute: Not Applicable

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This involves repeating a proposition without adding new evidence or support to bolster the claim.

   - Identification: The argument does not contain repetitive propositions.
   - Attribute: Not Applicable

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This type involves assuming consensus where there may be none. The argument does not presume a consensus among people.

   - Identification: The argument does not claim universal agreement among people about vegetarians' goodness.
   - Attribute: Not Applicable

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This involves using unclear language that can lead to multiple interpretations. The terms in the argument (e.g., "good people") might be subjective but not necessarily ambiguous in this context.

   - Identification: While "good people" might be subjective, the language isn't particularly ambiguous.
   - Attribute: Not Applicable

**Final Analysis using IDAA Framework:**
- The argument primarily suffers from **Generalization (G)** and **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
- Therefore, the argument can be characterized as:
   - **<G>** (Generalization)
   - **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason)

Thus, the defective attributes identified in the argument "My parents are vegetarians, and they are good people. Therefore, all vegetarians must be good people." are **<G>** and **<IR>**.
