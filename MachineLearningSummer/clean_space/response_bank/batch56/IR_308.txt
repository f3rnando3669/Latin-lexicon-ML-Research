For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application.

The given statement is: "Although we have proven that the moon is not made of short ribs, we have not proven that its core cannot be filled with them; therefore, the moon’s core is filled with short ribs."

Let's apply <IDAA> to identify the defective argument types present in the statement:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument relies on the fact that since something hasn't been proven to be false (the core being filled with short ribs), it must be true. This is an argument from ignorance and falls under the category of using inconclusive reasoning.

2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument jumps to a conclusion (the moon’s core is filled with short ribs) without sufficient causal evidence or basis. The fact that there's no evidence against the specific claim doesn't provide any causal basis for the claim itself.

Here is the identified application of defective argument types in the statement:

<IDAA>: "Although we have proven that the moon is not made of short ribs, we have not proven that its core cannot be filled with them; therefore, the moon’s core is filled with short ribs."
- <IR>: Uses the lack of disproof as a reason for a positive claim.
- <WCB>: Assumes a conclusion without sufficient causal evidence.
