It appears there's a slight confusion in the instruction. "IDAA" isn't defined previously, but if we are to classify the given argument using the previously defined defective argument types, we can identify which type or types may apply.

The argument "I deserve to have a later curfew, so you should let me stay out until 10pm!" could be classified under several defective argument types:

1. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The statement "I deserve to have a later curfew" isn't supported by any evidence or reason within the argument itselfâ€”it assumes the conclusion without sufficient backing.

2. **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**: The word "deserve" is subjective and can vary greatly in interpretation. Without a clear standard or criteria for what makes someone "deserve" a later curfew, this argument becomes ambiguous.

To apply the argument type labels:

- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The argument lacks sufficient backing for the premise "I deserve to have a later curfew".
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**: The term "deserve" is not clearly defined, making the argument ambiguous.
