For 
To apply the definitions of defective argument types to the argument "Millions of people are Marxists, so Marxist economic and political theories are correct," let's identify which, if any, of the defined defective argument types it falls into:

- **Generalization (G):** This type of argument jumps to a conclusion based on insufficient evidence. However, this doesn't seem to be a generalization based on sample size.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This involves drawing a conclusion from some instances while ignoring others. The argument doesn't enumerate any specifics but rather appeals to the authority of numbers.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This type of argument fails to provide adequate reasoning for the conclusion. The argument that "Millions of people believe X, so X must be correct" is inconclusive because the popularity of a belief does not necessarily correlate with its truth.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This refers to a lack of sufficient causal evidence to support a claim. The argument here lacks examination of the reasons why people believe in Marxist theories, rather than proving the theories themselves.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This type involves repetitive assertion without new evidence. The given argument does not feature repetition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Presumes that widespread agreement equals correctness. This seems very applicable, as the argument relies on the assumption that because many people hold a certain belief, that belief must be valid.

- **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** This could involve the misuse or vagueness of terms, which is not directly relevant here.

Thus, the argument "Millions of people are Marxists, so Marxist economic and political theories are correct" can be classified under:
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** for failing to present sufficient evidence outside of the popularity of belief.

Additionally, if we were considering labeling only one, **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** is the most fitting as the argumentâ€™s primary flaw is relying on consensus as evidence of truth.
