Certainly! To apply the defective argument types defined, we first need to identify the nature of the argument in question. The argument, "My opponent suggests that lowering taxes will be a good idea -- this is coming from a woman who eats a pint of Ben and Jerry’s each night!" is an *ad hominem* attack. An *ad hominem* attack is when one attacks the character of the person making an argument rather than addressing the argument itself.

Here, the speaker dismisses the opponent's argument about lowering taxes by bringing up a completely irrelevant and personal detail about her eating habits. This does not address the merits or demerits of the tax idea itself.

According to the defective argument types defined, the most suitable classification in this context would be <DEP>, which stands for Ambiguous Language. However, the type most closely related to an *ad hominem* attack within the given definitions might not perfectly match, but we can still proceed with the classification under an additional tag if needed.

Applying <IDAA (Identification of Defective Argument Annotation)> to the given argument:

"My opponent suggests that lowering taxes will be a good idea -- this is coming from a woman who eats a pint of Ben and Jerry’s each night! <IR>"
"Mi oponente sugiere que bajar los impuestos será una buena idea, ¡esto viene de una mujer que se come una pinta de Ben y Jerry cada noche! <IR>"

Here, <IR> stands for Inconclusive Reason which aligns with attacking the opponent’s character instead of their argument, suggesting that the reason provided (her eating habits) does not conclusively address the validity of the tax proposal.

If you were to prefer a new tag specifically for Ad Hominem, it could be provided as well.
