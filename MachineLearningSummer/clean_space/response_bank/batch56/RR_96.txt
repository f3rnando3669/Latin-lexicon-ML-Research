For 
It looks like you've defined several types of defective arguments and now want to apply a specific type, <IDAA>, to the provided statement. However, you didn't define what <IDAA> stands for. From the context, <IDAA> could mean something similar to the ones you've listed. 

To analyze "Sleeping until noon is the worst thing to do because it is bad to sleep late," let's first see if it matches any of the defective argument types you've defined.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument does not specifically overgeneralize, so we likely rule out <G>.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This argument does not seem to list incomplete examples, so we likely rule out <FE>.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This argument does provide a reason ("because it is bad to sleep late"), though circular.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This might apply if we argue that the cause provided ("it is bad to sleep late") is not sufficiently supported.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This might apply because the argument is essentially repeating the statement without providing new evidence.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Expects reader to agree without adequate basis.
7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The wording is fairly clear, so probably not this.

Given the close match, the best defective argument type here is likely **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**. The statement simply restates that something is bad without providing further evidence:

**"Sleeping until noon is the worst thing to do because it is bad to sleep late."**

This argument is faulty because it repeats the same proposition without introducing a new, supporting reason.

If we hypothesize <IDAA> could be similar to **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**, the reasoning would align similarly:

Therefore, by <RR> or a similar reasoning, the analysis confirms it as a faulty repetition of the original assertion.
