For 
It seems you're describing defective argument types and you want to know which one applies to the given dialogue between Billy and Bobby.

In the conversation, Bobby is dismissing Billy's statement about an apple being a vegetable by attacking Billy's character rather than addressing the content of Billy's claim.

This kind of argument is known as an **Ad Hominem** fallacy, where the argument is directed against the person making the claim rather than the claim itself.

However, since you've not defined '<IDAA>' but given types like Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Presumptuous Consensus, and Ambiguous Language, the argument **does not fit neatly into these predefined defective argument types** in your list.

Therefore, for the conversation:

Billy - "An apple is a vegetable."
Bobby - "Don't listen to Billy; he failed Spanish class last year."

The conversation illustrates an **Ad Hominem** fallacy, but it does not match any of the defective argument types labelled <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP>.
