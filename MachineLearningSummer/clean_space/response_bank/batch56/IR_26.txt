For 
The argument presented, "You should certainly be the one who washes the dishes -- you are just so good at it!" can be evaluated with the set of defective argument types. Let's break it down:

1. Generalization (<G>): This doesn't seem to be directly generalizing from a sample or a limited set of data points.
   
2. Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>): This does not seem to provide an incomplete set of possibilities or options.

3. Inconclusive Reason (<IR>): While the statement presents a reason (being good at washing dishes), it might be considered inconclusive because it doesn’t address other important factors, like fairness or distribution of chores. However, it still provides a reason, albeit possibly not a sufficiently strong one.

4. Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>): This would imply that the reason given does not adequately support the conclusion. The argument's suggestion is weak causally; being good at washing dishes doesn't inherently mean one should always do them.

5. Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>): This would involve repeating a proposition without providing new support or reasoning, which isn't clearly present here.

6. Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>): The argument doesn’t assume that there is a consensus or widely accepted belief about the conclusion.

7. Ambiguous Language (<DEP>): The language used is not necessarily ambiguous; it is pretty clear in what it is suggesting.

Given these considerations, the argument "You should certainly be the one who washes the dishes -- you are just so good at it!" seems to most closely fit <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis). The reason given (being good at washing dishes) is insufficient to fully justify the conclusion that the person should always be the one who washes the dishes. Other factors, such as fairness and workload distribution, are not considered.

Therefore, applying the defective argument type <IDAA>, the statement is an example of <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
