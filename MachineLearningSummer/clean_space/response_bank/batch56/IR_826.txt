For 
<IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Application Analysis):

In the given dialogue:

- **Jon:** "Go easy on the scotch; you've had three shots already now."
- **Jeff:** "Oh sure, I'll put down my scotch when you put down that tequila. Lay off, man."

Jeff's response to Jon can be analyzed for defective arguments:

1. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Jeff's argument is essentially shifting the focus from his own behavior to Jon's behavior, without addressing the concern raised by Jon about the amount of scotch Jeff has consumed. This tactic is sometimes referred to as "tu quoque" or "whataboutism," where instead of engaging with the actual critique, the individual deflects by accusing the critic of a similar issue.

2. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Jeff is implying that Jon should also stop drinking since he perceives Jon's drinking behavior (tequila) as similar to his own (scotch). This implies a consensus or mutual understanding that they both behave similarly and should both make the same change. However, this may be presumptuous as Jon's situation might be different (e.g., Jon might not have had as much to drink), and Jeff's argument doesn't take that into account.

In conclusion, Jeff's argument can be classified primarily under:
- <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), also known as a tu quoque fallacy.
- <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus) as he presumes an equal footing which may not account for the actual context.

Using these classifications, Jeff's response fails to address the immediate concern raised by Jon and instead attempts to deflect by pointing to Jon's actions. This deflection undermines the validity of the argument instead of directly discussing the issue of alcohol consumption.
