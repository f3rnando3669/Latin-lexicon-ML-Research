The argument "I can tell this movie is going to be terrible; the opening credits aren't even over yet!" can be evaluated using the list of defective argument types defined.

This argument states a belief about the overall quality of the movie, based solely on the observation of the opening credits. The argument is defective in several potential ways:

1. **Generalization (G)**: The argument makes a broad claim about the movie being terrible based on a very limited observation. Judging the entire quality of the movie just by its opening credits is an unjustifiable generalization because one part of the movie doesn't necessarily represent the whole.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument overlooks other factors that could contribute to the assessment of the movie's quality. Factors such as storyline, acting, direction, and production values are not considered here. Itâ€™s a hasty and incomplete judgment.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Assuming that the opening credits alone can definitively determine the quality of the whole movie is an inconclusive reason. Opening credits are just a small segment and not necessarily indicative of the full experience or quality of a movie.

Given these points, "<IDAA>" can be applied to identify which defective arguments the statement embodies:

- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**

Thus, the argument "I can tell this movie is going to be terrible; the opening credits aren't even over yet!" involves defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, and <IR>.
