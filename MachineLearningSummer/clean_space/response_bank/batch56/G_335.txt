For 
The argument "You shouldn't go to 'Vomito' I went once and the food was awful." is a type of defective argument. Here's a breakdown of how it can be applied with the defined defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument takes a single instance of bad experience and generalizes it to an overall recommendation for everyone to avoid the place. Just because one experience was bad does not mean all experiences will be the same.
   - *Applied*: "You shouldn't go to 'Vomito'. I went once and the food was awful." is a **Generalization** because it extrapolates one bad experience to a universal claim.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not consider other instances or opinions. It relies on a single event without a broad survey or substantial evidence.
   - *Applied*: "You shouldn't go to 'Vomito'. I went once and the food was awful." falls under **Incomplete Enumeration** because it does not account for other experiences at the restaurant.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided is not sufficient to conclusively prove that 'Vomito' is always bad. One bad meal does not logically mean that the restaurant is always bad.
   - *Applied*: "You shouldn't go to 'Vomito'. I went once and the food was awful." is an **Inconclusive Reason** since one instance does not firmly prove the overall quality of the restaurant.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: It assumes a causal relationship between the single bad visit and the general quality of the restaurant without enough evidence.
   - *Applied*: "You shouldn't go to 'Vomito'. I went once and the food was awful." can be seen as having an **Insufficient Causal Basis** because the argument doesn't sufficiently establish a causal link from a single event to a general rule.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This might not apply directly here as there is no repetition of a proposition in this statement.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument assumes consensus based on a personal anecdote. The claim might wrongly presume that others will share the same experience or view.
   - *Applied*: "You shouldn't go to 'Vomito'. I went once and the food was awful." hints at a **Presumptuous Consensus**, assuming that the bad experience will universally agree with or reflect that of the wider public without proper evidence of a common consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language isn't necessarily ambiguous in the provided argument, so this may not be relevant here.

In conclusion, the argument "You shouldn't go to 'Vomito'. I went once and the food was awful." primarily exhibits the defective argument types of **Generalization (G)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
