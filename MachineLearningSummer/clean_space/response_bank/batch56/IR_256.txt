For 
The scenario you're describing seems to involve identifying a type of defective argument known as an "ad hominem" fallacy. An ad hominem fallacy occurs when the arguer themselves is attacked rather than addressing the argument they put forth.

Therefore, applying the identifier for defective argument type "ad hominem attack" <IDAA>, the statement would be:

When the arguer is attacked vs. the argument that is attacked, this is an example of: <IDAA>.

Note that "<IDAA>" stands for Identifying the Defective Argument as an Ad Hominem Attack.
