To analyze and classify the defective argument in the statement provided using the shorthand definitions:

"My roommate Fatima said her philosophy class was hard, and the one I’m in is hard, too. All philosophy classes must be hard!” Insisted Baneen.

This argument exhibits an instance of a hasty generalization where the conclusion is drawn based on insufficient evidence. In the argument, Baneen generalizes that all philosophy classes are hard based on the experience of just two philosophy classes.

Thus, the defective argument type IDAA (Identify Defective Argument Applied) for the statement is <G> Generalization.
