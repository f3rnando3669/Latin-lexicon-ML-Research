For 
<IDAA> stands for "Identify Defective Argument Attributes."

To apply <IDAA> to the statement "If indoor smoking laws are passed for bars, the bars will go out of business since people who drink, smoke while they drink," you need to identify which defective argument types are present in the statement. Let's break it down and see what types might apply:

1. **Generalization (G)**: The statement generalizes that all people who drink also smoke. This is not necessarily true as not all drinkers are smokers.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument doesn't take into account other potential outcomes or variables. Some bars might continue to prosper despite smoking laws due to other factors like good service, ambiance, or food offerings.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning provided (that bars will go out of business because people smoke while they drink) is not conclusively supported. There could be other reasons or evidence that the smoking ban would not necessarily lead to bars going out of business.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The connection between smoking laws and bars going out of business is asserted without sufficient causal evidence. There's not enough proof that a smoking ban would directly result in bars closing.
   
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This doesnâ€™t seem applicable as the argument doesn't repeat a proposition to make it seem more valid.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The statement assumes a consensus among people who drink that they all smoke, which is presumptuous.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The term "bars will go out of business" could be considered ambiguous as it might mean different things to different people (some might think of reduced business vs. completely shutting down).

Based on the analysis, the statement primarily exhibits the defective argument types of Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), and Presumptuous Consensus (FU). The primary ones might be Generalization (G) and Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).
