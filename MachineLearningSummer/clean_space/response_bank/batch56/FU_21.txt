In the context of analyzing defective arguments, <IDAA> stands for Identify, Define, Assign, and Analyze. Let's apply <IDAA> to the argument "The new iPhone comes out this weekend! If you don't get it, you're not cool!"

### Identify
First, let's identify the type(s) of defective arguments present in the statement.

### Define
We have the following defective argument types defined previously:
1. **<G>** Generalization
2. **<FE>** Incomplete Enumeration
3. **<IR>** Inconclusive Reason
4. **<WCB>** Insufficient Causal Basis
5. **<RR>** Faulty Repetition of Proposition
6. **<FU>** Presumptuous Consensus
7. **<DEP>** Ambiguous Language

### Assign
Now we need to assign the appropriate defective argument type(s) to the statement.

1. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The argument suggests that owning the new iPhone is necessary to be considered "cool," assuming a consensus that being "cool" is a widely accepted and understood concept related to iPhone ownership without providing any evidence.

2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The statement implies a causal relationship between owning the new iPhone and being considered cool without sufficient justification or evidence showing why one would cause the other.

### Analyze
Let's analyze the defective argument:

1. **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** The claim that not getting the new iPhone results in not being cool presumes that "coolness" is universally defined by owning the latest iPhone. This argument takes for granted that there's a consensus on this idea without substantiating it. In reality, "coolness" is subjective and varies widely among different groups of people.

2. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** There is no logical or factual foundation provided to support the claim that purchasing the new iPhone directly impacts one's status as "cool." The statement lacks a rational connection between the two assertions, making the causality insufficiently supported.

### Conclusion
The argument "The new iPhone comes out this weekend! If you don't get it, you're not cool!" primarily suffers from **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus** by assuming that owning the new iPhone is a universally accepted sign of coolness, and **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis** by failing to substantiate the causal link between owning the iPhone and being cool.

Hence, the argument is defective due to these identified reasons.
