For 
The statement "We can have Sally as our soldier or we can have Brittany be the queen of the kingdom." does not seem to fit neatly into any of the defective argument types defined previously. Let's break down each type to see the closest possible match or if it fits at all:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This involves making a broad generalization from insufficient data. The statement does not seem to generalize anything.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This involves listing options or possibilities in a way that omits important alternatives. The statement presents a choice between two specific roles but doesn't suggest this is an exhaustive list. This could be its closest fit since it omits other possible roles or candidates.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This type of argument draws a conclusion from premises that do not strongly support it. The statement doesn't provide any reasoning or premises to judge.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This involves drawing a causal conclusion without sufficient evidence. There is no causation implied in the statement.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This involves making a claim and then repeating it as if the repetition serves as evidence. The statement doesn't repeat or reaffirm propositions.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This is assuming everyone agrees on a point without evidence to support that consensus. The statement doesn't claim any consensus or agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This involves using ambiguous or unclear language that can lead to different interpretations. The statement uses straightforward language without apparent ambiguity.

Given these definitions, the argument could loosely fit under **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** because it suggests a limited set of options without considering other possibilities or candidates for the roles mentioned. 

So, the application would be:

Apply <FE> to "We can have Sally as our soldier or we can have Brittany be the queen of the kingdom."
