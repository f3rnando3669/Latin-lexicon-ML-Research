For 
<IDAA>: <FU> Presumptuous Consensus.

The argument presented assumes that because millions of people drink Diet Coke every year, it must be the best soft drink in the world. This fallacious reasoning is an example of Presumptuous Consensus (FU), where the popularity or widespread acceptance of something is improperly taken as evidence of its superiority or correctness. The mere fact that many people drink Diet Coke does not necessarily mean it is the best; personal preferences, marketing, accessibility, and other factors could also contribute to its popularity.
