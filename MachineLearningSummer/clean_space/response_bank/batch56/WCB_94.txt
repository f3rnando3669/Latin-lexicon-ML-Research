Certainly! Let's apply each of the defined defective argument types to the argument:

"The flu vaccine comes out every year just before the holidays, then people go and spend a lot of money. Therefore, businesses are secretly using the flu vaccine as a mind control device to increase holiday spending."

**Generalization (<G>):**
- This argument makes a sweeping claim about a broad group (businesses using flu vaccines as mind control) based on minimal or no specific evidence. It generalizes a coincidence without sufficient proof.

**Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
- The argument assumes a direct link between the flu vaccine timing and holiday spending without considering other variables such as holiday sales, marketing, cultural practices, or economic factors that typically influence spending during this period.

**Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
- The reasoning in the argument is speculative and lacks direct evidence. The claim that businesses use flu vaccines as mind control is not conclusively proven by the correlation between the timing of the flu vaccine and increased holiday spending.

**Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
- There is no concrete causal evidence provided to support the claim that the flu vaccine causes increased holiday spending. The argument fails to establish a credible causal relationship between the two events.

**Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
- While not explicitly repetitive, any potential reiteration of this idea without new evidence would be an attempt to reinforce a flawed proposition through repetition. The initial proposition lacks validity and evidence.

**Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
- The argument makes a bold assumption about general consensus or secret collusion among businesses regarding the use of flu vaccines as mind control without any substantiating evidence or acknowledgment of dissenting views.

**Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
- The phrase "mind control device" is highly ambiguous and sensationalistic. It implies a science-fiction-like scenario without clearly defining what is meant by mind control in this context or providing any scientific basis for such a claim.

In summary, the argument that "businesses are secretly using the flu vaccine as a mind control device to increase holiday spending" suffers from several defective argument types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), and Ambiguous Language (<DEP>). Each of these factors contributes to the overall weakness and implausibility of the argument.
