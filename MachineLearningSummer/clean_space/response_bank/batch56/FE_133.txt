For 
The argument "Either you believe what I’m saying, or you must believe exactly the opposite" can be identified as employing a false dichotomy, which is a type of defective argument known as **False Dilemma** or **False Dichotomy**. This argument presents only two options when in reality, more options may exist, or the situation is much more nuanced.

Your specification does not provide a name for False Dichotomy within the listed defective argument types. Since <IDAA> stands for **Identify Defective Argument Type**, and your current list doesn't include False Dichotomy, we would need to identify it externally.

However, based on the specified defective argument types, one might consider it under the scope of **Ambiguous Language (DEP)** because it simplifies and constrains the understanding of a situation in a way that distorts the range of reasonable positions.

So, applying <IDAA> to the given statement, based on the closest match available, would give us:

"Either you believe what I’m saying, or you must believe exactly the opposite." <DEP> Ambiguous Language
