Applying this list of defective argument types to the statement "In order to really look at the problem of global warming, we must first consider how the homeless suffer when it is cold." requires an evaluation to determine which, if any, faulty argument types it might represent.

The statement seems to be an example of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. Here's why:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This argument type suggests irrelevant or insufficient reasoning to support a conclusion. The statement presents a problem (global warming) and then shifts to a different issue (how the homeless suffer when it is cold) without a clear logical connection. This reasoning does not necessarily support or provide insight into addressing global warming directly.

Thus, the statement "In order to really look at the problem of global warming, we must first consider how the homeless suffer when it is cold." exhibits the characteristics of an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because it introduces an unrelated issue without adequately addressing the primary problem of global warming.
