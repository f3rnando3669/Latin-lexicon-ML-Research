<IDAA>: Identify Defective Argument Application

Argument: "If you choose not to administer triple antibiotic coverage for this patient with severe and extensive burns, you will be held responsible for any infectious complications that might eventually arise."

1. Identify the Argument Type:
   - This argument appears to be an instance of **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**. It suggests that the only way to prevent infectious complications in a patient with severe and extensive burns is by administering triple antibiotic coverage. It fails to consider other potentially effective treatments or combinations of treatments that may also prevent infections.

2. Explanation:
   - Emphasizing only one method (triple antibiotic coverage) without considering other valid medical interventions creates an incomplete picture. The argument could overlook alternative or supplementary methods such as different antibiotic regimens, wound care techniques, or even advanced medical treatments that might also prevent infections.

Thus, the argument "If you choose not to administer triple antibiotic coverage for this patient with severe and extensive burns, you will be held responsible for any infectious complications that might eventually arise." can be classified under **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration** due to its failure to fully enumerate the possible methods or actions capable of preventing infectious complications in such cases.
