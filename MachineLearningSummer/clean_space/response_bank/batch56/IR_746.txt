For 
To analyze the argument provided using the identified defective argument types <G> (Generalization), <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration), <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis), <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus), and <DEP> (Ambiguous Language):

"I should receive an 'A' in this class. I had a tough week!" Hadi begged.

Let’s ascertain which defective argument types are present in this statement:

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - Hadi's argument relies on the idea that because he had a tough week, he should be awarded an 'A'. This fails to establish a sufficient causal basis. A tough week does not necessarily justify receiving the highest grade. The performance or understanding of the course material should be the primary factor in determining grades, not personal difficulties alone.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The mention of having a tough week is an inconclusive reason for receiving an 'A'. It doesn’t conclusively support that grade outcome. Many factors should be considered for grading, such as assignment submissions, exam performance, and participation, not just external personal issues.

In applying the identified defective argument types to Hadi's statement, we conclude that the argument shows signs of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** and **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.

So, the argument contains elements of:
- <WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis
- <IR>: Inconclusive Reason
