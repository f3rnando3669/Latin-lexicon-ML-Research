For 
<IR>: To apply the defective argument type called Inconclusive Reason (<IR>) to the statement "Donâ€™t waste your money on a home security system; master thieves will still be able to get into your house," you would point out that the argument assumes that because some master thieves might bypass the system, having a security system is not worthwhile at all. This ignores the fact that home security systems can still deter or catch many other potential intruders, providing a level of protection that is better than none. The reason provided is inconclusive because it does not consider the overall effectiveness of such systems against common threats.
