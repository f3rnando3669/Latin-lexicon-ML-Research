To apply the defective argument type analysis to "If we legalize marijuana, then more people will try heroin," we need to identify any of the defined defective argument types (IDAA) that the statement might exemplify.

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - This could be seen as a generalization because it assumes a direct and inevitable chain of events from legalizing marijuana to increased heroin use without supporting evidence. Broad assumptions are made about people's behavior patterns based on a single policy change.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - This statement does not enumerate (list) all potential outcomes or factors involved. It overly simplifies the issue by implying that legalizing marijuana will directly lead to heroin use without considering other influencing factors.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The reasoning is inconclusive because it lacks sufficient evidence to establish the eventual outcome clearly. Correlation does not imply causation, and the argument does not provide clear, supportive reasoning for the connection between marijuana legalization and heroin use increases.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - This fits the category of insufficient causal basis as it presupposes a causative relationship without substantiating data or evidence. There isn't enough basis to conclude that legalizing marijuana will cause more heroin use.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - If this argument is repeatedly used without new evidence, it could fall under this category. However, based on this single instance, the defect doesn't particularly apply here unless the statement is being repetitively used without substantiated evidence.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - If the argument is based on the idea that "everyone knows" this outcome will occur, it might be presumptuous consensus. This is a weaker match unless the speaker insists that this belief is widely accepted without substantial evidence.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - The language here is not particularly ambiguous.

Applying the defective argument types:

- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

Thus, the argument in the statement "If we legalize marijuana, then more people will try heroin" primarily exemplifies defective argument types **G (Generalization)**, **FE (Incomplete Enumeration)**, **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**, and **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
