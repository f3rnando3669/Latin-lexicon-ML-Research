For 
<IDAA> refers to a defective argument type called Identifying Defection of Adversarial Accountability. This type of argument involves wrongly attributing all or most negative outcomes to the adversarial party's policies without sufficient or conclusive evidence.

Let's apply <IDAA> to "blame opponent's policy for the country's problems":

When someone claims, "The current economic downturn is entirely due to the opposition party's latest policy on trade," they might be engaging in <IDAA>. This argument type fails to consider other potential factors that could contribute to the economic downturn, such as global economic trends, natural disasters, or other independent variables. By attributing all the blame to the opponent's policy without adequately accounting for these other factors, the argument falls into the category of Identifying Defection of Adversarial Accountability <IDAA>.
