Applying defective argument analysis to the given statement:

"If you don't buy the black pencils, you will get made fun of. You will not be chosen for group projects."

Let's identify the defective argument types present in this statement.

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement implies that there are only two consequences of not buying black pencils - getting made fun of and not being chosen for group projects. This is an incomplete enumeration because it neglects other possible outcomes.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning provided does not conclusively link the failure to buy black pencils with the negative outcomes suggested (getting made fun of and not being chosen for group projects). There are multiple other factors that could contribute to these outcomes.

3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The assertion that not buying black pencils directly leads to getting made fun of and being excluded from group projects lacks a sufficient causal basis. The cause-effect relationship is weak and not substantiated.

Reviewing these points, the defective argument "IDAA" would primarily involve **FE, IR, and WCB**:
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
