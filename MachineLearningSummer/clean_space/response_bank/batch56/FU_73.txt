For 
<IDAA> stands for "Identify Defective Argument Applause." Let's identify if the statement "Trying the latest social media challenge is a good example of what logical fallacy?" corresponds to one of the defective argument types listed.

The test here is to determine which, if any, of the defective argument types fits the given statement. Specifically:

- **Generalization (G):** This involves making a broad statement based on a small sample or insufficient evidence.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This means missing out possible, relevant considerations or alternatives in making a point.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This is when the supporting reason does not conclusively prove the intended claim.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This involves asserting causation without sufficient evidence.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This entails repeatedly asserting a point without adding additional substantive backing.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This is assuming consensus or agreement with little to no evidence backing it.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** This involves using language that can be interpreted in multiple ways, leading to misunderstandings.

Let's analyze the statement:

"Trying the latest social media challenge is a good example of what logical fallacy?"

This asks to identify a fallacy, based on the characterization of trying a social media challenge. However, it itself doesn't represent an argument or assertion from which to directly identify a defective argument type. Instead, it seeks to apply knowledge of fallacies to a situational example.

Since it doesn't inherently assert a causal relationship, consensus, enumeration, repetition, or employ ambiguous language in making a point, the defective argument types can be filtered through:

- It does not generalize here, as it's merely a query about a logical category.

Given that the statement is a question rather than an argument, none of the defective argument types (Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Presumptuous Consensus, Ambiguous Language) directly apply in identifying an inherent fallacy within the question itself.

Thus, <IDAA> reveals that the query doesn't classify as a defective argument of the specified types, and the logical fallacy sought to be identified would depend on the context and evidence provided if the challenge or reasoning behind participating is analyzed separately.
