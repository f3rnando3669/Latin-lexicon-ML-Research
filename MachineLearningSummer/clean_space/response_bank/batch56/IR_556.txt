For 
The argument presented is: "Do not listen to Luisa, she will only tell you lies about the recent activities given in our EAPP class."

Let's break it down according to the defective argument types defined:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The argument asserts that Luisa will only tell lies without providing evidence or a valid reason for why she would do so. It does not offer specific instances or proof of Luisa lying about the activities in the EAPP class.

Thus, the argument can be classified as having the defect:
**<IR> - Inconclusive Reason**

This argument is defective because it lacks substantiated evidence to dismiss Luisa's credibility and relies on an unsupported assertion.
