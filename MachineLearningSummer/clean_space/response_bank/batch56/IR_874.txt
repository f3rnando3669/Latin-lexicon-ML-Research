The argument provided is an example of an "Appeal to Authority," which can be classified as a defective argument type because it relies on the authority of a specific individual rather than presenting substantive evidence or reasoning.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why this is considered a defective argument:

**Argument Statement:**
"We should abolish the death penalty. Even Judge Judy is opposed to it."

**Identified Defective Argument Type (<IDAA>):**

**<IDAA: Appeal to Authority>**

This argument suggests that the opinion of Judge Judy, a TV personality who is known for being a judge, should be a sufficient reason to abolish the death penalty. However, whether or not Judge Judy opposes the death penalty does not necessarily provide a convincing argument on the issue. The expertise or authority of a person on a specific matter (Judge Judy's opinion) is being used to substantiate a claim about a significant and complex issue (the death penalty), but this does not address the various ethical, legal, and pragmatic aspects that should be considered.

While Judge Judy may have a legal background and her opinion might be worth considering, the argument is defective because it does not provide any substantial evidence or reasoning other than her stance. Therefore, by focusing on the authority rather than the issue at hand, the argument fails to adequately support the claim.
