For 
<IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Applied):  

The fallacy described in the statement is an example of what's commonly known as **appeal to emotion (argumentum ad passiones)**. This type of fallacy attempts to manipulate an emotional response in place of a valid or compelling argument.

Here's a detailed breakdown aligned with defective argument types:

- It involves **<DEP>** (Ambiguous Language) because emotive language can be vague and open to multiple interpretations, thus preventing clear reasoning.
- It may show characteristics of **<FU>** (Presumptuous Consensus), where the arguer presumes that manipulating emotions will lead to agreement or consensus without actual evidence or logical reasoning.
- It could also be seen as an **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason), where the reason provided (emotional appeal) is not logically conclusive or relevant to the truth of the argument being made.

In classification, the primary focus is on the **appeal to emotion** rather than the faulty repetition, incomplete enumeration, or insufficient causal basis directly.
