For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application. Here is the application of this method to the given argument:

Argument: "Your brain is made of molecules. Molecules are not the source of consciousness. Therefore, your brain cannot be the source of consciousness."

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument takes a general rule about molecules ("Molecules are not the source of consciousness") and improperly generalizes it to the brain without considering the complexity and the emergent properties of the brain as a system. This overlooks the possibility that the arrangement and interactions of molecules can give rise to consciousness.

2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument lacks a sufficient causal basis for linking the properties of molecules directly to the property of consciousness. It ignores the complex processes and organizational levels in the brain that contribute to consciousness, thus providing an insufficient causal explanation.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The premise that "molecules are not the source of consciousness" is inconclusive for the given conclusion. The reasoning does not adequately support the conclusion that "the brain cannot be the source of consciousness," as it fails to consider the possibility of emergent phenomena.

Identified Defective Argument Types:
- <G> Generalization
- <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis
- <IR> Inconclusive Reason
