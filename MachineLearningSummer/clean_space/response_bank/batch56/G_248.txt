In applying the defective argument analysis to the statement "Supreme Court Justice Byron White was an All-American football player while in college, so how can you say that athletes are dumb?", we can identify several defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument takes the singular example of Byron White and generalizes it to claim that all athletes are not dumb. Using one notable exception to make a sweeping statement about an entire group is a classic example of a hasty generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument implies that because one athlete (Byron White) was intellectually distinguished, this must apply to all athletes. It fails to acknowledge the larger population and the variability within it, ignoring other examples that might contradict the conclusion.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The premise that Byron White was intelligent does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that all athletes are not dumb. The reasoning does not adequately support the broad conclusion about the intellectual capabilities of all athletes.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument might suggest an underlying causal relationship between being an athlete and being intelligent by pointing to Byron White as an example. However, this single case does not establish a sufficient causal basis to claim that athleticism is linked to intelligence.

5. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The term "dumb" is ambiguous and subjective. It can refer to a lack of knowledge in certain areas, poor decision-making, or a variety of other attributes. The imprecise use of "dumb" weakens the argument as it relies on a term that is open to interpretation.

Given the statement and defective arguments identified, the argument is flawed primarily through overgeneralization, incomplete enumeration, inconclusive reasoning, insufficient causal basis, and the use of ambiguous language.
