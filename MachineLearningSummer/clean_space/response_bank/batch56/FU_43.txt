For 
To identify and define the defective argument type present in the statement "We now produce the best program in existence; four thousand businesses subscribe to our program," let's analyze the argument.

The statement suggests that the quality of the program ("the best program in existence") is proven by the number of businesses that subscribe to it ("four thousand businesses"). 

This reasoning is faulty because it assumes that the popularity of the program (the number of subscribers) is a direct and sufficient measure of its quality. There could be many other reasons why the program has that many subscribers, such as effective marketing, lack of competition, or other non-quality related factors.

### Identified Defective Argument Type:

#### Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
This argument seems to fall under the defective argument type defined as **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**. The assumption here is that because many people (or businesses, in this case) subscribe to the program, it must be the best, which is a presumed consensus that does not necessarily reflect the actual quality of the program.

### Explanation:
**Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** occurs when an argument assumes that a popular or widely accepted belief is true simply because many people believe it or follow it. This is a logical fallacy because widespread belief or adoption does not inherently validate the truth or quality of the proposition.

### Application:
Applying <FU> to the statement yields:

"We now produce the best program in existence; four thousand businesses subscribe to our program."

- **Analysis:** The statement assumes the programâ€™s superiority based solely on its number of subscribers.
- **Defective Argument Type (FU):** The argument is a **Presumptuous Consensus** because it incorrectly equates the number of subscribers to the quality of the program, without providing substantial evidence that the program is objectively the best.
