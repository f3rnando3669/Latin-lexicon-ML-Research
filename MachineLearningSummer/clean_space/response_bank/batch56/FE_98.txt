For 
<IDAA> stands for an "improperly disjunctive argument application," which indicates the use of a false dichotomy. A false dichotomy is when only two options are presented as the only possibilities, while in reality, other options may exist.

For the statement "You are either a leader or a follower," applying <IDAA> would note that this statement falsely limits the options and doesn't account for other possibilities or a more nuanced condition, such as being an independent thinker, collaborator, or another distinct role that isn't strictly defined by leadership or following. 

Thus, the proper label would be:
<IDAA> "You are either a leader or a follower."
