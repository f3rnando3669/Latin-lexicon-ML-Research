For 
<IDAA> stands for "Identify Defective Arguments and Annotate." Here's the analysis and annotation of the given dialogue between Speaker 1 and Speaker 2:

---

**Speaker 1: You should trust the Bible because it’s the Word of God.**

- (**<IR> Inconclusive Reason**) This statement can be seen as an inconclusive reason because simply stating the Bible is the Word of God is not sufficient evidence for why someone should trust it. The reason provided is not independently verifiable or convincing without further context.

**Speaker 2: How do you know it’s the Word of God?**

- No defective argument here. This is a genuine question seeking clarification or justification for Speaker 1's claim.

**Speaker 1: Because God tells us it is.**

- (**<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**) The argument that "God tells us it is the Word of God" lacks an independent, verifiable causal basis. There's no clear evidence provided that this statement is directly from God and not just an assumption or belief.

- (**<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**) Additionally, assuming that a single statement ("God tells us it is") fully enumerates the justification for the trust in the Bible might be an incomplete argument, as it overlooks alternative explanations or contexts.

**Speaker 2: Where does God tell us this?**

- No defective argument here. This is another genuine question seeking further explanation for Speaker 1's claim.

**Speaker 1: Right here, in the Bible.**

- (**<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**) This response repeats the initial proposition and does not address the question with any new evidence. It's a form of circular reasoning where the argument's conclusion is used as its premise.

- (**<G> Generalization**) Implicit in this statement is a generalization that any claim made within the Bible must be accepted as true just because it is made inside the Bible, which is not an accepted method of validating the truth of a statement in a rational argument.

By identifying and annotating the defective arguments, we can see that Speaker 1's argument relies predominantly on circular reasoning and lacks sufficient independent verification or causal basis.
