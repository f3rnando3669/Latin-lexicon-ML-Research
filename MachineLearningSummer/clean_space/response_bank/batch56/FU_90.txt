To apply the concept of Identifying Defective Argument Application (<IDAA>) to the phrase "everyone is doing it" mentality, we need to analyze and identify if this falls under any of the defined defective argument types.

In this context, "everyone is doing it" is an appeal to popularity or consensus to justify a behavior or a belief. This typically implies that because many people engage in something, it must be correct or acceptable.

Given our list of defective argument types, the most applicable one here is:

**<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:**
This defective argument rests on the assumption that if a majority or a consensus believe or do something, it must be correct or valid without providing any substantial evidence or reasoning other than the popularity of the action or belief.

Therefore, the phrase "everyone is doing it" falls under the defective argument type <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).
