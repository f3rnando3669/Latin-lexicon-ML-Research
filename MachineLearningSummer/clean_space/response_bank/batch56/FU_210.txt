For 
The sentence "Four legs good, two legs bad" can be critiqued using the defined defective argument types. Specifically, we can apply "Incomplete Enumeration" (FE) to analyze this slogan.

<IDAA> "Four legs good, two legs bad"

To evaluate the argument type:

1. **Generalization (G)**: The statement is a sweeping generalization, as it broadly categorizes beings based on the number of legs without consideration for other relevant factors.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This is most applicable here as the argument fails to take into account animals or beings that do not fall into the simple categories of four legs or two legs. For example, what about animals with no legs (snakes) or six legs (insects)? It inadequately enumerates the variety of beings it refers to.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The statement does not provide sufficient reasoning or evidence to conclude that four legs are inherently good and two legs are inherently bad.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: It implies causation without sufficient basis, suggesting that the number of legs determines the goodness or badness of a being.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Continually repeating this slogan does not enhance its validity or truth.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The statement presumes general agreement on this binary classification without proper justification or consensus.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The terms "good" and "bad" are ambiguous and subjective, failing to provide clear criteria for evaluation.

Thus, the statement "Four legs good, two legs bad" primarily suffers from **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** as it oversimplifies and inadequately represents the spectrum of beings.
