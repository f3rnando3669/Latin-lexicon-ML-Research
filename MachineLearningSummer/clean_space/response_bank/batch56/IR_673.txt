For 
In the argument provided, we are analyzing a statement that seems to describe a specific kind of fallacy used by a candidate during his class president election campaign. The candidate calls his opponent derogatory names which appears to be an ad hominem attack. 

Applying <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Types Algorithmically) to the statement in question means breaking it down to recognize which of the previously defined defective argument types it corresponds to. 

Here is the statement again for reference:
"In his class president election video, he called his student opponent 'a brown-nosing, suck up who only wanted to get on the teacher's good side,' which got him disqualified" IS an example of THIS fallacy.

Let's identify if it fits any of the defined defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**
   - This doesn't seem to involve a broad claim based on limited evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
   - This doesn't appear to involve listing only part of the evidence to support a conclusion.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
   - This isn't necessarily an inconclusive reason but rather a personal attack.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
   - The argument doesn't describe a cause-effect relationship being misrepresented.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
   - No repetition of propositions is evident.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
   - This doesn't involve assuming a consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**
   - The language used is not ambiguous but rather direct and pejorative.

Given this analysis, the statement: "In his class president election video, he called his student opponent 'a brown-nosing, suck up who only wanted to get on the teacher's good side,' which got him disqualified" is most directly associated with an **ad hominem fallacy**, which involves attacking the opponent personally instead of addressing their argument or policy positions.

Although none of the predefined defective arguments fit perfectly with classical ad hominem attacks, you might consider classifying it slightly outside of these terms or simply recognizing the nature of the personal attack itself. However, if forced to choose from the existing labels, "ad hominem" doesn't strictly align with any of the given categories. Thus, recognizing it as an **ad hominem fallacy** independently from predefined defective argument types should suffice in this context.
