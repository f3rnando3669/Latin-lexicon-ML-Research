For 
"I know in my heart of hearts that our home team will win the World Series."

Let's analyze this argument statement:

### Argument Analysis Using Identified Defective Argument Categories (IDAA):

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
    - There is no evidence of generalization in this statement. The person is making a specific claim about the outcome of the World Series and not generalizing about a broader category.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
    - This doesn't really enumerate possibilities or options, so <FE> doesn't apply here.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
    - The phrase "I know in my heart of hearts" does not provide a conclusive reason or evidence to support the claim. It's based on personal feeling rather than objective reasoning or evidence. This fits <IR>.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
    - There is no causal reasoning provided in the statement to support the prediction that the home team will win. The statement relies purely on a subjective feeling, fitting <WCB>.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
    - The argument isn't repeating a proposition. It's a single declarative statement, so <RR> doesn't apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
    - This statement does not make presumptions about a consensus or what others might think or feel. It's a personal assertion, not based on presumed general agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
    - The phrase "heart of hearts" is somewhat ambiguous, relying on a metaphor for deep conviction rather than clear, precise language. This could be seen to fit <DEP> because it uses emotionally charged but unclear language.

### Conclusion:
The argument "I know in my heart of hearts that our home team will win the World Series." primarily suffers from **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** because it offers no objective evidence or logical reasoning, just a personal feeling. Additionally, it involves **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** as it lacks any causal explanation and **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)** due to the metaphorical nature of "heart of hearts."

Therefore, the defective argument types applicable here are:
- **<IR>** Inconclusive Reason
- **<WCB>** Insufficient Causal Basis
- **<DEP>** Ambiguous Language
