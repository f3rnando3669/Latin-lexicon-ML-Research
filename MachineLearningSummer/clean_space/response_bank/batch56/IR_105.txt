You asked to identify defective argument types (referred to as <IDAA>) in the statement "Green Peace's strategies aren't effective because they are all dirty, lazy hippies."

Let's analyze the given statement:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This could apply here because the statement generalizes a group of people ("they are all dirty, lazy hippies") without substantiating that claim with evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This doesn't seem to fit perfectly here, as the statement doesn't attempt to enumerate reasons; it hinges on a single broad generalization.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This applies because the reason provided ("they are all dirty, lazy hippies") is not a conclusive or valid reason to determine the effectiveness of Green Peace's strategies.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This might be considered applicable because there is an implied cause-effect relationship (i.e., being "dirty, lazy hippies" causes ineffective strategies), but no sufficient basis is provided for this causal claim.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This type is not applicable here as there is no repetition of a proposition within the given statement.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This may apply if the argument is suggesting that "everyone" believes Green Peace members are "dirty, lazy hippies," thus using that perception as evidence, but the statement itself does not explicitly invoke consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language used in the statement ("dirty, lazy hippies") could be ambiguous and open to interpretation, and such language does not clarify the stance on the effectiveness of Green Peace's strategies.

Given these observations, the defective argument types that best apply to the statement "Green Peace's strategies aren't effective because they are all dirty, lazy hippies" are primarily:

1. **Generalization (G)**
2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
4. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**

These four categorizations address the broad generalization, the weak reasoning, the unsubstantiated causal connection, and the ambiguous, derogatory language.
