The argument presented can be identified and analyzed using the previously defined defective argument types. Let's break it down accordingly:

"The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism. Therefore, we must avoid atheism for the same reasons."

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
    - The argument might overly generalize the cause of the Soviet Union's collapse by attributing it solely to atheism. The fall of the Soviet Union was a complex event caused by numerous factors, including economic issues, political dynamics, and social unrest, among others. This simplification ignores other contributing elements and draws a broad conclusion from a narrow premise.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
    - The argument lists only one factor (atheism) while ignoring a comprehensive enumeration of all other potential causes. By focusing exclusively on atheism, the argument fails to provide a complete account of all contributing factors that led to the Soviet Union's collapse.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
    - The argument assumes a direct causal relationship without establishing solid evidence linking atheism to the collapse. Many other atheistic societies or nations have not suffered similar fates, indicating that the reasoning might be inconclusive or failing to consider other reasons.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
    - The argument lacks a sufficient causal basis to establish that atheism directly caused the collapse of the Soviet Union. There's insufficient evidence to support the claim that atheism was a primary or significant cause in comparison to other socio-political and economic factors.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: 
    - The argument does not seem to repetitively assert the same proposition. It is more focused on a single proposition rather than repeating a faulty one. Thus, this defective argument type does not apply directly here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
    - The argument may imply an assumed consensus that atheism is detrimental by using the Soviet Union as a cautionary tale. However, it does not substantiate this claim with wider evidence or representative examples.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
    - The phrase "taking up atheism" could be considered slightly ambiguous, as it doesn't clarify how or to what extent the Soviet Union's adoption of atheism influenced its policies. However, this potential ambiguity is not the primary issue; the main problems lie in the causal assumptions and generalizations made.

From the defective argument types defined, the most applicable to this argument are **Generalization (<G>)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**, **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
