For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Attributes. To apply <IDAA> to the given statement, we need to assess and identify the defective argument types present in the statement: "I have been around the block many times, and I have had my share of success. So believe me when I tell you that there is no better hobby than cat-juggling."

1. **Generalization <G>:** The statement generalizes an opinion about the best hobby based on the speaker's personal experiences without sufficient evidence to support such a broad claim.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>:** The speaker fails to consider other hobbies or provide a comprehensive comparison, simply asserting that cat-juggling is the best without evaluating alternatives. This constitutes an incomplete enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason <IR>:** The reasons given (being around the block and having success) are inconclusive and irrelevant to the claim about cat-juggling being the best hobby. There is no logical connection demonstrated between the speakerâ€™s personal success and the superiority of cat-juggling.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>:** The argument implies a causal relationship between the speaker's experiences and the truth of their claim about cat-juggling, without sufficient causal analysis to justify this conclusion.

5. **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>:** The claim subtly expects the audience to accept the statement as true simply based on the speaker's authority and experiences, assuming consensus without proper evidence or broad consideration.

6. **Ambiguous Language <DEP>:** The phrase "there is no better hobby" is ambiguous and subjective. It does not clearly define criteria for judging what makes one hobby better than another.

In summary, the statement exhibits multiple defective argument types including Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Presumptuous Consensus, and Ambiguous Language.
