It seems you've defined a set of defective argument types, but you haven't provided a definition for <IDAA>. Based on the context, <IDAA> could potentially be a directive or a label indicating the detection and analysis of defective arguments according to the classifications you've provided.

Assuming <IDAA> stands for "Identify Defective Argument Analysis," let's dissect the given argument: 

"If we don't adopt that puppy today, they might put him down. Do you want to be responsible for that?" Exclaimed Yasir.

We can categorize this argument using the types of defective arguments defined:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Yasir's argument presents a binary choice (either adopt the puppy today or be responsible for his potential demise) without considering other possible options (like other people adopting the puppy, or the shelter keeping him longer).

2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The conclusion that not adopting the puppy today leads to it being put down is based on an assumption without providing sufficient evidence that these are the only possible outcomes.

Using these categories, we can label the components of the argument as:

- The first part of the argument "If we don't adopt that puppy today, they might put him down" can be categorized under **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, assuming it doesn’t offer all possible outcomes.
- The emotional appeal in the question "Do you want to be responsible for that?" can be categorized under **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, as it leverages a fear-based assumption without groundwork.

Hence, Yasir’s argument contains aspects of both <FE> and <IR> defects.
