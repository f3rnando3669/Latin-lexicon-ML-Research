<IDAA>: Identify Defective Argument Attributes

1. **John: Members of the UbaTuba White Men's Club are upstanding citizens of the community.**
   - **Generalization (G)**: This statement makes a broad generalization about all members of the UbaTuba White Men's Club without providing specific evidence or acknowledging potential exceptions.

2. **Marvin: Then why are there so many of these members in jail?**
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Marvin implies that the presence of many members in jail is incompatible with John's statement, but he does not consider other explanations or offer a complete enumeration of all possible reasons why these members might be in jail.

3. **John: They were never true UbaTuba White Men's Club members.**
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: John's response is an example of the "No True Scotsman" fallacy, providing an inconclusive reason to dismiss the counterexample by asserting that those in jail were never "true" members without an objective criterion.

4. **Marvin: What’s a true UbaTuba White Men's Club member?**
   - **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Marvin's question highlights the ambiguity in John’s argument. The term "true UbaTuba White Men's Club member" is not clearly defined, making the discussion about membership and conduct unclear.

5. **John: Those who don't go to jail.**
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: John's final statement is a redefinition that repeats his initial proposition without addressing Marvin’s challenge. This repetition does not provide new information or evidence and fails to resolve the argument logically.

In summary, the argument is flawed due to **Generalization (G)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**, and **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**. Each speaker's statements are shown to possess defective attributes that weaken the overall discourse.
