For 
<IDAA> stands for a defective argument type known as Improper Dichotomy or Argument by Assertion.

Applying <IDAA> to the statement:

"The only solutions I can see to climate change is either mass extinction of humans, or passing this green bill."

Analysis:

This statement presents two extreme options as the only possible solutions to a complex issue, ignoring any potential middle ground or alternative solutions. By framing the argument in this way, the speaker is creating a false dichotomy, implying that these are the only two choices without considering other possible measures or strategies to address climate change.

Therefore, applying the label:

<IDAA>: "The only solutions I can see to climate change is either mass extinction of humans, or passing this green bill."

This indicates that the argument is employing an improper dichotomy, asserting that there are only two mutually exclusive outcomes when, in reality, a broad range of solutions could exist.
