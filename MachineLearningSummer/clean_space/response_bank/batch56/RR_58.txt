For 
To analyze the argument "Affirmative Action can never be fair or just. You cannot remedy one injustice by committing another." for any defective argument types (<IDAA>), I'll break down the statement and see which, if any, of the defined defective argument types apply.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This occurs if the argument makes broad assertions that don't account for exceptions.
   - "Affirmative Action can never be fair or just." While this is a strong claim, without evidence presented it could be seen as an overgeneralization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This occurs if the argument fails to consider all relevant cases or examples.
   - The statement does make an absolute claim about the fairness and justice of Affirmative Action without considering specific cases where it might be perceived differently. Hence, this fits incomplete enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This occurs if the reason given does not necessarily lead to the conclusion.
   - "You cannot remedy one injustice by committing another." This part presumes without evidence that Affirmative Action constitutes an injustice. If one does not inherently accept this premise, the reason is inconclusive to the stated conclusion.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This refers to a lack of causal connection between the premise and conclusion.
   - This could apply slightly, as the argument assumes a direct causal link (affront to injustice) without sufficient evidence establishing this.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This applies if the argument merely repeats the same point without new evidence.
   - The argument isn't quite repeating itself, but restating "Affirmative Action can never be fair or just" indirectly through the phrase "You cannot remedy one injustice by committing another."

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This occurs if the argument assumes everyone agrees with a contentious point.
   - The statements make broad claims expected to be accepted by all, presuming a consensus on Affirmative Action being unjust, without clearly establishing that all parties would agree on such.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This would apply if the argument uses vague or unclear terms that could be interpreted in different ways.
   - The argument uses terms like "injustice" and "fair," which can be subjective and interpreted variously by different audiences. This makes the language ambiguous.

**Application of <IDAA>**:

- **<G>:** The argument generalizes Affirmative Action as always being unfair/unjust.
- **<FE>:** Doesn't acknowledge specific cases or examples where Affirmative Action might be just or fair.
- **<IR>:** The conclusion that Affirmative Action is an injustice is not necessarily supported by the reason provided.
- **<WCB>:** Assumes a causality that is not sufficiently demonstrated.
- **<FU>:** Presumes a consensus on the idea that Affirmative Action is an injustice.
- **<DEP>:** Uses ambiguous terms like "injustice" and "fair."

Conclusively, the argument has several defective elements including Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Presumptuous Consensus, and Ambiguous Language.
