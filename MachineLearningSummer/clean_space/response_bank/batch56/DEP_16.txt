For 
The defective argument type in the provided statement can be designated as <DEP>, Ambiguous Language. The defendant is exploiting the ambiguity in the word "Fine" on the parking sign. In one sense, "fine" implies a monetary penalty, while in another sense, "fine" can mean that it is acceptable or permissible. By deliberately misunderstanding the sign's intended meaning, the defendant is presenting an argument based on this ambiguity.

Example:

"When the judge asked the defendant why he hadn't paid his parking fines, he said that he shouldn't have to pay them because the sign said 'Fine for parking here' and so he naturally presumed that it would be fine to park there." - <DEP> Ambiguous Language.
