The argument "If we put limits on the right to bear arms, soon all of our Constitutionally-given rights will be taken away" can be identified as containing a defective argument type:

**<IDAA>** Irrelevant Diverse Argument Agency (though it could be more accurately called a *Slippery Slope* fallacy in traditional fallacy terminology).

Here's how it might break down:
- **Slippery Slope**: This argument suggests that a relatively minor action (putting limits on the right to bear arms) will lead to a significant and undesirable outcome (all Constitutionally-given rights being taken away) without providing sufficient evidence for such an inevitable progression.

It assumes a cause-and-effect relationship without demonstrating a causal pattern or intermediate steps that logically justify this chain of events. Therefore, it introduces an irrelevant or excessive progression from the initial proposition.
