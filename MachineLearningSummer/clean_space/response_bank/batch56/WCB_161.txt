For 
To apply the framework of defective argument types to the statement "Every time I wash my car it rains; therefore, washing my car makes it rain," let's identify which specific type or types of defective arguments this example might represent:

**Applying Defective Argument Types:**

1. **(WCB) Insufficient Causal Basis:** The statement suggests a direct causal relationship between washing the car and it raining. However, there is no sufficient causal basis provided to support this claim. Correlation does not imply causation, and without further evidence, this argument is flawed.

   **Tag: \<WCB>**

2. **(G) Generalization:** This argument also generalizes based on the limited instances where washing the car and it raining occurred together. It implies that these few instances apply universally without sufficient evidence.

   **Tag: \<G>**

Putting it all together, the statement "Every time I wash my car it rains; therefore, washing my car makes it rain," exhibits the following defective argument types:

- **\<WCB>** Insufficient Causal Basis: The claim about causation is not substantiated with adequate evidence.
- **\<G>** Generalization: It takes a few instances and applies them broadly without justifiable support.

So, the tagged statement becomes:
"Every time I wash my car it rains; therefore, washing my car makes it rain." **\<WCB>** **\<G>**
