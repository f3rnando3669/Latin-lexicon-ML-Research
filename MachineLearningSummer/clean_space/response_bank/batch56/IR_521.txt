For 
<IDAA> stands for "Irrelevant Diversion from Actual Argument." This type of defective argument occurs when someone redirects attention away from the core argument or claim being discussed to something else that is not directly related.

When applying <IDAA> to ", rather than on his arguments or opinions.":

It appears that the phrase ", rather than on his arguments or opinions" is suggesting that a focus is being shifted away from someone's arguments or opinions to something else. If the context indicates that this shift is irrelevant to the core discussion, it would be an Irrelevant Diversion from Actual Argument.

Example: "You should not trust what Bob says because he dresses poorly, rather than on his arguments or opinions."

In this example, the focus is being shifted from the merit of Bob's arguments or opinions to an irrelevant aspect of his personal appearance, which constitutes an irrelevant diversion from the actual argument.

Therefore, the phrase as it stands implies an <IDAA> because it suggests focusing on a detail unrelated to the main arguments or opinions presented.
