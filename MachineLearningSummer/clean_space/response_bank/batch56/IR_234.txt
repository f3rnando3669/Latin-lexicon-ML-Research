For 
<IDAA> refers to "Identify, Describe, Analyze, and Address" a defective argument. Let's break down the given argument using the <IDAA> framework:

1. **Identify**:
   - **Identification of the arguments** within the statement:
     - "Medical expenses for the elderly continue to rise."
     - "If you don't buy long-term health insurance now, you probably won't be able to qualify once you're older."
     - "Sure, the insurance policy is a little expensive, but it's worth spending the money today so you don't go bankrupt in the future, becoming a burden to your family."

2. **Describe**:
   - The argument aims to convince the reader to buy long-term health insurance now to avoid potential financial hardship and dependence on family in the future.

3. **Analyze**:
   - Let’s examine the potential defective argument types present:
     1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
        - The statement "Medical expenses for the elderly continue to rise" could be viewed as a generalization without providing specific evidence or considering exceptions.
   
     2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
        - The assumption that "If you don't buy long-term health insurance now, you probably won't be able to qualify once you're older" does not list possible exceptions or other options that might be available to the readers.

     3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
        - The link between buying insurance now and avoiding bankruptcy in the future is not conclusively supported. There are many variables that can affect this outcome, not considered in the argument.
   
     4. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
        - The phrase "you probably won't be able to qualify once you're older" assumes a consensus or common knowledge that might not be accurate.

4. **Address**:
   - To strengthen the argument, additional evidence and a more balanced view could be provided:
     1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Provide statistical data and specific examples to substantiate the claim that “medical expenses for the elderly continue to rise.”
   
     2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Acknowledge and discuss other options and scenarios. For example, mention that some people may still qualify for insurance or other financial aids even if they buy later.
   
     3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Include more empirical evidence or studies that support the connection between buying insurance now and preventing future financial hardship.
   
     4. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Avoid making broad presumptions without backing them with data or acknowledging the nuances, and clearly specify under what conditions the statement holds true.

By addressing these points, the argument would be more robust and less likely to be categorized as defective.
