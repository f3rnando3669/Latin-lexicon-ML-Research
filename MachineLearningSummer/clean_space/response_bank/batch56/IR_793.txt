For 
The defective argument type <IDAA> is not defined in your provided list. It seems there might be a typo, or you might be referring to one of the listed defective argument types. Let's try to identify the appropriate type from those you've defined: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), and Ambiguous Language (DEP).

Given the scenario where you are diverting your mom's attention from the phone bill to talking about your math class and test, the argument falls under the category of distraction, which isn't defined directly in your list. However, this is commonly known as a Red Herring fallacy in logical terms. In the context of the defined defective argument types, none directly map to a Red Herring fallacy.

If you meant <IDAA> to be a new or another commonly known defective argument type related to distraction (such as *Irrelevant Diversion or Avoiding the Issue*), it would match the scenario you provided. But since it's not listed, we can proceed with understanding this as an attempt to divert attention and not directly address the issue at hand, which is the phone bill.

If there is a need for an exact match to the list provided, clarification or redefinition of <IDAA> would be necessary to apply it precisely.
