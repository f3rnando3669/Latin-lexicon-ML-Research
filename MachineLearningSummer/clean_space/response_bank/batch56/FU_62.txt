For 
The passage "Everyone who is really into gaming already owns the latest video game. Don't be the only one left out!" contains a logical fallacy known as **Bandwagon** (Appeal to Popularity).

Hereâ€™s why:

- **Bandwagon Fallacy**: The argument suggests that because other people (those who are really into gaming) are doing something (owning the latest video game), you should do it too to avoid being left out. It appeals to the desire to fit in with the majority, rather than providing any substantive reasoning for why one should own the latest video game.

In the context of the defective argument types defined, this can be identified under the broader issue of **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** because it presumes a consensus ("everyone... owns the latest video game") to persuade someone to conform without offering concrete evidence or reasoning.
