For 
<IDAA> stands for Identify Defective Argument Application. In this case, let's analyze the given statement: "Let's talk about Glaucon. Where did you get the poison you used on him?"

First, let's break down the elements involved in the statement:

1. **Red Herring (or Distraction) issue**: The opening sentence "Let's talk about Glaucon" aims to distract from the real issue at hand by shifting focus to Glaucon.
2. **Loaded Question**: The follow-up question "Where did you get the poison you used on him?" presupposes that the person actually poisoned Glaucon, which may not be true.

Now, let's classify these issues under the defective argument types we've defined:

1. **Loaded Question** (a type of defective argument not explicitly listed but implied): This occurs when a question contains an assumption that hasn't been proven or accepted by all the people involved. The question presumes guilt regarding poisoning Glaucon without evidence or an established basis.

2. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The phrase "Let's talk about Glaucon" can be a distraction, which isn't entirely an example of ambiguous language but a tactic often used in defective arguments.

Given these elements, the primary defective argument type here is **Loaded Question**. However, since Loaded Question doesn't match exactly with the defective arguments we've listed, the closest match in the predefined types is:

- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: While not a perfect fit, the question's presumption about poisoning involves ambiguous and leading implications about what happened with Glaucon.

Therefore, applying <IDAA> to the statement "Let's talk about Glaucon. Where did you get the poison you used on him?" considers it primarily a case of **Loaded Question** with some aspect of **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**.
