For 
To apply the Incorrect Defective Argument Application (<IDAA>), let's correctly identify the potential defective argument(s) present in the statement: "sending M-16s to Syrian rebels inevitably means boots on the ground in Damascus."

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The statement presents a cause-and-effect relationship as inevitable without sufficient supporting evidence. It generalizes that one specific action (sending M-16s) will lead to another specific outcome (boots on the ground).

2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - It assumes causation without providing sufficient evidence or causal link between sending M-16s and the necessity of boots on the ground. The argument implies an inevitable outcome without substantiating the causal pathway convincingly.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The argument presumes an inevitable consequence but fails to address or rule out other potential outcomes, making the reason inconclusive.

By correctly identifying these issues, the original argument can be seen as relying on an insufficient causal basis, making generalized statements without adequate support, and offering inconclusive reasons.

Therefore, the <IDAA> reveals that the original statement is flawed due to Generalization (<G>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), and Inconclusive Reason (<IR>).
