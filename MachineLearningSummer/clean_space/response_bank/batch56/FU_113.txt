The statement "40 million people can't be wrong! Buy the new iPhone XIV today!" can be analyzed for defective arguments. 

Applying definitions of defective argument types:

<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration): The statement implies that because 40 million people have bought the iPhone XIV, it is the best choice. This overlooks other potential viewpoints or factors that might influence a purchasing decision. It fails to provide a complete enumeration of reasons why one should buy the iPhone XIV aside from its popularity.

<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus): This statement assumes that because a large number of people have bought the iPhone XIV, it must be the correct or best choice. It presumes that the consensus of these 40 million people is an adequate reason without addressing any potential biases or different contexts that might explain this consensus.

<IR> (Inconclusive Reason): The reason provided—that 40 million people have bought the iPhone XIV—does not directly conclude that other individuals should also buy it. The popularity of the product does not necessarily imply its quality, suitability, or value for every potential consumer.

Thus, the statement "40 million people can't be wrong! Buy the new iPhone XIV today!" primarily involves <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration), <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus), and <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) as its defective argument types.
