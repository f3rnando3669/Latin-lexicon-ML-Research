Sure, let's apply the identified defective argument types (IDAA) to the conversation provided:

**NASA: Yes, we really did successfully land men on the moon.  
TinFoilHatGuy1969: Yeah, right. And Elvis is really dead.**

1. **Generalization (G)**: This might not directly apply here, as Generalization typically involves making a broad assertion based on limited evidence. TinFoilHatGuy1969 is not making a broad assertion but rather implying disbelief.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable here, as neither argument is presenting a list or count of factors.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: 
   - **TinFoilHatGuy1969**: "Yeah, right. And Elvis is really dead."
     - This response implies skepticism of the moon landing by drawing a parallel to the disbelief in Elvis's death. However, there is no logical connection between the two statements, making the reason inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This isn't directly relevant here since WCB involves causal connections that are not well-established, which isn't the case in this exchange.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Not applicable since thereâ€™s no repeated proposition within this exchange.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There is an insinuation that people who believe Elvis isn't dead will also doubt the moon landing occurred, which could be considered drawing on some presumed consensus among skeptics. However, this is a bit weak to definitively apply FU.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: 
   - **TinFoilHatGuy1969**: "Yeah, right. And Elvis is really dead."
     - The statement can be seen as DEP because it uses sarcasm and implies disbelief without stating a clear reason why the moon landing is doubted.

In conclusion, the dominant defective argument type here is **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, as TinFoilHatGuy1969's statement does not provide a logically sound reason for disbelieving NASA's claim. There is also an element of **Ambiguous Language (DEP)** due to the use of sarcasm without clear, explicit reasoning.
