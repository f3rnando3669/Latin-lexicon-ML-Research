Certainly! The statement "I saw a student texting in my class yesterday; all my students must be texting, so cell phones should be banned." can be analyzed for defective arguments based on the types you've defined.

Here’s the analysis using the given codes:

1. **Generalization <G>**:
   - The speaker is generalizing from the observation of a single student texting to conclude that all students must be texting. This is a form of hasty generalization.
   - **Code**: <G>

2. **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>**:
   - The argument doesn't consider other instances or evidence that may contradict the claim that all students are texting. It's prematurely concluding from insufficient data.
   - **Code**: <FE>

3. **Inconclusive Reason <IR>**:
   - The reason given – that one student was texting – is not strong enough to justify the conclusion that all students are doing so.
   - **Code**: <IR>

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>**:
   - There's an implied causal relation that seeing one student texting leads to the conclusion that all are texting and therefore a ban is necessary. The causal connection lacks sufficient basis.
   - **Code**: <WCB>

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>**:
   - The argument doesn't feature repetition of a proposition, so this code is not applicable here.
   - **Code**: N/A

6. **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>**:
   - There's no direct appeal to a consensus or presumption of agreement among others, so this code doesn't apply.
   - **Code**: N/A

7. **Ambiguous Language <DEP>**:
   - The language here is not particularly ambiguous; it's fairly direct and clear in its wording.
   - **Code**: N/A

Overall, the argument "I saw a student texting in my class yesterday; all my students must be texting, so cell phones should be banned." exhibits defective argument types of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, and <WCB>.
