For 
It appears that you are defining various types of defective arguments and would like an application of "<IDAA>" to the statement "Distracting and dangerous mobile devices should be banned from use in vehicles." However, "<IDAA>" is not defined in your provided list of defective argument types. If you meant to define yet another type of argument, please provide its definition. 

For now, I will evaluate the given statement using the defective argument types you have defined:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** 
   - If the statement is concluded based on a few instances of accidents caused by mobile devices without enough data to support that they are a widespread issue, it could be a Generalization.
   - Example: "In the last month, there were five accidents in our town due to mobile devices. Therefore, mobile devices should be banned from use in vehicles."

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - If the statement fails to consider other factors that could be equally distracting besides mobile devices, it might be an Incomplete Enumeration.
   - Example: "Mobile devices are the only reason for distractions in vehicles."

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - If the reasons provided for the ban are not sufficient or conclusive to justify it, it might be an Inconclusive Reason.
   - Example: "Because some people use mobile devices irresponsibly, all mobile devices should be banned."

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - If there's insufficient evidence to directly link the use of mobile devices to a significant number of accidents or injuries, this could be an Insufficient Causal Basis.
   - Example: "There is no rigorous study linking mobile device use directly to accidents, but they should still be banned."

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - If the argument simply restates the proposition without adding any supporting evidence, it could be a Faulty Repetition of Proposition.
   - Example: "Mobile devices are distracting and dangerous, so they should be banned. Therefore, mobile devices should be banned."

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - If the statement assumes that everyone agrees that mobile devices are a significant problem without any evidence of such a consensus, it fits into Presumptuous Consensus.
   - Example: "Everyone knows that mobile devices are dangerous, so they should be banned from vehicles."

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - If key terms in the statement are not clearly defined, leading to confusion or misinterpretation, it could be Ambiguous Language.
   - Example: "What exactly constitutes a 'distracting' or 'dangerous' mobile device? Are hands-free devices included?"

Given your list of defective argument types, the statement might exhibit some of them such as Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, or Ambiguous Language based on how the argument is structured and presented. If "<IDAA>" refers to a specific type among these or a different one, please provide its definition for a more accurate application.
