For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Analysis. Here's how we can apply this to the given statement:

**Statement:** "Broccoli has significantly less fat than the leading candy bar! Plus, it's nowhere near as hot as Hot Cheetos!"

**Analysis:**

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The statement about broccoli having less fat than a leading candy bar may be too broad and generalized. It implies that all leading candy bars have significant fat content without specifying which candy bar is being compared.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The comparison does not consider other aspects of nutrition, such as sugar content, vitamins, or minerals. It cherry-picks a couple of metrics (fat content and spiciness) while ignoring a comprehensive analysis.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The fact that broccoli has less fat than a candy bar is true but partly irrelevant to overall health benefits. Likewise, the comparative spiciness to Hot Cheetos is inconclusive in evaluating its health value.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - This argument lacks a sufficient causal basis to claim that the nutritional value of broccoli over a leading candy bar or Hot Cheetos is superior solely based on fat content and spiciness.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - There is no clear repetition here, but reiterating well-known facts like "broccoli has less fat than candy bars" without further context can introduce redundancy in a different context.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - It indirectly assumes a consensus that leads one to believe lower fat and less spiciness alone make broccoli superior, which might be a presumptive simplification.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - The phrase "significantly less" is ambiguous without numerical comparison. Similarly, "nowhere near as hot" is subjective and lacks a measurable metric.

In summary, the argument presents:

- A **Generalization** (<G>) by implying all leading candy bars are high in fat.
- **Incomplete Enumeration** (<FE>) by focusing narrowly on only fat content and spiciness.
- **Inconclusive Reason** (<IR>) since the rationale for comparison doesn't fully address overall nutritional value.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis** (<WCB>) as it doesn't establish a comprehensive cause-and-effect relationship on why these parameters alone define superiority.
- **Ambiguous Language** (<DEP>) that doesn't provide clear, measurable criteria for the comparisons.

This analysis demonstrates multiple defective arguments in the statement provided.
