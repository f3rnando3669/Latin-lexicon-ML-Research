For 
<IDAA> stands for the identification of defective arguments applied to a particular statement or argument. Let's apply this to the given statement:

**Statement**: "Politician: We have to decide if we are going to support school choice or if we are going to support failing schools. Those are the only two options."

This statement is an example of a logical fallacy known as a "false dilemma" or "false dichotomy," where the speaker presents only two options when, in reality, more options might exist.

Upon analysis, the defective argument type that this statement corresponds to is:

**Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement fails to list all possible options and oversimplifies the issue into two polar choices, ignoring other potential solutions or pathways that might exist for improving schools or supporting education in general.

Thus, the proper categorization under <IDAA> would be:

"<FE> Incomplete Enumeration."
