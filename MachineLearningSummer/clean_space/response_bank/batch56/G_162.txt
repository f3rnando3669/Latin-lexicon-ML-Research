For 
The defective argument type <IDAA> stands for "Identify Defective Argument and Analyze Application."

First, let's identify the defective argument present in the statement:

"Don't let your cousin borrow $10.00. Next, he's going to be borrowing money from you every day."

This statement can be classified as a defective argument type called Generalization (<G>), and it may also share characteristics with Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>).

### Analysis:

1. **Identification**:
    - **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument takes a single instance of behavior (borrowing $10.00) and exaggerates it to suggest an ongoing, indefinite pattern of borrowing every day. This is an unwarranted overgeneralization based on insufficient evidence.
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not consider all possible scenarios in which the cousin may not borrow money continuously. It assumes a specific outcome without considering other potential factors or evidence.

2. **Application**:
    - By applying <G>, we can see that the concern arises from a single instance extrapolated to an extreme, without adequate supporting context.
    - By considering <FE>, the statement lacks a comprehensive analysis and does not enumerate potential reasons why the cousin might not repeat borrowing or might behave differently in the future.

### Conclusion:

The statement "Don't let your cousin borrow $10.00. Next, he's going to be borrowing money from you every day." is a defective argument primarily due to Generalization (<G>), with aspects of Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>). This leads to an unwarranted assumption and a failure to consider other possible outcomes.
