For 
To apply the framework of Identifying Defective Arguments Analysis (IDAA) to the statement "There must be objective rights and wrongs in the universe. If not, how can you possibly say that torturing babies for fun could ever be right?", we need to identify which types of defective arguments might be present.

Let’s break down the statement and see if any of the defined defective arguments apply.

1. **Generalization (<G>):** Does the argument make a broad generalization from a limited set of data?  
   - In this case, the statement doesn't seem to be making a broad generalization from limited data. 

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Does the argument ignore possible alternatives or fail to consider all relevant options?
   - The statement sets up a binary choice (either there are objective rights and wrongs or torturing babies for fun could be right). This does ignore the possibility of other ethical frameworks (such as subjective or intersubjective morality), suggesting that it might be an Incomplete Enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Does the argument rest on a premise that doesn't adequately support the conclusion?
   - The premise that torturing babies for fun is wrong doesn’t necessarily prove the existence of objective rights and wrongs. Thus, the reasoning may be inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Does the argument fail to establish a causal relationship?
   - This type doesn’t seem directly applicable here since the statement is more about moral beliefs rather than a causal relationship.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Does the argument simply repeat the proposition in different words without providing new evidence?
   - This type may not apply directly, as the statement doesn’t merely repeat itself but attempts to use a specific example to argue for the general principle.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Does the argument assume that a consensus exists when it might not?
   - This type could apply because the argument assumes that everyone agrees that torturing babies for fun is wrong, thus using this presumed consensus to argue for objective morals.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** Does the argument use language that is unclear or open to multiple interpretations?
   - The terms “objective rights and wrongs” are inherently ambiguous and might be interpreted in multiple ways.

In conclusion, the statement "There must be objective rights and wrongs in the universe. If not, how can you possibly say that torturing babies for fun could ever be right?" seems to contain several types of defective arguments:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The statement ignores other possible ethical frameworks outside of objective morals.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The premise about torturing babies doesn’t necessarily support the conclusion about objective morals.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The argument assumes a universal agreement on the immorality of torturing babies.
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** The terms “objective rights and wrongs” are unclear and open to different interpretations.

Thus, these defective argument types collectively undermine the strength of the statement's reasoning.
