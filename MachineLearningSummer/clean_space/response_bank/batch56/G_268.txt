First, let's clarify what "IDAA" stands for: Identifying Defective Argument Application. We will apply it to the provided statement to determine which of the defined defective argument types it falls under.

The statement: "This fallacy suggests that unlikely or ridiculous outcomes are likely when there’s just not enough evidence to think so."

Based on the definition, this sounds like a form of fallacy where an argument is made about unlikely or exaggerated consequences without sufficient evidence. Which of the defective argument types does it fit into from the definitions we have?

- **<G> Generalization**: This fallacy doesn't seem to make a broad generalization based on limited evidence.
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: This isn't about failing to consider all necessary aspects or options.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: There is some overlap here, since inconclusive reasoning could involve suggesting outcomes without enough evidence, but it's more about conclusions that don't follow based on provided reasons.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: This could apply since the fallacy suggests an outcome without a causal basis that is sufficient or supported by evidence.
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: This isn't about repetitively asserting the same claim without new support.
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: This isn't about assuming everyone agrees without sufficient basis.
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**: This isn't about ambiguous language or unclear terminology.

Based on the provided definitions, it seems that the statement "This fallacy suggests that unlikely or ridiculous outcomes are likely when there’s just not enough evidence to think so" most closely fits under <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis. This is because it describes a scenario where a conclusion (unlikely or ridiculous outcomes) is drawn without adequate evidence to support the causal link.

So the applied defective argument type is:
**<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis.**
