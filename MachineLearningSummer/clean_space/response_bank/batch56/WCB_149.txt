For 
Applying the defective argument analysis (<IDAA>) to "Every time I go to sleep, the sun goes down. Therefore, my sleeping causes the sun to set.":

This argument can be identified as having the following defective argument types:

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument improperly establishes a causal connection between two events that merely correlate: going to sleep and the sun setting. There is no sufficient causal basis to conclude that one causes the other.

By marking it with <WCB>, we highlight the fundamental flaw in the argument:

"Every time I go to sleep, the sun goes down. Therefore, my sleeping causes the sun to set." <WCB>

This highlights the incorrect causal relationship and the defect in reasoning within the argument.
