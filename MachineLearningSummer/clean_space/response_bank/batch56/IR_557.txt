For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identify, Define, Analyze, and Address the Argument) to the statement "Studies show that it takes up to seven years for the human body to digest a piece of gum," we can proceed as follows:

### Identify
The claim here is that "Studies show that it takes up to seven years for the human body to digest a piece of gum."

### Define
We need to determine which, if any, defective argument types apply to this claim:
1. **Generalization (<G>)** - Making a broad conclusion based on limited information.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** - Failing to consider all relevant instances.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** - Offering a reason that does not fully support the conclusion.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** - Assigning causation without sufficient evidence.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)** - Repeating a claim without substantiation.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)** - Assuming general agreement where none exists.
7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)** - Using unclear or vague terms.

### Analyze
- **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement generalizes that all gum behaves the same way in every human body based on unspecified studies. This lacks detail on the methodology, sample size, and scope, which can render it a hasty generalization.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The claim does not consider other possible outcomes or the variation in digestion among different people, which can be an incomplete enumeration.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Without specific studies cited, the reason (studies saying it takes seven years to digest gum) is inconclusive in supporting the claim.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The statement implicitly suggests that gum uniquely takes seven years to digest without sufficient causal evidence for this duration.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The statement may reflect a commonly repeated myth rather than a substantiated fact.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: By saying "studies show," it presumes a scientific consensus that may not exist.
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The phrase "studies show" and "up to seven years" are vague. It doesn't specify which studies or provide clear, measurable data.

### Address
The claim "Studies show that it takes up to seven years for the human body to digest a piece of gum" can be addressed by citing actual, specific studies and scientific evidence that have been peer-reviewed. It is also essential to clarify any ambiguous language used in the statement and to avoid making generalizations without proper support.

For instance, one can refute this by noting that while gum is not digestible, it passes through the digestive system relatively intact and is excreted in stool within a few days, just like other indigestible materials. This aligns with common medical understanding and debunks the myth.

### Conclusion
The statement primarily exhibits characteristics of an Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), and Ambiguous Language (<DEP>). To provide a stronger argument, one should supply concrete evidence and clarify any ambiguities surrounding the claim.
