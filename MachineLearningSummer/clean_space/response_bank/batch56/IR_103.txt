For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application.

Given the statement "Attacks the arguer instead of the argument," the correct identification of the defective argument type in this context is **Ad Hominem**, which does not belong to the provided defective argument types (Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Presumptuous Consensus, and Ambiguous Language).

However, if we were to apply <IDAA> to encapsulate the essence of "attacking the arguer instead of the argument," it would align closely with reasoning defects where personal attacks are made, rather than focusing on the logical structure of the argument itself. While Ad Hominem stands as a distinct category, it can be seen as falling outside the specified types unless we consider a broader classification system that includes personal attack fallacies.

Thus, the defective argument type for the statement "Attacks the arguer instead of the argument" is best categorized under **Ad Hominem** which does not match any of the defined defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP>.
