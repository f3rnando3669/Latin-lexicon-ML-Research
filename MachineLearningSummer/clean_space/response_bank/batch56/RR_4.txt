For 
To analyze the argument presented in the statement "Why must you always take positions that are so unscientific?" using the defective argument types defined, we apply the method <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Application). Let's break down the sentence:

**Statement:** "Why must you always take positions that are so unscientific?"

**Defective Argument Types:**

1. **Generalization (G):** The argument assumes that the person always takes unscientific positions without considering specific instances.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** It does not specify or enumerate the "unscientific positions" being referred to, thus lacking necessary detail.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** It does not provide reasons why the positions are unscientific; it makes an assertion without evidence.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Assumes a cause (the person must take unscientific positions) without justifying why this must be the case.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This defective argument is not applicable because the statement does not repetitively assert the same proposition without evidence.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This is not applicable as the argument does not claim consensus.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The term "unscientific" could be considered vague or subjective, lacking clear definition within the argument.

### Application of <IDAA>:

Upon analyzing, we can list the relevant defective argument types identified:

1. **Generalization (G):** The phrase "always take positions" overgeneralizes the behavior of the person.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument does not specify which positions are unscientific.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** No reasons or evidence are provided to support why the positions are unscientific.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** There is an implied necessity (must take unscientific positions) without a causal basis.
5. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The term "unscientific" is ambiguous and not clearly defined.

### Conclusion:
The statement "Why must you always take positions that are so unscientific?" can be identified as defective due to its reliance on **Generalization (G)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, and **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**.
