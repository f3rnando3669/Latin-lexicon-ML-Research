A defective argument type often associated with falsely claiming or assuming an "either/or" situation, when in fact there are additional logically valid options, is known as a false dichotomy or false dilemma. However, based on the context provided, I will define a new defective argument type called "Inaccurate Dichotomy/Asserting Alternatives" (IDAA):

IDAA: When a statement falsely claims or assumes an "either/or" situation, when in fact there is at least one additional logically valid option, it is called an Inaccurate Dichotomy/Asserting Alternatives.

In this context, IDAA is used to highlight the logical flaw of presenting only two alternatives when more options are actually available. This flaw can lead to misleading conclusions and restricts the debate or reasoning artificially.
