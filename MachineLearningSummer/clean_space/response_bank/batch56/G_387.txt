For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Analysis. To apply <IDAA> to the given scenario, we need to first identify which type of defective argument or fallacy Jeff's mom has committed. Here is the detailed analysis:

- **Scenario**: Jeff's mom is concerned when she finds out that he skipped class one day. She tells him that she is concerned that since he skipped one class, he will start skipping more frequently. Then he will drop out altogether, never graduate or get into college, and end up unemployed and living at home for the rest of his life.

The argument made by Jeff's mom can be analyzed as follows:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This fallacy might be present if Jeff's mom assumes that skipping class once necessarily leads to all the subsequent negative outcomes without sufficient evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable here since the argument doesn’t involve listing of possibilities and missing out on other potential reasons or events.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This might be a potential candidate, as the mom assumes skipping a class once will lead to permanently skipping classes and a negative outcome without conclusive evidence linking these events.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This is another strong candidate given that there’s an insufficient causal link between skipping one class and the series of catastrophic events described.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This is not pertinent since the argument does not repetitively assert the same proposition without additional support.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This is not present as the argument does not invoke a presumed consensus to support the claim.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language does not appear to be ambiguous; the statements made are quite clear in their intended meaning.

In reviewing these options, the most fitting defective argument type for Jeff's mom's concern is **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. Jeff's mom is assuming a direct, inevitable causal chain from skipping a single class to a series of extreme life outcomes, without providing sufficient evidence for such a strong causal relationship.

**Conclusion**: The fallacy that Jeff's mom has committed is best described as <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
