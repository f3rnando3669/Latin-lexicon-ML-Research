For 
"Is your stupidity inborn?" is an example of a defective argument type known as a Definitional Impossibility (IDAA). This kind of argument presents a loaded question or a complex question fallacy, which presupposes a claim that is not yet proven and forces the respondent into a corner. By asking whether someone's "stupidity" is inborn, it implies that the person is indeed stupid without providing any argument or proof for that assertion. This traps the respondent between two undesirable alternatives, either admitting to being stupid or denying an unproven claim about their inborn nature.
