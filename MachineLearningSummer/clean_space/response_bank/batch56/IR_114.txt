For 
To apply your defined defective argument types to the statement "Cocaine is all natural; therefore, it is good for you," we will identify which type(s) of defective argument apply here.

Let's deconstruct the statement:

1. "Cocaine is all natural" – This is a premise that suggests the natural origin of cocaine.
2. "Therefore, it is good for you" – This is the conclusion drawn, suggesting that because something is natural, it must be beneficial.

We can now assess which defective argument types are relevant:

1. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason** – The fact that cocaine is natural does not logically lead to the conclusion that it is good for you. There is an incomplete connection between the premise and the conclusion.

2. **<G> Generalization** – This argument takes a very specific case (cocaine) and tries to apply a general rule (natural things are good for you). However, this generalization is misleading, as not all natural substances are beneficial.

3. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis** – The argument implies a causal relationship between being natural and being good for health, but there are not enough grounds to establish this causality convincingly.

4. **<DEP> Ambiguous Language** – The term "natural" is used ambiguously here. In one context, "natural" can mean originating from nature, but it does not inherently mean safe or beneficial, which is a misleading usage.

Therefore, the statement "Cocaine is all natural; therefore, it is good for you" can be identified as containing the following defective argument types: **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**, **<G> (Generalization)**, **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**, and **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language)**.
