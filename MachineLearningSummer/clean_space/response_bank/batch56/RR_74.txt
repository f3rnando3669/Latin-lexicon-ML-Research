For 
To apply the framework you've provided to analyze the argument, "The President said he will not allow disrespectful dissent.", let's go through each of the defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: Generalization refers to drawing a broad conclusion from a small sample. However, this statement doesn't appear to generalize any wider population based on insufficient data.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This is when not all relevant options or scenarios are considered. The statement could potentially imply different forms of dissent without enumerating them, but it doesn't explicitly detail any incomplete list.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This occurs when the reasoning provided does not conclusively support the conclusion. The statement provides no reasoning or evidence, so it isn't clearly using inconclusive reasoning.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This refers to claiming a cause-effect relationship without sufficient basis. The statement doesn't imply any causal relationship directly, so this doesn't apply.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This involves repeating a proposition without providing additional support. The statement is a single claim rather than a repeated proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This is assuming agreement or consensus without evidence of such. The statement implies an authoritative stance but doesn't claim a consensus, so this does not apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Ambiguous Language occurs when a term or phrase is not clearly defined which could lead to multiple interpretations. The phrase "disrespectful dissent" is indeed ambiguous since "disrespectful" is subjective and can vary greatly in interpretation.

Based on the given definitions, the defective argument type that best applies to this statement is:

- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**: The term "disrespectful dissent" lacks clarity and can lead to various interpretations of what would be considered "disrespectful," making the statement ambiguous.

So, the argument type to apply is:

**IDAA: DEP**
