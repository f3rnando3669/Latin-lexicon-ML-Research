For 
Let's apply the definitions and argument defects to the given statement via the IDAA (Identify, Define, Apply, and Analyze) methodology.

### Identify
The given statement is an example of the **"No True Scotsman"** fallacy. The argument involves Angus making a broad claim about Scotsmen and then rejecting a counterexample by altering the definition.

### Define
An argument being made here is of the type "Generalization and Rejection of Counterexamples”:
- Angus initially generalizes that Scotsmen do not put sugar on their porridge.
- Lachlan presents a counterexample, stating he is a Scotsman who does put sugar on his porridge.
- Angus redefines what it means to be a Scotsman to exclude Lachlan.

### Apply
Apply the defective argument types to the statement:

1. **Generalization (G)**: Angus declares that Scotsmen do not put sugar on their porridge, a broad and unqualified generalization.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Angus doesn't provide comprehensive evidence for this claim; instead, he uses a personal belief or an unverified assumption about all Scotsmen.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning provided isn't logically sound, as the definition of a Scotsman can't be altered to suit an argument.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There's no sufficient causal basis suggesting real Scotsmen must not sugar their porridge.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: By claiming "no true Scotsman sugars his porridge," Angus repeats his initial generalization without supporting evidence.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Angus presumes consensus about what it means to be a "true Scotsman" without evidence that all Scotsmen agree on this characteristic.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The term “true Scotsman” is not clearly defined and is manipulated ambiguously to reject Lachlan’s counterexample.

### Analyze
After identifying the argument defects, categorize and map them to the parts of the argument:
- Angus's argument that no Scotsman sugars his porridge (**G**, **FE**, **IR**).
- Rejection of Lachlan as a Scotsman (**G**, **WCB**, **RR**, **FU**, **DEP**).

As a whole, Angus's response is primarily a defective argument because it seeks to protect the initial generalization by dismissing counterexamples unreasonably. He uses ambiguous language and unverified consensus to support his point without a valid causal basis.

In conclusion, the statement "Angus declares that Scotsmen do not put sugar on their porridge, to which Lachlan points out that he is a Scotsman and puts sugar on his porridge. Furious, like a true Scot, Angus yells that no true Scotsman sugars his porridge." includes a blend of the defective argument types defined (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, and <DEP>), highlighting the initial generalizing fallacy and the manipulative redefinition to avoid contradiction.
