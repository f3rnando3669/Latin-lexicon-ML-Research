For 
To apply a defective argument type to the statement "Historians agree that studying the past is the best way to avoid repeating mistakes," we must identify any flaws in the reasoning or issues that make the argument defective. Based on the given definitions, the statement might involve the following defective argument types:

1. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The claim "Historians agree" suggests a consensus among historians that may not actually exist. It presumes that all or most historians hold this view without providing sufficient evidence or acknowledging the possibility of dissenting opinions.

2. **Generalization (G)**: The statement generalizes the opinion of "historians" without specifying how many historians share this view or what evidence they base it on. It presents the conclusion "the best way to avoid repeating mistakes" as universally accepted, which might not be true for all historians.

Thus, applying <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Application) to the statement:

- **FU**: The claim may be presumptive, suggesting a consensus among historians without supporting evidence. It assumes that the majority, or all historians, agree without providing specific supporting documentation.
- **G**: The statement makes a broad generalization regarding historians' agreement, which might oversimplify or misrepresent the diversity of opinions that historians might actually hold.

Given this analysis, the statement "Historians agree that studying the past is the best way to avoid repeating mistakes" can be considered defective due to **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** and **Generalization (G)**.
