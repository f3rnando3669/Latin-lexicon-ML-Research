For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given conversation:

<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Applied Analysis. In the conversation provided:

**Bob:** "that movie was a waste of time and money"
**Ted:** "what was wrong with it?"
**Bob:** "It sucked"

Letâ€™s analyze Bob's response "It sucked" in response to Ted's question "what was wrong with it?":

1. **Generalization (G):** This argument type involves drawing a broad conclusion from a small sample. Bob's statement "It sucked" does not provide specific reasons that can be considered a generalization based solely on Bob's personal view.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This occurs when not all possibilities or relevant alternatives are considered. Bob does not provide a detailed account of specific aspects; instead, he gives a vague, all-encompassing comment.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This occurs when the reason provided does not conclusively support the conclusion. Bob's response "It sucked" is subjective and does not give objective reasons that could support the assertion that the movie was a waste of time and money.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This occurs when there is not enough information provided to establish a causal link. Bob does not explain why the movie was a waste of time and money.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This occurs when an argument simply repeats the initial proposition without adding new information. Bob's statement "It sucked" basically reiterates his initial negative opinion without explaining it.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This occurs when one presumes that their opinion reflects a general consensus without evidence. Bob does not imply that everyone agrees with him, so this category may not fit directly.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** This occurs when vague or unclear terms are used. The term "It sucked" is ambiguous and subjective, lacking clarity.

Therefore, the conversation is a clear example of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because Bob's response "It sucked" does not provide specific, conclusive details to explain what was wrong with the movie. It might also be considered **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** because Bob repeats his negative assessment without elaboration or supporting details. Additionally, **Ambiguous Language (DEP)** applies due to the vagueness of "It sucked". 

Given the multiple defective argument types that this conversation could touch upon, "It sucked" fits most precisely with **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
