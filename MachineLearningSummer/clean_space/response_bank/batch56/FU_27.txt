For 
"Lots of people bought this album, so it must be good."

This argument appears to be making a leap from the popularity of the album to its quality. The reasoning suggests that because many people have purchased the album, it must inherently be of high quality. However, this line of reasoning can be flawed because popularity does not necessarily equate to quality. Several defective argument types can be applied here:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument fails to consider other factors that could influence people's decision to buy the album, such as marketing, hype, or social influence, rather than the inherent quality of the album.

2. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument assumes that the collective opinion of the majority (lots of people) is an accurate indicator of quality, without providing evidence or examining whether those opinions are well-founded.

3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument implies a causal relationship between the number of purchases and the album's quality, without providing sufficient causal evidence to support this connection.

Given the provided defective argument types, this argument best fits the "Presumptuous Consensus (FU)" as it relies on the assumption that the consensus (people buying the album) guarantees the quality of the album.

Therefore, we can apply **<FU>** to the argument: "Lots of people bought this album, so it must be good."
