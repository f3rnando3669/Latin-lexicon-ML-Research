For 
Sure, to apply the Defective Argument Analysis (<IDAA>) to the statement "Being overweight leads to a shortened lifespan because it's unhealthy," we need to check for potential flaws based on the defective argument types defined:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This occurs when a conclusion is drawn about a group based on a limited or biased sample.
   - This might apply if the statement is based on a limited dataset or ignores other factors influencing lifespan.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This type occurs when not all relevant instances or possibilities are considered.
   - The argument attributes shortened lifespan purely to being overweight, potentially ignoring other key factors like genetics, lifestyle, and medical care.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This occurs when the evidence provided does not necessarily lead to the claimed conclusion.
   - The statement might fall into this category if it does not provide substantial evidence to conclusively link being overweight with a shortened lifespan.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This type occurs when there's insufficient evidence to support a claimed cause-and-effect relationship.
   - There might be a lack of sufficient causal evidence to claim that being overweight directly leads to a shorter lifespan.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This type involves rephrasing the same proposition without additional justification or evidence.
   - The statement does not necessarily fall into this category since it does not seem to be merely repeating the same idea without new information.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This occurs when a claim is made based on an assumed unanimous agreement that may not exist.
   - This might apply if the statement assumes that everyone agrees being overweight always leads to unhealthiness and shortened lifespan, without considering dissenting perspectives or evidence.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This occurs when the argument uses vague or unclear terms.
   - The terms "overweight" and "unhealthy" can be seen as ambiguous without clear definitions or thresholds, making the argument potentially ambiguous.

Based on this analysis, the statement "Being overweight leads to a shortened lifespan because it's unhealthy" could be critiqued for several potential flaws:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: By not considering the multitude of factors influencing lifespan.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Due to a lack of detailed and conclusive evidence linking overweight status and lifespan directly.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: As it may lack robust causal evidence connecting being overweight directly to a shorter lifespan.
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: Because terms like "overweight" and "unhealthy" can be vague without specific definitions.

In order to strengthen the argument, it would be helpful to clarify the terms used, provide comprehensive evidence considering all possible factors, and ensure a solid causal relationship is established.
