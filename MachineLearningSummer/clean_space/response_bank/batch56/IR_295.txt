For 
The argument "Everyone in our family has gone to the University of Tennessee, so you need to apply to UT." can be evaluated using the defective argument types defined.

Letâ€™s identify which defective argument types apply (IDAA) to this statement:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument assumes that because everyone in the family has done something, the individual must do the same. It generalizes the actions or choices of the entire family to one individual without considering that the individual might have different interests or circumstances.
   
2. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument presumes that the consensus within the family (everyone going to the University of Tennessee) should dictate the individual's choice, without providing other reasoning or considering the individual's preference.

Given this analysis, the argument commits the defective argument types of Generalization (<G>) and Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>).

So, the argument "Everyone in our family has gone to the University of Tennessee, so you need to apply to UT." is primarily identified as having:

**<G> Generalization**
**<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**
