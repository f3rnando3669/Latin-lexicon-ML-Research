To apply an analysis of defective argument types to the statement "Yes, we have safety issues in our factory. But we work really hard to make a good product," we can examine it using the defective argument types you've defined. This process will identify which of the defective arguments might be present.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This applies when conclusions are drawn from insufficient evidence. This argument does not seem to be making a broad generalization from limited cases.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This occurs when not all relevant instances are considered. The argument does acknowledge the safety issues, so it doesn't appear to be ignoring significant parts of the evidence.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This is when the reasoning does not logically support the conclusion. The statement "But we work really hard to make a good product" does not directly address or mitigate the safety issues mentioned. This may be an instance of <IR> because working hard on product quality does not logically counteract concerns about safety issues.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This involves a weak causal link between the premises and the conclusion. The link between working hard on making a good product and resolving safety issues is not causally strong, which may indicate an <WCB> argument.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This is when a proposition is repeated incorrectly, without support. The argument does not involve repetition of a proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This occurs when it is assumed that a consensus exists without proper evidence. There's no indication of claiming a false consensus here.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This is when language is used in an unclear way, potentially misleading. The statement is relatively clear in its language, even if its reasoning is flawed.

In conclusion, the statement "Yes, we have safety issues in our factory. But we work really hard to make a good product" primarily showcases an **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**. The effort placed into making a good product does not provide a satisfactory resolution or address the serious concern of factory safety issues. There might also be an element of **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**, as the connection between working hard on products and addressing safety issues is not strong or evident.
