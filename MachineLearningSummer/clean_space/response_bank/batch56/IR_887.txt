For 
To properly apply the "Identify Defective Argument or Assumption" (<IDAA>) technique to the provided statement, we need to analyze the argument for possible logical fallacies or defective reasoning types defined earlier.

Statement: "Then we had a death. A 32-year-old woman hemorrhaged to death as a result of a cervical laceration. I finally realized, we weren't helping women - we were destroying them."

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Specific Incident to General Conclusion**:
    - The statement uses the instance of a single incident (death of a 32-year-old woman) to make a broad generalization about a larger context (implying that 'we weren't helping women - we were destroying them').

2. **Generalization (<G>)**:
    - The argument moves from a specific case (woman's death due to hemorrhage) to a sweeping conclusion (we were destroying them). This type of argument falls under faulty reasoning called **Generalization (<G>)** because it takes one or a few examples and makes an unreasonably broad conclusion.

3. **Incomplete Enumeration (<IE>)**:
    - The conclusion is also based on incomplete enumeration of cases. The statement does not consider other instances where women might have been helped or benefited. This represents an **Incomplete Enumeration (<IE>)** as it fails to account for the entire scope of occurrences.

Applying the <IDAA> technique:

- **Generalization (G)**: The argument uses a single tragic incident to represent the effectiveness or morality of an entire practice or campaign, which is logically unsound as it overgeneralizes based on anecdotal evidence.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (IE)**: The argument fails to provide a comprehensive set of examples or data that would be necessary to make a valid conclusion about the effect of 'helping women.'

In conclusion, the provided argument is primarily defective due to <G> Generalization and <IE> Incomplete Enumeration. Itâ€™s important to support assertions with broader and more representative data to avoid these defective argument types.
