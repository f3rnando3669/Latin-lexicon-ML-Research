<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application. In this case, we need to apply it to the statement: "Running the government is like running a business. You can’t keep running into debt and expect to be successful."

1. **Generalization (G)**: The argument makes a generalization by implying that governments can be run in the same way as businesses, despite the fact that governments and businesses have fundamentally different purposes, responsibilities, and constraints.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not enumerate the distinct differences between running a government and running a business, nor does it acknowledge the different forms of debt and investment that might be beneficial in a governmental context.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The comparison between running a government and a business provides an inconclusive reason. It assumes that the strategies that lead to success in business will automatically lead to success in governance, without providing substantial evidence or reasoning behind this assumption.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument lacks a sufficient causal basis by asserting that running into debt in a government context will lead to failure, similar to a business context. It does not consider the complex economics of government debt and investment.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The argument implicitly repeats the proposition that what works for business (avoiding debt) should work for government without providing new evidence or a different perspective, making this a form of faulty repetition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument assumes a consensus that running a government should be like running a business and that debt is inherently negative without proving this assumption or considering opposing views.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The terms "running into debt" and "successful" are used ambiguously. In a business context, "debt" may imply financial instability, whereas in a governmental context, debt can be more complex and sometimes strategically beneficial. Similarly, "successful" is not clearly defined in the context of government.

Thus, the statement "Running the government is like running a business. You can’t keep running into debt and expect to be successful" can be identified as containing several defective argument types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), and Ambiguous Language (DEP).
