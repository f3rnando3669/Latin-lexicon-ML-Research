Applying an identification of defective argument types to the given statement:

**Statement:** "Professor, please, PLEASE reconsider my grade on the Final! I know I only answered 7% of the questions correctly, but I didn’t really deserve an F! In the past week I sprained my ankle, my dog ran away, and my kitchen caught on fire! I think it’s only fair I get a chance to retake the test!"

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The student is providing selective personal misfortunes (sprained ankle, dog ran away, kitchen fire) as reasons for reconsideration of their grade. However, the list of unfortunate events is incomplete in the context of their academic performance over the entire term, thus not addressing potentially other contributing factors.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reasons provided (personal misfortunes) are emotionally compelling but do not logically justify why the grade should be reconsidered. The argument evades the fundamental issue, which is the inadequate performance on the test itself (7% correct answers).

A more precise approach could include other factors such as overall performance during the semester or documented exceptional circumstances as recognized by academic policy.
