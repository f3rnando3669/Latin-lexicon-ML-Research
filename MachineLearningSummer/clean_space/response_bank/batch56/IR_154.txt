For 
It seems you are asking to evaluate the argument in the statement: "Cat Stevens may be a successful and skilled musician, but let's not forget that he's been accused of extremist religious and political views." using some defective argument types and a classification marker <IDAA> which you have not defined. However, I can analyze the argument to identify if it falls under any of the defined defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G):** This argument does not appear to be a generalization, as it talks about a specific individual, Cat Stevens.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This argument does not seem to omit necessary details of a list; it does not try to enumerate multiple items incompletely.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This could be applicable. The argument implies that Cat Stevens' success and skills as a musician don't outweigh accusations against him, but it does not conclusively connect his personal views to his professional achievements.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The argument does not provide a causal explanation that can be deemed insufficient.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This means repeating a claim without further support, which does not seem to apply here.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument doesn't claim consensus or appeal to what everyone believes.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** There is some potential for ambiguity without specific details or context, particularly with the term "accused," but it isn't the main flaw here.

Given the provided types, the argument seems closest to **<IR> Inconclusive Reason** because it juxtaposes two unrelated aspects of Cat Stevens' life without a clear explanation of their relevance to each other. Let's tag it with that:

**<IR>** "Cat Stevens may be a successful and skilled musician, but let's not forget that he's been accused of extremist religious and political views."

If <IDAA> refers to identifying and annotating a defective argument analysis, then this argument falls into the category of <IR> Inconclusive Reason.
