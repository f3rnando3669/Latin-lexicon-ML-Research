To clarify, you seem to want to categorize the given argument according to the defective argument types you defined, but I'm not sure what "<IDAA>" stands for in your context. However, based on the classifications provided, I can assess the given argument for any defective reasoning types that apply.

Here is the argument again:
"The noble forefathers who created this great country did not fail; it is a great country now as it was then, by their very making."

Now let's analyze it:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - This argument asserts that because the country is great now, it was automatically great in the past by the actions of the forefathers without addressing the nuances or specific contributions over time. This could be considered a form of generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - The argument doesn't list or consider other factors or individuals that may have contributed to the country's current state. It focuses only on the forefathers.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The assertion that the country is great now as it was then by the making of the forefathers alone does not provide strong evidence or reasoning to support the notion that the country's greatness is solely due to the actions of the forefathers.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - It assumes a direct causal link between the actions of the forefathers and the current state of the country without sufficient evidence or acknowledgment of other contributing factors.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - The argument restates the proposition that the country is great now as it was then, implying the same reasoning without addressing any opposing views or providing new support.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - The argument assumes a general consensus that the country is great and implies unified agreement that the forefathers' actions were solely responsible without addressing diverse perspectives or possible dissent.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - The phrase "great country" is subjective and vague. The argument does not specifically define what "great" means, which can lead to ambiguity.

Given this breakdown, your original phrase can be categorized under multiple defective argument types, including Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), and Presumptuous Consensus (FU). It also features elements of Ambiguous Language (DEP) due to the vague term "great country."
