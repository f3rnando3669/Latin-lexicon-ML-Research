For 
Applying the principles of identifying defective arguments and argument analysis (<IDAA>), here's an evaluation of the given statement:

Statement: "We are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which the God of nature hath placed in our power."

1. **Examine for Generalization (<G>)**: The statement claims that "we are not weak" based on the proper use of means given by the "God of nature." This might be seen as a generalization because it suggests a universal truth about strength and the use of natural means, without specifying which means or providing evidence that supports this claim universally.

2. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: If the statement relies on the phrase "those means which the God of nature hath placed in our power," it lacks specificity about which means are being referred to. This could lead to an incomplete enumeration since it does not list or specify what exactly is meant by "those means."

3. **Look for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The statement provides a conditional claim ("if we make a proper use of those means") but does not conclusively show a causal relationship between the use of means and not being weak. The reasoning feels inconclusive because it does not establish evidence or clear logical steps.

4. **Assess for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: There is an implicit claim of causality (using means provided by nature leads to strength), but without specific evidence or examples, the causal link seems tenuous. The statement may be critiqued for lacking sufficient causal basis.

5. **Evaluate for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The claim does not seem to repeat itself within this short statement, so there's no clear evidence for <RR>.

6. **Analyze for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The statement implies that it is self-evident or commonly accepted that using natural means correctly leads to strength. It presumes consensus without demonstrating that this is a commonly accepted or verifiable truth.

7. **Identify Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: Terms like "proper use," "those means," and "the God of nature" are vague and subject to interpretation. The language lacks precision and clarity, making the argument ambiguous.

In conclusion, applying <IDAA> reveals that the statement could be critiqued primarily on the grounds of **Generalization (<G>)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**, **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**, **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**, and **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**. Each of these defective argument types plays a role in undermining the statement's overall persuasive power.
