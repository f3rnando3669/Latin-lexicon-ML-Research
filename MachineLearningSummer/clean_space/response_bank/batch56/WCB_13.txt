Applying the type codes:

1. Define <IDAA>: Identify Defective Argument Application.

2. Analyze the given argument:
   - "Kevin's dog scratched his leg, and that night he had a fever. Kevin concluded that his dog must have infected him with something."

3. Identify the defect in the argument:
   - The argument assumes a causal relationship between the dog scratch and Kevin's fever without sufficient evidence to support that conclusion.

4. Apply the defective argument type (<IDAA>):

Therefore, the defective argument type for the given argument is <WCB>.
