The application of the defined defective argument types (Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Presumptuous Consensus, Ambiguous Language) to the statement "I don’t see what’s wrong with engaging the services of a professional escort" involves identifying which, if any, of these defective arguments it can be categorized under. 

“I don’t see what’s wrong with engaging the services of a professional escort.”

Let's assess this statement:

- **Generalization (G)**: This defective argument type involves making broad claims based on limited evidence. The statement does not make a broad claim but expresses a personal viewpoint without offering evidence, hence it may not fit neatly into this category.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This involves drawing a conclusion based on an incomplete list of possibilities or factors. The statement might exhibit this defect if it fails to consider important arguments or factors relevant to the issue, rather than simply state an opinion without explanation.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This occurs when the given reason doesn't sufficiently support the conclusion. The statement mentions a personal perception without presenting a supporting reason, making it weak but it might not fully encapsulate the nature of 'inconclusive reason.'
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This involves attributing insufficient cause to an effect. The statement doesn't necessarily attribute causal relationships, so it might not fit this category.
  
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This involves repeating the same proposition without adding substantial reasoning. Since the statement doesn't establish a proposition through repetition, it doesn’t seem to fall under this category.
  
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This is when an argument assumes a consensus or agreement without evidence. The statement reflects personal opinion without implying consensus, so it isn’t an example of this defective argument type.

- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This involves using unclear or vague language, making the message ambiguous. The statement is clear in its expression of personal opinion without ambiguity.

Of these possible defects, the most fitting are:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement expresses a positive stance towards a controversial topic without acknowledging other relevant factors or arguments, reflecting an incomplete consideration of the issue.

So, the application ("<IDAA>") of defective argument types to the given statement results in identifying it best as Incomplete Enumeration **(FE)** based on the available definitions.
