The argument presented can be analyzed with respect to the defective argument types you defined. The argument is as follows:

"Naima is scratched by a cat while visiting her friend. Two days later she comes down with a fever. Naima concludes that the cat's scratch must be the cause of her illness."

To determine which defective argument type applies, let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Event A**: Naima is scratched by a cat.
2. **Event B**: Two days later, Naima comes down with a fever.
3. **Conclusion**: Naima concludes that the scratch caused the fever.

This is a clear case of **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)** because Naima is concluding a causal relationship between two events based solely on their temporal proximity without sufficient evidence to establish causality. Just because the fever occurred after the scratch does not necessarily mean the scratch caused the fever. Other factors could also contribute to her illness, and further evidence would be needed to support such a cause-and-effect relationship.

Therefore, the defective argument type applicable here is:

**<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**
