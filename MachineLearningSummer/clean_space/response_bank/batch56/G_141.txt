To analyze the argument "If we let teenagers wear whatever they want to school, they will no longer respect the rules and academic performance will decline," using the defective argument types, we need to identify which fallacy or defective argument type(s) potentially apply. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - The statement assumes that allowing teenagers to wear whatever they want will lead to a lack of respect for rules and a decline in academic performance. This is a broad generalization that applies to all teenagers based on a limited understanding without supporting evidence. Therefore, **G** (Generalization) is applicable.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - The argument does not consider other factors that might contribute to teenagers' respect for rules or academic performance. It only provides one scenario (wearing whatever they want). Thus, **FE** (Incomplete Enumeration) can be applied.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The argument leaps to a conclusion without providing adequate reasoning or evidence to support the causal link between dress code freedom and academic decline. Hence, **IR** (Inconclusive Reason) fits.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - There's an assertion of a causal relationship between dress code policy and academic performance, but no evidence or basis for this causal connection is provided. Therefore, **WCB** (Insufficient Causal Basis) applies.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - If the statement were repeatedly used as an argument without new evidence or reasoning each time, **RR** (Faulty Repetition of Proposition) would apply. From a single instance, it’s not clear if this is repeatedly used.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - The argument might imply that the decline in academic performance if dress codes are relaxed is an obvious or widely accepted fact without showing consensus. If this is assumed without evidence, **FU** (Presumptuous Consensus) applies.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - The statement’s language isn't necessarily ambiguous. The terms "respect the rules" and "academic performance" are quite clear in this context. So, **DEP** (Ambiguous Language) may not apply here.

**Summary**:
The argument in question contains several defective argument types:
- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- Possibly, **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**

Thus, the primary defective arguments here would be <G>, <FE>, <IR>, and <WCB>.
