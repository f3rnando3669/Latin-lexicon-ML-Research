For 
<IDAA> stands for Defective Arguments Analysis Application. Let's analyze the argument exchange between Lola and John according to the defective argument types defined:

Lola's Argument:
>Lola: "I don't think John would be a good fit to manage this project, because he doesn't have a lot of experience with project management."

John's Response:
>John: "But you don't have a lot of experience in project management either!"

Now, let's apply <IDAA> to this example:

1. **Lola's Argument Analysis:**
   - Argument Type: Lola is making a claim about John's suitability for managing the project based on his lack of experience in project management.
   - Defective Argument Analysis:
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Lola's argument may be considered incomplete enumeration if she is basing her conclusion solely on one aspect (experience) without considering other possible qualifications or factors that might make John suitable for the role.

2. **John's Response Analysis:**
   - Argument Type: John deflects Lola's critique by pointing out her lack of experience in project management.
   - Defective Argument Analysis:
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: John's response repeats a similar proposition to Lola's without addressing her original point about suitability for the project. Instead of providing evidence for his own suitability, he points back to Lola, which doesn't refute her claim.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: John's statement implicitly suggests that Lola's lack of experience invalidates her opinion on the matter, assuming that her own experience is necessary for evaluating others without any supporting evidence.

In summary:

- Lola's argument might involve **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** because it hinges on a single factor (experience) without full consideration of other relevant aspects.
- John's response involves **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)** because it deflects the critique without addressing the initial argument substantively, and possibly **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)** as it implies that Lola's lack of experience disqualifies her from making a valid judgment about John's experience.
