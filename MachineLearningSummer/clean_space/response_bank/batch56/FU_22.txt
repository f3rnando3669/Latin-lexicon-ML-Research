It looks like you may have intended to use one of the defective argument types you've defined to analyze the given statement: "All professional athletes use Apple watches to track their training, so our team needs to purchase Apple watches for everyone." However, you mentioned <IDAA>, which isn't defined in your list of defective argument types.

Based on the list of definitions provided, the most fitting defective argument type that applies to the given statement is <G> (Generalization):

- **Generalization (<G>)**: This is an argument where a broad conclusion is drawn from a small or unrepresentative sample. In this case, the statement assumes that because "all professional athletes" use Apple watches, it directly follows that your team should do the same.

Therefore, you could restate the given argument with the identified defective argument type:

"The statement 'All professional athletes use Apple watches to track their training, so our team needs to purchase Apple watches for everyone' is a Generalization (<G>), because it assumes that what is true for professional athletes must also be true and necessary for your team without providing sufficient evidence."
