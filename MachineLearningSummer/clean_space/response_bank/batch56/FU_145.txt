The argument given can be identified as committing the fallacy of <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus). This fallacy occurs when someone assumes that widespread agreement or popularity is an indicator of the argument's merit or truth.

In the argument, the speaker dismisses the professor's critical assessment of "The Bridges of Madison County" by pointing out that the book was on the best-seller list for over 100 weeks. The implicit assumption here is that the book's popularity is a sufficient rebuttal to the professor's negative evaluation, without addressing any of the professor's specific criticisms directly. Popularity, however, does not inherently reflect artistic worth or quality, so relying on it to invalidate the professor's informed opinion constitutes a presumptuous consensus.
