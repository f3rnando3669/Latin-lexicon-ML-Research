In order to apply <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument and Annotation) to the statement, "Whilst rallying support for his plan to fundamentally undermine citizens' rights, the Supreme Leader told the people they were either on his side, or they were on the side of the enemy," let's identify if the argument contains any of the defined defective types.

This argument contains:

1. **False Dichotomy (a subcategory of fallacy, related to a** Generalization \[<G>\]**)**:
   - The argument presents only two options: supporting the Supreme Leader or being an enemy. This is a classic example of creating a false binary choice, which disregards other possibilities. This can be categorized as <G>.

So the annotation is: 
- <G>: False dichotomy because it presents only two options. 

Complete annotation:
- "Whilst rallying support for his plan to fundamentally undermine citizens' rights, the Supreme Leader told the people they were either on his side, or they were on the side of the enemy." <G>
