Certainly! To apply the analysis to Tony's statement, we need to identify and categorize any defective arguments within his reasoning. Here's the breakdown with the <IDAA> tag applied:

**Statement:**
"Tony: I bought a book on the law of attraction and two days later I won $30k in a lottery. I wasn’t a believer of the law of attraction before, but now I am!"

**Defective Argument Analysis (<IDAA>):** 

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** 
   - Tony suggests a causal connection between buying a book on the law of attraction and winning $30k in the lottery. However, this conclusion is based on insufficient evidence. The proximity in time between the two events does not necessarily establish a causal relationship.

2. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - Tony implies that his new belief in the law of attraction is justified by the singular event of winning the lottery. Repeating this specific proposition doesn’t add weight to the argument because it still hinges on one isolated incidence, which can be attributed to chance.

3. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - Tony's reasoning implicitly ignores possible other explanations for winning the lottery. He doesn't consider factors like sheer luck, coincidence, or the mathematical probability of winning.

4. **Generalization (G):**
   - Tony is generalizing his experience to support the broader concept of the law of attraction. He takes one instance as sufficient proof for a broad, universal claim, which is a form of overgeneralizing based on limited evidence.

**Summary:**

**Tony's Argument:** "I bought a book on the law of attraction and two days later I won $30k in a lottery."

**Defective Arguments Identified:**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Generalization (G)**

Therefore, Tony's reasoning suffers from several logical flaws, making his newfound belief in the law of attraction questionable based on the provided argument.
