For 
The argument in the statement "The word of Zorbo the Great is flawless and perfect. We know this because it says so in The Great and Infallible Book of Zorbo's Best and Most Truest Things that are Definitely True and Should Not Ever Be Questioned." can be identified as an instance of <IDAA> under the name Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR). 

This is because the argument is essentially repeating the proposition that Zorbo's word is flawless and perfect by appealing to a book that claims to be infallible without providing external evidence or validation. The conclusion (Zorbo's perfection) and the premise (the book's claim) are dependent on each other in a circular manner, without substantive independent support.
