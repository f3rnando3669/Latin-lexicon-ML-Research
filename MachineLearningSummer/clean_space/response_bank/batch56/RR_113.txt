For 
The argument "Itâ€™s important to argue logically because logic is an essential part of argumentation" can be analyzed for defects using the categories you've defined. In this case, the most appropriate defective argument type is:

- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**

This is because the argument essentially repeats the same idea in both the premise and the conclusion without providing any substantive support or additional reasoning. The statement that "it's important to argue logically" is justified by saying "logic is an essential part of argumentation," which is a tautology and does not add any new information or evidence to support the conclusion.
