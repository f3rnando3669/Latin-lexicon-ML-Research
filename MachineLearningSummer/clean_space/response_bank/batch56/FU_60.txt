To apply the method <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Analysis) to the subject matter of "Polls concerning global warming," we will examine potential defective arguments that might appear in discussions related to this topic. Here's an analysis focusing on the argument types defined:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This occurs when conclusions about global warming are based on insufficient or non-representative data points from polls. For example, claiming that "most people believe global warming is a hoax" based on a single, small, or biased poll would be a generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This would involve arguing that certain polls represent the complete spectrum of public opinion without acknowledging the existence of other polls that might show different results. An example might be arguing that "all polls show overwhelming support for global warming measures" while ignoring polls that indicate significant opposition.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This could be identified if someone argues that varying results from different polls decisively prove the unpredictability of public opinion on global warming, without considering that varying methodologies, questions, and samples might explain the differences.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: An argument representing this would be claiming that the results of specific polls directly cause changes in climate policy without considering other factors like economic impacts, scientific evidence, or political agendas.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This would apply if a specific poll result is repeatedly used as definitive evidence in multiple arguments without further support or analysis, like repeatedly citing the same singular poll to claim public consensus on global warming issues.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This might involve asserting a consensus on global warming based on selected poll results while ignoring substantial dissenting opinions. For example, claiming "everyone agrees that man-made global warming is real" based on favorable poll results while ignoring significant numbers showing contrary beliefs.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: An argument here would involve using poll questions or interpretations that have ambiguous, unclear, or vague language, leading to confusion about what respondents actually believe. For instance, using terms like "global warming" or "climate change" without defining them clearly in the context of the poll questions might result in ambiguous responses.

### Example

**Poll Statement**: "A recent survey shows that 85% of people support immediate action to combat global warming."

**Defective Argument Analysis (IDAA)**:

1. **Generalization (G)**: If this survey was conducted on a small or unrepresentative sample (like only within one city or among a particular demographic), then extrapolating this result to the whole population would be a generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: If the discussion uses only this particular poll and ignores other polls with different results, it would be an incomplete enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: If the argument concludes that public opinion is overwhelmingly in favor of immediate action based solely on this one poll without considering other influencing factors or potential biases, it is inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Claiming that this poll result will directly lead to policy changes without considering the necessary political, scientific, and economic discussions is an insufficient causal basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: If this 85% figure is referenced repeatedly in debates or articles as sole evidence of public support without providing additional context or data, it could be a faulty repetition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Using this poll's result to declare broad public consensus while ignoring significant opposition voiced in other polls would be presumptuous consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: If the poll question was vague, such as "Do you support immediate action to combat climate change?" without specifying what kind of action, it could result in ambiguous responses and thus fall under ambiguous language.

By identifying these defective argument types, we can critically analyze the strength and validity of claims made based on polls concerning global warming and ensure a more nuanced understanding of public opinion and its implications.
