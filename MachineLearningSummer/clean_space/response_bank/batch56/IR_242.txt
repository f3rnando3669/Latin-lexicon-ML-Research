Identifying Defective Argument Attributes (IDAA) involves analyzing the statement to identify any defective argument types that apply. Let's break down the statement "Keeping a dog as a pet is every bit as evil as human slavery" and see which defective arguments are present.

1. Generalization (G): This argument makes a broad generalization by equating keeping a dog as a pet with human slavery. The two situations are vastly different in nature and context, and this sweeping statement does not account for the nuances and differences between them.

2. Incomplete Enumeration (FE): The argument suggests a dichotomy where keeping a dog as a pet and human slavery are the only considerations of "evil," omitting other forms of treatment of dogs or humans that could be relevant. 

3. Inconclusive Reason (IR): The reasoning behind comparing pet ownership to human slavery is not conclusively justified. The statement does not provide a strong basis for why these two situations should be considered equally evil.

4. Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB): The claim lacks a causal link that adequately supports why keeping a dog as a pet would be equated to human slavery. The fundamental differences in nature, intention, and impact between pet ownership and slavery are not addressed.

5. Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR): There is no clear pattern or repetition within this single statement to identify as RR, as itâ€™s a straightforward comparison rather than a repeated defective argument.

6. Presumptuous Consensus (FU): The argument might assume a consensus or a commonly held belief that keeping pets is morally comparable to human slavery without legitimate basis or widespread agreement.

7. Ambiguous Language (DEP): The terms "evil" and "every bit as" are quite ambiguous and open to interpretation. They do not provide clear criteria or reasons for why pet ownership would be considered on the same moral level as human slavery.

In conclusion, the statement "Keeping a dog as a pet is every bit as evil as human slavery" involves the following defective argument types:

- Generalization (G)
- Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
- Inconclusive Reason (IR)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
- Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
- Ambiguous Language (DEP)
