For 
The argument "We either have to cut taxes or leave a huge debt for our children" can be analyzed using the defective argument type which you designated as <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Attributes). Here is the analysis:

1. **False Dichotomy (FD)**: The argument presents a situation as if there are only two possible options or outcomes when, in fact, there might be more. For instance, other solutions could include restructuring spending, finding new revenue sources that are not tax-related, or implementing policies that balance both tax levels and debt management.

Hence, applying **<IDAA>** to this argument, we identify it as a **False Dichotomy**, potentially oversimplifying the complexity of fiscal policy and debt management. This demonstrates that the argument is defective due to the incorrect presumption that the only choices are cutting taxes and leaving a huge debt for future generations, without considering any other viable alternatives.
