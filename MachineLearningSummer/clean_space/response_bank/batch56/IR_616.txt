For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Assignment) to the statement “We shouldn’t even bother to interview that job applicant. He has a beard.”, we need to analyze the argument and identify which of the predefined defective argument types it falls under.

Upon examining the statement:

- The reason given for not interviewing the job applicant is solely that he has a beard.
- The argument is making a generalization based on an irrelevant characteristic (the presence of a beard) rather than qualifications or relevant criteria for the job.

This fits the definition of:

**<G> Generalization** - A defective argument where a conclusion is drawn about a whole group based on a sample that is not large or representative enough.

Therefore, the statement “We shouldn’t even bother to interview that job applicant. He has a beard.” can be classified under the defective argument type:

**<G> Generalization.**

The reasoning here is that the argument unfairly generalizes potential job performance or suitability based on an irrelevant and insufficient characteristic, namely having a beard.
