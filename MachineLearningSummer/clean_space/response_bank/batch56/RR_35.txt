The argument "I lost my phone in the living room, so it will always be in the living room when it is lost" can be assessed using the defective argument types defined.

Let's apply each of the defective arguments to see which one fits best:

- **Generalization (G)**: This occurs when a conclusion is drawn from a sample that is too small. In this scenario, the argument generalizes the location of the phone based on a single instance.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This involves concluding something based on an incomplete list of possibilities. Here, the argument does not consider other possible locations where the phone could be lost.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This is when the reason given does not sufficiently support the conclusion. The premise that the phone was lost once in the living room does not conclusively support the idea that it will always be lost there.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This refers to an argument that suggests a cause-and-effect relationship without adequate evidence. However, the argument does not explicitly claim causation, just a pattern.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This means restating a point without additional reasoning. The argument doesn't necessarily fall into this category since it doesnâ€™t merely repeat a claim without backing.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This involves assuming general agreement without evidence. The argument does not rely on any assumed consensus.

- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This deals with language that is unclear or has multiple interpretations. The language here is relatively clear.

Out of these, the two most fitting defective argument types are **Generalization (G)** and **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**. The argument generalizes from one specific incident (where the phone was lost in the living room) to all future incidents. Additionally, it incompletely enumerates the possible locations by ignoring the other places the phone could be lost.

Therefore, the argument "I lost my phone in the living room, so it will always be in the living room when it is lost" could suffer from **Generalization (G)** and **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**.
