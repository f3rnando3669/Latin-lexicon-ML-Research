For 
The argument "I started exercising twice a week, and I just got a babysitting job. Exercising leads to new jobs!" contains a defective argument type called Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>). 

Hereâ€™s how it fits this type:
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This occurs when the argument claims a cause-and-effect relationship between two events without providing enough supporting evidence to demonstrate that the first event actually caused the second event.

In this example, the argument concludes that exercising leads to new jobs merely based on a correlation between the two events (starting to exercise and getting a job). There is no substantial evidence provided to substantiate that the act of exercising directly caused the new job. Other factors could have contributed to obtaining the job, and simply noting that these two events happened around the same time is not enough to establish a causal relationship.
