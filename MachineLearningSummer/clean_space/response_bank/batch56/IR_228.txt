For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Arguments Applied. To apply <IDAA> to the given statement: "Violent video games are directly related to gun violence in schools and should be banned for teens. The school day should start an hour later," we need to identify any defective argument types present. Here is the analysis:

1. "Violent video games are directly related to gun violence in schools and should be banned for teens."
   - Defective Argument Type: <WCB> - Insufficient Causal Basis. 
     - Reasoning: There is a claim of a direct relationship between violent video games and gun violence in schools without adequate evidence to support a causal link. This argument lacks rigorous data or studies that conclusively show such a direct effect.

2. "The school day should start an hour later."
   - Defective Argument Type: N/A (Not applicable as stated).
     - Reasoning: This part of the statement appears to be a separate issue entirely and does not seem to contain a specific argument for its case. Therefore, it's not sufficiently detailed to identify a defective argument type based on the provided reasoning alone.

In conclusion, the first part of the statement shows an <WCB> defect, while the second part is insufficiently developed to classify as any defective argument type based on the information given.
