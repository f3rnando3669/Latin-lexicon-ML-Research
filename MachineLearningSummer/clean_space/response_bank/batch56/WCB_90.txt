For 
It appears you want to analyze the given argument using the defined defective argument types. I'll deconstruct the argument to see which, if any, of the defective arguments apply.

The argument is: "I broke my mirror this morning, AND I failed my Civics test. I must've failed because the mirror gave me bad luck."

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - This argument doesn’t generalize from a limited set of examples to a broad conclusion. So, <G> does not apply.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The argument does not lay out a limited set of options or examples. Thus, <FE> does not apply.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The reasoning here is inconclusive because there could be many reasons for failing the Civics test besides breaking a mirror. It’s not a logically valid connection. So, <IR> does apply.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - This argument claims a causal connection between breaking a mirror and failing a test, but it doesn’t provide sufficient evidence for why this causal relationship should exist. Hence, <WCB> applies.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - There is no repetition of a proposition in the argument. So, <RR> does not apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - This argument does not seem to assume that a consensus exists where none is justified. <FU> does not apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - The language used in the argument is not ambiguous. It's very clear about what it implies linking broken mirrors to bad luck. Thus, <DEP> does not apply.

Given these points, the defective argument types that apply to this reasoning are:

- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)

Therefore, the statement "I broke my mirror this morning, AND I failed my Civics test. I must've failed because the mirror gave me bad luck." contains the defective arguments of:
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).
