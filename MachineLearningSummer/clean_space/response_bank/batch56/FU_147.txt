For 
<IDAA> stands for Identify Defective Argument Application, where we analyze the argument for any defective types defined earlier.

**Argument:**

"Jill and Jane have some concerns that the rules their sorority has set are racist in character. Since Jill is a decent person, she brings her concerns up in the next meeting. The president of the sorority assures her that there is nothing wrong with the rules, since the majority of the sisters like them. Jane accepts this ruling but Jill decides to leave the sorority."

**Analysis:**

1. **The president's reasoning:**
   "The president of the sorority assures her that there is nothing wrong with the rules, since the majority of the sisters like them."

   - **Identification:**
     This statement is an argument intended to address the concern about the rules being racist. The president argues that because a majority of the sisters like the rules, there is nothing wrong with them.

   - **Defective Type (FU):**
     This argument employs **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)** because it assumes that the majority opinion is sufficient to dismiss concerns about racism. It presumes a consensus of liking the rules equates to the rules being morally or ethically acceptable, which isn't necessarily true.

2. **Jane's acceptance:**
   "Jane accepts this ruling..."

   - **Identification:**
     Jane accepts the president's assurance based on the majority's preference.

   - **Defective Type (FU):**
     Jane's acceptance without further scrutiny falls under **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)** as well, as she presumes the rules are justifiable solely based on the majority's liking.

3. **Jill's decision:**
   "Jill decides to leave the sorority."

   - **Identification:**
     Jill decides to leave the sorority, which could be seen as her conclusion from not being convinced by the president's reasoning.

   - **Defective Argument Analysis:**
     Jill’s action doesn’t directly present a defective argument per se. Instead, it is a response to the president’s **(<FU>)** argument. She dismisses the president’s reasoning, which relies on a presumptuous consensus.

**Summary of Defective Types Identified:**

- **"The president of the sorority assures her that there is nothing wrong with the rules, since the majority of the sisters like them."** 
  - Defective Argument Type: **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**

- **"Jane accepts this ruling..."** 
  - Defective Argument Type: **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**
