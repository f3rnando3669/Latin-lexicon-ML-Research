For 
<IDAA> typically stands for the process of Identifying and Describing the Argumentative Approach, which we'll apply to the given statement. Let's break down the argument:

**Statement:** "Andanar is unfit for the position because he seems unqualified for it."

**Identification and Breakdown:**
1. **Claim:** Andanar is unfit for the position.
2. **Reason:** Because he seems unqualified for it.

### Applying <IDAA>
#### Step 1: Identify the Type of Argument
This statement appears to be providing a reason (he seems unqualified) to support a conclusion (he is unfit for the position).

#### Step 2: Check for Defective Argument Types
We now evaluate the argument to see if it matches any of the listed defective argument types:

- **Generalization (G):** The statement does not seem to generalize from a small sample.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The statement does not list reasons incompletely.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason given ("he seems unqualified for it") appears to be subjective and lacks specific evidence or a concrete foundation, making it inconclusive.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal link between "seems unqualified" and "is unfit" is weak without further evidence.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The statement does not merely restate the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The statement does not assume consensus without evidence.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The term "seems" is ambiguous and subjective without clarifying what "seems unqualified" specifically means.

### Conclusion:
The primary defective argument type here seems to be **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, as the reason given (someone merely seeming unqualified) lacks concrete evidence or specifics to robustly support the claim that Andanar is unfit for the position.

Additionally, the term "seems unqualified" could potentially fall under **Ambiguous Language (DEP)** due to its subjective and non-specific nature.

Thus, the argument could be marked with both **<IR>** and **<DEP>** due to the inconclusive reason and the ambiguous language used.
