In this context, <IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application. The argument presented by Louise in her campaign speech commits the fallacy known as **Ad Hominem**. This type of fallacy occurs when someone attacks the character or personal traits of their opponent rather than addressing the substance of the opponent's argument or position.

Let's break down why this is an Ad Hominem fallacy:
- Louise diverts from discussing her opponentâ€™s qualifications, policies, or ideas relevant to the position of class president.
- Instead, she attacks her opponent's personal behavior (being a smoker and cheating on her boyfriend), which is not directly related to their ability or suitability to perform the duties of a class president.

To categorize this using the provided defective argument types, although none of the specific types mentioned perfectly encapsulate Ad Hominem, we can consider it in broader terms:

1. **Ad Hominem** may share properties with the <G> (Generalization) because it often involves generalizing from personal attributes to conclusions about a person's overall capability.
2. **Ad Hominem** could vaguely relate to <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) since the attack on character provides insufficient reason to conclude the opponent is unfit for presidency.

Nevertheless, Ad Hominem is a recognized fallacy specific in its own right outside the defective argument categories <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, and <DEP>.
