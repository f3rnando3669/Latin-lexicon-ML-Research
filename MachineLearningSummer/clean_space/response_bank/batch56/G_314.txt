For 
To analyze the statement "My Aunt was in the hospital for 6 weeks because she didn't wear a seatbelt," we need to identify which defective argument type applies. Here’s a breakdown using the defined defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This doesn't seem like a case of generalizing from an insufficient sample size or data.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement doesn't enumerate any relationships that would be incomplete or insufficient.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This statement does hint at an inconclusive reason. The direct causative link between not wearing a seatbelt and being in the hospital for 6 weeks can be seen as weak unless more details are provided. However, this is not the most precise categorization.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This more accurately fits the statement. The assertion that the hospitalization period was caused solely by not wearing a seatbelt could lack adequate causal evidence. There could be various factors at play that contributed to the injury severity and the length of the hospital stay.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The statement is not repeating any proposition, so this doesn't apply.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There is no appeal to or presumption of a consensus here.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language in the statement is pretty clear and it doesn’t seem to leave much to interpretation.

Therefore, the defective argument type that most appropriately applies to the statement "My Aunt was in the hospital for 6 weeks because she didn't wear a seatbelt" is:

**Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
