For 
The statement "My opponent is a card-carrying member of the K.K.K." can be identified as a defective argument type known as Ad Hominem Attack, which is labeled here as <IDAA>.

### Explanation of <IDAA> (Ad Hominem Attack):

An Ad Hominem Attack is where the argument attacks the person making the case rather than addressing the merits of the case itself. By pointing out that the opponent is a member of the K.K.K., the statement attempts to discredit the opponent's argument based on their character or affiliations rather than tackling the argument's substance.

### Application:
"My opponent is a card-carrying member of the K.K.K." is an <IDAA> because it targets the opponent's character and affiliations instead of evaluating the actual argument or position presented by the opponent.
