It looks like there might be a typo in your instructions since the IDAA acronym doesn't match any of the defective argument types you have defined. Could you please clarify if "IDAA" refers to one of the defective argument types or if it stands for something else? Based on the defective argument types you've provided, I can attempt to identify the correct one for the given statement.

The argument "Four out of five dentists recommend Happy Glossy toothpaste. Therefore, it must be great." could be identified as:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This argument type applies because the statement uses the recommendation of a sample of dentists (four out of five) to make a general claim about the toothpaste being great, but it does not provide comprehensive evidence or consider the entire pool of opinions.

If you intended for the acronym IDAA to refer to something else, please provide additional context.
