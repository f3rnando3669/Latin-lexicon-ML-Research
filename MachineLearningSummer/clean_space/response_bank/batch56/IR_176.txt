For 
Let's first remind ourselves of the list of defective argument types that were defined:

1. **Generalization (G)**
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**

Now, let's identify and apply an appropriate defective argument type analysis (IDAA) to the given statement: "A commercial shows images of animals in need to persuade the audience to make donations."

The statement describes a common persuasive technique used in commercials, but to evaluate whether this technique involves a defective argument, we need to examine it more closely.

**Analysis:**
1. **Generalization (G)**: This isn't an obvious fit because the commercial isn’t making a broad assertion based on limited examples.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The commercial doesn’t seem to be listing options or possibilities incompletely.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This could be applicable if the reason provided by the commercial for donating is considered weak or not directly related. The emotional appeal might not be considered a solid enough reason to donate.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There’s no clear causal argument being made here about why donations should be made.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The commercial is not repeating a flawed argument, so this doesn’t fit either.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The commercial might imply that everyone else is donating and thus you should too, which can be a form of presumptuous consensus.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language in the commercial might come off as vague or emotionally charged without giving concrete evidence or reasons.

After evaluating the options, the most fitting defective argument types for this commercial seem to be **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**, depending on how the commercial is framed:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: If the commercial relies on emotional appeals (images of animals in need) as the primary reason to donate, without providing substantive reasons or evidence that donations will effectively help the cause.
  
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: If the commercial suggests that there is a widespread consensus or obligation to donate without providing actual support for that consensus.

**Final IDAA:**
The primary defective argument type applied to "A commercial shows images of animals in need to persuade the audience to make donations." would be **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, with a secondary consideration for **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**, depending on the additional context and presentation of the commercial.
