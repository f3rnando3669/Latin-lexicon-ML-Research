For 
To apply an Identification of Defective Argument Types Analysis (IDAA) to the statement, "We think this new MallTime game app will be a success because all little girls like shopping," let's break down the argument and identify any defective argument types present:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument assumes that the preference of all little girls can be generalized based on the activity of shopping, which is an overgeneralization. Not all little girls like shopping, and thus generalizing this preference to guarantee the success of the game app is flawed.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not consider the range of interests that little girls might have. By assuming all little girls like shopping, it overlooks other factors or interests that could impact the appâ€™s success.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasoning provided does not conclusively support the claim that the app will be successful. The fact that some little girls like shopping does not necessarily mean they will like this specific game app.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument does not provide a strong causal connection between liking shopping and the success of a game app. It lacks evidence or reasoning to show that the preference for shopping will directly lead to the popularity and success of the game.

Considering the definition and context given, the statement contains several defective argument types:

- **Generalization (<G>)** is clearly present because it assumes all little girls like shopping.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** is present as it fails to account for the diversity of interests among little girls.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** is evident as the reasoning is not definitive enough to guarantee success.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** is also present, as the linkage between the liking of shopping and the game's success is inadequately supported.

Thus, the primary defective argument types in this statement are <G>, <FE>, <IR>, and <WCB>.
