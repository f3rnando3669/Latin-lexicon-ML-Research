Sure, let's analyze the statement "Makes the claim that EVERYONE is using this product, and you should, too." by applying <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Types):

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The claim that "EVERYONE is using this product" is a sweeping generalization. It implies a universal truth without providing substantial evidence that literally everyone uses this product.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - By stating "EVERYONE," the argument fails to enumerate who specifically uses this product. There is no clear evidence or list of individuals or demographics supporting this claim.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The reason given here ("EVERYONE is using this product") does not conclusively support the conclusion that "you should, too." The fact that others may be using it is not a strong, conclusive reason for you to do the same.

4. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - The argument assumes a consensus by claiming "EVERYONE" is using the product. It presumes a collective agreement without evidence, implying social proof as the main persuasive factor.

By applying <IDAA>, we can see that the statement contains elements of Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), and Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>). These defective argument types suggest that the reasoning behind the statement is flawed and lacks sufficient evidence to be persuasive or reliable.
