For 
Let's analyze the statement "We should ban all hairspray or the world will end!" and determine which defective argument type from the list applies.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument type involves making a broad statement based on limited or insufficient evidence.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This argument type involves considering only some possibilities and not all.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This argument type involves drawing a conclusion based on premises that do not actually support it.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This argument type involves asserting a cause-and-effect relationship without sufficient evidence.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This argument type involves repeating a proposition in different ways without actually proving it.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This argument type involves assuming that a certain viewpoint is correct because it is supposedly widely held.
7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This argument type involves the use of vague or unclear language that can be interpreted in multiple ways.

The statement "We should ban all hairspray or the world will end!" is making an extreme cause-and-effect claim without providing any substantial evidence. It suggests that not banning hairspray will literally lead to the end of the world, which is an exaggerated and unsupported causal relationship. Therefore, the argument type **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** seems to be the most fitting here.

So, we can apply <IDAA> and conclude:
"The statement 'We should ban all hairspray or the world will end!' is a defective argument type called Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)."
