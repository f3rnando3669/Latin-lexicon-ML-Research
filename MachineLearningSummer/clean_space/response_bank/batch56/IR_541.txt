Certainly! The term "<IDAA>" seems to be some analytical method to identify defective arguments. To analyze the given statement with the definitions provided:

**Statement**: “Grading this exam on a curve would be the most fair thing to do. After all, classes go more smoothly when the students and the professor are getting along well.”

Let’s break down this statement and see which defective argument types may apply:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This would involve making a broad assumption based on limited evidence. In this case, it's not directly relevant since the statement isn't generalizing from limited instances.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This involves listing out only a few options and neglecting others. This argument does not enumerate options but rather makes a specific claim.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This is applicable when the reason given does not sufficiently support the conclusion. Here, stating that grading on a curve is the most fair option because it makes classes smoother is an inconclusive reason. Just because classes are smoother does not directly imply that curve grading is the most fair method.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This involves asserting a causal relationship without sufficient evidence. The statement assumes that curve grading leads to smoother class interactions, which is not supported by sufficient evidence here.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This involves repeating a proposition without presenting new evidence. The argument does not repeat a proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This involves assuming consensus without evidence. The argument does assume that everyone will agree that smoother classes are a priority without providing evidence that this consensus exists.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This involves using vague or ambiguous terms that lead to unclear conclusions. Terms like "fair" and "smoothly" can be considered ambiguous as their meaning might vary among different people.

Based on this breakdown, here are the applicable defective argument types:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The conclusion that curve grading is the most fair is not well supported by the premise regarding smoother interactions.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: There is an unsupported assumption that curve grading causally leads to smoother class interactions.
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The terms "fair" and "smoothly" are ambiguous and can mean different things to different people, weakening the argument.

So, applying <IDAA> results in identifying <IR>, <WCB>, and <DEP> as defective argument types present in the statement.
