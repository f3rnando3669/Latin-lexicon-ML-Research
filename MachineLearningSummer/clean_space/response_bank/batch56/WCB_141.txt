The given example: "I have flipped heads five times in a row. As a result, the next flip will probably be tails." exemplifies a defective argument type known as the **Gambler's Fallacy**.

Explanation:
This argument's flaw lies in the assumption that past events influence future outcomes in a random process, where each flip of the coin is an independent event with a 50/50 probability for heads or tails. Statistically, the probability of flipping heads or tails remains the same regardless of previous outcomes. This type of erroneous reasoning often arises in contexts involving random, independent events.

Formally Labelled under Defective Argument Types:
**<IDAA>**: "Gamblerâ€™s Fallacy"

Example in Context:
**<IDAA>**: "I have flipped heads five times in a row. As a result, the next flip will probably be tails."

It misapplies probability by inaccurately assuming that prior independent results somehow affect future occurrences.

This example was not explicitly defined under your initial list, but it aligns closely with the concept of "Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)" because it incorrectly attempts to establish a causal link where none exists. Therefore:

**<WCB>**: Misassumption that previous independent events influence future outcomes in unrelated random events.
