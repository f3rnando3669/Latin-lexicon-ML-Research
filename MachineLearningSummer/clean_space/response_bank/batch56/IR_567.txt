For 
To apply the identification of defective argument types (IDAA) to the claim "There is no concrete proof that Duterte himself is corrupt; therefore, he is an honest politician," we need to analyze the argument and determine which of the defined defective arguments it might fall under.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: A generalization involves drawing a broad conclusion from a small or unrepresentative sample. This doesn't seem to fit since the argument is about a specific individual, not a broader category.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This fallacy occurs when not all necessary factors or cases are considered. This may apply here, as the argument only considers the lack of concrete proof without considering other potential factors or evidence that might indicate dishonesty (e.g., eyewitness testimony, circumstantial evidence).

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This occurs when the reason provided is insufficient to support the conclusion. This could apply because the absence of concrete proof does not necessarily mean that Duterte is honest; there could simply be no discovered or documented proof yet.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This involves assuming a causal relationship without sufficient evidence. This doesn’t seem to fit the argument as it's about character assessment rather than causality.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This involves repeatedly stating a proposition without providing new evidence or arguments. This does not seem to apply here either since we have a single statement rather than repetition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This involves assuming consensus without adequate evidence of agreement. The argument doesn’t seem to be based on consensus, but rather on the lack of contrary evidence.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This involves using language that is vague or has multiple meanings. The term "concrete proof" could be seen as ambiguous because what constitutes "concrete proof" can be subjective.

Based on this analysis, the argument primarily seems to reflect **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** and **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**. It relies on the absence of concrete proof without considering other evidence that might indicate dishonesty (Incomplete Enumeration), and the absence of proof does not logically prove honesty (Inconclusive Reason).*
