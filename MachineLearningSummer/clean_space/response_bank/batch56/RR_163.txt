Based on the definitions of the defective argument types provided, let's apply the <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument(s) Applied) to the statement:

"My new method of conducting meta-analyses is the most valid there is because it is the only one capable of such validity, the only one that has ever approached such validity, and the only one that is so completely valid."

1. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - The argument repeats the same proposition using slightly different wording to give an illusion of multiple supporting reasons.
     - "it is the only one capable of such validity"
     - "the only one that has ever approached such validity"
     - "the only one that is so completely valid"

Each part of the statement essentially conveys the same idea repeatedly: that the method is uniquely valid without providing distinct supporting evidence. This repetitive structure is characteristic of a faulty repetition of proposition.

Therefore, the defective argument type applied to this statement is primarily:

**<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**

This highlights the issue with the argument: it lacks diverse and substantiated support, opting instead for repetitive assertions.
