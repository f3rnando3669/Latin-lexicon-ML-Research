For 
The given argument can be analyzed using the framework of defective arguments.

The statement:
"What she says about Kepler's astronomy theory of the 1600's must be just so much garbage. Do you realize she's only fifteen years old?" 

is an example of an ad hominem fallacy, where the argument dismisses the validity of a person's statements based on irrelevant personal characteristics (in this case, the person's age) rather than the content of their argument.

IDAA stands for Identify, Define, Assess, and Apply the defective argument types. Here’s how it would look for this statement:

1. **Identify**: Recognize the type of defective argument present.
2. **Define**: Provide a definition of the identified defective argument.
3. **Assess**: Evaluate how the identified argument flaw applies to the original statement.
4. **Apply**: Illustrate the defectiveness within the context of the argument.

1. **Identify**: 
   This argument dismisses the content of the statement based on the age of the person. It can be seen as <IR> "Inconclusive Reason" because it focuses on the irrelevance of the person's age instead of engaging with the actual content of the argument.

2. **Define**:
   <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) - An argument that presents a reason which, even if true, does not sufficiently support the conclusion.

3. **Assess**: 
   The reasoning here is dismissed purely based on the individual's age, which is irrelevant to the accuracy or validity of insights on Kepler's astronomy theory. Age does not directly correlate with one's understanding or knowledge of a historical scientific theory. Therefore, it doesn't conclusively address whether the statement about Kepler's astronomy theory is valid or not.

4. **Apply**:
   The defectiveness of the argument is evident as follows: 
   "The conclusion that her statements about Kepler’s astronomy theory are 'garbage' is not supported by an examination of the content of her statements but rather by an unrelated aspect—her age. Dismissing her statements because she is fifteen years old does not provide a logical examination of the accuracy of her claims. Thus, the argument is inconclusive."

Therefore, this argument is defective due to <IR> "Inconclusive Reason" as it improperly dismisses the argument based on an irrelevant factor instead of addressing the actual claim.
