To apply the defective argument types to the statement "Primitive people believed in gods to explain natural phenomena. We have science, and are not primitive anymore. Therefore, there is no God," we'll analyze the argument and identify any defects as defined:

1. **Generalization (G)**: The argument might be generalizing the belief system of all primitive people. It assumes that all primitive cultures believed in gods solely to explain natural phenomena, without considering the variety and complexity of their beliefs. This overgeneralization can be misleading.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument lists only two possibilities: belief in gods to explain natural phenomena versus reliance on science. It overlooks other potential reasons or explanations for belief in gods, such as spirituality, cultural tradition, or personal experience.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The conclusion that "there is no God" does not logically follow from the premises. The advancement of science does not inherently disprove the existence of deities. The argument's reasoning is thus inconclusive and does not adequately support the conclusion.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument connects the belief in gods to the lack of scientific knowledge, implying that with scientific understanding, belief in gods is unnecessary. This causation is not sufficiently established and does not account for people who hold both scientific and religious beliefs.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This defective type is not clearly applicable here, as the argument does not involve repetitive propositions to support the conclusion.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument presumes a consensus that modern science invalidates the existence of God, which is not universally agreed upon. This assumption of unanimous agreement is unwarranted and defeats the argument's credibility.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The terms "primitive," "natural phenomena," and "science" are ambiguously used. The word “primitive” could be derogatory or misrepresent various cultures' complexity, "natural phenomena" is too broad, and "science" encompasses various fields with different scopes, making the language used in the argument ambiguous.

Conclusively, the argument contains several defective elements: it generalizes (G), incompletely enumerates (FE), provides inconclusive reasoning (IR), assumes insufficient causality (WCB), presumes consensus (FU), and uses ambiguous language (DEP). These defects undermine the argument's validity.
