Sure, let's break down the argument "J.K. Rowling is a wonderful writer because she writes so well" to determine if it fits any of the defined defective argument types.

1. **Generalization (G)** - This refers to making broad claims based on limited evidence.
   - This doesn't appear to be a generalization since it's a specific claim about J.K. Rowling.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** - This involves listing some evidence but leaving out other relevant evidence.
   - This argument doesn't seem to list or enumerate evidence, so it's unlikely to be an incomplete enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** - This refers to a reason that doesn’t conclusively support the claim.
   - The reason given ("she writes so well") could be seen as subjective and not necessarily conclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** - This involves a weak causal connection between the cause and effect stated.
   - There's no causal relationship outlined in this argument, so this doesn't apply here.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** - This refers to restating the proposition with almost the same words without providing additional evidence.
   - This seems to fit: "wonderful writer" and "writes so well" are almost synonymous, making it just a repetition without further evidence or explanation.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** - This assumes that the majority or consensus agrees without evidence of such agreement.
   - This isn't implying any consensus, so it doesn't fit presumptuous consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)** - This involves using language that is unclear, vague, or has multiple interpretations.
   - The language here isn’t particularly ambiguous but rather repetitive.

Based on the analysis, the statement "J.K. Rowling is a wonderful writer because she writes so well" fits the defective argument type <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).

Thus, applying <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Application), the answer is:

"J.K. Rowling is a wonderful writer because she writes so well" is an example of RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
