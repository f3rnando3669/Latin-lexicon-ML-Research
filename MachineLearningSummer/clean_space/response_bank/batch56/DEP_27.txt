The defective argument type applicable to the statement "But professor, I got all these facts from a program I saw on TV once... I donâ€™t remember the name of it though." can be identified in multiple ways. 

First, let's break it down:

1. The speaker is making an appeal to a source of information (a TV program) but fails to provide verifiable details or credentials of that source.
2. The inability to recall the name of the program or any specific details undermines the credibility of the information.

Analyzing this statement, we find potential involvement of the following defective argument types:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reasoning provided (animation from an unnamed TV program) is not a strong or conclusive basis for establishing the facts in question since there isn't enough information to verify or assess the credibility of the source.
  
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** Though not language in the traditional sense, referring to "a program I saw on TV once" without any specific details can be considered a type of ambiguity where the reference is too vague to be meaningful or useful for verification.

Given these points, the most fitting defective argument type is:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This is because the fundamental flaw here is that the source can't be verified or evaluated due to lack of details, rendering the reasoning inconclusive.

So, applying IDAA, we have:

**<IR> Inconclusive Reason:**
The claim's supporting evidence (the unspecified TV program) is insufficiently detailed to draw a conclusive reason about the accuracy of the facts presented.
