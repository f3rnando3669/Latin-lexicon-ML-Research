<Generalization> "We think this new MallTime game app will be a success because all girls like shopping."

This argument assumes that because "all girls like shopping," they will therefore like the MallTime game app. This is a hasty generalization because it applies a broad stereotype to all individuals within the group, which is not necessarily accurate or fair. Not all girls like shopping, and even those who do may not be interested in a shopping-themed game app. The argument oversimplifies the preferences of a diverse group of people, making it a defective.<G>
