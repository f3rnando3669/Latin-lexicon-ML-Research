For 
"Too much candy can cause cavities. You should avoid eating any candy unless you want cavities."

Let's apply the defective argument types to analyze the reasoning in the given statement:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument might be considered a generalization if it improperly assumes that all candy consumption will lead to cavities, without considering the amount or frequency of consumption, or other factors like dental hygiene.

   - ***Generalization Example*: "Too much candy can cause cavities" generalized to "You should avoid eating any candy."**

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This could be the case if the argument lists a cause (candy leading to cavities) but does not account for other factors or conditions that also play a role in cavity formation, such as oral hygiene habits or genetic predisposition.

   - ***Incomplete Enumeration Example*: Failing to mention other conditions that could lead to cavities and only focusing on candy consumption.**

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning might be inconclusive if there's insufficient evidence to jump directly from "too much candy *can* cause cavities" to the prescription to avoid *any* candy entirely. The cause and effect relationship isn't conclusively proven for all cases.

   - ***Inconclusive Reason Example*: "Too much candy can cause cavities" does not conclusively justify "You should avoid eating any candy."**

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This seems connected to IR but emphasizes that the cause-effect link does not provide a strong enough basis for the extreme advice given.

   - ***Insufficient Causal Basis Example*: There isn't enough causal evidence to support the claim that any consumption of candy will lead to cavities.**

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This argument type doesn't seem directly applicable here since there's no repeated proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This doesn't apply directly since the argument doesn't rely on assumed widespread agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The argument could be said to use some degree of ambiguous language, like "too much candy," which might be interpreted differently by different people.

   - ***Ambiguous Language Example*: "Too much candy" is vague and subjective, and "you should avoid eating any candy unless" introduces ambiguity regarding how much candy is 'too much.'**

Based on the analysis, the most relevant defective argument types for this statement seem to be Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), and Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).

- **Generalization (G)**: The conclusion overgeneralizes from "too much candy" to "avoid any candy."
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Fails to consider additional factors contributing to cavities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Insufficiently justified leap from cause to prescription.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Lacking strong causal evidence to support the advice given.

Thus, the reasoning in the statement "Too much candy can cause cavities. You should avoid eating any candy unless you want cavities." demonstrates characteristics of G, FE, IR, and WCB.
