The argument "What’s the point of living? We’re all going to die anyway." can be identified as Inconclusive Reason (IR) and Defective Ambiguous Assertion (DEP).

### Analysis:
1. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** 
   - The premise that "we’re all going to die anyway" does not logically lead to the conclusion that life has no point. The fact that life is finite does not inherently negate its value or purpose. Various philosophical, ethical, and existential perspectives can attribute meaning and significance to life despite its temporary nature.

2. **Defective Ambiguous Assertion (DEP):**
   - The phrase "the point of living" is ambiguous and can be interpreted in multiple ways. It might refer to personal purpose, overall meaning, or other subjective constructs, making the argument susceptible to misunderstanding and misinterpretation. The lack of clear definition for "the point" leads to ambiguity.

By identifying these defective argument types, we can see that the original statement fails to provide a conclusive and unambiguous reason for its claim.
