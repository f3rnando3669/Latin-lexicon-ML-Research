In applying <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Types and Analyze) to the statement "This tactic plays upon a viewer's lack of knowledge by forcing the idea that the situation is static. Unless the audience is well-informed and aware of this deception, they may think that they have only two choices," we need to identify any defective argument types present in the statement and analyze them accordingly.

1. Generalization (<G>): The statement might involve a generalization by suggesting that all viewers will be equally misled by this tactic unless they are well-informed. However, individual viewers' responses may vary.

2. Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>): The notion that the audience may think they have "only two choices" simplifies the potential range of options or interpretations the audience might have. This suggests an incomplete enumeration by not accounting for all possible choices or nuances in audience reaction.

3. Inconclusive Reason (<IR>): The statement presumes that the well-informed audience will avoid deception, which assumes that awareness alone will prevent being misled. This might be an inconclusive reason, as there can be other factors at play in how information is interpreted.

4. Ambiguous Language (<DEP>): Phrases like "plays upon a viewer's lack of knowledge" and "forcing the idea" are somewhat vague and open to interpretation. What constitutes "lack of knowledge" or "forcing" is not specified clearly, making the language ambiguous.

To summarize:

- Generalization (<G>) is present in assuming that all viewers will react the same way.
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>) appears by suggesting only two choices.
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>) is identified in the assumption that awareness alone prevents deception.
- Ambiguous Language (<DEP>) is noted due to the unclear terms used.

By identifying these defective arguments, the statement's limitations and potential bias or unclarity are exposed, allowing for a more critical analysis of the argument presented.
