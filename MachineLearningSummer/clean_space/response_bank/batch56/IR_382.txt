It sounds like you are providing a list of defective argument types and asking for the application of some form of argument analysis to a specific statement. However, it's unclear what "<IDAA>" specifically refers to. Assuming "<IDAA>" is a directive for some form of Argument Analysis applying defective argument types where relevant, let's break down the statement provided and see where the defective arguments might be:

**Statement**: "Marco cusses a lot, so you can't listen to a thing he says. He's not a good guy."

1. **Generalization** (<G>): The statement makes a generalization about Marco based on his cussing habit. Just because Marco cusses frequently does not mean everything he says is invalid or that he is automatically a bad person. This is an overgeneralization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration** (<FE>): This argument might imply that only Marco's cussing is considered when assessing his credibility or character. It ignores other behaviors, actions, or facts that might influence one's judgment about Marco.

3. **Inconclusive Reason** (<IR>): The reason provided ("Marco cusses a lot") does not conclusively lead to the conclusion ("He's not a good guy" or "You can't listen to a thing he says"). There might be many reasons why someone could be considered a "good guy" or worth listening to, and cussing alone is not sufficient to discredit him entirely.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis** (<WCB>): The statement implies a cause-and-effect relationship between cussing and overall credibility or moral character, which is not necessarily a valid causal connection.

5. **Ambiguous Language** (<DEP>): The term "not a good guy" is ambiguous and subjective. What qualifies someone as "not a good guy" can vary widely depending on personal values or societal norms. The terms “lot” and “cusses” also lack specificity.

Therefore, we can categorize several parts of the argument with the defective types defined:

1. **<G> (Generalization)**: "you can't listen to a thing he says"
2. **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: "cusses a lot" as a sole basis for judgment
3. **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: linking cussing to being "not a good guy"
4. **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: assuming cussing alone implies general lack of credibility
5. **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language)**: "not a good guy"

This analysis shows how multiple categories of defective arguments can be applied to critically evaluate the given statement.
