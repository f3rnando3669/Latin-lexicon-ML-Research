For 
To apply the Defective Argument Analysis Approach (IDAA) to the statement "You're clearly just too young to understand what’s happening," we need to evaluate it within the context of the defective argument types we've defined:

1. **Generalization (G):** This type of defective argument involves making a broad claim based on limited evidence. The statement doesn't seem to fit here as it targets a specific characteristic (age) rather than generalizing from a few examples.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This involves a claim based on an incomplete list of possibilities. The statement isn't enumerating possibilities; it’s making a direct assertion.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This type involves presenting reasons that don't adequately support the conclusion. One could argue this statement uses an inconclusive reason by implying that age alone determines understanding without proof or further explanation.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This involves claiming a causal relationship without sufficient evidence. The statement weakly suggests that being young causes a lack of understanding without supporting evidence.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This is about repeating an assertion without additional evidence, simply restating a claim doesn't fit this context.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This involves assuming that a claim is true because a majority or an authority agrees with it. The statement doesn't appeal to a consensus or authority.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** This involves the use of vague or ambiguous terms. While "too young" could be considered somewhat vague, the argument rests more on a direct assertion about age rather than using outright ambiguous language.

Based on this evaluation, the statement "You're clearly just too young to understand what’s happening" most closely fits:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** It provides a reason (being too young) that is inadequate to sufficiently support the conclusion that the person cannot understand what’s happening, without offering further justification or evidence.
