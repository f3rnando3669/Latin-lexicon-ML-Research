For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application, so let’s apply this to the statement:

"The Democrats support more aggressive gun control laws. Can you believe they want to deny repeat offenders and those on the terrorist watch list their rights?"

First, let's break down the statement and identify any potential defective arguments:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This occurs when a broad statement is made based on limited evidence. In this case, stating "The Democrats support more aggressive gun control laws" could be a generalization since it assumes that all Democrats support this policy without providing specific evidence or acknowledging intra-party differences.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This type of defective argument enumerates causes or parts but fails to account for all relevant factors. The statement doesn't fall into this category since it doesn’t list out a series of elements incompletely.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This occurs when the reasons provided don’t necessarily lead to the conclusion. The reasoning here is attempting to equate supporting aggressive gun control laws with denying rights, but it doesn’t conclusively show that the law would unjustly deny rights without adequate justification.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This refers to a cause-and-effect relationship that lacks adequate support. It’s not clear if this applies directly here since the statement isn’t making a direct causal claim, although it implies a correlation between gun control and the denial of rights.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This involves repeating a proposition in different words leading to a circular argument. The statement does not appear to employ circular reasoning.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This occurs when an argument seeks to establish its validity by claiming that it is commonly agreed upon, without evidence. The use of "Can you believe they want to deny…" might suggest an appeal to common shock or a presumed consensus against such denial, though it's not explicit.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This uses language that is open to multiple interpretations. The phrase "aggressive gun control laws" and "deny...their rights" could be seen as somewhat ambiguous and loaded, depending on one's interpretation of what constitutes "aggressive" or "rights."

Based on these definitions and the provided statement, here's the application:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement generalizes the stance of Democrats on gun control without specifying evidence or considering dissent within the group.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The argument suggests that aggressive gun control inherently means the unfair denial of rights to certain individuals without sufficient reasoning to support this strong conclusion.
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The terms "aggressive gun control laws" and "deny...their rights" can be considered ambiguous and emotionally loaded, which can mislead the audience about the specifics of the policies and rights involved.

Hence, the revised application of <IDAA> is as follows:

**Generalization (<G>)**, **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**
