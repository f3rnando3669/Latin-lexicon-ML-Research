For 
To analyze the given statement using <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Attributes), let's break down the sentence and apply the defined defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The statement claims, "Our country is certainly in terrible shape," which is a broad and generalized claim. This generalization might oversimplify the complexities and nuances of the country's condition without providing specific evidence or examples to substantiate it.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The list of positive attributes mentioned ("we still have all kinds of freedoms, cultural diversity, emergency rooms and trauma care, agencies like the FDA out to protect us, the entertainment industry, a free market, national parks, we are considered the most powerful nation in the world, have amazing opportunities, and free public education") might be seen as an incomplete enumeration because it selectively highlights certain aspects but doesn't acknowledge others that might contradict the conclusion. By only listing positives, the argument ignores negative aspects which could provide a more balanced view.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The argument states that despite having all these positive attributes, the country is "in terrible shape." This type of reasoning is inconclusive because it does not provide specific reasons or evidence to explain why these positives do not outweigh or mitigate the country's supposed terrible shape, nor does it define what "terrible shape" specifically means.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - The claim that the country is in terrible shape is presented without an adequate causal basis. No evidence or examples are given to explain why the country's positive aspects do not contribute meaningfully to its overall condition or what causes the supposed negative state. 

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - There is no repetition of a proposition in this particular statement, so this defective argument type does not apply here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - The phrase "Our country is certainly in terrible shape" implies a consensus without providing evidence that this view is widely held or supported by others. It presumes that the opinion is a given fact without demonstrating that there is a general agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - The term "terrible shape" is ambiguous and subjective, as it is open to interpretation and not clearly defined. What constitutes "terrible shape" can vary widely depending on individual perspectives and criteria. This makes the argument dependent on ambiguous language.

Based on the <IDAA> analysis, the identified defective argument attributes in the given statement are primarily:

- Generalization (<G>)
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
- Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)

These defective argument types illustrate the various ways the statement lacks logical robustness and substantiation.
