Before applying the defective argument types, let's briefly understand what they mean in the context of argument analysis:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: Making a broad statement based on limited evidence.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Failing to consider all relevant possibilities or cases.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Providing a premise that does not strongly support the conclusion.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Claiming a causal relationship without enough evidence.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Repeating a claim without introducing new evidence.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Assuming something is true because many people believe it.
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: Using words or phrases that are unclear or have multiple meanings.

Now, let's analyze the statement "Eighty-five percent of those surveyed said that it is important to have a cell phone." using <IDAA>:

1. Identify the Defective Argument Applied (IDAA):
   A plausible defective argument type for this statement is **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.

2. Explain why:
    This is because the statement suggests the importance of having a cell phone based on the high percentage of people who believe it is. The argument relies on what a majority believes, assuming this belief itself is sound evidence for the importance of having a cell phone. This is an example of an argumentum ad populum fallacy: assuming that widespread belief necessarily implies truth.

So, applying the IDAA to the statement, we have:

"Eighty-five percent of those surveyed said that it is important to have a cell phone." can be classified as a **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** because the argument relies on the majority's opinion as the primary evidence for the claim, without further supporting reasons.
