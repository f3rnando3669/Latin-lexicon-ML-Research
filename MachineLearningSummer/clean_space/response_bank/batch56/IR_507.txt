For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Authentication scheme, which is a hypothetical tool used to label various types of defective arguments in a given dialogue. Let's apply this to the given dialogue:

Service Tech: Your car could use some new tires.
Bart: You have a financial interest in selling me tires, why should I trust you? 
<Response: FE - Incomplete Enumeration>
- Bart is suggesting that the Service Tech's financial interest automatically invalidates their recommendation. This overlooks other potential reasons for the recommendation, such as safety concerns or actual tire wear, hence an Incomplete Enumeration.

Service Tech: You brought your car to me to have it checked, sir.
<Response: IR - Inconclusive Reason>
- The Service Tech's statement is an attempt to redirect without addressing Bart's concern about trust, which is an Inconclusive Reason. Just because Bart brought the car in for a check-up doesn't directly address the trust issue raised.

Bart: I brought my car to the shop where you work.
<Response: IR - Inconclusive Reason>
- Bart is reiterating that his action was toward the shop, not necessarily the Service Tech. It is still not addressing the trust concern, making it an Inconclusive Reason.

Service Tech: So should we forget about the new tires for now?
<Response: FU - Presumptuous Consensus>
- The Service Tech presumes consensus or an implied decision without actually achieving agreement, which is presumptuous, hence a Presumptuous Consensus.

Bart: I never suggested that. Are you trying to use reverse psychology on me, so I will buy the tires?
<Response: DEP - Ambiguous Language>
- Bart's response involves an assumption and introduces an ambiguous term "reverse psychology," which shifts the conversation into potentially unclear territory, making it an example of Ambiguous Language.

By identifying the defective arguments in the discussion, we can see the multiple points where reasoning is either incomplete, inconclusive, or built on assumptions and ambiguity.
