Certainly! To properly identify and apply the defective argument types (<IDAA>) to "AttP 1: Jenny & Bert's Economy Conversation," I would first need the content of that specific conversation. 

Since the conversation's actual content isn't provided, let's proceed with a hypothetical example of a conversation about the economy between Jenny and Bert to apply these identified defective argument types.

**Hypothetical Conversation:**

**Jenny**: "The economy is collapsing because I've heard some local businesses are closing down. <G>"

**Bert**: "Yeah, I agree. Every time I walk downtown, I see at least three businesses with 'For Lease' signs. <FE>"

**Jenny**: "It's clear that we're headed for another Great Depression! <IR>"

**Bert**: "Exactly, there are so many problems it has to be something big like that. <WCB>"

**Jenny**: "And everyone I talk to thinks the same—everyone's afraid of the impending economic crash. <FU>"

**Bert**: "Yeah, and I keep telling people the economy is collapsing. The more I tell people, the more they seem to agree. <RR>"

**Jenny**: "And when people say things like 'economic downturn' or 'slow growth', they mean the same thing as 'collapsing economy'. <DEP>"

**Applying Defective Argument Types:**

1. **Jenny**: "The economy is collapsing because I've heard some local businesses are closing down. **<G>**"
    - **Generalization (G)**: Jenny is making a broad conclusion about the entirety of the economy based on limited observations of local businesses closing down.

2. **Bert**: "Yeah, I agree. Every time I walk downtown, I see at least three businesses with 'For Lease' signs. **<FE>**"
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Bert's observation is limited to a small area (downtown) and limited instances (three businesses), which aren't sufficient to generalize about the entire economy.

3. **Jenny**: "It's clear that we're headed for another Great Depression! **<IR>**"
    - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Jenny’s assertion about an impending Great Depression isn't substantiated with strong or extensive evidence, making the reasoning inconclusive.

4. **Bert**: "Exactly, there are so many problems it has to be something big like that. **<WCB>**"
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Bert is assuming causation without sufficient basis, implying that multiple unspecified problems directly indicate an event as significant as the Great Depression.

5. **Jenny**: "And everyone I talk to thinks the same—everyone's afraid of the impending economic crash. **<FU>**"
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Jenny is relying on a presumed consensus among people she talks to as evidence, which may not accurately reflect the broader population or expert opinion.

6. **Bert**: "Yeah, and I keep telling people the economy is collapsing. The more I tell people, the more they seem to agree. **<RR>**"
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Bert is using repetition as a flawed means of validating his proposition, assuming that agreement through repetition constitutes proof.

7. **Jenny**: "And when people say things like 'economic downturn' or 'slow growth', they mean the same thing as 'collapsing economy'. **<DEP>**"
    - **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Jenny uses vague or ambiguous terms interchangeably, blurring distinct economic terms ('economic downturn', 'slow growth') with a more severe descriptor ('collapsing economy') to reinforce her argument.

By systematically identifying these defective argument types, we gain insight into the potential flaws within Jenny and Bert's conversation about the economy.
