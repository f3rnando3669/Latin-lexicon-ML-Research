For 
The dialogue between Jack and Nick can be analyzed using the specified defective argument types. Here, we apply <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Attributes) to assess the argument structure:

### Argument Breakdown:
**Jack:** "I have tiny, invisible unicorns living in my anus."
**Nick:** "How do you figure?"
**Jack:** "Can you prove that I don't?"
**Nick:** "No."
**Jack:** "Then I do."

### Defective Argument Types Applied:

1. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:**
   - **Description:** Arguments where conclusions are drawn from premises that do not provide solid justification for the conclusion.
   - **Application:** Jack's conclusion that he has tiny, invisible unicorns living in his anus is based on Nick's inability to disprove the claim. The absence of disproof does not constitute proof of the claim.

2. **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:**
   - **Description:** Arguments which omit relevant possibilities or alternatives.
   - **Application:** Jack disregards other possible explanations or the need for positive proof for his claim. Just because Nick cannot disprove it does not mean it is true; it overlooks the necessity of proving such an extraordinary allegation.

3. **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:**
   - **Description:** Reiterating a claim without adding new evidence or reasoning does not substantiate the claim.
   - **Application:** Jack repeats the assertion "Then I do" based only on the lack of disproof, rather than presenting positive evidence.

4. **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:**
   - **Description:** Arguments presuming that consensus or lack thereof on a topic supports one's claim.
   - **Application:** Jack presumes that Nick's agreement or inability to disprove implies truth, ignoring the absence of any evidence supporting his claim.

### Conclusion:
Jack's argument embodies multiple defective attributes:
- The use of an **<IR> Inconclusive Reason** to claim unicorns based merely on the lack of disproval.
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration** since the argument dismisses other critical possibilities (e.g., the expectation of proof).
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition,** because the repetition doesn't offer new supportive reasoning.
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus,** as Jack presumes agreement or Nick's inability to disprove equates to truth.

Thus, the combined defective argument types <IR>, <FE>, <RR>, and <FU> illustrate the flawed reasoning within Jack's statements.
