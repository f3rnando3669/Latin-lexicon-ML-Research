For 
<IDAA> stands for Identify Defective Argument Application. Let's apply it to the given statement: "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess all the other classes will all fail it, too."

Upon analyzing the statement, we are looking for any defective argument types as defined:

1. **Generalization (G)** - This occurs when a conclusion is drawn about a whole group based on an insufficient sample size.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** - This occurs when a statement does not consider all the relevant cases matter.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** - This occurs when the reasoning provided does not sufficiently support the conclusion.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** - This occurs when a presumed cause-and-effect relationship is not adequately supported.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** - This takes place when an argument is repeatedly stated with no new reasoning or evidence.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** - This occurs when the argument assumes unanimous agreement without good reason.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)** - This occurs when unclear or vague language is used, leading to potential misinterpretation.

The statement, "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess all the other classes will all fail it, too," makes a broad assumption based on the performance of a small group. It assumes that because three kids in one class failed, all students in all other classes will also fail.

By reviewing the definitions:

- This is best classified as a **Generalization (G)** because it applies the performance of three students to all students across multiple classes without sufficient evidence.

Therefore, the <IDAA> application would classify this statement primarily under <G>.

So, the identified defective argument type(s) in the given statement is:
- <G> Generalization.
