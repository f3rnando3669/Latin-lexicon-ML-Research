Sure, let's identify the defective argument in the given dialogue using the defined categories.

**Mom: Watching TV that close will make you go blind, so move back!**
**Jonny: That is B.S., Mom. Sorry, I am not moving.**

In this exchange, the argument can be analyzed as follows:

1. **Mom's Argument**: Watching TV that close will make you go blind.
2. **Jonny's Response**: That is B.S., Mom. Sorry, I am not moving.

**Analysis of Mom's Argument**:
- The claim is "Watching TV that close will make you go blind."
- However, this claim can be considered an instance of <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), as modern scientific evidence does not support the assertion that watching TV up close leads to blindness. The evidence for this causal relationship is insufficient and inconclusive.

**Analysis of Jonny's Response**:
- Jonny dismisses the claim by saying "That is B.S., Mom" without providing any counter-evidence or reasoning.
- His response can be categorized under <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), as he merely repeats his disbelief without substantiating it or engaging in a constructive discussion.
  
So, in conclusion:

- **Mom's Argument**: <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)
- **Jonny's Response**: <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)

Identifying the defective arguments helps highlight the need for more evidence-based reasoning and constructive dialogue.
