For 
It looks like you are asking to apply one of the defined defective argument types to the statement: "You oversleep and then fail a test; so you assume that oversleeping causes you to fail tests."

Based on the definition provided, this type of reasoning falls under the defective argument type called **<WCB>** or **Insufficient Causal Basis**. The reason is that the statement erroneously implies a causal relationship between oversleeping and failing tests without sufficient evidence to support this claim. Oversleeping might contribute to failing a test, but there could be many other factors involved, and one instance does not establish a definitive causal link.
