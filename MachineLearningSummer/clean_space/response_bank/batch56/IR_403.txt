For 
<IDAA> stands for the application of an argument-identification system to classify a particular argument into one of the defective argument types you've defined. This system could logically be part of a larger framework for analyzing argumentative discourse or rhetoric. Given the statement, "Congressman Darell Issa calls White House Spokesperson Jay Carney a 'paid liar,'" let’s analyze it to see what kind of defective argument type it might fall into.

1. **Generalization (G)**: This occurs when a broad statement is made based on limited evidence.
   - Analysis: The statement does not seem to be making a broad generalization based on insufficient evidence; it is a specific accusation against a single individual.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This happens when a conclusion is drawn from an incomplete list of options or instances.
   - Analysis: The accusation does not imply that it is drawn from a consideration of all possible evidence or instances, so this does not seem to apply.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This is when the reasoning presented is not strong enough to sufficiently support the conclusion.
   - Analysis: The statement directly calls someone a "paid liar" without providing sufficient evidence or reasoning to support this claim. Therefore, it could fit this category.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This would mean asserting a causal relationship without sufficient grounds to do so.
   - Analysis: The statement contains an implicit causal claim (that Carney lies because he is paid to do so), but it doesn’t provide evidence for this causal relationship. Thus, this could also fit.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This is characterized by repeating a proposition without advancing the argument.
   - Analysis: The statement does not seem to suffer from repetitive redundancy; it is a singular, specific accusation.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This is asserting something to be true based on presumed agreement without evidence.
   - Analysis: The Congressman does not assert that everyone agrees with his accusation, so this does not apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This involves using ambiguous language that can confuse or mislead.
   - Analysis: The statement "paid liar" might have some degree of vagueness or escalation, but it's fairly direct in its intent and lacks the kind of ambiguity typically associated with this category.

Two possible classifications emerge:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, as the reasoning (assuming that Jay Carney lies because he is paid to do so) is not backed by evidence within the statement.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, due to the lack of evidence supporting the underlying cause-and-effect claim implied.

Given the specific nature of the accusation and the absence of substantiated reasoning, <IDAA> might classify this statement primarily under **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**.
