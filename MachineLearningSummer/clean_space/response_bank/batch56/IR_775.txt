Certainly! To break down the argument and identify any defective arguments using their corresponding tags:

### Argument:
"MacDougal roots for a British football team. Clearly he's unfit to be a police chief in Ireland."

### Analysis:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - **Definition**: Broad conclusions drawn from limited or inadequate evidence.
   - **Application**: Assuming that because MacDougal supports a British football team, he is unfit to be a police chief in Ireland can be seen as a broad and sweeping conclusion.
   - **Tag**: <G>

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - **Definition**: Failing to consider all the relevant possibilities or only listing a few cases.
   - **Application**: The argument does not consider other qualities or qualifications that might make MacDougal fit or unfit for the position.
   - **Tag**: <FE>

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - **Definition**: Offering reasons that do not sufficiently justify the conclusion.
   - **Application**: The fact that MacDougal roots for a British football team does not provide a conclusive reason for his ability or inability to be a police chief in Ireland.
   - **Tag**: <IR>

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - **Definition**: Claiming a causal relationship without sufficient evidence.
   - **Application**: There is no evidence provided that rooting for a British football team affects one’s ability to be a police chief in Ireland.
   - **Tag**: <WCB>

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - **Definition**: Repeating the same proposition without additional support.
   - **Application**: The statement does not involve repetition of the same claim for effect.
   - **Tag**: Not applicable.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - **Definition**: Assuming that a belief or consensus among a group justifies a conclusion.
   - **Application**: The argument does not involve assuming a consensus or citing a group's belief as justification.
   - **Tag**: Not applicable.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - **Definition**: Using language that is unclear or vague, leading to potential misunderstanding.
   - **Application**: The language used is direct and not particularly ambiguous.
   - **Tag**: Not applicable.

### Defective Argument Tags Applied:

The argument can be critiqued using the following tags:
- <G> (Generalization): Assuming support for a British football team implies unfitness for a police chief position in Ireland is an overgeneralization.
- <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration): Failing to consider other important factors in evaluating MacDougal’s fitness for the position.
- <IR> (Inconclusive Reason): The reason provided does not sufficiently justify the conclusion.
- <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis): Lacking evidence for a causal relationship between supporting a football team and unfitness for the job.

Thus, the argument "MacDougal roots for a British football team. Clearly he's unfit to be a police chief in Ireland." can be tagged with <G>, <FE>, <IR>, and <WCB>.
