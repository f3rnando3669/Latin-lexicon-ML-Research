The argument presented: "Either you can save your money to buy a new car for yourself, or you can just take an Uber around for the rest of your life." can be identified as an example of a **false dilemma** or **false dichotomy**. This argument type presents a situation as having only two possible outcomes when, in reality, other alternatives might exist.

For instance, one could lease a car, use public transportation, carpool, ride a bicycle, or walk, among other options. By ignoring these alternatives, the argument creates a misleading perception of the choices.

In the context of the defective argument types defined:

- <IDAA> could represent **Insufficient Dichotomous Argument Assertion**.

Therefore, applying <IDAA> to the argument means identifying the fallacy of presenting a false dichotomy:

**IDAA**: The argument commits a **false dichotomy** by asserting that the only options available are either saving money to buy a new car or taking an Uber for the rest of your life, neglecting the existence of multiple other practical alternatives.
