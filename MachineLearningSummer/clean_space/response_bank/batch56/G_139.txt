To apply the Identification and Defective Argument Analysis (IDAA) method to the statement "Miller Lite is cheap beer, so the Guinness will be cheap, too," we will identify any defective argument types present:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument could fall under Generalization if it assumes that because one type of beer (Miller Lite) is cheap, all beers (including Guinness) must also be cheap, without considering that different brands and types of beer can have varying prices.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This argument does not list out all possible beers and their prices, so it could be seen as an incomplete enumeration by making a conclusion based on an insufficient subset of beers.

3. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The argument "Miller Lite is cheap beer, so the Guinness will be cheap, too" doesn't fall under this category as it does not repeat a proposition in a faulty manner.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is no causal link established between the price of Miller Lite and the price of Guinness. Just because Miller Lite is cheap doesn’t cause Guinness to be cheap; thus, this is an insufficient causal basis.

5. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Using Miller Lite's price as a reason for Guinness's price is inconclusive, as the two beers are distinct products that could have different pricing strategies and market positions.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument does not rely on the assumption that there is a consensus about beer prices, so it doesn’t fall under this category.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language used in the argument is clear and not ambiguous.

Based on the above analysis, the argument primarily falls under:
- **Generalization (G)**: Assuming that all beers must share similar pricing because Miller Lite is cheap.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Failing to consider a comprehensive set of examples before making the conclusion.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is no causal relationship between the price of Miller Lite and Guinness.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided does not conclusively support the conclusion.

Thus, the statement "Miller Lite is cheap beer, so the Guinness will be cheap, too" can be identified as containing multiple defective arguments, primarily **Generalization (G)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, and **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
