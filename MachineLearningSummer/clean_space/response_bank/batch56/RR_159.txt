The argument "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people." implies that the issue with the judicial system can be straightforwardly resolved simply by electing new people. This suggests a causal relationship without sufficient evidence to support such a conclusion, and it oversimplifies a complex issue.

Applying the defective argument types:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This is an example of "Insufficient Causal Basis" because it assumes that the root cause of the problem with the judicial system can be entirely attributed to the current people in office, and that electing new people would fix it. This causal relationship is not substantiated by evidence.

Thus, the logical fallacy represented here is "Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)."
