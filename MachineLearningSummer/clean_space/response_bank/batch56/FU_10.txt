For 
The concept you provided, <IDAA>, hasn't been explicitly defined in your list of defective argument types. However, let's consider the possibilities based on usual logical fallacies that relate to such a statement:

- **Generalization (<G>):** Assuming that because one million students have purchased Brain Power, it must be beneficial or of high quality. This is a broad generalization without assessing individual student experiences or other factors.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Suggesting that because a large number of students have bought Brain Power, it implies a consensus on its effectiveness or value.

None of these fully match with <IDAA> since itâ€™s not defined. For an accurate application, you need to define <IDAA>. However, based on typical categories, a presumption of quality based on purchase numbers could fall under Generalization or Presumptuous Consensus.

Would you like to define <IDAA> or explore one of the already known defective argument types more thoroughly?
