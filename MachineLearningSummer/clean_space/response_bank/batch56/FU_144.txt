For 
To apply the defined defective argument types to the statement "Marcus wants to go to a small community college close to home because all of his friends are there," we need to identify any logical flaws or inadequacies in the reasoning.

The argument in question is:

"Marcus wants to go to a small community college close to home because all of his friends are there."

Let's assess this statement against the defined defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - Not applicable here. The statement does not make a broad generalization based on a small sample or isolated cases.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - Potentially applicable. The statement assumes that "all of his friends" being at the college is a sufficient reason for Marcus to want to go there, without considering other important factors such as the quality of education, programs offered, personal academic goals, and so on.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - Potentially applicable. The reason given for Marcus wanting to attend the college (because his friends are there) might be seen as inconclusive if other important factors influencing the decision are not addressed.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - Potentially applicable. The statement assumes a cause-and-effect relationship between Marcus's desire to go to the college and his friends being there, without providing sufficient evidence that this is a rational or well-considered basis for making such an important decision.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - Not applicable here. The statement does not contain repetition of the proposition in a faulty manner.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - Potentially applicable. The statement could be seen as implying that Marcus should follow a decision just because all of his friends are doing it, presuming a consensus among his friends that may not necessarily be the correct or best decision for Marcus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - Not obviously applicable. The language in the statement is relatively clear and unambiguous.

Assigning the <IDAA> argument type:
- Based on the analysis, the argument "Marcus wants to go to a small community college close to home because all of his friends are there" can be considered to exhibit *Incomplete Enumeration* (<FE>), *Inconclusive Reason* (<IR>), *Insufficient Causal Basis* (<WCB>), and *Presumptuous Consensus* (<FU>).

### Conclusion
The argument type <IDAA> (Identified Defective Argument Analysis) applied to the given statement suggests that it contains the following defects:
- <FE>: Incomplete Enumeration.
- <IR>: Inconclusive Reason.
- <WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis.
- <FU>: Presumptuous Consensus.

The argument presented is not fully rational as it overlooks several crucial considerations that would be necessary for a well-rounded decision about which college to attend.
