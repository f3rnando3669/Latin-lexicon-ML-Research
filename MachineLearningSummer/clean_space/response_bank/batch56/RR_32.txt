For 
To analyze the argument "Starbucks is the best because it's expensive" using the defective argument types you've defined, we need to identify if any of these defective types apply. 

Here are the definitions again for quick reference:
- <G>: Generalization
- <FE>: Incomplete Enumeration
- <IR>: Inconclusive Reason
- <WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis
- <RR>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition
- <FU>: Presumptuous Consensus
- <DEP>: Ambiguous Language

Now let's apply <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Appeal):

The argument "Starbucks is the best because it's expensive" seems to infer that the high cost of Starbucks directly correlates with its quality, suggesting that being expensive makes it superior. 

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument assumes a causation (that cost determines quality) without sufficient evidence. Just because something is expensive does not necessarily mean it is of the highest quality or "the best."

2. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided ("because it's expensive") does not conclusively establish the claim ("Starbucks is the best"). The expense alone is not enough to justify the claim of superiority without additional support or context.

Given these points, we can apply the following defective argument types:

- **<WCB>**: Insufficient Causal Basis
- **<IR>**: Inconclusive Reason

To conclude, "Starbucks is the best because it's expensive" primarily suffers from <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) and <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
