<IDAA> stands for Ignoring the Argument and Attacking the Arguer. This is a fallacy where someone ignores the argument presented and instead attacks the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument.

In the example "Oh, please. What would you know about labor laws? You don't even have a job," the speaker is not addressing the argument or points made about labor laws. Instead, they are attacking the person's employment status to discredit their argument. This exemplifies the <IDAA> fallacy.
