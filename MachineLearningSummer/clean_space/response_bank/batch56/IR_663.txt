Sure, it looks like you've got a system for categorizing defective arguments. Let's apply these categories to the given argument:

"I really deserve an 'A' on this paper, professor. Not only did I study during my grandmother’s funeral, but I also passed up the heart transplant surgery, even though that was the first matching donor in 3 years."

This argument appears to appeal to emotions and special circumstances rather than focusing on the quality of the paper itself. Here's how we can categorize it:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The speaker mentions studying during a significant family event (grandmother’s funeral) and passing up an important medical procedure (heart transplant), but these actions do not directly address whether the paper meets the criteria for an "A" grade. The enumeration of hardships is incomplete and irrelevant to the evaluation of academic work.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reasons provided (funeral and heart transplant) are inconclusive for determining the quality of the paper. The quality of academic work should be assessed based on the work itself, not external circumstances.

- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** The term "deserve" is subjective and can be interpreted differently. It is the professor’s responsibility to follow objective criteria for grading, making the argument ambiguous in context.

The primary defective argument type seems to be **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason), since the reasons given (personal hardships) do not logically support the conclusion (deserving an "A" on the paper).

So, the application of your argument categorization leads to identifying this argument primarily as having an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** defect.
