Sure, let's break down the argument "smoking cigarettes is deadly because cigarettes can kill you" using the defined defective argument types:

The argument presents a statement that "smoking cigarettes is deadly" and supports it with the claim "because cigarettes can kill you."

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument might not necessarily be a generalization error as it specifically discusses cigarettes and their lethal effects.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument doesn't enumerate any other possible effects of smoking or factors that contribute to its deadliness, so it might be considered incomplete in that regard.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasoning provided ("cigarettes can kill you") is valid but might be seen as inconclusive if not backed by detailed evidence or data.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument lacks detailed evidence or explanation on how and why cigarettes cause death; it assumes a clear causality without providing substantial support.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The argument essentially repeats the proposition. It states that "cigarettes are deadly" and supports it by saying "cigarettes can kill you," which is a restatement rather than a deeper explanation.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument does not necessarily appeal to a consensus and thus might not fit this category.
7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The terms used ("deadly" and "can kill you") are straightforward and unambiguous; thus, this defective type can be ruled out.

Based on these, the defective argument type most applicable to the statement "smoking cigarettes is deadly because cigarettes can kill you" would be **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**. The argument merely rephrases the initial assertion in its support, leading to circular reasoning.
