Let's apply the defective argument types to the conversation between Ken and Rob:

Ken: There has to be an objective morality because otherwise terms like “right” and “wrong” would be meaningless since they have no foundation for comparison.
- **<G> Generalization:** Ken is making a broad generalization that without objective morality, terms like "right" and "wrong" would be meaningless. This assumes an all-or-nothing approach without considering that meanings can be derived from subjective or cultural contexts.

Rob: The terms “right” and “wrong” are based on cultural norms, which do have a subjective foundation -- one that changes as the moral sphere of the culture changes. The term “heavy” does not have an objective standard, yet we have no problem using that term in a meaningful way. In fact, very few relational terms have any kind of objective foundation.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** Rob points out that "right" and "wrong" can have subjective foundations, and draws an analogy with terms like "heavy." However, he provides an inconclusive reason by not directly addressing the core of Ken's argument about moral objectivity directly.

Ken: But without an objective morality, we would all be lost morally as a race.
- **<G> Generalization:** Ken again generalizes by asserting that without objective morality, humanity would be morally lost. This ignores the possible variation and guidance provided by subjective or cultural ethical systems.

Rob: Many would say that we are.
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** Rob counters Ken's generalization with a presumptuous consensus, implying that a significant number of people believe humanity is already morally lost, but does not provide evidence to back this claim.

Ken: But how can you say that torturing children for fun is morally acceptable in any situation?
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** Ken is using a single extreme example (torturing children) to argue for objective morality, suggesting that without it, such acts could be deemed acceptable. This argument lacks a sufficient causal basis as it does not explore the complexities of moral reasoning and alternative ethical frameworks that may also condemn such actions.

Rob: Personally, I wouldn’t, but you are implying that anything that is not objective must necessarily be seen in all possible ways. A feather may not be seen as “heavy” to anyone, but that doesn’t mean its “lightness” is still not relative to other objects.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** Rob provides a rebuttal by clarifying that subjective perspectives do not necessitate universal ambiguity. However, this does not definitively address Ken's concern about moral actions being objectively wrong or right.

Ken: But God is the standard of objective morality. Prove that wrong!
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** Ken asserts that God is the standard of objective morality, presuming a consensus among all that this is true without engaging with other possible ethical foundations.

Rob: That I cannot do.
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language:** Rob's response is ambiguous as it neither confirms nor negates Ken's claim about God being the standard of morality. This leaves the argument unresolved without adding substantial clarification or evidence.

By identifying these defective arguments, we can see that both Ken and Rob's arguments had flaws that hinder the resolution of the debate regarding objective versus subjective morality.
