The argument provided can be analyzed for defective argument types as follows:

"Holly said that vaccinations caused autism in children, but her scientifically well-read friend Caleb said that this claim had been debunked and proven false. Their friend Alice offered a compromise that vaccinations must cause some autism, just not all autism."

Let's break it down:

1. **Holly's claim:** "vaccinations caused autism in children."
   - Without sufficient scientific evidence to support Holly's claim, this can be categorized as <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).

2. **Caleb's counterpoint:** "this claim had been debunked and proven false."
   - Caleb provides a reasonable counterargument based on scientific consensus, assuming he has evidence to support his statement. His argument isn't necessarily defective unless he fails to provide reliable sources.

3. **Alice's compromise:** "vaccinations must cause some autism, just not all autism."
   - Alice's compromise introduces a middle-ground fallacy without any new evidence, implying causation without a scientific basis, making it <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) as well.

Additionally, we can identify other potential defective argument types:

- **Alice's compromise:** By trying to find a middle ground without sufficient evidence, Alice might also be committing an error similar to <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), as she proposes a solution that lacks concrete backing.

In summary, we mainly observe:
- **Holly's claim:** <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)
- **Alice's compromise:** <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis), potentially also <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)

Thus, the application of <IDAA> yields:

<Holly's Claim: WCB> 
<Alice's Compromise: WCB, potentially IR>
