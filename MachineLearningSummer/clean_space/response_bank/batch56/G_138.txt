To apply the Identification and Deconstruction of Argumentative Absurdities (IDAA) to the statement "Women can't do as good a job as men.", we will identify and deconstruct its defective arguments using the defined types: 

1. **Generalization (G):** The statement makes a sweeping claim about all women and men, implying that all women are inherently less capable than all men across various jobs without considering individual differences, skills, or experiences. It is an overgeneralization without sufficient evidence.

    **Deconstruction:** The statement unfairly lumps all women into a single category, ignoring the extensive evidence of capable women excelling in various fields traditionally dominated by men. Furthermore, skills and job performance are highly individualized and cannot be accurately predicted based on gender alone.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The statement fails to acknowledge the many examples of women who have outperformed men in numerous jobs, thereby presenting an incomplete picture.

    **Deconstruction:** By not considering numerous counterexamples where women have excelled and even led in their respective fields, the argument omits critical evidence that disproves the claim. Recognizing these examples invalidates the premise that gender determines job performance.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The statement fails to provide concrete, empirical evidence or reasoning to support its claim. It relies on a biased opinion rather than data or research.

    **Deconstruction:** An inconclusive reason undermines the argument because it does not ground the assertion in verifiable facts. Studies and real-world examples continuously show that gender is not a determinant of job performance. Factors like education, experience, and individual aptitude are far more relevant.

4. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The statement might presume a consensus that doesn’t exist or assume that everyone agrees with this baseless stereotype.

   **Deconstruction:** By implicitly suggesting that people generally believe women are less capable in their jobs, the argument ignores the widespread acknowledgment and evidence of gender equality and diversity in the workplace. Many organizations strive to debunk such myths and promote an inclusive environment.

5. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The term "as good a job as men" is vague and broad. It does not specify what "good" means or what jobs are being referred to.

    **Deconstruction:** Ambiguity makes the argument less credible because it lacks precision. What constitutes "good" can differ greatly depending on the job's nature, industry, and specific tasks involved. Without specification, the argument cannot be accurately evaluated or substantiated.

By identifying and deconstructing these defective argument types in the statement “Women can't do as good a job as men,” we can clearly see that it is fundamentally flawed, biased, and unsupported by substantive evidence.
