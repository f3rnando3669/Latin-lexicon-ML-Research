For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Attributes) to the statement "The universe has a beginning. Every thing that has a beginning has a cause. Therefore, the universe has a cause called God," we will explore which, if any, of the defined defective argument types apply to the argument presented. Let's analyze it step by step:

1. **"The universe has a beginning."**
2. **"Every thing that has a beginning has a cause."**
3. **"Therefore, the universe has a cause called God."**

Here's the analysis using the defective argument types defined:

### Generalization (<G>)
- **Definition**: Making a broad generalization from a small or unrepresentative sample.
- **Analysis**: The statement does not directly make a sweeping generalization about a specific group or subset. 

### Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- **Definition**: Assuming a list is complete when it is not.
- **Analysis**: The argument does not enumerate options or list them incompletely. It does not list all potential causes for the universe's beginning.

### Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- **Definition**: Drawing a conclusion that is not sufficiently supported by the premises.
- **Analysis**: The conclusion that the universe's cause must be called "God" is not sufficiently supported by the premises given, as there could be other possible causes not considered.

- **Tag**: <IR>

### Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- **Definition**: Assuming causation without sufficient causal basis or evidence.
- **Analysis**: The argument assumes that everything that has a beginning must have a cause without providing sufficient evidence for this causal relationship, and then jumps to the cause being "God" without establishing a clear causal connection.

- **Tag**: <WCB>

### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
- **Definition**: Repeating a proposition as if that repetition itself is sufficient to make it true.
- **Analysis**: The argument does not repeat the proposition in a way that tries to make it true.

### Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
- **Definition**: Assuming that consensus or common belief makes a proposition true.
- **Analysis**: The argument does not rely on a supposed consensus or common belief to establish its point.

### Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)
- **Definition**: Using language that is unclear or can have multiple interpretations.
- **Analysis**: The term "God" could be considered ambiguous as it can have different interpretations depending on religious or philosophical contexts.

- **Tag**: <DEP>

### Conclusion:

Applying <IDAA> to the argument, we can identify the following defective argument attributes:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The conclusion that the universe's cause must be "God" is not sufficiently supported by the premises.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument assumes without sufficient evidence that everything that has a beginning must have a cause and that this cause must be "God".
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The term “God” is ambiguous and can be interpreted in various ways.

Thus, the argument can be tagged with <IR>, <WCB>, and <DEP>.
