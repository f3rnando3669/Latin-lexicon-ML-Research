<IDAA> stands for Irrelevant Diversion and Argumentative Avoidance, which is also known as a Red Herring fallacy. It refers to introducing an irrelevant topic to divert attention from the original issue.

In the provided scenario,

"A mother is telling her daughter that she went over her data for the month, and the daughter begins telling her mother about getting an A on a math test."
