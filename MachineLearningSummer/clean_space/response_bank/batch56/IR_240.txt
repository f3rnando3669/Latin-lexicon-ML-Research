For 
Incidentally Defective Argument Analysis (IDAA) for the statement: "If you have never been born again, eternal separation from God in the Lake of Fire awaits you. If you are born again, then being with the Lord in heaven forever is your destiny. Which do you choose?"

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The argument assumes a binary outcome based on the concept of being "born again" without considering other beliefs, interpretations, or alternative spiritual paths. This is a broad generalization that likely does not account for the diversity of religious and spiritual views held by different people.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - This argument presents only two possible outcomes: eternal separation from God or being with the Lord in heaven. It does not provide a complete enumeration of other possible beliefs or interpretations about the afterlife, thus missing important context and variations in belief systems.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The argument hinges on a particular religious assertion. It does not provide empirical or universally accepted evidence to support the claim that being "born again" is the definitive criterion for determining one's eternal destiny. The reasoning provided may not be conclusive or convincing to individuals with different religious or philosophical perspectives.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - The causal link between being "born again" and the stated outcomes (eternal separation or being with the Lord) relies on specific religious doctrine, which might not be a sufficient causal basis for individuals who do not share the same religious affiliations or beliefs. There is a lack of universally accepted evidence establishing this causality.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - The argument repeats the propositions related to the consequences of being or not being "born again" without new evidence or reasoning. It states the outcomes as absolute facts without providing additional justification or addressing potential counterarguments.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - The argument presumes a consensus on the validity and importance of being "born again" for determining one's eternal destiny, which may not exist. Different religious traditions and secular viewpoints may disagree with this assessment, and the argument presumes agreement without establishing it.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - Terms like "born again," "eternal separation," "Lake of Fire," and "destiny" carry significant religious and theological connotations that can be interpreted in various ways. The ambiguity of these terms can lead to misunderstandings or varied interpretations depending on one's religious background or lack thereof.

By applying Incidentally Defective Argument Analysis (IDAA), we can see that the argument suffers from several types of defective arguments, including generalization, incomplete enumeration, inconclusive reason, insufficient causal basis, faulty repetition of the proposition, presumptuous consensus, and ambiguous language. These deficiencies highlight potential weaknesses in the argument's structure and persuasiveness, particularly when addressing a diverse audience with varying beliefs and perspectives.
