The term **IDAA** stands for **Identification and Description of Argumentative Adulteration**.

When applying **IDAA** to the statement "You moved the goalposts or made up an exception when your claim was shown to be false," the process involves identifying and describing the specific defective argument at play.

Let's break it down:

1. **Identify the Claim:** 
   - The claim being addressed is an accusation that someone moved the goalposts or created an exception to their original claim when it was shown to be false.

2. **Evaluate the Defects:**
   - **Moving the Goalposts:** This is when someone changes the criteria or requirements of a claim after it has been challenged or proven false, to make it seem as though the claim still holds true.
   - **Making Up an Exception:** This is creating an ad-hoc or special case exception to the original claim to avoid admitting that it was incorrect.

3. **Classify According to Defined Defective Argument Types:**
   - This scenario primarily fits into the defective argument type we can define as **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. This is because the argument involves changing the criteria or making exceptions to avoid conceding that the claim was disproven, thereby making the reasoning for the original claim inconclusive.
     - Example: If someone claims that "All swans are white" and then, upon being shown a black swan, they respond with "Well, all Australian swans are white," they are changing their claim to avoid admitting it was false, thereby introducing an inconclusive reason.

Thus, the defective argument type attributed here would be **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, as the act of moving the goalposts or making up exceptions when a claim was shown to be false undermines the conclusiveness of the reasoning behind the original claim.
