The argument provided can be analyzed for defective reasoning as follows:

"I don't see how you can believe he is not guilty of that crime. He's a terrible person and I can prove it. In fact, several years ago he was convicted of that same kind of crime."

1. **Generalization (<G>):** 
   - The argument generalizes that because someone is a terrible person (a subjective and broad assessment), they must be guilty of a specific crime in question. This is a sweeping conclusion that isn't substantiated by specific evidence pertaining to the current case.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The argument mentions that the person was convicted several years ago of a similar crime. This is an instance of incomplete enumeration because it assumes that past behavior is a comprehensive and sole indicator of present guilt, without considering the full range of evidence or possible changes in circumstances.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The assertion that because the person is terrible and has a past conviction, they must be guilty now is an inconclusive reason. The past conviction does not necessarily lead to a conclusion of guilt in the present case without additional, relevant evidence.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The argument implies a causal relationship between being a terrible person and being guilty of a specific crime. This is baseless because there is no direct causative proof provided to link the moral character with the crime in question.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - The argument's discussion about the person being convicted several years ago can be seen as a faulty repetition used to reiterate presumed guilt. This does not add new evidence but repeats a circumstance in the past to persuade the listener.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - There is an implicit suggestion that most people would agree with the speakerâ€™s viewpoint that the person must be guilty based on their character and past conviction. This presumes a consensus that is not necessarily justified or evidenced.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - The term "terrible person" is vague and subjective, leaving it open to interpretation. What constitutes a "terrible person" can vary widely among different people, and such ambiguity does not provide a solid basis for a conclusion.

In summary, applying the analysis reveals that the argument is primarily defective due to the following identified flaws:
- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**

These defects weaken the rationale, making it an unreliable and improperly constructed argument.
