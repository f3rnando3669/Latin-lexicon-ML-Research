For 
The argument by the salesman and Will can be analyzed for defective argument types as follows:

Salesman: "This car gets better than average gas mileage and is one of the most reliable cars according to Consumer Reports."
- There doesn't appear to be any defective argument in this statement based on the provided definitions. The salesman is making a factual claim supported by a cited source (Consumer Reports), assuming the citation is genuine.

Will: "I doubt itâ€”you obviously just want to sell me that car."
- This response by Will contains a defective argument type as follows:
  - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Will's doubt about the salesman's claim is based on the ulterior motive attributed to the salesman (wanting to sell the car), which is not directly refuting the claim about the car's gas mileage and reliability. This reasoning does not adequately address the specific qualities of the car mentioned by the salesman.

Therefore, the encountered defective argument type in Will's statement is:

<IDAA (IR)> Inconclusive Reason
