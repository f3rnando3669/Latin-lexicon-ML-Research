For 
<IDAA> is not defined among the defective argument types provided. However, given the context and typical patterns in reasoning, we can attempt to identify and categorize the defective arguments presented in the statement:

1. **"Once you leave the house, you cannot go back."**
   - This statement can be interpreted as a <G> (Generalization) because it broadly assumes that leaving the house is a one-way action without considering any possible circumstances under which returning might be possible.

2. **"You will not receive any financial support so you need to stop going to school."**
   - This is an <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) because the lack of financial support does not necessarily mean one absolutely needs to stop going to school; there might be other ways to fund education, such as scholarships, loans, or part-time work.

3. **"Your credit card will be cut so you need to work."**
   - This could be considered an <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) as well because having a credit card cut off does not inherently mean that working is the only option. There could be other alternatives to manage finances or credit.

4. **"You will live on your own."**
   - This statement may be a <G> (Generalization) since it assumes that leaving the house automatically implies living independently without considering shared living arrangements, living with friends, etc.

Overall, the statement contains elements of Generalization and Inconclusive Reason, misrepresenting the complexity of the situation with overly simplistic and often unsupported claims.
