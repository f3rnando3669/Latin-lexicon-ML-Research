For 
The argument in "You know Jane Fonda’s exercise videos must be worth the money. Look at the great shape she’s in." is defective because it relies on an inconclusive reason. Here is a breakdown of why it is defective:

The statement implies that because Jane Fonda is in great shape, her exercise videos must be worth the money. This is an example of the <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) type of defective argument. The shape Jane Fonda is in does not necessarily provide sufficient proof that her exercise videos are effective or worth the money. There could be numerous other factors contributing to her physical condition, such as diet, genetics, personal trainers, or other forms of exercise not related to the videos being sold.

So, applying <IDAA> (Identification and Diagnosis of Argumental Anomalies):

1. **Identification**: The claim is that Jane Fonda's exercise videos must be worth the money because she is in great shape.
2. **Diagnosis**: The reason provided ("Look at the great shape she’s in") is not sufficient to conclusively establish the claim. There could be other factors contributing to her physical condition.
3. **Categorization**: The argument is categorized under <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
4. **Analysis**: The argument is defective because it does not provide a conclusive reason that directly supports the claim. Other explanations for Jane Fonda's physical condition are entirely plausible and need to be considered.

Therefore, the argument's defect type is <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
