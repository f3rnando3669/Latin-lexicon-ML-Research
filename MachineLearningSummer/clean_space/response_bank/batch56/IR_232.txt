It seems like you're asking to identify defective arguments in a given statement and reply, followed by applying the appropriate labels from the provided list. Let's break down the statement and reply in the example:

Original Statement:
"We should present Cadet Curry with our squadron’s cadet of the year award. He’s the most active and highest-performing cadet we have."

Reply:
"But Cadet Arnold has been in CAP longer."

Here we identify the argument types in each statement:

1. The Original Statement Argument:
   - This argument supports presenting Cadet Curry with an award, based on him being the most active and highest-performing cadet.
   - Logical evaluation: The argument follows a reasonable logic, as the criteria (activity and performance) seem relevant for the award.

2. The Reply Argument:
   - The reply argues for Cadet Arnold, based on the fact that Arnold has been in CAP longer.
   - Logical evaluation: The duration of membership is mentioned without a clear connection to the relevant criteria of activity and performance for the cadet of the year award. It doesn't address the criteria mentioned in the original statement.

Here, the reply could be seen as using a defective argument type:

- The Reply by Cadet Arnold could be seen as:
  - <IR> (Inconclusive Reason): The length of membership in CAP is brought up without a direct connection to the stated award criteria of activity and performance.

The statement shouldn't be conclusive without addressing how Arnold’s longer membership impacts the criteria of performance and activity regarding the award.

Final Identification of Defective Argument Application (IDAA):
The defective argument in the reply is best classified as <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).

So applying <IDAA> to the given exchange:
"We should present Cadet Curry with our squadron’s cadet of the year award. He’s the most active and highest-performing cadet we have. REPLY: But Cadet Arnold has been in CAP longer." — The reply is an example of <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
