For 
Let's analyze the argument presented in the statement using the defective argument types defined:

**Argument Analysis:**

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The statement could be seen as a generalization because it implies that the presence of poverty in Britain somehow discredits criticism of Dubai. This assumes that one negative aspect of a country constitutes a broader judgment of its overall status or morality.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The argument considers only the fact that a portion of the British population lives in poverty while ignoring other factors that might be relevant in comparing the issues of Dubai and Britain. This is incomplete enumeration because it fails to account for the full scope of both contexts.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The reasoning given to counter the criticism of Dubai (i.e., referring to Britain's poverty) is inconclusive. The poverty in Britain might not be directly related to the specific issues highlighted about Dubai, which could be entirely different in nature.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The statement doesn’t seem to involve a causality that can be considered insufficient or flawed.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - There is no repeated proposition in the argument. 

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - The argument implies that since some in Dubai called foul, there is a general consensus against the British journalist's story. This can be a case of presumptuous consensus because it assumes the view of a few represents the majority without evidence.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - The language used might be considered ambiguous, especially phrases like "dark side" and “what to think of a country,” which lack precise definitions and can be interpreted in various ways.

**Summary of Identified Defective Arguments (<IDAA>) in the Statement:**
- Generalization (<G>)
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
- Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)

The argument reflects multiple defective elements, summarizing broader, incomplete, and vague reasoning to counter an argument about Dubai by pointing to an unrelated issue in Britain.
