For 
<IDAA> refers to the task of identifying a defective argument in an example. Given the example: "The president of Honduras is a good leader because he is a leader of the country," the argument can be classified as a defective argument type called Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>).

This argument illustrates the fallacy of **circular reasoning**, where the conclusion is repeated in the reasoning as a way to substantiate it, without providing any additional or independent support.

So to apply <IDAA>:

"The president of Honduras is a good leader because he is a leader of the country." This is an example of the common fallacy of **circular reasoning** (<RR> - Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
