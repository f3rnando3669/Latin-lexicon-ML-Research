The argument provided is: "We can give cadets awards for doing well, or we can have a disciplined squadron. We can’t do both."

Applying <IDAA>—Identifying and Diagnosing Argumentative Flaws and their Associated Acronyms:

This statement presents a false dichotomy, suggesting that the two options (giving awards and having a disciplined squadron) are mutually exclusive, with no possibility of them coexisting.

Based on the definitions of defective argument types provided, none directly correspond to 'false dichotomy.' However, the nature of the argument can be closest associated with:

### Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- **Reasoning**: The conclusion that giving awards and maintaining discipline cannot coexist is not sufficiently supported by the premises. The argument presumes a conflict without providing evidence or considering the possibility of both conditions being attainable simultaneously.

Therefore, the argument "We can give cadets awards for doing well, or we can have a disciplined squadron. We can’t do both." can be identified and diagnosed as <IR>, Inconclusive Reason.
