For 
The argument "I have several female friends and every one of them loves country music. All females love country music." can be analyzed using the defined defective argument types as follows:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument is a classic example of a hasty generalization. The speaker observes a characteristic in a small sample group (several female friends) and then generalizes this characteristic to an entire population (all females).

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This argument also suffers from incomplete enumeration, as it relies on a limited set of examples (several female friends) without considering whether there may be female individuals who do not like country music.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning provided is inconclusive because the preferences of several friends are not sufficient to draw a definitive conclusion about the preferences of all females.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is no causal basis given or implied for why being female would universally result in a preference for country music. The argument jumps from observation to conclusion without addressing causation.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This defective argument type does not directly apply here since the argument does not repetitively assert the same proposition with variations.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument seems to presume that there is a consensus among all females based on the limited observation of a few friends, which is unwarranted.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language in this argument is not particularly ambiguous; hence, this defective argument type does not seem applicable here.

In essence, the argument predominantly falls under <G> (Generalization), <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration), <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
