Certainly! It looks like you want to identify and apply defective argument types to the statement.

<Says Robot 2, attacking Robot 1 instead of his arguments.>

In this scenario, Robot 2 is committing a logical fallacy by attacking Robot 1 personally rather than addressing the arguments that Robot 1 is making. This is commonly known as an "ad hominem" attack. However, based on the defective argument types you've defined, this does not exactly fit any of the provided categories.

If we were to categorize this based on the defective types provided:

- **Generalization (G)**: Applying a broad claim based on limited evidence.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not considering all possible cases.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The conclusion does not follow coherently from the premises.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Lacking a sufficient cause-and-effect relationship.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Repetitive assertion without proper justification.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assuming agreement or consensus without proper evidence.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Using language that is unclear or vague.

Since none of these defective argument types directly correspond to an ad hominem attack, we are unable to apply <IDAA> (identify and address arguments) directly from this set of defective types. Therefore, we might need to create a new category specific to personal attacks or ad hominem fallacies.

For now, you can recognize that the statement involves attacking the individual, which is a logical fallacy but is not explicitly covered under the defined defective argument types.
