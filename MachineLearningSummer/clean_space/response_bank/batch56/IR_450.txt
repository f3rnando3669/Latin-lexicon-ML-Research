Sure, let's apply the defined defective arguments (collectively referred to as <IDAA>) to the given scenario.

Scenario: 
Billy: "Spanish is easy."
Bobby: "Don't listen to Billy; he failed Spanish class last year."

The argument Bobby is making can be classified under multiple defective argument types:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Bobby's reasoning assumes that Billy's performance in Spanish class last year fully determines his ability to accurately assess the difficulty of the Spanish language. This ignores other possible factors such as changes in Billy's study habits, the specific class he took, or the possibility that Billy's own struggles do not reflect the inherent difficulty of the language for others.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Bobby's statement relies on an anecdotal experience (Billy's failure) rather than providing substantive evidence or addressing the subject matter itself (whether Spanish is easy or not for most learners).

3. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Bobby attempts to discredit Billy's claim by reiterating Billy's failure, which does not directly address the claim about the ease of learning Spanish. Bobby's argument is not further substantiated with additional information; it merely highlights Billy's past failure.

Given these considerations, Bobby's argument about not listening to Billy because he failed Spanish class last year is inherently fallacious and can be characterized as defective using <IDAA> under the categories of Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), and Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR).
