For 
To apply the categories of defective argument types to analyze the given statement ("The shopping is a red herring, since the original issue was video games."), itâ€™s important to first interpret and understand the argument and then determine which defective argument type it falls under. Below is the analysis using the defined categories:

- **Generalization (G)**: This involves making a broad claim based on limited evidence.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This occurs when an argument does not account for all possible scenarios or options.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This is when the reason provided does not adequately support the conclusion.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This involves making a causal claim without sufficient evidence.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This is repeating a claim without providing new evidence or reasoning.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This assumes that a certain consensus exists without proper justification.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This involves using language that is vague or has multiple interpretations.

### Analysis:

**Argument:** "The shopping is a red herring, since the original issue was video games."

This statement suggests that discussing shopping is an irrelevant diversion from the actual topic, which is video games.

1. **Generalization (G):** This argument is not making a broad general claim.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This argument does not seem to omit explanations or scenarios, but rather labels one as irrelevant.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This may apply if labeling "shopping" as a red herring does not adequately address why it distracts from the main issue.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This argument is not making a causal claim, so this category does not apply.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This statement does not repeat a proposition, so this category does not apply.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This argument does not assume a consensus but rather makes an assertion about relevance.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The term "red herring" can sometimes be somewhat ambiguous if the reader is unfamiliar with the idiomatic use, but it's a relatively well-understood term in logical analysis.

### Conclusion:

The most suitable defective argument type for this statement is **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. The reason provided ("since the original issue was video games") may not sufficiently justify why talking about shopping is off-topic without further context explaining why the transition to shopping fails to connect to or detracts from the discussion on video games. 

Therefore, applying **<IR>**:

**<IR>** "The shopping is a red herring, since the original issue was video games."
