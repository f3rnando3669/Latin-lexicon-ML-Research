The statement "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick" exhibits the <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Arguments and Applying Analysis) for the defective argument type <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).

This is because the conclusion that the water must have caused the illness is drawn without sufficient evidence to establish a causal link. The argument assumes a causal relationship solely based on the temporal sequence of events (drinking water and then getting sick) without considering other possible causes or providing further evidence to support the claim. Hence, it identifies a common post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy, where it is presumed that because one event follows another, the first event must be the cause of the second.
