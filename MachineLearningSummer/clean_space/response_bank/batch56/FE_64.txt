For 
The argument "Purchase our product or no one is going to think you’re attractive" can be evaluated for its defective attributes. To determine if it falls under one of the defective argument types listed:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This would be if it made a broad claim based on limited evidence.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This would involve presenting an incomplete list of options or possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This would be if the reasoning fails to provide a solid conclusion.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This would be if the cause-and-effect relationship isn't sufficiently established.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This involves repeating a proposition without providing additional support or evidence.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This implies a general consensus without adequate support.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This involves using language that is unclear or has multiple interpretations.

The argument you provided, "Purchase our product or no one is going to think you’re attractive," seems to imply a strong causal link between purchasing the product and being perceived as attractive. This causality is not sufficiently demonstrated, making it an **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** argument. It also uses ambiguous terms like "attractive," which can have different meanings based on context and individual perception, which could bring it under **Ambiguous Language (DEP)** as well.

Therefore, the defective argument types that apply here are:
1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
2. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**
