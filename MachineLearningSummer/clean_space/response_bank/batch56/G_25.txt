For 
The argument presented in the statement "But you have to let me go to the party! If I don't go to the party, I'll be a loser with no friends. Next thing you know, I'll end up alone and jobless, living in your basement when I'm 30!" contains multiple logical defects. Let's identify them using our defined defective argument types (IDAA means Identify Defective Argument Types and Analyze):

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument assumes without sufficient basis that not going to the party will inevitably result in having no friends and subsequently becoming a lonely, jobless adult. It fails to consider other possible outcomes or factors that contribute to healthy social development.

2. **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument generalizes the consequence of missing a single party to an extreme long-term outcome. This is not a reasonable generalization as it neglects numerous other social events and opportunities to make friends.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasoning linking missing the party to future loneliness and joblessness is not conclusively supported by evidence or logic. It's a leap in reasoning that lacks substantial proof.

4. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument seems to operate under the presumption that attending this specific party is universally critical for social acceptance and future success, which may not be agreed upon by everyone.

Let's break down each of these defective arguments within the context of the statement:

- **Incomplete Enumeration**: The statement overlooks other activities or opportunities for social interaction and personal development beyond this one party. It does not account for the many other ways to build friendships and future career paths.
- **Generalization**: Missing a single social event is unlikely to result in complete social ostracization and long-term failure. The claim extrapolates the outcome of one event to a whole life trajectory.
- **Inconclusive Reason**: The argument lacks concrete evidence to support the cause-and-effect relationship it posits between missing the party and future destitution. It's speculative rather than definitive.
- **Presumptuous Consensus**: The statement assumes that everyone (including the person being addressed) would agree that attending this party is essential to avoid dire future consequences, which is a debatable assumption.

In summary, the argument is defective due to incomplete enumeration, unwarranted generalizations, inconclusive reasoning, and presumptions about consensus.
