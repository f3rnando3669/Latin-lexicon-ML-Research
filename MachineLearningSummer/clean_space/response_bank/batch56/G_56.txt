For 
To apply the concept of Identifying Defective Argument Analysis (<IDAA>) to the argument given, we need to evaluate whether the argument contains any of the specified defective argument types. Let's break down the argument first:

**Argument:**
"Gas prices have been rising steadily these past few years. Thus, the cost of car ownership is higher than it was previously."

**Analysis:**
1. **Generalization (G)**: Generalization refers to making broad conclusions based on a limited set of instances. In this case, while gas prices are a significant factor in the cost of car ownership, this argument does not necessarily overgeneralize on the basis of inadequate instances. So, it doesn't fall under <G>.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This occurs when all relevant instances are not considered. The argument mentions gas prices but does not account for other factors that contribute to the cost of car ownership, such as insurance, maintenance, and depreciation. Therefore, this argument can be identified as having an **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** defect because it provides an incomplete list of reasons for the increase in the cost of car ownership.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This refers to a situation where the reasons presented do not sufficiently support the conclusion. The rise in gas prices does contribute to higher costs, but without considering the other factors, the reasoning is inconclusive. Therefore, the argument also bears an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** defect.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This applies when a causal relationship is claimed without sufficient evidence. Here, the causal link between gas prices and overall cost of car ownership is implied but not sufficiently substantiated. Hence, this argument shows an **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** defect as well.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This occurs when a proposition is repeated without additional support. There is no indication of such repetition in the argument presented. Hence, it doesn't apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This happens when one assumes that because many people believe something, it must be true. The argument doesn't appeal to consensus, so this defect is not present.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This involves the use of unclear or vague language. The terms used in the argument are fairly clear and specific, so there is no evidence of ambiguous language.

**Conclusion:**
The argument "Gas prices have been rising steadily these past few years. Thus, the cost of car ownership is higher than it was previously." primarily exhibits the following defective argument types:
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** 

Thus, we identify this argument with <FE>, <IR>, and <WCB> defects using Identifying Defective Argument Analysis (<IDAA>).
