For 
The argument presented can be analyzed as follows:

"Jimmy Swaggart argued strongly against sexual immorality, yet while married, he has had several affairs with prostitutes; therefore, sexual immorality is acceptable."

This argument attempts to conclude that sexual immorality is acceptable based on the personal behavior of Jimmy Swaggart, a person who argued against it.

To identify the defective argument types, we can first break down the structure and reasoning within the statement.

1. **Generalization (G):** The argument seems to generalize from a single instance (the behavior of Jimmy Swaggart) to a broader claim (sexual immorality is acceptable). However, this is not a clear example of using a generalization directly.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument does not enumerate all possible situations or perspectives related to sexual immorality but relies on just Jimmy Swaggart’s hypocrisy. This would suggest an incomplete enumeration because it dismisses other viewpoints or evidence that might exist on the subject.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reasoning is inconclusive because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise. The fact that one person (Swaggart) does not practice what he preaches does not provide a conclusive reason for the acceptability of sexual immorality.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** There is an insufficient causal connection between Jimmy Swaggart’s actions and the broader moral judgment about sexual immorality. Swaggart's behavior alone does not causally support the argument that sexual immorality is acceptable.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This does not seem applicable here since the argument does not repeat the same proposition under different guises.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument does not presume a consensus, hence this does not apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** There is no significant use of ambiguous language that would mislead or confuse the understanding of the argument.

By analyzing the argument, the most relevant defective argument types that apply are:

<IDAA> appears to be: 
- <FE>: Incomplete Enumeration, because the argument does not consider the general context of moral standards and solely focuses on Swaggart’s actions.
- <IR>: Inconclusive Reason, because the conclusion (sexual immorality is acceptable) does not logically follow from the given premise (Swaggart's hypocritical behavior).

Thus, the argument can be identified primarily under these defective argument types:
**<IDAA: FE, IR>**
