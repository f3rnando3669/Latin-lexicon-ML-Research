To apply the identified defective argument types (IDAA) to the given statement, let's examine the argument presented by Willeidy: "At soccer practice, Willeidy tells Aida, 'Pace's soccer team was losing until I bought new shoes. We have not lost a game since I got my lucky shoes!'"

We'll identify which specific defective argument types apply:

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The statement assumes a causal relationship between buying new shoes and the team not losing any games. However, the purchase of new shoes is likely unrelated to the team's performance, making this an example of an insufficient causal basis. There is no evidence provided to support that the shoes caused the winning streak.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning provided is inconclusive. While it is true that the team hasn't lost a game since Willeidy bought the new shoes, this does not conclusively prove that the shoes are the reason for the improvement in performance. Other factors could have contributed to the team's success.

These two argument types, WCB and IR, thus accurately categorize the defective reasoning in Willeidy's statement.
