It looks like there was some confusion in your request. The argument "Everybody does it. You should too." is an appeal to popularity. Given your definitions, I would classify this argument type as <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).

Here's the reasoning behind this classification:
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This type of defective argument assumes that the popularity of an action implies its correctness or worthiness. The statement "Everybody does it. You should too." essentially argues that because many people are doing something, it is the right thing to do, which is a common logical fallacy known as "appeal to the masses" or "bandwagon fallacy."

So, you would apply <FU> to "Everybody does it. You should too."
