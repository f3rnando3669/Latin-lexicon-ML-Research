In the example provided, "Shell was charged with misleading advertising in its Platformate advertisements. A Shell spokesman said: 'The same comment could be made about most good advertising of most products,'" we can evaluate the argument using the defective argument types defined:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The Shell spokesman is making a broad claim that most good advertising of most products could be considered misleading, without providing evidence to support this generalization. This weakens the argument because it assumes a general pattern based on a specific case without substantiating the claim.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: There is an implication that misleading advertising is common in good advertising generally, but the argument fails to enumerate specific instances or provide comprehensive coverage on why this might be true. By not addressing whether other forms of good advertising can indeed be categorized in the same way, the argument remains incomplete.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The statement provided by the Shell spokesman does not conclusively address whether Shell's advertising was misleading or not. Instead, it shifts the focus to advertising practices in general, which does not resolve the specific charge against Shell. This makes the reasoning inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument presented does not establish a sufficient causal basis to connect the concept of "good advertising" with the propensity to be misleading. It lacks the necessary causal link needed to support the claim that misleading advertising is inherent to good advertising.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The argument emphasizes the notion that most good advertising could be considered misleading, but it doesn't offer new evidence or reasons. It just repeats a proposition without substantiating it further, resulting in a faulty repetition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The statement assumes a consensus that most good advertising is misleading without providing evidence or indicating that this perspective is widely accepted. Presuming such a consensus without support makes the argument defective.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The term "good advertising" is ambiguous and open to interpretation. What constitutes "good advertising" is not clearly defined, leaving room for misinterpretation. Furthermore, the word "misleading" can have varied connotations in different contexts, adding to the ambiguity.

Given these defective argument types, the statement by the Shell spokesman can be classified primarily as a Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), and Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), with elements of Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), and Ambiguous Language (<DEP>). The argument attempts to downplay the specific charge against Shell by generalizing about advertising practices without substantial evidence and employing ambiguous terms.
