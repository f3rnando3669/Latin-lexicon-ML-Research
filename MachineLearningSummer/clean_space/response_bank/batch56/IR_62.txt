For 
<IDAA> stands for Identify, Define, Analyze, and Argue Against. Applying this to the argument provided:

1. **Identify:** 
   The argument is: "America keeps telling China to be more respecting of journalism, but why don't they stop the American propaganda first?"

2. **Define:**
   - The argument suggests that America is not in a position to criticize China about journalism because it itself engages in propaganda.
   - This type of argument could potentially fall into several defective argument categories.

3. **Analyze:**
   This argument appears to leverage a form of *tu quoque* (a type of ad hominem argument or "you too" fallacy), which might be seen as a way of deflecting criticism by accusing the critic (America) of similar wrongdoings (engaging in propaganda).

   - **Generalization (<G>):** There is a suggestion that all of America's efforts to promote journalistic integrity are hypocritical based on the behavior of some. This might be too broad a generalization.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument does not consider the full scope of American media and journalism, which includes a wide array of practices beyond just propaganda.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reasoning does not directly address whether China's journalistic practices are ethical or not.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** There may be an implied consensus that American journalism is universally seen as propagandistic, which is presumptive and not necessarily true.

4. **Argue Against:**
   - **Focus on Ethical Standards:** It's important to maintain a distinction between the ethical standards of journalism and the practices of different countries. One can argue that both America and China should be held to high standards without excusing one because of the other's failings. 
   - **Specificity:** The argument doesn't provide specifics or evidence about instances of American propaganda, hence it lacks depth and specificity.
   - **Red Herring:** This argument diverts attention away from China's journalistic practices by focusing on American practices, which does not logically negate the need for improved journalistic standards in China.
   - **Objective Analysis:** Rather than deflecting criticism, a constructive argument would involve a comparative analysis of journalistic standards in both countries and suggesting improvements based on objective criteria.

In conclusion, the original argument contains elements of **Generalization (G)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, and **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**. It deflects from the core issue rather than addressing it directly, making it a defective argument.
