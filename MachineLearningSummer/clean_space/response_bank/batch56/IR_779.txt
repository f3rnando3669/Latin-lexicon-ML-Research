For 
<IDAA> appears to be a placeholder for the action of identifying and annotating defective argument types. 

Given the statement: "I don’t care what scientists say, my mother always told me that the world is flat, and she would never lie to me!"

We can identify several possible defective arguments within this statement:

1. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** - The statement relies on the repeated assertion from the mother without any new supporting evidence: "my mother always told me."
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** - There are many possible reasons why the mother's statement might be incorrect, but the statement does not consider them: "my mother always told me that the world is flat."
3. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** - The statement implies that the mother's word should be taken as accurate or authoritative without sufficient support: "she would never lie to me!"
4. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** - The reliability of the mother's honesty does not logically conclude the truth of the world being flat: "she would never lie to me!"

Therefore, the annotated argument is:

"I don’t care what scientists say, my mother always told me that the world is flat (RR, FE), and she would never lie to me (FU, IR)!"
