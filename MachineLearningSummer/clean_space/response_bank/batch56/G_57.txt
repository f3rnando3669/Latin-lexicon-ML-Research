For 
Before applying IDAA (Identification and Diagnosis of Argumentative Defects), let's break down the specific parts of the argument given:

1. "My mom says that most tourists from France are rude."
2. "She had to wait on one the other day and the lady threw her pancakes on the ground because they were not big enough."

Now let's apply the defective argument types to evaluate the argument:

- **Generalization (G):** The argument infers a broad conclusion ("most tourists from France are rude") based on a single incident. This is a classic example of overgeneralization from one specific case.
  
  **IDAA Label: G**
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument only presents one instance of rude behavior without considering other cases where French tourists might have been polite.
  
  **IDAA Label: FE**
  
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** There isn't sufficient evidence to justify the conclusion that "most tourists from France are rude" based solely on one personal experience.
  
  **IDAA Label: IR**
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The argument implies a causal relationship (being French causes rudeness) without sufficient evidence. One rude act by an individual doesn't substantiate a broader cause-effect relationship.
  
  **IDAA Label: WCB**
  
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This defect does not seem to apply here since there is no repeated proposition.
  
  **IDAA Label: Not applicable**
  
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There is no presumption that others agree with this argument. It simply reflects one person's perspective based on personal experience.

  **IDAA Label: Not applicable**
  
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The language used is relatively clear and unambiguous regarding the incidents described.
  
  **IDAA Label: Not applicable**

So, the defective argument types applicable to the given statement are:

**G, FE, IR, WCB**

These types diagnose the core issues with the argument, showing that it generalizes from limited evidence, doesn't consider a broad enough data set, lacks conclusive reasoning, and implies an unsupported causal relationship.
