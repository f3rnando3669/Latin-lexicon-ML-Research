Sure, let's break down the argument and identify the defective argument types applied:

### Argument:
"The owner of the car dealership by my house told me I need a new car, and he would know since he works in the industry."

### Analysis:
1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument does not make a broad generalization based on limited information, so <G> does not apply here.
  
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not list several factors or possibilities only to draw a conclusion from an incomplete analysis, so <FE> does not fit.
  
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This argument might contain inconclusive reasoning because relying solely on the dealership owner's advice as evidence is weak, as there could be a conflict of interest. So, <IR> could be relevant.
  
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument does not claim a causal relationship based on insufficient evidence, so <WCB> does not apply.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: There is no repetition of a proposition here intended to make it appear more valid, so <RR> does not fit.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument does not rely on an assumed agreement or consensus to support the conclusion; therefore, <FU> is not applicable.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language used is fairly direct and there is no ambiguous wording pertinent to the argument, thus <DEP> does not apply.

### Conclusion:
The most applicable defective argument type here is **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**. The reason given (the advice of the car dealership owner) is not adequately conclusive evidence for the need to purchase a new car, especially considering the potential bias of someone who benefits from selling cars.
