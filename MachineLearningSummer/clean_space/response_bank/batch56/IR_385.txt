For 
<IDAA> stands for "Identify Defective Argument and Apply Analysis." Given the statement:

"It is ridiculous to have spent thousands of dollars to rescue two whales trapped in the ice. Why, look at all the people trapped in jobs they don't like."

Let's apply <IDAA>:

1. **Identify Defective Argument:**
   - The argument juxtaposes two unrelated situations (rescuing whales and people being in jobs they don't like) and implies that the money spent on rescuing whales should instead be spent on addressing job dissatisfaction.

2. **Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** The argument makes a broad generalization by comparing the specific case of rescuing whales to a broad issue of job dissatisfaction without providing sufficient evidence or context for the comparison.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reasoning here is inconclusive because it doesn't provide a direct causal link or relevant premises that logically connect the two issues (money spent on whales versus job dissatisfaction).
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** There is no causal relationship established between the spending on whale rescue and the issue of people being unhappy with their jobs.
   - **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** The use of "trapped" has different connotations in the two contexts (literal entrapment for whales, metaphorical entrapment for people in jobs), which muddies the clarity of the argument.

3. **Apply Analysis:**
   - The speaker's argument is flawed because it falsely equates two unrelated issues. The decision to allocate resources to rescue efforts for whales does not detract from the ability or responsibility to address job dissatisfaction.
   - The comparison between "whales trapped in the ice" and "people trapped in jobs they don't like" is inappropriate because it mixes literal and metaphorical uses of the word "trapped," which can mislead the audience.
   - Effective resource allocation arguments should be based on comparable situations and clear, direct connections between causes and effects. This argument does neither and thereby fails to provide a reasonable basis for critique.

In summary, the given argument primarily suffers from <G>, <IR>, <WCB>, and <DEP>. It indiscriminately generalizes, employs inconclusive reasoning without causation, and uses ambiguous language, making the comparison invalid and misleading.
