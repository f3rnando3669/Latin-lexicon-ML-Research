To apply the concept of Identifying Defective Argument Attributes (IDAA) to the statement "That type of car is poorly made; a friend of mine has one, and it continually gives him trouble," we need to analyze the argument for potential defects based on the types you’ve defined.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument suggests that because one specific car of that type has issues, all cars of that type are poorly made. This is a form of hasty generalization because it doesn't provide sufficient evidence to support such a broad conclusion. The experience of a single individual is not enough to represent the entire population.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument relies on a very limited sample (one friend’s experience) and fails to consider other possible experiences with the same type of car. It assumes the friend's experience is representative without providing a broader context or more examples.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided (one friend's negative experience) may not be sufficient to conclude that the entire type of car is poorly made. The argument doesn't show causation or consider other factors that might have led to the car's issues.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument fails to establish a strong causal link between the friend’s experience and the general quality of the car type. There could be other factors specific to the friend's car, such as maintenance history, driving conditions, or individual defects, that are not representative of all cars of that type.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This defect does not seem to apply here as the argument does not repetitively assert the proposition without any further support.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument does not claim or imply that there is a widespread agreement on the car being poorly made based on the friend's experience.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The terms used in the argument (e.g., “poorly made,” “gives him trouble”) could be somewhat subjective but they are not particularly ambiguous. The main issue is not with the clarity of language but with the inferential leap made from one instance to a general conclusion.

Thus, the argument "That type of car is poorly made; a friend of mine has one, and it continually gives him trouble" can be analyzed as having the following defective argument types:

- Generalization (<G>)
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)

These defects indicate that the argument lacks sufficient evidence and logical support to justify the broad conclusion drawn.
