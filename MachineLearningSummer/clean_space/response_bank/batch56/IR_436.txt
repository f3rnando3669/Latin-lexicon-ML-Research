For 
<IDAA> stands for Identification of Defective Argument Attribute(s).

Let's analyze the statement "You should give me a promotion. I have a lot of debt and am behind on my rent." and identify the defective argument attributes.

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not consider all potential reasons for why someone should or should not receive a promotion. It relies solely on the speaker's financial struggles, ignoring other factors such as job performance, qualifications, and the company's requirements.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The claim that having debt and being behind on rent justifies a promotion is weak and not directly related to the qualifications for the promotion. Financial struggles do not necessarily correlate with job performance or merit within the workplace.

3. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This may also be partially considered, as the argument attempts to present personal hardship as a circular justification for a promotion without additional substantiating evidence about job-related criteria.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument assumes that financial difficulties should lead to a promotion, but it fails to establish a sufficient causal link between personal financial status and the merit for a promotion.

Given these analyses, the statement "You should give me a promotion. I have a lot of debt and am behind on my rent." has multiple defective argument attributes:

<IDAA>: <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>
