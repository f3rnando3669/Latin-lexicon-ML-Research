For 
<IDAA stands for Identify Defective Argument Attributes. Let's break down the argument "She is good at writing because she writes words effectively." to identify any defective argument attributes that might be present.

**Argument Breakdown:**

- She is good at writing (conclusion).
- because she writes words effectively (reason).

**Analysis of the Argument:**

1. **Generalization (G):** This doesn't seem to be a case of overgeneralization since it is referring to an individual instance rather than a broad group.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This argument doesn't suffer from incomplete enumeration as it's not trying to list out all possibilities or categories.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reasoning provided could be considered inconclusive. Saying someone is good at writing because they write words effectively is somewhat circular and doesn't provide a robust basis or independent criteria for being "good" at writing.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The argument may not fully establish why writing words effectively makes someone good at writing overall. Writing involves more than just putting words together effectively—it could involve creativity, clarity, engaging the audience, etc.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The argument appears to fall into this category as well—it basically repeats the proposition in different terms without adding substantive supporting evidence ("good at writing" and "writes words effectively" are closely related).

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There's no mention of a consensus or appeal to popular opinion in this statement.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The terms used ("good at writing" and "writes words effectively") are a bit vague and could be interpreted in various ways.

**Identified Defective Argument Attributes:**

1. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason provided is not sufficiently conclusive to support the conclusion well.
2. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The argument repeats the conclusion in a slightly altered form without offering new evidence.

Given these points, the identified defective argument attributes in "She is good at writing because she writes words effectively." are: <IR> and <RR>.
