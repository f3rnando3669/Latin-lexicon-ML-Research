For 
Applying the Defective Argument Analysis and Annotation (IDAA) to the given topic and debate:

TOPIC: Should people let their cats go outside?
DEBATE:
1. "People should let their cats go outside. Going outside gives cats more exercise."
2. "Speaking of exercise, have you ever played 'Just Dance'? What a great workout!"

Let's break it down:

**1. "People should let their cats go outside. Going outside gives cats more exercise."**
- This statement may be viewed through the lens of <G> Generalization. The argument makes a broad claim that going outside will provide all cats with more exercise without considering exceptions or potential downsides involved with outdoor activities for cats (risk of injury, disease, etc.).

**2. "Speaking of exercise, have you ever played 'Just Dance'? What a great workout!"**
- This statement is largely irrelevant to the topic at hand and can be seen as a form of <DEP> Ambiguous Language because it shifts the discussion to an unrelated personal anecdote about a video game, which has no direct connection to whether cats should go outside for exercise.

Combining both analyses into a structured IDAA:

TOPIC: Should people let their cats go outside?
DEBATE:
**"People should let their cats go outside. Going outside gives cats more exercise."**
- Defective Argument Type: <G> Generalization - This argument oversimplifies the issue by assuming that outdoor activity is universally beneficial for cats.

**"Speaking of exercise, have you ever played 'Just Dance'? What a great workout!"**
- Defective Argument Type: <DEP> Ambiguous Language - This statement segues into an unrelated topic, thereby failing to address the debate about whether cats should go outside.
