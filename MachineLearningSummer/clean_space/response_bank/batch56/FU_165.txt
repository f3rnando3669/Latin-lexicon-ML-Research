For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Analysis. Letâ€™s apply this to the argument in question: 

**Argument:** "How could you not believe in ghosts? Roughly two billion people believe in them, so don't you think you should reconsider your opinion?"

Let's break this down using the defective argument types defined:

1. **Generalization (G):** This argument suggests that because a large number of people believe in ghosts, it must be true or at least worthy of belief. However, the truth of a proposition does not necessarily depend on the number of people who believe it. This reflects a hasty generalization based on popular belief.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This argument fails to consider other possibilities or view that might not be represented by the two billion people mentioned. It overlooks the diversity of opinions and reasons why people might or might not believe in ghosts.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The fact that two billion people believe in ghosts does not necessarily provide a conclusive reason for their existence or why someone should believe in them. People can collectively believe in false ideas.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The argument does not provide a causal connection or evidence that these beliefs are based on reasonable or scientific grounds. Simply citing the number of believers does not establish a legitimate cause for the belief in ghosts.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The argument repeats the proposition that many people believe in ghosts without providing additional evidence or reasoning to support why this belief is valid.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument assumes that the number of believers itself is a strong argument for the validity of the belief. It rests on the presumption that a large consensus implies truth, which is not a sound logical basis.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The argument does not clearly define what it means to "believe in ghosts." Belief can vary widely in nature and context, and without clarification, the ambiguity remains.

Combining these observations, we can see that the argument primarily relies on the defective types of **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** and **Generalization (G)**, while also touching upon **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**, and **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**. These defects collectively undermine the argument's validity and persuasiveness.
