For 
<IDAA> stands for Identify Defective Argument Type. Below, I will analyze the argument "Yesterday you were 5 minutes late, today 10, and tomorrow you won't even show up!" and classify it based on the defective argument types provided:

Argument: "Yesterday you were 5 minutes late, today 10, and tomorrow you won't even show up!"

This argument appears to be a defective argument type called Generalization (defined as <G>) in this context. The person making this argument is using a limited set of observations (being late by 5 minutes one day and 10 minutes the next day) to predict a severe and exaggerated conclusion (that the person won't show up at all tomorrow). This prediction does not take into account any external factors or reasons that might explain the tardiness and jumps to an unwarranted conclusion based on insufficient evidence.

Therefore, the argument can be classified as:

<IDAA> Generalization (G)
