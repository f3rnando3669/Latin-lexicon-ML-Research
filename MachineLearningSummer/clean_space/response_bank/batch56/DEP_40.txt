For 
<IDAA> stands for "Identify Defective Argument Attributes."

Let's break down the statement and identify the defective argument types involved:

**Statement:** "It is said that we have a good understanding of our universe. Therefore, we know exactly how it began and exactly when."

1. **Generalization (G)**: The statement implies a broad conclusion based on limited information. The phrase "a good understanding of our universe" is generalized to mean complete understanding of its origins, which is not necessarily true. Our understanding of the universe doesn't automatically mean we know everything about its beginning and precise timeline.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement bases its conclusion on an incomplete set of evidence. The understanding of the universe is multifaceted and ongoing; claiming complete knowledge is an oversimplification that ignores the many unknowns and continuing research in cosmology and astrophysics.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument does not provide sufficient reasoning to link the premise ("we have a good understanding of our universe") to the conclusion ("we know exactly how it began and exactly when"). Knowing how the universe began and knowing its exact timeline require specific evidence and details that are not discussed or provided here.

Based on these analyses, the defective argument attributes for the statement "It is said that we have a good understanding of our universe. Therefore, we know exactly how it began and exactly when." are:

<G>, <FE>, <IR>.
