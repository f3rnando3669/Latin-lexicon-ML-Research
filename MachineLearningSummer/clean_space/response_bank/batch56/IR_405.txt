Let's clarify the defective argument types you've defined before applying the Identification of Defective Argument Application (IDAA):

- \(<G>\) Generalization
- \(<FE>\) Incomplete Enumeration
- \(<IR>\) Inconclusive Reason
- \(<WCB>\) Insufficient Causal Basis
- \(<RR>\) Faulty Repetition of Proposition
- \(<FU>\) Presumptuous Consensus
- \(<DEP>\) Ambiguous Language

Now, applying the Identification of Defective Argument Application (IDAA) to the dialogue:

Mom: (looking at report card) How do you have an F in English?!
Son: I don’t know. Did you see that I loaded the dishwasher? I was about to go mow the lawn. Need me to do anything else?

This dialogue mostly contains what is known as a **red herring**, a distraction from the main issue (the F in English). The son is attempting to divert the mom’s attention from his grade by pointing out his efforts in household chores. Here's how it relates to the defective argument types:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (\(<IR>\))**: The son's response does not address the specific question about his F in English. Instead, he provides unrelated information about his household activities, which leads to an inconclusive reasoning about the actual grade mentioned.
   
So, the primary defective argument type in the son's response is:

- \(<IR>\) Inconclusive Reason

Therefore, applying IDAA:

"Mom: (looking at report card) How do you have an F in English?!  
Son: I don’t know. Did you see that I loaded the dishwasher? I was about to go mow the lawn. Need me to do anything else?"

Defective Argument Type: \(<IR>\) Inconclusive Reason.
