For 
Applying the term <IDAA> (which appears to be an Argumentum Ad Hominem) to the argument:

"Mr. Gough supports the cell phone ban, and he's an idiot, so we should let teachers keep their cell phones."

The argument is attacking Mr. Gough's character (by calling him an idiot) rather than addressing the merits or flaws of the cell phone ban itself. This is a classic example of an ad hominem fallacy, where the focus is shifted from the argument to the person making the argument. As a result, it does not provide a strong basis for the conclusion that teachers should be allowed to keep their cell phones.
