For 
The argument "If we let this child bring the permission slip late, there is no reason to ever set a deadline for anything again!" can be classified using the defective argument types defined as follows:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This argument assumes that letting the child bring the permission slip late would lead to never setting a deadline for anything again, without considering other possible scenarios. This is a form of hasty conclusion because it does not consider other possible outcomes or solutions where deadlines can still be enforced while accommodating exceptions in certain circumstances.

2. **Generalization (G)**: The argument takes a specific instance (the child bringing the permission slip late) and generalizes it to a broad and extreme consequence (no reason to ever set deadlines again). This is a classic case of overgeneralization where a single event is assumed to cause a complete breakdown of an unrelated system.

The argument doesn't appear to fit well into the other defective argument types, such as **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**, **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**, or **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**.

Thus, the main defective argument types applied here would be:
- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
