For 
<IDAA> stands for identifying defective argumentation and acknowledges the flawed reasoning in the statement ", that makes it right/valid." Now, let's apply the defective argument types to this statement:

When someone argues "That makes it right/valid," they are often assuming that by citing an example or a piece of evidence, they have conclusively proved their point. This statement can be critiqued based on several defective argument types:

1. **<G> Generalization**: If the statement is based on a single or limited example, it could be considered an overgeneralization. E.g., "One person did it this way, that makes it right/valid for everyone."

2. **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: If the statement ignores other possibilities or examples, it falls under incomplete enumeration. E.g., "These two cases turned out this way, that makes it right/valid."

3. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: If the reason provided does not logically lead to the conclusion, then the argument is inconclusive. E.g., "Because it worked once, that makes it right/valid."

4. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: If there isn’t a well-established causal relationship, then the argument is insufficient. E.g., "This happened first, then that happened, so that makes it right/valid."

5. **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: The statement merely repeats the initial proposition without adding valid justification. E.g., "It’s right because it’s right, that makes it right/valid."

6. **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: Assuming something is valid just because a group of people say so. E.g., "Everyone believes it, so that makes it right/valid."

7. **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**: The word "right/valid" itself may be ambiguous or too vague without proper definition or context. E.g., "Since this scenario meets undefined criteria, that makes it right/valid."

Thus, the statement ", that makes it right/valid." could be critiqued by identifying what specific defective argumentation is at play based on the context in which it is used.
