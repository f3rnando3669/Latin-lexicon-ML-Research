To apply the identified defective argument types to the statement "Everyone already believes that the defendant killed her husband, and that many people can't be wrong," we assess the logical flaws within it. This statement primarily showcases a fallacious argument structure by appealing to the presumed majority opinion instead of presenting concrete evidence.

Here is the defective argument type that applies:

**<FU>: Presumptuous Consensus**

Explanation:
- The argument assumes that since many people believe the defendant killed her husband, it must be true. This is an appeal to the majority's opinion (argumentum ad populum) and does not provide factual evidence or logical reasoning to support the claim. Rather, it presumes consensus as a substitute for proof.

Other potentially relevant defective argument types:

- **<IR>: Inconclusive Reason** 
  - The statement provides an inconclusive reason ("many people can't be wrong") to justify the belief without presenting proper evidence or leading reasoned arguments to its conclusion.

By identifying the <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus) and acknowledging the possibility of <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), we clarify the faulty nature of the argument's reliance on popular belief without substantial evidence.
