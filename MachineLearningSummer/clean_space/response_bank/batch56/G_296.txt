It seems like you're interested in applying a particular type of defective argument to the given statement. However, the type `<IDAA>` isn't defined in your list, so it's unclear what specific type of defective argument this might correspond to.

If we interpret the joke using the defective argument types provided, we could potentially identify some elements that might make the argument defective, depending on the context:

- **Generalization (G):** "Why did the blonde cross the road? Because she saw a shoe sale!" This could be seen as a stereotype, generalizing behavior based on the assumption that blondes (or specifically women) are overly interested in shoe sales.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The joke only offers one reason for why the blonde crossed the road, which is insufficient to cover all possible reasons someone might cross the road. It's not a thorough enumeration of possibilities.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The joke doesn't offer a logically compelling reason for someone crossing the road—it’s more of a humorous stereotype rather than a conclusive argument.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** There is no real evidence to suggest that seeing a shoe sale is a definitive cause for crossing the road, making the joke rely on an insufficient causal basis.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This type doesn't seem to apply directly to the joke since there's no repetition of a proposition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The joke presumes that the audience will find humor in shared stereotypes or common beliefs about blondes and shopping.

- **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The language in the joke is not particularly ambiguous, so this type doesn't seem to apply.

Given these explanations, it appears that the joke most closely aligns with **Generalization (G)** due to its reliance on stereotypes, but it also incorporates elements of **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** and **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. Without defining `<IDAA>`, these are the best matches among the defective arguments you provided.
