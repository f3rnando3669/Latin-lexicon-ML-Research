For 
<IDAA> seems to be a request for an application involving identifying, defining, and analyzing arguments. Although not explicitly defined in your query, I'll follow the logical process:

1. **Identify the Argument**: 
   - **Claim**: "We should buy an Apple computer whenever we need a new computer."
   - **Justification**: "We have been buying Apple as far back as anyone can remember!"

2. **Define the Defective Argument Type**:
   - This argument primarily relies on past behavior to justify current and future actions without providing substantive reasons why this choice remains the best option.

3. **Analyze with Defective Argument Types**:
   - This can be classified under <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition) because it essentially repeats the proposition (to buy Apple computers) on the basis of historical repetition rather than any direct merits or relevant reasons for the current scenario.
   - It also shows elements of <G> (Generalization), assuming that what was a good choice in the past is necessarily the best choice now and in the future without addressing current circumstances or options.

Thus, applying the defective arguments classification, the statement "Of course we should buy an Apple computer whenever we need a new computer. We have been buying Apple as far back as anyone can remember!" is primarily an instance of <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition) and exhibits traits of <G> (Generalization).
