The argument presented is: "Coke is not as healthy for you as Pepsi. Besides, Britney Spears drinks Pepsi, so it must be healthier than Coke."

To apply the defective argument types (abbreviated as <IDAA>), let's break down the argument and identify which defective arguments are being used:

1. "Coke is not as healthy for you as Pepsi."
   - This is a **Generalization (<G>)** because it makes a broad claim without providing specific evidence or data to support that assertion.

2. "Besides, Britney Spears drinks Pepsi, so it must be healthier than Coke."
   - This contains multiple defective arguments:
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Just because Britney Spears drinks Pepsi does not mean that all relevant factors determining its healthiness over Coke have been considered.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The fact that a celebrity drinks Pepsi does not serve as a conclusive reason for its health benefits.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This assumes that because a popular person (Britney Spears) drinks Pepsi, people should also believe it is healthier without establishing a valid grounds for consensus.

So, identifying the defective arguments applied to the statement: "Coke is not as healthy for you as Pepsi. Besides, Britney Spears drinks Pepsi, so it must be healthier than Coke," would be:

- **<G> Generalization**: "Coke is not as healthy for you as Pepsi."
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: "Britney Spears drinks Pepsi."
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: "Britney Spears drinks Pepsi, so it must be healthier than Coke."
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: "Britney Spears drinks Pepsi, so it must be healthier than Coke."

In summary, the statement utilizes <G>, <FE>, <IR>, and <FU> defective arguments. The reasoning lacks a solid causal basis connecting Pepsi with being healthier than Coke and relies on an appeal to celebrity endorsement rather than factual evidence.
