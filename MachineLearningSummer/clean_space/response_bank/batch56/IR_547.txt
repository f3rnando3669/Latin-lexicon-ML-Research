For 
The acronym <IDAA> stands for "Improper Use of Appeal to Authority." This type of defective argument occurs when someone relies on the opinion of an authority instead of providing evidence for their statement. 

Applying <IDAA> to the given argument:

"You said that because an authority thinks something, it must therefore be true."

Here, the argument is assuming that the authority's opinion is a valid substitute for evidence. Just because an authority believes a proposition does not necessarily mean that the proposition is true. The truth of the statement needs to be established on its own merits rather than relying solely on the authority's support.

Thus, this statement exemplifies the <IDAA> argument type.
