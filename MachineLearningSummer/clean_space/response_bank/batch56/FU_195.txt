To analyze the argument in the statement using the defined defective argument types:

**Statement:** "Katie likes to read and would rather do that than play sports. Her friends make fun of her and tell her that reading is for nerds. Katie stops reading so much and starts to play sports more."

This statement involves both social influence and individual decision-making. Let's break down potential defective argument types:

1. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument Katie's friends make fun of her for reading and label it as "for nerds" suggests a faulty premise based on a social consensus that reading isn’t valuable or desirable, which is an unsupported generalization. The friends assume the consensus ("reading is for nerds") should apply to Katie without substantiating why that consensus is valid or why it should influence Katie's behavior.

2. **Generalization (G):** The friends generalize reading as an activity "for nerds," which is an overgeneralization. This type of reasoning assumes that because some people might label readers as nerds, it applies universally.

Combining **FU** and **G**: The friends' influence on Katie stems from the defective argument structures of **FU** (a false social consensus) and **G** (an over-simplified generalization about reading).

Thus:
   
**IDAA (Identified Defective Argument Types Application):**
- **(FU)**: Katie's friends’ argument that reading is "for nerds" and the presumption that this viewpoint should dictate Katie's behavior is an instance of **Presumptuous Consensus**.
- **(G)**: The labeling of reading as an activity "for nerds" is a defective **Generalization**.

So the argument presented in the situation is primarily defective due to **(FU)** and **(G)**.
