For 
<IDAA> stands for **Identify Defective Argument Application**. To identify defective arguments in the given statement, we need to analyze the argument and match it to the defined defective argument types.

Let's break down the statement:

"Company R.E. are working on advertisement for a new juice drink. Some of their marketing employees went to a school to do a survey on students’ beverage preference. The majority said they preferred orange-flavored drinks, so Jeff told his superiors that orange was the flavor favored most by high school students."

**Potential Defective Arguments:**

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - Jeff is generalizing the preferences of the students at one school to represent the preferences of all high school students.
   - Statement that indicates this: "The majority said they preferred orange-flavored drinks, so Jeff told his superiors that orange was the flavor favored most by high school students."

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The survey only considered students' preferences at one school, not a comprehensive sample of high school students nationwide.
   - Implies a lack of complete data.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The reason provided may not be sufficient to assume that high school students in general prefer orange-flavored drinks. There is no conclusive evidence that the surveyed group's preferences apply broadly.
   - Jeff's conclusion is based on a potentially non-representative sample.

Given these analyses, we can identify the following defective argument types applied to the statement:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**

So, the <IDAA> for the given statement identifies the use of <G>, <FE>, and <IR> defective argument types. 

Applying <IDAA> to:

"Company R.E. are working on advertisement for a new juice drink. Some of their marketing employees went to a school to do a survey on students’ beverage preference. The majority said they preferred orange-flavored drinks, so Jeff told his superiors that orange was the flavor favored most by high school students."

Results in the identification of the following defective arguments:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
