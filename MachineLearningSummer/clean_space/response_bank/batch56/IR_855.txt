For 
To analyze the argument "No one has proven God exists, so He doesn’t" and apply the appropriate defective argument type (IDAA), we'll break down what is inherently flawed about it.

This statement is an example of an argument from ignorance, where it claims that a proposition is false because it has not been proven true. However, the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. The argument assumes that because there is currently no proof of God's existence, it is concluded that God does not exist.

Given the definitions:

- **Generalization (G):** Drawing a broad conclusion based on a small sample.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Concluding something must be true by failing to consider all relevant possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Drawing a conclusion from evidence that doesn’t necessarily support it.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Claiming a cause without sufficient evidence.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Repeating a claim without providing supporting evidence.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Claiming something is true because it is widely believed.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** Using unclear or vague language that allows for multiple interpretations.

The argument "No one has proven God exists, so He doesn’t" falls under:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This argument fails to consider other relevant possibilities, such as the possibility that God's existence is beyond human understanding or current scientific capability to prove. It prematurely concludes that lack of proof equates to non-existence without exploring other potential explanations or the limits of human knowledge.

Thus, the appropriate defective argument type for this statement is <FE>.
