<IDAA>: Identify Defective Argument Application

1. **Statement**: "Everyone is getting tattoos in college, so you might as well do it too."

2. **Identifying the Defective Argument Type**:

   - **Generalization (G)**: Making a broad statement based on limited examples or evidence.
     * The term "everyone" implies that all college students are getting tattoos, which is a generalization without specific data to back it up.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assuming that because many people do something, it is the correct or advisable course of action.
     * The argument suggests that because "everyone" (presumably a large group) is getting tattoos, you should do it too, relying on the notion of consensus as a justification.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Suggesting a conclusion based on an incomplete appraisal of the relevant factors.
     * The argument doesn’t consider individual preferences, health concerns, cultural beliefs, or personal values— it ignores these variables by focusing solely on the behavior of peers.

3. **Conclusion**:

   The statement "Everyone is getting tattoos in college, so you might as well do it too." contains defective arguments of type **Generalization (G)**, **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**, and **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:

   - **Generalization (G)**: Implicit assumption that all college students are getting tattoos without sufficient evidence.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Drawing a conclusion based on the presumed popularity of an action without considering individual circumstances.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Failing to acknowledge other relevant factors that might be important when deciding whether or not to get a tattoo.
