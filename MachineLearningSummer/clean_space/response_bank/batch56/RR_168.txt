For 
Let's break down the given statement using the predefined defective argument types to identify and analyze the issues present:

**Statement: "Circular definition: a definition that is circular."**

1. **Definition of the Defective Argument Types:**
    - Generalization (<G>)
    - Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
    - Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
    - Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
    - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
    - Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
    - Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)

2. **Analyzing the Statement:**

**Circular Definition: a definition that is circular.**

- **Circular Definition:**
    The statement essentially uses the term "circular" to define "circular definition," making it inherently circular. This kind of definition fails to provide any new information, explanation, or clarification about what a circular definition actually means.
    
    - **Defective Argument Type Applied:** Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)

- **Ambiguous Language:**
    The phrase "a definition that is circular" could be ambivalent in nature since it doesnâ€™t provide a clear understanding of what "circular" implies in this context (Does it mean repetitive, lacking new information, or self-referential?).

    - **Defective Argument Type Applied:** Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)

Based on the above analysis, the statement could be marked with the following defective argument types:

- Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
- Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)

Therefore, the appropriate defective argument types to apply to "Circular definition: a definition that is circular." are:

<IDAA> <RR> <DEP>
