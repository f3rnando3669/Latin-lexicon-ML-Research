The argument presented can be analyzed and identified for defective argument types as follows:

1. **John's Argument**:
   - **Type**: Generalization (<G>)
     - **Explanation**: John is generalizing that because firearm registration is a step towards regulation, it will inevitably lead to confiscation and the elimination of constitutional rights. This is an overgeneralization as it assumes a slippery slope without concrete evidence.

2. **Ted's Argument**:
   - **Type**: Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
     - **Explanation**: Ted's rebuttal restates the idea that registration does not necessarily lead to confiscation, using other examples like cars, babies, boats, and lanes. This repetition doesn't directly address the specific concerns John raised about firearms and constitutional rights but instead uses unrelated examples to generalize the notion of registration.

By applying <IDAA> (Identification of Defective Argument Types Applied), we identify distinct defective argument types involved in the exchange:

- **John's Argument**: Generalization (<G>)
- **Ted's Argument**: Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)

Both arguments display forms of defective reasoning that weaken their positions.
