For 
<IDAA> stands for "Identifying Defective Argument Application." Let's apply it to the given argument:

**Original Argument:**
"Dr. Fauci says we need to wear masks, but Dr. Fauci is the oldest, meanest doctor around. I’m sure what he says isn’t true at all."

**Identified Defective Argument Application (IDAA):**

This argument contains a defective reasoning known as an "ad hominem" fallacy, where the argument attacks the character of the individual (Dr. Fauci) rather than addressing the content of what he says (the need to wear masks). However, based on the defined defective argument types, none exactly match the "ad hominem" fallacy. Despite this, we can identify which of the provided defective argument types might be somewhat relevant:

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - This fallacy isn't about generalizing from insufficient evidence, so this doesn't apply here.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - This involves drawing a conclusion from an incomplete set of instances, which isn't applicable here.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - This fallacy occurs when a conclusion is reached without sufficient evidence. The argument here does involve an inconclusive reason as it bases the rejection of Dr. Fauci’s advice solely on his perceived character. Therefore, **<IR>** could be considered.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - This is about insufficient evidence for a claimed cause-effect relationship, which does not apply here.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - This involves repeating a proposition without additional evidence, which isn't happening here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - This fallacy occurs when it is assumed that something is true because many people believe it, which isn't present in this argument.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - This involves ambiguity or unclear wording; the language here is clear but attacking character not addressing the argument.

Therefore, the most fitting defective argument type here appears to be:

```
<IR>: Inconclusive Reason
```

This is because the argument against Dr. Fauci's advice is based on attacking his character (oldest, meanest doctor) rather than providing evidence against the necessity of wearing masks, making the reasoning inconclusive about the actual point.
