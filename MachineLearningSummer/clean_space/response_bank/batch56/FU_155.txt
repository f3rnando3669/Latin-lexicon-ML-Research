For 
The statement "McDonald's Hamburgers: over 99 billion served." could be examined under various defective argument types we'll define here. However, from the given list, one particularly relevant defective argument type that can be applied is <FU> – Presumptuous Consensus. Let's break down why this might be the case:

### Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):
This argument assumes that because a large number of people have consumed McDonald's hamburgers (over 99 billion served), this is an implicit endorsement of the quality or desirability of their hamburgers. It presumes a consensus among consumers without providing substantive evidence that the high number of hamburgers served correlates to the product's quality or health benefits.

However, it is important to note that while "McDonald's Hamburgers: over 99 billion served." primarily serves as a statement of fact regarding the quantity of burgers sold, the implication can be made that this statement is meant to suggest popularity and thus quality.

### Evaluation of other Defective Argument Types:
1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - This does not directly apply since the statement is a specific fact, not a broad generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - Not applicable here since the statement doesn't imply a list or a set of items.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - This type might apply if the statement were used to conclude something specific about the quality or benefit of McDonald's hamburgers, but as it stands alone, it’s more about quantity.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - This would apply if the statement were making a direct causal claim, such as saying the number served causes something specific. However, the statement is more of a report than a causal claim.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - This doesn’t seem to fit as it does not involve repetition without additional support.

6. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - The language in the statement is fairly clear and direct, though it could be said that what is ambiguous is the implied meaning (popularity suggesting quality).

In conclusion, <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus) is the most suitable defective argument type to apply to the statement "McDonald's Hamburgers: over 99 billion served." because it presumes a consensus about the hamburgers' quality based merely on their high sales numbers.
