Certainly! To apply the definitions of defective argument types we've established:

Given:
**Argument**: "Quinoa is a delicious, plant-based source of protein because it tastes so darn good."

Let's identify and classify this argument's potential defects using our defined types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This type of defective argument is not directly applicable here because the argument does not appear to overgeneralize based on insufficient evidence. There is a statement about quinoa being delicious, but it's not drawn from a broad or hasty conclusion about all quinoa.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Since the statement does not list multiple examples and omit crucial ones, this type does not seem relevant here.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This argument could fit into this category. The conclusion that quinoa is a good source of plant-based protein is based on its taste, which is irrelevant to its nutritional value. Saying something tastes good does not logically infer it being nutritionally beneficial or a good source of protein.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This is another good fit. The argument suggests a causal relationship between the delicious taste of quinoa and its status as a good source of protein, which is unsubstantiated. The taste of a food does not cause it to have nutritional content.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This does not apply here, as the statement is not repetitively making the same proposition without adding new information or support.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This is not applicable because there is no assumption based on a presumed consensus or collective agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The term "delicious" can be subjective and vague, leading to different interpretations. However, the primary defect here is not about ambiguity but more about the inappropriate causal link.

Thus, the argument "Quinoa is a delicious, plant-based source of protein because it tastes so darn good." best fits the following defective argument types:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The claim about protein content is inadequately supported by information about taste.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument implies an unsupported causal relationship between taste and protein content.

Therefore, applying <IDAA>, we identify the argument as defective due to **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
