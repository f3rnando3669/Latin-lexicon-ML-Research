Under the Defective Arguments classification you've provided, the statement “I’ve never had the flu because I take my vitamins everyday” can be analyzed as follows:

The statement attributes the absence of flu exclusively to the habit of taking vitamins daily. However, this reasoning may be flawed due to multiple possible factors that contribute to not getting the flu (such as general immunity, flu vaccination, low exposure to the virus, etc.).

Considering the types of defective arguments you've provided, the most fitting classification would be:

### <WCB> - Insufficient Causal Basis

This argument fails to provide a sufficient causal basis for the claim that taking vitamins daily is the sole reason for never having had the flu. There could be many other factors contributing to this outcome that are not accounted for in the statement.

Therefore, the statement “I’ve never had the flu because I take my vitamins everyday” demonstrates a defective argument of type <WCB>.
