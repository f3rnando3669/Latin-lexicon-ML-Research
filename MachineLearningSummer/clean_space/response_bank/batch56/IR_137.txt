For 
<IDAA> or Identifying Defective Argument Application can be applied to the provided argument by recognizing the specific defective argument types present. Here's the analysis:

"A smoke screen to cover the truth; a clue that is misleading or distracting."

This phrase involves certain linguistic and logical issues:

1. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The phrase "a smoke screen" is metaphorical and can be interpreted in multiple ways. Without context, it's unclear what is being hidden and how it specifically relates to the truth.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument presents "a smoke screen" as a cover for truth without considering other potential reasons or explanations for the distraction.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The argument assumes that "a smoke screen" conclusively leads to truth being hidden, but it does not establish a clear causal link or provide sufficient evidence to support this conclusion.

Thus, applying IDAA to the phrase identifies the following defective argument types:

- Ambiguous Language (<DEP>): The metaphor "a smoke screen" is vague and open to multiple interpretations.
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>): It fails to consider other possible reasons for distraction or misleading clues.
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>): It does not conclusively establish the connection between the smoke screen and the hiding of the truth.

Therefore, the analysis concludes that the defective arguments in the statement "A smoke screen to cover the truth; a clue that is misleading or distracting." involve <DEP>, <FE>, and <IR>.
