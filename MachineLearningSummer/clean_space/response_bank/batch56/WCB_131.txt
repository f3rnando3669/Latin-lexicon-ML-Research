In order to apply the Identifying Defective Argument Analysis (<IDAA>) to the argument "I'm moving to Connecticut because it is the richest state in the nation and I'm tired of being poor," we need to determine which types, if any, of the defective argument types defined could apply.

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - This defective argument involves making a broad statement based on limited evidence or an unrepresentative sample.
   - Analysis: The statement does not appear to generalize broadly about all states or conditions, so <G> does not apply directly.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - This defective argument occurs when important alternatives or options are left out of consideration.
   - Analysis: The argument suggests that moving to the wealthiest state will solve the problem of being poor, but it omits other possible ways to address poverty (like employment opportunities, social programs, cost of living, etc.). Hence, <FE> could apply.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - This type involves reasoning that does not conclusively lead to the stated conclusion.
   - Analysis: Merely moving to a wealthy state does not necessarily lead to personal wealth. The reasoning linking Connecticut's wealth to resolving personal poverty is inconclusive. Thus, <IR> might apply.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - This defective argument involves assuming a causal relationship without sufficient evidence.
   - Analysis: The assertion that moving to Connecticut will directly cause the person to stop being poor lacks evidence of a causal connection. <WCB> can apply here.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - This occurs when a proposition is repeated without adequate justification.
   - Analysis: There isnâ€™t a repeated proposition in the argument, so <RR> does not apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - This type assumes a consensus or agreement that may not exist.
   - Analysis: The argument does not rest on an assumed consensus for support, so <FU> does not apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - This involves the use of language that is unclear or has multiple interpretations.
   - Analysis: The terms used in the argument are fairly clear, with no obvious ambiguity, so <DEP> does not apply.

By applying <IDAA>, the argument "I'm moving to Connecticut because it is the richest state in the nation and I'm tired of being poor" can be identified as potentially defective due to:

- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:** The argument does not consider other ways of addressing poverty.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** The reasoning does not conclusively lead to the conclusion that personal poverty will be alleviated.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** It assumes a direct cause-effect relationship between living in a wealthy state and escaping personal poverty without sufficient evidence.

Therefore, <FE>, <IR>, and <WCB> are the relevant types of defective arguments identified in this case.
