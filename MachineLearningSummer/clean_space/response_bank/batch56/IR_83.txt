For 
It looks like you want to identify and apply a type of defective argument (<IDAA>) to the statement given. While you did not explicitly define <IDAA>, based on the context you've provided, I'll make an informed guess. The statement "My family is this school's biggest donor so, you better think about that bad grade you gave me on my test" is an example of an external persuasion attempt and potentially manipulating authority or influence to affect a grade, which could very well represent an "Improper Dependency on Authority or Affluence," which I'll designate as <IDAA>.

So, the application would be:

"My family is this school's biggest donor so, you better think about that bad grade you gave me on my test." <IDAA>

If <IDAA> actually stands for something else, please provide the precise definition and I can re-evaluate the statement accordingly.
