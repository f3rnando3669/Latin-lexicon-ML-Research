For 
<IDAA>: Identification and Demonstration of Argumentative Flaws.

Here is an application of <IDAA> to the argument "I'm raising money to help cure XYZ disease. If you do not donate, you are part of the problem."

1. **Identification of Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument makes a sweeping statement that implies anyone who does not donate is complicit in the problem.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument assumes a universal agreement or moral consensus that donating is the only way to be part of the solution.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Repeating the assertion that non-donors are part of the problem without providing additional evidence or reasoning.
   - **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The phrase "part of the problem" is vague and can be interpreted in various ways, creating ambiguity.

2. **Demonstration of Argumentative Flaws**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument unfairly categorizes all non-donors as contributing to the problem of XYZ disease, without considering individual circumstances or other potential contributions to the cause.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: By asserting that not donating indicates being part of the problem, it presumes widespread consensus on a moral judgment that may not be universally held.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The statement restates the same claim—donating equates to being part of the solution—without further substantiation, failing to advance the argument meaningfully.
   - **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The term "part of the problem" lacks clarity. It does not specify how non-donating translates to complicity or what being "part of the problem" entails.

In summary, the argument "I'm raising money to help cure XYZ disease. If you do not donate, you are part of the problem," contains several defective argument types, including Generalization, Presumptuous Consensus, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, and Ambiguous Language. These flaws weaken the argument's validity and persuasiveness.
