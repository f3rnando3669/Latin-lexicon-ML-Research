The argument provided is:

"I broke my mirror this morning, AND I failed my History test. I must've failed because the mirror gave me bad luck."

Using the defective arguments defined, let's analyze and apply relevant types to this argument:

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This argument attributes the failure of the History test to breaking the mirror based on the superstition of bad luck. There is no sufficient causal link established between the two events; hence, the argument shows an insufficient causal basis.

So, we apply the defective argument type <WCB>:

**<WCB>**: "I broke my mirror this morning, AND I failed my History test. I must've failed because the mirror gave me bad luck."

This correctly identifies the flaw in the argument related to a lack of sufficient cause-effect reasoning.
