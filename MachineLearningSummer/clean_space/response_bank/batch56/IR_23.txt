For 
To apply the identification of defective argument types (designated here as <IDAA>) to the statement "I'm tailgating her because she cut me off!", we need to analyze whether this argument falls into any of the predefined defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Does the argument make a broad generalization from limited evidence?  
   - In this case, the statement does not seem to be generalizing; instead, it focuses on a single incident.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Does the argument assume all relevant cases have been considered without exhaustive analysis?  
   - The statement does not enumerate cases, so this defective argument type does not apply here.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Does the conclusion not logically follow from the premises?  
   - While tailgating because someone cut you off does not justify the driver's action, it still provides a reason. However, it's more about the insufficiency or irrationality of the reason rather than an inconclusive one.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Does the argument imply a causal relationship without sufficient evidence?  
   - The statement implies a causal relationship: "She cut me off" causing "I'm tailgating her." Although there is a direct cause-effect stated, it could be argued that this causal chain is rationally insufficient or unjustifiable.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Does it rely on merely restating the same proposition without further support?  
   - This argument doesn't repeat itself; it presents a reasoning process.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Does the argument presume that a consensus exists or that others agree without proof?  
   - There is no mention of consensus or assumed agreement by others.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: Does the argument use language that is unclear or has multiple interpretations?  
   - The language used here is quite clear and specific.

### Analysis Conclusion:
The argument primarily falls into the category of **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** since it attempts to justify tailgating (a potentially dangerous action) simply based on being cut off, which is insufficient as a reasonable causal basis for such a potentially harmful response. 

Thus, it can be identified as follows:
```
<IDAA> "I'm tailgating her because she cut me off!" [<WCB>]
```
