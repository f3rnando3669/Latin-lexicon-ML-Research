For 
<IDAA>: Inconclusive Reason (IR)

The argument in the dialogue centers around the use of electrolytes in a drink called Brawndo. The Secretary of State's and Secretary of Defense's responses do not provide a systematic or scientific explanation for why electrolytes are used in Brawndo. Instead, they simply repeat the fact that Brawndo contains electrolytes without addressing Pvt. Joe Bowersâ€™ underlying question about the purpose or function of these electrolytes. This makes the reasoning inconclusive as it fails to provide an adequate explanation.
