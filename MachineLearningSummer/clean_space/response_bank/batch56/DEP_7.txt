For 
<IDAA> can be used to label the defective argument type present in the dialogue between Speaker 1 and Speaker 2. 

Speaker 1 asks a direct question regarding whether the prisoner was tortured. 

Speaker 2's response attempts to sidestep the implication of torture by describing actions that are commonly understood as forms of torture—holding someone under water (which can imply waterboarding) and conducting a mock hanging—without explicitly acknowledging them as torture. This response can be analyzed as a type of defective argument called "Ambiguous Language" (<DEP>), where the terms used are open to multiple interpretations and deliberately avoid a straightforward answer to the direct question asked.

Therefore, the defective argument in the response of Speaker 2 can be identified as <DEP>.
