For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Types) to the stated argument about President Bush and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge:

**Argument Presented:**
"President Bush argues that we should open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil drilling. But Bush just wants to reward his rich cronies in the oil industry, so we can't take his arguments seriously."

Let's break it down:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This defective argument type involves making broad statements or conclusions based on insufficient evidence. 
    - This doesn't specifically apply to the provided argument as it's more focused on an attack on motive rather than a broad statement.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This defect arises when an argument lists a limited number of options or scenarios, omitting plausible alternatives. 
    - This isn't applicable here as the argument doesn't involve listing scenarios.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This defect is when the reasons given don't provide sufficient support for the conclusion.
    - The argument states that because Bush supposedly wants to reward his rich cronies, his arguments cannot be taken seriously. There's a lack of direct connection between personal motives and the validity of the drilling argument, so this fits.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This involves assuming causality without sufficient evidence.
    - The assertion that Bush wants to open up the refuge for drilling solely to reward cronies lacks evidence, so this could apply.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This defect involves repeating a proposition without providing new supporting evidence.
    - Repetition isn't an issue here because the argument presented doesnâ€™t involve repetitive claims.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This defect assumes something is true because many people believe it without backing it with evidence.
    - The argument assumes Bush's motive based on a stereotype of his affiliations rather than concrete evidence, which could loosely apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This occurs when an argument uses vague or ambiguous terms that lead to confusion.
    - In the context, the terms are not particularly ambiguous.

**Summary of Identified Defective Argument Types:**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The connection between Bush's motives and the strength of his argument for oil drilling is not adequately supported.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The claim about Bush's motives for oil drilling lacks sufficient evidence to substantiate the supposed causality.

Thus, the defective argument types for the provided argument are **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
