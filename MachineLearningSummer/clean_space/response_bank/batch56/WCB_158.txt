For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Analysis, which helps identify which types of defective argument are present in a given argument.

Let's apply <IDAA> to the argument: "I broke a mirror earlier in the day, and then I received an F on my history final. Therefore, I received the F because I broke the mirror."

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The argument implies a cause-and-effect relationship between breaking the mirror and receiving an F, but no sufficient causal link is established. The two events are correlated in time, but correlation does not imply causation.

Thus, the argument primarily falls under the type <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
