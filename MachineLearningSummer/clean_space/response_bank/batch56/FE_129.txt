For 
<IDAA> appears to be a placeholder for an analysis or identification framework for defective arguments. Since "IDAA" is not defined within your provided context, I'll assume its purpose is to identify and classify any defective arguments within the given statement:

In the statement, "At a recent cocktail party, the conversation has turned to family pets, and your friend asks you 'Are you a cat or a dog person?'"

Let's analyze this statement based on the provided defective argument types:

1. **Generalization <G>:** This argument might be implying that everyone must be either a cat person or a dog person, which is a form of overgeneralization. It ignores the possibility that someone might like both cats and dogs, or neither.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>:** The statement does not account for other types of pet preferences (e.g., birds, fish, reptiles, etc.). It presents only two options, which is an incomplete enumeration of possible preferences.

3. **Inconclusive Reason <IR>:** The statement does not provide any reasoning or evidence as to why one must choose between being a cat person or a dog person, making it largely inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>:** The question itself does not posess any apparent causal claims, so this type is not applicable here.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>:** There is no repetition in the proposition, making this type not applicable.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>:** The question presumes a consensus that the only valid categories of pet preferences are cats and dogs. It assumes everyone falls neatly into one of these categories without sufficient basis.

7. **Ambiguous Language <DEP>:** The phrase “Are you a cat or a dog person?” could be considered ambiguous because "person" in this context is a label that may not be clearly defined or objectively measured. This can lead to different interpretations of what it means to be a "cat person" or a "dog person."

Based on this analysis, the given statement "Are you a cat or a dog person?" can be identified as containing defective arguments under <G> (Generalization), <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration), <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus), and <DEP> (Ambiguous Language).
