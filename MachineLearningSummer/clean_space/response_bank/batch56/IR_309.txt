For 
It appears there's a slight confusion. You've defined various defective argument types but haven't specified what <IDAA> stands for. However, given the context, <IDAA> might refer to some form of argumentative analysis or identification, possibly an acronym not clearly defined yet. Let me break down the given argument:

1. "My opponent is an untrustworthy liar and an idiot." 
2. "Therefore, you should believe me."

The argument proceeds by attacking the opponent's character instead of addressing the actual issues at hand. This is commonly known as an ad hominem attack. In the provided list, none of the defective argument types directly align with an ad hominem fallacy. However, if we were to categorize this using general fallacy terminology, it doesn't neatly fit into <G> (Generalization), <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration), <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis), <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus), or <DEP> (Ambiguous Language).

For comprehensive fallacy analysis:
1. **Ad Hominem Attack**: The argument attacks the character or attributes of the person making the counterclaim, without engaging with their argument directly.
2. **Irrelevant Reasoning**: Suggests that personal attributes of the individual are unrelated to the truth or falsity of the proposition at hand.

Since <IDAA> is assumed to be a form of argument analysis, this argument would likely be noted as not addressing the proposition's core due to use of personal attack, thus making it fallacious reasoning not clearly defined by existing <type> definitions given.
