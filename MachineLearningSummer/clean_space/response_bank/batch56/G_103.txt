It appears you want to identify and apply the appropriate defective argument type to the provided statement. The given statement:

"I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!"
