For 
Certainly! Let's break down the quote to identify the literary terms present within it. The quote is:

"There I was in the midst of thousands, and yet a perfect stranger; without home and without friends, in the midst of thousands of my own brethrenâ€”children of a common Father, and yet I dared not to unfold to any one of them my sad condition."

1. **Irony**:
   There is a clear sense of irony in the fact that the speaker is surrounded by thousands, yet feels completely isolated and unable to confide in anyone. The expectation would be that being among "brethren" provides a sense of comfort and companionship, but the reality is starkly different.

2. **Repetition**:
   The phrase "in the midst of thousands" is repeated, which reinforces the sense of isolation amidst a crowd. This repetition emphasizes the contradiction between the speaker's physical surroundings and emotional state.

3. **Contrast**:
   There is a use of contrast in the juxtaposition of being "in the midst of thousands" but also a "perfect stranger," and being with "brethren" who are "children of a common Father" but yet unable to share his "sad condition". This highlights the disparity between expected social bonds and actual emotional disconnection.

4. **Pathetic Fallacy**:
   While not directly addressing the environment or nature, the emotional state of the speaker is projected onto the social situation. The use of the phrase "sad condition" personifies the speaker's feelings, creating a sense of shared sorrow with the audience.

5. **Metaphor**:
   The phrase "children of a common Father" metaphorically refers to people who are part of the same community or humanity at large, indicating a shared bond or origin.

6. **Hyperbole**:
   The notion of being "in the midst of thousands" exaggerates the crowd's size to intensify the sense of isolation.

So, applying the analysis, the literary terms found in this quote are:
- Irony
- Repetition
- Contrast
- Pathetic Fallacy
- Metaphor
- Hyperbole
