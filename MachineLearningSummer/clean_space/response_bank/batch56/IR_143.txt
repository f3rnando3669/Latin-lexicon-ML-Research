To address the argument provided using the defective argument annotations defined:

"When President Kennedy said that research for space travel could help children with eye defects, he is making what kind of appeal?"

The statement could be interpreted in several contexts, each potentially involving different types of defective arguments. Here is a breakdown:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The statement may assume that space travel research can help children with eye defects among other unspecified benefits. If Kennedy did not list all the possible benefits, he might be omitting other essential details that complete the enumeration of the benefits of space research.
   
   - **<FE>**: The argument is defective due to an incomplete listing of benefits.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The appeal to aiding children with eye defects due to space travel research may lack direct evidence or a conclusive basis. The connection between space research and eye defect treatment may not be clearly established or may rest on speculative links.

   - **<IR>**: The argument is defective because the reason provided is inconclusive.

3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** If the causal relationship between space research and benefits to children with eye defects is weak or speculative, then the argument lacks a solid causal basis.

   - **<WCB>**: The argument is defective due to an insufficient causal basis linking space research to the treatment of eye defects.

In this particular context, the most fitting defective argument type appears to be **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the statement makes a potentially vague or unsubstantiated connection between space research and eye treatment benefits, without providing conclusive evidence for such a relationship.

Thus, the specific annotation would be:
- **<IR>**: The argument is defective due to providing an inconclusive reason.
