For 
<IDAA> stands for Identify Defective Argument Analysis.

Let's analyze the argument: "iPhones are the best smartphones on the market because Apple makes the best smartphones."

To identify the defective argument types, we need to look at the flaws in the reasoning.

1. **"iPhones are the best smartphones on the market because Apple makes the best smartphones."**

   - This argument essentially states that iPhones are the best because Apple, who makes iPhones, makes the best smartphones. It's a form of circular reasoning because the argument's premise is simply a restatement of the conclusion.
   - The defective argument type that best applies here is <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), given that it restates the proposition within its argument.

Therefore, the appropriate tag for this argument is:

<IDAA> <RR>
