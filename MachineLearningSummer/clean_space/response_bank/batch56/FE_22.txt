For 
Certainly! Let's apply the definitions of the defective argument types (DAs) to the statement: "The academic decathlon, Mr. Iglesias? That's a rich kid thing."

**<IDAA>: Identifying Defective Argument Types Applied Analysis**

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - This argument is a classic example of Generalization. It assumes that only "rich kids" participate in academic decathlons without considering exceptions or the broader context.
   
   **Identified DA**: <G>

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - The statement makes an implicit incomplete enumeration by suggesting that participants of academic decathlons are exclusively "rich kids." It ignores other groups who might also participate.

   **Identified DA**: <FE>

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The reason given for why academic decathlons are "a rich kid thing" is not conclusive. It brings up the socioeconomic status of participants without providing evidence or a clear connection between the event and wealth.

   **Identified DA**: <IR>

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - There is an implied causal link that academic decathlons are somehow restricted to "rich kids," but the causal basis is not sufficiently established.

   **Identified DA**: <WCB>

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - This defective argument type does not seem applicable in this context as there is no repetitive assertion of the proposition in the argument.

   **Not Identified DA**: <RR>

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - The statement could be seen as suggesting a consensus view (everyone thinks it's a "rich kid thing") without providing any supporting evidence or justification for this consensus.

   **Identified DA**: <FU**

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - The term "rich kid thing" is ambiguous and lacks clarity, making the argument unclear and potentially misleading.

   **Identified DA**: <DEP>

**Summary of Identified Defective Argument Types**:
- **<G>**: Generalization
- **<FE>**: Incomplete Enumeration
- **<IR>**: Inconclusive Reason
- **<WCB>**: Insufficient Causal Basis
- **<FU>**: Presumptuous Consensus
- **<DEP>**: Ambiguous Language

These identified defective arguments indicate that the statement makes sweeping assumptions without proper evidence, clarity, or sufficient reasoning.
