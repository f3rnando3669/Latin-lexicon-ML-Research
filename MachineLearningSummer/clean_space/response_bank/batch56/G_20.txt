For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identification and Diagnosis of Argumentative Anomalies) to the statement "I work out in the morning because it worked for my friend," we need to identify which defective argument types are present in the reasoning. Here's the assessment:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This argument relies on a single instance (the friend's experience) to generalize the effectiveness of working out in the morning for the speaker, disregarding other possible outcomes or variables. This is an example of incomplete enumeration because it doesn't take into account other experiences or evidence that might contradict the friend's experience.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The statement "because it worked for my friend" provides an insufficient reason for the conclusion that working out in the morning will work for the speaker. The friend's success might be due to various factors that do not apply to the speaker, making the reasoning inconclusive without more evidence or a stronger causal link.

Therefore, the statement primarily involves the defective argumentative types:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**

This concludes the application of <IDAA> to the statement "I work out in the morning because it worked for my friend."
