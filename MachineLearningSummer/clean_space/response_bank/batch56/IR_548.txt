You have defined a number of defective argument types and listed their abbreviations. To deconstruct and assign the type to the question "Are you still a heavy drinker?", we interpret it as follows:

The question "Are you still a heavy drinker?" presumes that the person to whom it is directed was a heavy drinker at some point in the past. This is a classic case of a complex question fallacy, where the question embeds an assumption within it. However, you haven't defined a specific fallacy for complex questions among the ones you've provided.

Given the defective argument types you've defined, the one that seems to most closely match the nature of this issue is <DEP>, which stands for Ambiguous Language. Though it's not a perfect match, the ambiguity here lies in the presupposition made by the question, making it misleading without further context.

Therefore, applying the closest defective argument type you have provided:

<DEP>: "Are you still a heavy drinker?"

This classification is based on the assumption embedded within the language of the question, which makes it ambiguous or potentially misleading.
