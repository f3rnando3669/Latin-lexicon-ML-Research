The argument presented can be analyzed for any instances of Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), and Ambiguous Language (DEP). 

Given the specific chain of reasoning in the provided statement, it appears to primarily suffer from a form of Inconclusive Reason (IR) because it establishes a sequence of highly speculative and sometimes exaggerated consequences without solid evidence for each step. Each link in the chain may have alternative outcomes or mitigating factors that are not considered in the argument. Essentially, the logical progression from one event to another is assumed rather than conclusively demonstrated.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the argument against the defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: Not predominantly observed here as the argument is more about a singular chain rather than drawing a general conclusion from a specific case.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This could be implied since the possibility of other outcomes or solutions (e.g., studying some but not fully, retaking a quiz, or finding alternative pathways to success) is not considered, indicating a lack of considering all possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Predominantly observed as each step in the chain - failing the quiz, leading to a lowered GPA, causing inability to play football, resulting in no scholarship, thereby no college and ultimately no life - is highly speculative. Each step assumes a worst-case scenario without providing concrete evidence that these would definitively happen.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Closely related to IR, it can be argued that the causal links between the steps are tenuous. For example, failing one quiz doesn't necessarily lower the GPA sufficiently to prevent playing football, and there might be other factors influencing scholarship eligibility.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Not clearly represented in the argument. There's no indication that repeating the same proposition to validate the argument.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument does not appear to rely on an assumed consensus among others to validate the steps laid out in the progression.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: There is clarity in the statements made, so ambiguity in language isn't a primary issue.

Given the analysis above, the main defective argument type applied to this sequence of reasoning is **<IR> Inconclusive Reason** due to the overly speculative nature of the sequential consequences drawn without solid evidence.
