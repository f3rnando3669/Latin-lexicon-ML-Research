For 
To analyze the argument using the provided defective argument types, let's break down the claim: "Last year, the city of Brookfield allocated more money to public parks. This year, however, littering increased, so the increase in park funding must have been responsible." 

Firstly, we need to scrutinize the logical relationship being asserted: more funding for parks leading to increased littering.

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - The argument does not generalize based on insufficient or limited evidence but instead infers the cause of an effect. This does not fit the category of Generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - The argument fails to consider other possible reasons for the increase in littering, such as changes in population, tourist activity, or public events. Hence, this fits as an Incomplete Enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - The reason given (increase in funding) does not logically or conclusively link to the observed effect (increase in littering). The increase in funding could have myriad other intended and unintended consequences. So, this demonstrates an Inconclusive Reason.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - There is an insufficient basis to assert a direct causal link between the increased funding and the increased littering. The argument lacks evidence showing how more money would specifically result in more littering. Therefore, this fits as Insufficient Causal Basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - The argument does not repetitively emphasize a proposition without adding new evidence or justification. This does not fit as Faulty Repetition of Proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - The argument does not indicate that it is relying on a presumed consensus or widely held opinion without actual evidence. This does not fit as Presumptuous Consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - The language used in the argument is relatively clear and specific regarding the claims and reasoning. There is no evident ambiguity in language that would mislead or obscure the argument. This does not fit as Ambiguous Language.

Therefore, the given argument can be identified as:
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

### Final Analysis (IDAA):
The argument: "Last year, the city of Brookfield allocated more money to public parks. This year, however, littering increased, so the increase in park funding must have been responsible."

Defective arguments identified:
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument does not account for other potential factors for increased littering.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason given does not conclusively lead to the observed result.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** There is inadequate evidence to link the increase in funding to the increase in littering.
