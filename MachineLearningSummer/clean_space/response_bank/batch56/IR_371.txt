The argument provided can be analyzed in terms of the six defective argument types defined. The statement made is:

"There is a lot of commotion regarding saving the environment. We cannot make this world an Eden. What will happen if it does become Eden? Adam and Eve got bored there!"

We'll apply each of the defined defective argument types to see if and how the statement fits them.

**Generalization (<G>):**
- The argument seems to generalize that achieving an "Eden" (a perfect or utopian environment) is undesirable because Adam and Eve supposedly got bored there. This generalizes the experience of two mythical figures to the entire human population, which is an over-simplification and a defect in reasoning. Therefore, the argument can be considered to contain a defective Generalization.

**Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
- The argument fails to enumerate other potential benefits and outcomes of striving for an improved environment, focusing only on the idea that "Eden" (perfection) is undesirable. This is an incomplete enumeration of the possible consequences and motivations for environmental conservation. Therefore, it contains an Incomplete Enumeration defect.

**Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
- The argument connects the current commotion about saving the environment to the question of whether creating a perfect environment (Eden) would be beneficial, but this connection is not logically solid or conclusive. There's a leap in reasoning from environmental conservation to the undesirability of a utopian world. Therefore, the argument can be seen as having an Inconclusive Reason.

**Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
- The argument implies a causal relationship between striving for a perfect environment and an undesirable state of boredom. However, it lacks sufficient evidence to support this causal relationship. The historical or mythical reference to Adam and Eve does not provide a substantial causal basis for this claim. Hence, it fits the defective argument type of Insufficient Causal Basis.

**Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
- The argument does not repetitively state a single proposition in a way that would qualify as faulty repetition. Therefore, this defective argument type does not seem applicable here.

**Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
- The argument does not appeal to a supposed consensus or imply that everyone agrees with the proposition it is making. It does not fit the notion of Presumptuous Consensus.

**Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
- The term "Eden" can be seen as ambiguous. It is metaphorical and might mean different things to different people (a perfect garden, an unattainable ideal, etc.). Additionally, the argument’s implications about the boredom of Adam and Eve are ambiguous and unclear in context. Therefore, the argument can be classified as involving Ambiguous Language.

As a summary:

The given statement can be identified as exhibiting the defective argument types:
- Generalization (<G>)
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)

By recognizing these defects, we understand the weaknesses in the argument’s structure and reasoning.
