It looks like you have provided a set of defective argument types and their definitions. To apply <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Attributes) to the statement "The reason billions of children starve to death each year is because we live in a world that does not care," I will analyze it through the lens of these defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement employs a broad conclusion about the world based on the issue of child starvation. The claim "we live in a world that does not care" is a sweeping generalization that may not account for the complexities and varying degrees of care and efforts made by different entities and individuals.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not enumerate all potential reasons why children might starve, possibly overlooking factors such as economic disparity, conflict, inadequate infrastructure, and political instability.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The statement provides a reason that is not fully substantiated. The assertion that the world does not care is subjective and lacking in concrete evidence or explanation, making it inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: There is an insufficient causal basis for the assertion. The relationship between the world not caring and child starvation is too simplistic and does not delve into the various, often complex, causes that lead to such a severe issue.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The statement does not appear to repeat any propositions, so this defective argument type does not apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The statement presumes a consensus that the world does not care about starving children without providing evidence that this is a widely agreed-upon belief, which might not be accurate.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The term "does not care" is ambiguous and can be interpreted in many ways. It is not clear what caring would entail or what specific actions or lack thereof are being referred to.

So, applying <IDAA> to the statement, we get the following defective argument attributes:

- Generalization (<G>)
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
- Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)

These attributes suggest that the statement lacks precision, fails to account for multiple factors and perspectives, and makes broad, unsupported claims.
