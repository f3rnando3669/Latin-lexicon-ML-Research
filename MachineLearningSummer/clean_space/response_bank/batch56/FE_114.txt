For 
The statement "Force people to choose between two extreme choices intentionally ignoring the whole spectrum of other possibilities" can be categorized using <IDAA> as follows:

<IDAA> is an acronym standing for Identify, Describe, Analyze, and Address. Let's break down the statement using these steps:

### Identify:
The statement presents a type of argument that constrains the options to only two extremes, ignoring all other potential alternatives.

### Describe:
This argument type is commonly known as a False Dilemma or False Dichotomy. It suggests that there are only two possible choices when, in fact, a wide range of possibilities exist.

### Analyze:
Analyze why it is an issue:
- It misrepresents the complexity of the situation.
- It can lead to a forced and potentially misguided decision.
- It disregards other viable options that might provide a better outcome.

### Address:
To address this defective argument:
- Recognize and expose the fallacy by identifying other possible alternatives that have been ignored.
- Encourage exploration of the full spectrum of possibilities and present evidence or reasoning for these other options.
- Promote a more nuanced understanding that the situation is not as black-and-white as it is being portrayed.

So, applying <IDAA> to the statement:

**Identify:** False Dilemma (A subset of Generalization, <G>).
**Describe:** The argument restricts choices to two extremes, omitting a broader spectrum of possibilities.
**Analyze:** It oversimplifies complex issues, leads to poor decision-making.
**Address:** Highlight and consider other alternatives, provide evidence, encourage complex understanding.

In this way, we can effectively understand, critique, and provide a comprehensive response to the defective argument presented.
