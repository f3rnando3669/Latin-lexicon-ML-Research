For 
<IDAA>, or Identification of Defective Argument Types, applied to the statement "People either like coffee or hate it," can help us analyze potential flaws in the argument. 

This statement seems to be a type of **false dichotomy** (a logical fallacy that involves presenting two opposing options as the only possibilities). However, given the defective argument types you've defined, the most appropriate categorization may be:

<FE> â€” Incomplete Enumeration: The argument simplifies the range of possible opinions about coffee into just two extremes, ignoring other possibilities such as people who are indifferent or who have mixed feelings about coffee. 

Therefore, "People either like coffee or hate it" can be identified as an example of <FE> where the enumeration of all possible opinions is incomplete.
