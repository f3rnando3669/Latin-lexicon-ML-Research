Sure, let's analyze the argument step by step and identify the defective argument type:

---

**Argument:** "Thanks to her enduring popularity with employees, Ella Watson is the best-liked CEO in our company's history."

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This could apply if the argument assumes that Ella Watson's popularity with employees necessarily makes her the best-liked CEO in history without considering other potential factors or evidence. However, this doesn’t seem to fit perfectly because the argument is more specific rather than making a broad generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This applies if the argument fails to consider other possible well-liked CEOs in the company's history or other factors contributing to being "best-liked." This looks like a strong candidate, as the argument assumes that popularity with employees alone qualifies her as the best-liked without comparing her to other CEOs.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This could apply if the reason given (i.e., popularity with employees) is not necessarily sufficient to conclude that she is the best-liked CEO. It seems to fit the given argument since just popularity with employees doesn't conclusively establish her as the best-liked CEO in history.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This could apply if the argument incorrectly links her popularity with the broader conclusion of being the best-liked CEO. This doesn't seem quite right here, as the argument doesn't focus on a causal relationship as much as an assumed correlation or basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This doesn't seem to apply, as there's no repetition of a proposition evident in the argument.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This could apply if the argument presumes that her popularity with employees implies a broader consensus, but the argument doesn’t explicitly do this.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This may apply if the terms like "enduring popularity" and "best-liked" are ambiguous. Though this could be a consideration, it doesn’t fit as well as.
