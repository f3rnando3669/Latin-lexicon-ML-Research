For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application.

In the given statement, "Cari says that we need a major overhaul in education. Cari gets a speeding ticket every other week, so maybe she should learn how to drive instead of worrying about schools," the defective argument type <IDAA> can be applied to identify the specific fallacy or defective reasoning. 

This is an example of a **red herring** or **ad hominem** fallacy, where instead of addressing the argument Cari made about needing a major overhaul in education, the speaker diverts attention to Cari's driving habits, which are irrelevant to the argument about education reform.

If we were to map this to one of the predefined defective argument types, it aligns closely with:

- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** The supplied reason (Cari's driving record) does not provide a conclusive basis to reject her argument about education reform. The information about her driving habits does not relate to, or invalidate, her advocacy for changes in the education system.

So, applying <IDAA> to the statement, we can identify it as:

**<IR> Inconclusive Reason**
