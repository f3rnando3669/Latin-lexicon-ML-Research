For 
The argument provided, "Honesty is defined as always being honest," appears to be circular. Circular reasoning is when the conclusion of an argument is assumed in one of the premises, often resulting in an argument that doesn’t provide useful or additional information.

In this case, "honesty" and "being honest" are essentially the same thing, so the argument doesn't provide a meaningful definition or explanation.

However, <IDAA> wasn't one of the defective argument types listed. Based on the arguments provided, this argument fits the definition of <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), which refers to an argument that merely repeats the proposition without providing additional support or justification.

Therefore, the proper designation for this argument is:

**<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: “Honesty is defined as always being honest.”
