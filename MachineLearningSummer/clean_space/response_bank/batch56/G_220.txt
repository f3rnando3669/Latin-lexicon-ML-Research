For 
The statement "Fred, the Australian, stole my wallet. Thus, all Australians are thieves." can be analyzed for defective arguments using the defined types.

The primary issue in this argument is that it makes a sweeping conclusion about all Australians based on the behavior of a single individual. This is a classic example of a *hasty generalization*, where a broad conclusion is drawn from a limited sample. Let's apply the defective argument types to this statement:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument is a generalization because it infers that all Australians are thieves based on the singular instance of Fred's behavior. This characteristic fits the definition of a defective argument type under Generalization.

Thus, applying <IDAA>, the argument "Fred, the Australian, stole my wallet. Thus, all Australians are thieves." would be classified under **<G> Generalization**. This type indicates that the conclusion is improperly extended from a limited observation.

So, the defective argument type is: **<G> Generalization**.
