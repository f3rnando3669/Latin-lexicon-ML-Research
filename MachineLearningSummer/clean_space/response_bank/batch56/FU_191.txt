For 
The defective argument you provided ("40 million people canâ€™t be wrong! Buy the new iPhone XIV today!") can be analyzed for its fallacies. Utilizing the defective argument types defined:

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** is demonstrated here as the statement implies that because many people (40 million) have made a particular choice, their decision is inherently correct or justified. It appeals to the notion that a large number of people are in consensus about the value of the iPhone XIV, without addressing the actual merits or qualities of the product.
  
Therefore, "<FU>" fits well with the argument provided.

**Final Application: <FU>**
