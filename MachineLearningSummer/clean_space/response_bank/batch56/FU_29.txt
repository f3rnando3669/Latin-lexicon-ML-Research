For 
To analyze "Everyone being referred to as comrade" using the defective argument types you've defined, we need to consider the nature of the statement and identify which, if any, defective arguments apply. 

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument type involves making broad claims based on limited evidence. 
   - **Application**: If the statement "Everyone being referred to as comrade" is based on limited or selective instances where people are called comrade, this would be a generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This involves providing an incomplete list of possibilities or causes.
   - **Application**: The statement might imply that referring to everyone as comrade is the only or most prevalent way of addressing people, without considering other forms of address.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Arguments that fail to provide a definite reason or proof.
   - **Application**: If the statement does not provide sufficient reasoning for why everyone should be referred to as comrade or why it is happening, it could be inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Claims a cause-effect relationship without sufficient evidence.
   - **Application**: If there is an implied causation (e.g., "Everyone is referred to as comrade because of a specific social policy") without proof, it may fall under this category.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Repeated assertion without justification.
   - **Application**: Simply repeating "Everyone is referred to as comrade" without explaining why or on what basis might constitute faulty repetition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Asserting that a consensus exists without evidence.
   - **Application**: Saying "everyone" implies a universal agreement or practice, which could be presumptuous without evidence.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Using language that is unclear or can be interpreted in multiple ways.
   - **Application**: The term "everyone" is ambiguousâ€”it might mean everyone in a specific context, community, or globally, which is not clear.

Given the statement "Everyone being referred to as comrade," the defective arguments likely applied are:

- **Generalization (G)**: Assuming that the practice of referring to people as comrade is widespread based on limited evidence.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assuming that there is an agreement or established norm that everyone is referred to as comrade without presenting evidence to support this claim.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The term "everyone" is vague and could mean different things in different contexts, leading to an unclear or misleading interpretation.

Therefore, the statement seems to involve **Generalization (G)**, **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**, and **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**.
