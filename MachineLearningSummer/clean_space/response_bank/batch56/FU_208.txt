For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Types to analyze and classify the flawed reasoning used in a given argument. Let's apply it to "AttP 11: It is okay to walk across Mr. Jones's property as evidenced by other people walking on his property."

1. **Defective Argument Type Identification**:
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument relies on the fact that some people are walking on Mr. Jones's property to conclude that it is okay to do so. However, this generalization is incomplete without considering other relevant aspects, such as whether Mr. Jones has given permission, local laws, or any signs posted on the property. Not counting all necessary factors to justify the conclusion indicates an incomplete enumeration.
   
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument assumes that because others are performing an action (walking on Mr. Jones's property), it is inherently acceptable. This presumption of consensus does not necessarily establish the action's propriety or legality.
   
2. **Explanation**:
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The conclusion that it is okay to walk across Mr. Jones's property based solely on the observation of others doing so is insufficient. There may be other essential factors or information not considered that could change the conclusion.
   
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument presumes that the behavior of a group sets a standard or norm, which is not verified. Just because people are doing something doesn't automatically mean it is right or allowed, showing a presumptuous consensus.

Hence, applying <IDAA> to "AttP 11: It is okay to walk across Mr. Jones's property as evidenced by other people walking on his property," we identify the defective arguments as:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
2. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**

This categorization helps diagnose the flaws, highlighting that making assumptions based on incomplete observations or unverified group behavior lacks solid justification.
