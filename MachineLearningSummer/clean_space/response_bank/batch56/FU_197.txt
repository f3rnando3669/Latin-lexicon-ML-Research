For 
The argument presented in "Come on! Everyone else thinks the movie is great - you should too!" can be analyzed as follows:

The type of defective argument applied to this scenario is <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).

Explanation: 

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** refers to the fallacy of assuming that because a majority or a significant number of people hold a certain belief, that belief must be valid or correct.
- In this case, the argument is suggesting that since "everyone else" thinks the movie is great, you should believe it too, which rests on the assumption that the consensus of others automatically justifies the validity of the opinion.

Thus, the argument falls under the category of Presumptuous Consensus, <FU>.
