For 
Certainly, let's analyze the argument "That's what abortion is - killing innocent humans for money. Abortionists are government licensed hit men." using the identified defective argument types.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument seems to make a broad generalization by equating all abortions with killing innocent humans for money. It does not account for the various circumstances and considerations that might surround the issue of abortion.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not acknowledge the multitude of reasons why someone might seek an abortion â€” such as medical necessity, the health or life of the mother, cases of severe fetal abnormalities, or other personal and socioeconomic factors.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasoning here is incomplete and does not provide comprehensive evidence or a logical foundation. It equates abortionists to "government licensed hit men" without a clear, step-by-step logical connection or supporting evidence to back the claim.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: There is a causal claim made by suggesting that the sole or primary reason for abortion is monetary gain. However, this does not acknowledge or examine the complex decision-making process involved in abortions, or the regulatory frameworks and healthcare contexts in which abortions occur.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The argument does not seem to exhibit faulty repetition, as it primarily relies on strong emotional and valuative language rather than repeated propositions.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument presumes a widely accepted consensus or moral judgment about abortion that may not reflect the diversity of opinions and beliefs held by different people and cultures. It imposes a moral viewpoint without recognizing that there is significant debate and nuance on the topic.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The terms "killing innocent humans" and "government licensed hit men" are highly loaded and emotionally charged phrases. They are likely to cause confusion and emotional reaction rather than fostering clear, rational debate.

Thus, the argument exhibits the following defective argument types:

- **<G> Generalization**
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**
