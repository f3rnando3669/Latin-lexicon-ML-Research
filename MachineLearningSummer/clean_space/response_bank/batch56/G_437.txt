It looks like there's a specific logical framework you're following with designated labels for different types of defective arguments (such as Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, etc.). However, I don't see the definition for <IDAA> specified in your list.

Given the statement: "My grandfather was a typical Irishman - friendly, outgoing, and drunk half the time," and understanding that <IDAA> refers to Identifying Defective Argument Application, we can analyze this statement for potential fallacies based on your given types.

1. **Generalization (G)**: This statement makes a broad generalization about all Irish people based on the characteristics of one individual (the speaker's grandfather). It implies that being "friendly, outgoing, and drunk half the time" is typical of all Irishmen, which is a hasty and overgeneralized assertion.

2. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The term "typical Irishman" is vague and subjective. What one person considers "typical" can greatly vary, leading to possible misinterpretation or reinforcing stereotypes.

This statement clearly suffers from both <G> (Generalization) and <DEP> (Ambiguous Language). Without the definition of <IDAA>, it is assumed that it refers to the analysis or application process of identifying defective arguments. Thus, the application of <IDAA> would involve recognizing these defective arguments in the given statement.
