For 
To apply <IDAA> to the argument "The newest brand jeans that everyone is wearing are called Blue Dogs. Blue Dogs are being worn by all young teens. Be sure to go out and buy your new jeans at your local mall," we need to identify the defective argument types involved. Let's analyze the statement step-by-step:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - "The newest brand jeans that everyone is wearing are called Blue Dogs."
   - This statement seems to generalize the popularity of Blue Dogs jeans to "everyone" without sufficient evidence. Given the lack of details and the broad claim, this can be considered a Generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - While the statement does not list examples, it implies that because Blue Dogs are worn by "all young teens," everyone should buy them. This could fit as an Incomplete Enumeration if there's an implied list of young teens that is not representative of the whole group.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - "Blue Dogs are being worn by all young teens."
   - The reasoning here is inconclusive because it assumes that if young teens wear them, everyone should, without providing a compelling reason why this should be the case for everyone else.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - The argument does not clearly state a causal relationship, so this might not apply directly. However, if the implied causal link is that wearing Blue Dogs will make someone fit in, this causal basis is weak and relies on assumption.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - The phrase "Blue Dogs are being worn by all young teens" is repeated to emphasize a point without strengthening the argument itself. 

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - "Everyone is wearing" and "all young teens" implies a consensus without evidence. It presumes a broad consensus that may not exist.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - The term "everyone" and "all young teens" are ambiguities. "Everyone" is not defined, and "young teens" is broad and unclear.

Given the above analysis, the defective arguments in the statement are primarily:

- **Generalization (G)**: "Everyone is wearing" is too broad and unsupported.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: It assumes "all young teens" without specifying or legitimizing the scope.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The conclusion to "go out and buy" lacks strong reasoning.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assumes a consensus that hasn't been shown.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Uses vague terms like "everyone" and "all young teens."

Thus, the argument broadly commits errors that fit into Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Presumptuous Consensus, and Ambiguous Language.
