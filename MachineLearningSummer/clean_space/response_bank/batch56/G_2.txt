For 
The argument given is: 

"Even though it's only the first day, I can tell this is going to be a boring course."

Applying the defined defective argument types, this statement primarily appears to be:

<**G - Generalization**>: The speaker makes a broad conclusion about the entire course based on a single piece of evidence, the first day. This generalization may not be justified because it doesn't take into account future classes or changes in the course content and teaching style.

Thus, the statement is a defective argument of type <G>.
