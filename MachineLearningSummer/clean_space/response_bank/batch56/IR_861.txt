To apply the identification and classification of defective arguments (IDAA) to the given statement:

"I think that businesses should not have to limit the amount of pollutants they release into the atmosphere because Rush Limbaugh says that there is no real evidence for industrial pollutants causing the Greenhouse Effect."

Let's analyze the argument for any defective attributes defined:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   This argument does not necessarily make an unwarranted leap from a small sample to a broad conclusion, so it may not fit <G>.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   It does not involve listing examples and falsely claiming the list is complete enough to draw a conclusion. Thus, it doesn't fall under <FE>.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   The argument implies that the authority's claim is sufficient without critically assessing the evidence. This might mislead by over-relying on a superficial justification. However, the reasoning seems to be based more on the authority fallacy rather than its conclusiveness.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   This argument does suggest a potential lack of comprehensive causation analysis regarding pollutants and the Greenhouse Effect. It ignores broader scientific consensus and data.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   The argument doesn't seem to merely repeat a proposition to prove its truth, so it doesn't align with <RR>.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   The speaker relies heavily on Rush Limbaugh's assertion without recognizing a broader consensus or credible evidence. This displays a reliance on an unqualified or isolated opinion as if it represented general consent.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   The language seems clear in expressing a particular point of view based on the statement of a specific individual, thus it doesn't fit <DEP>.

Based on this analysis:
- **Primary Fit:** <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).
- **Secondary Fit:** <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).

Thus, the argument "I think that businesses should not have to limit the amount of pollutants they release into the atmosphere because Rush Limbaugh says that there is no real evidence for industrial pollutants causing the Greenhouse Effect." primarily demonstrates features of **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)** while partly reflecting **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
