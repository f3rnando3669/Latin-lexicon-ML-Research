Let's break down the task given:

1. **IDAA (Identify Defective Arguments Applied)** has to be applied to the statement: "Believing that 'runs' occur to statistically independent phenomena such as routine wheel spins."

To do this, we'll need to analyze the statement and see which defective argument types might be present based on the provided definitions.

2. **Generalization (G)**: This would involve making a broad conclusion based on limited evidence. We should check if the belief in the statement extends to all similar phenomena without sufficient data.

3. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Here, the argument might list cases selectively or incompletely, making a conclusion seem stronger than it actually is.

4. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This would mean the reason given isn't adequately supportive of the conclusion that 'runs' occur.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This addresses whether the statement lacks a solid basis for a causal relationship.

6. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This would involve repeating a assertion as evidence of itself without genuine support.

7. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This refers to assuming agreement without evidence that a consensus actually exists.

8. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This involves unclear or vague language that can lead to misinterpretation.

Applying the identification to the statement:

### Analysis:
**Statement**: "Believing that 'runs' occur to statistically independent phenomena such as routine wheel spins."

- **G**: The belief seems to generalize 'runs' to all statistically independent phenomena without specifying evidence, which implies a potential generalization.
- **FE**: The reference to "routine wheel spins" could suggest that it's picking one type of independent phenomenon without considering all possible types.
- **IR**: The statement does not provide reasoning or evidence for why 'runs' should happen.
- **WCB**: There is no explicit causal basis stated for why 'runs' would occur in statistically independent phenomena like wheel spins.
- **RR**: The statement doesn't seem to repeat itself, so this one might not apply.
- **FU**: The belief does not state that there's a consensus or that everyone knows this, so this might not apply.
- **DEP**: The term 'runs' might be considered ambiguous unless clearly defined.

### Conclusion:
Applying the defective arguments to the statement, we can identify the following:
- <G> (Generalization): The statement generalizes 'runs' across statistically independent phenomena without sufficient evidence.
- <IR> (Inconclusive Reason): It includes a belief without presenting concrete reasons.
- <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis): There is no clear causal link presented between statistically independent phenomena and runs.
- <DEP> (Ambiguous Language): The term 'runs' might be considered ambiguous unless more clearly defined.

Thus, the statement "Believing that 'runs' occur to statistically independent phenomena such as routine wheel spins" can be flagged for potential issues with the argument types: Generalization (G), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), and Ambiguous Language (DEP).
