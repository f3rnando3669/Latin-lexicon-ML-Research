For 
To apply the defective argument type <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument and Assign Type) to the argument "Famous actors like Alex Gonzaga and Philip Salvador support Oplan Tokhang, so it must be an effective operation," we would analyze the reasoning given and identify the specific type of defective argument it represents.

This argument is relying on the popularity or fame of certain individuals (Alex Gonzaga and Philip Salvador) rather than evaluating the actual effectiveness of Oplan Tokhang through valid criteria, evidence, or reasoning. This is an example of using an appeal to authority inappropriately because being a famous actor does not inherently grant someone expertise or reliable insight into the effectiveness of a law enforcement operation.

The appropriate defective argument type in this case is:

**<FU>: Presumptuous Consensus.** 

This includes the reliance on the opinions of people in positions of fame or authority to assume consensus or effectiveness without proper evidence or reasoning. Here, the argument presumes that because famous actors support Oplan Tokhang, it is therefore effective, which is a flawed and presumptuous form of reasoning.
