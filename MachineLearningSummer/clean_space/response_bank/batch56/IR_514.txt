It appears that you're referring to a process to identify defective arguments using different types of argumentation flaws. Let's break down the statement "Evolution is the idea that humans come from pond scum." and identify what defective arguments it may include.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Even though it touches on the broader concept of evolution, saying "humans come from pond scum" is an oversimplification and misrepresentation. It ignores the vast complexity of evolutionary theory, which includes numerous intermediate steps and species over millions of years.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement presents evolution in an overly simplistic manner, failing to enumerate the variety of processes and evidence supporting evolutionary theory. It disregards the fossil record, genetic evidence, and natural selection mechanism, which are all critical components of the theory.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The statement does not provide evidence or reasoning to support the claim. It merely asserts a simplified and misleading view without offering conclusions drawn from scientific data or reputable sources.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: By reducing evolution to "humans come from pond scum," the statement lacks sufficient causal explanation of how complex beings evolved from simpler organisms. It fails to address genetic variations, mutations, and natural selection which are key causal factors in evolution.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: If someone continually repeats this oversimplified notion without proper context or evidence, it would be a faulty repetition of a misleading proposition. However, without context of repetition, this might not apply strongly to a single statement.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This statement might suggest a presumptive consensus if presented as a fact accepted by all or as reducing the consensus of evolutionary theory to this misleading simplification. Yet, it usually emerges in discussions skewed to suggest that people broadly agree on this misguided definition.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The term "pond scum" is ambiguously used here and can be misleading about what evolutionary science actually posits. The use of non-scientific terminology obfuscates the detailed and nuanced understanding required to grasp evolutionary biology.

After reviewing the given types of argument flaws and the statement, it is clear that the statement "Evolution is the idea that humans come from pond scum," primarily falls under:

- Generalization (<G>)
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- Potentially Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)

This approach highlights the multiple layers of deceit or inaccuracy within the statement as it relates to portraying the scientific understanding of evolution.
