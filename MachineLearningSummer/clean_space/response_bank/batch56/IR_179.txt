For 
Applying <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Application) to the statement: 

"Joe is firm in his principles. The reader admires Joe for not changing his ideas and opinions according to what is popular or advantageous," we need to evaluate the argument to identify any defective reasoning. 

1. **Generalization (<G>)** - This would involve making a broad conclusion from a limited set of examples. In this case, if the statement had claimed something like "everyone who is firm in their principles is admirable," it would fit this category, but the statement doesn’t make such a broad generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** - This would be listing examples that don't cover all possibilities. The statement doesn’t list examples or incomplete parts that mislead the reader.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** - This involves drawing a conclusion that is not fully supported by the evidence presented. Here, the reader's admiration for Joe is presented as a result of Joe being firm in his principles. It seems like a conclusion is being drawn from an attribute (firmness in principles) without exploring if this firmness is genuinely admirable in every context or other contributing factors.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** - This involves attributing a causal relationship with insufficient evidence. If the statement claimed the reader's admiration was solely due to Joe's firmness with no other supporting information, it would fall under this. This appears to apply here as the causal relationship between Joe's firmness and the reader’s admiration is asserted without clear evidence that this is the only or primary reason.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)** - This occurs when a proposition is repeated without any evidence or argument to support it. There's no repetitive assertion of a proposition in the given statement.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)** - This involves assuming that a belief is shared by everyone. The statement mentions "the reader admires Joe," which doesn't necessarily presume a universal belief, but it could be presumptuous if it implies all readers.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)** - This involves using language that is vague or can be interpreted in multiple ways. "Firm in his principles" might be slightly ambiguous, but it is generally understood.

From this analysis:
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** and **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)** appear applicable. The conclusion about the reader’s admiration might not be sufficiently supported by just stating Joe is firm in his principles. There’s an implied cause-effect relationship without sufficient evidence.
- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)** might also be applicable if 'the reader’ implies all or most readers.

Therefore, the primary defective argument types in the statement "Joe is firm in his principles. The reader admires Joe for not changing his ideas and opinions according to what is popular or advantageous" could be identified as:
- **<IR>**: The conclusion is not fully supported by the evidence presented.
- **<WCB>**: The causal relationship is asserted without sufficient evidence.
- Possibly **<FU>** if the statement presumes consensus.
