For 
The statement "I know three redheads who have terrible tempers, and since Annabel has red hair, Iâ€™ll bet she has a terrible temper too." can be analyzed for defective arguments using the specified categories:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - The argument makes a broad generalization based on a very small sample size (three redheads). Inferring that all redheads have terrible tempers from knowing only three redheads is an example of hasty generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - The argument does not consider other possible reasons for why the three redheads might have terrible tempers. It also fails to enumerate examples of redheads who may not fit this stereotype.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The evidence provided (knowing three redheads with terrible tempers) is not strong enough to conclusively support the claim about Annabel's temper. There could be many other factors influencing an individual's temper that are not related to hair color.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - The argument implies a causal relationship between being a redhead and having a terrible temper without sufficient evidence. There is no logical basis to conclude that hair color causes temper issues.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - This argument does not necessarily involve the repetition of a proposition, so this category might not apply directly.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - The argument assumes that the temperamental nature of three individuals can be generalized to all individuals with similar hair color, without any broader consensus or evidence. It appeals presumptuously to an assumed consensus without justification.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - The term "terrible temper" could be considered ambiguous if not clearly defined, but in this context, it appears to be specific enough to understand the argument's intent.

Thus, the statement most clearly aligns with <G> (Generalization), <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration), <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis). The statement reflects faulty reasoning in these defective argument categories.
