To analyze the argument "Marriage has traditionally been between a man and a woman; therefore, gay marriage should not be allowed." using the defined defective argument types, we can identify several issues:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument relies on the historical definition of marriage as between a man and a woman, generalizing past practices to current norms without considering the evolution of societal values and legal interpretations.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement overlooks other types of relationships and marriages that have existed historically and in different cultures. It fails to account for the full range of human marital practices and the diversity of marital norms.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The premise "Marriage has traditionally been between a man and a woman" does not logically support the conclusion "therefore, gay marriage should not be allowed." Tradition alone is an insufficient reason to prohibit marriage equality, as it does not address moral, legal, or practical considerations.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument implies a causal link between tradition and the prohibition of gay marriage without establishing why tradition should be an authoritative basis for contemporary legal decisions.

5. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument assumes that the traditional view of marriage is universally accepted or should be accepted without considering dissenting or progressive viewpoints that support the inclusion of gay marriage.

6. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The term "traditionally" is vague and can be interpreted in various ways. The argument does not define how far back in history it is looking or which cultures it is considering, leading to potential ambiguities.

By applying these defective argument types, we can see that the argument has several flaws that undermine its validity and persuasiveness.
