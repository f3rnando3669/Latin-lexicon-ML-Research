Sure, let's identify and analyze the argument type for the statement: "Which type of logical fallacy is used when a writer incorrectly states that one event has caused another?"

The logical fallacy described in the statement is the "False Cause" fallacy, which is often referred to in formal logic as "Post hoc ergo propter hoc" (after this, therefore because of this). 

Now, let's see how this can fit into one of the defective argument types defined earlier:

1. **Generalization (G):** This is not a case of generalizing based on limited information.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This does not involve failing to adequately enumerate all relevant possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This could be argued as part of the issue since the reason provided is inconclusive, but it is more specific than that.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This matches well because the fallacy involves claiming a causal relationship without sufficient evidence.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This fallacy is not about repetitive assertion.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This is not about consensus or popularity.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** This does not primarily involve ambiguous or unclear language.

Based on the analysis, the type of defective argument described in the question is best categorized under **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

Therefore, the statement "Which type of logical fallacy is used when a writer incorrectly states that one event has caused another?" describes a fallacy that falls under the defective argument type **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
