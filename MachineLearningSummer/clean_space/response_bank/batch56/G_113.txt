Here's the analysis applying the list of defined defective arguments to "All of those who hate the Duterte administration are CPP-NPA supporters."

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - This statement is a sweeping assertion that implies a characteristic of a whole group based on a limited observation without sufficient evidence or exceptions. It generalizes that everyone who hates the Duterte administration must support the CPP-NPA, which is highly unlikely and unsubstantiated.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - The statement fails to consider the complexity and variety of reasons why people might dislike the Duterte administration. By not enumerating all possible reasons, it commits the fallacy of incomplete enumeration, suggesting that there are no other reasons besides being a CPP-NPA supporter.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The assertion lacks a sound premise and does not provide concrete evidence that hating the Duterte administration is causally linked to supporting the CPP-NPA. The reasoning is insufficient to support such a strong conclusion.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - There is no demonstrated causation or sufficient causal basis to claim that hating the Duterte administration directly leads to supporting the CPP-NPA. This links two unrelated concepts without proper justification.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - The statement does not explicitly contain repetition of a proposition. However, if this claim is repeatedly asserted without providing new evidence or reasoning, it may imply a faulty repetition fallacy over time.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - The statement presumes a shared consensus or a "common knowledge" that all detractors of the Duterte administration support the CPP-NPA, without evidence of such a majority consensus, thus committing the fallacy of presumptuous consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - There is some ambiguity in the terms "hate" and "supporter." It is unclear what threshold of opposition qualifies as "hating" and how support for CPP-NPA is defined. However, this might be less prominent compared to other fallacies at play.

**Summary of Applied Defective Arguments (IDAA)**:
- This argument is primarily a **Generalization (G)** as it makes a broad claim without sufficient evidence.
- It also suffers from **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, as it fails to consider all reasons for opposition, lacks a sound premise, and does not establish causation.
- Additionally, there is a component of **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** by implying a shared belief without substantiation.
- Ambiguous Language (DEP)** may apply to a lesser extent due to the vague terms used in the statement.
