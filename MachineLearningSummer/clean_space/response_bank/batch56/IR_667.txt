The argument presented can be classified as a defective argument type called Generalization (<G>).

Here's the reasoning:

- The statement "all kids love Cinnamon Toast Crunch" is an overgeneralization. It assumes a universal truth based on an unsubstantiated premise that may not apply to all individuals within the group.
- The conclusion drawn, "you must not be a real kid," is based on this overgeneralization and relies on the erroneous assumption that the attribute (loving Cinnamon Toast Crunch) must apply to all members of the category (kids).

Therefore, the fallacy can be identified as a Generalization <G>.
