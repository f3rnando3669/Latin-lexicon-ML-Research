For 
This appears to be a request to identify the type of defective argument used in a given statement or situation. 

"<IDAA>" isn't defined within the context of the defective types listed. However, I assume "<IDAA>" is intended to represent the action 'Identify Defective Argument Applied'. 

Given the prompt, letâ€™s identify the type of defective argument based on an example:

Let's use an example statement: "All politicians are corrupt because I've heard about several corruption scandals involving politicians."

"This is an example of which fallacy?"

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument type applies because it makes a broad, generalized statement about all politicians based on a limited number of incidents. It extrapolates specific cases to a general rule without sufficient evidence to support the universality of the claim.

Therefore, the statement "All politicians are corrupt because I've heard about several corruption scandals involving politicians" exemplifies the fallacy of Generalization (<G>).
