The argument type given in the example by Billy and Bobby can be identified using the following defective argument types definitions:

- Billy makes a claim: "An apple is a vegetable."
- Bobby responds: "Don't listen to Billy; he failed Spanish class last year."

To identify which defective argument type applies here, let's analyze the components:

1. Bobby does not directly address the truth or falsity of Billy's claim about apples being vegetables. Instead, Bobby attacks Billy's character or credibility by mentioning his failure in Spanish class.

Given this information, we can identify Bobby's response as a defective argument type known as "Ad Hominem." While this type was not explicitly listed among the defective argument types provided, it is a well-known logical fallacy where a person's character or circumstances are attacked instead of addressing the argument or issue at hand.

Thus, the argument in question represents an Ad Hominem fallacy. While it doesn't directly match any of the given defective argument types like Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Presumptuous Consensus, or Ambiguous Language, it is still an example of a defective argument, specifically under the category of Ad Hominem.
