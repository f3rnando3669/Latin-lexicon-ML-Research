For 
"I love my new Samsung Galaxy phone from Verizon! Everyone else who has bought it loves it too."

In this scenario, the argument employed by Verizon can be categorized as follows:

<FU> - Presumptuous Consensus

Presumptuous Consensus (FU) occurs when an argument claims that a conclusion is valid or a product is desirable because "everyone else" supports it or has had a positive experience with it. This type of argument assumes that because a certain group of people (in this case, other buyers) holds a favorable opinion, the same must be true universally, without providing substantive evidence or considering potential biases.

Therefore, the statement made by Verizon, "everyone else who has bought it loves the new product," fits under the defective argument type <FU> Presumptuous Consensus.
