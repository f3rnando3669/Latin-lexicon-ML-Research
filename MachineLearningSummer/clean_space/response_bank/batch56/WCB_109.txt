Certainly! To analyze the argument "Jimmy isn't at school today. He must be on a family trip." using the defective argument types defined, we need to identify any reasoning flaws it might have. 

Let's break down the argument and see which defective argument types may apply:

1. **Generalization (G)**: Making a broad statement based on limited evidence. In this case, this doesn't directly apply unless the speaker assumes that being absent from school generally means a family trip.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Failing to consider all possible alternatives. This does apply here since the conclusion that Jimmy "must be on a family trip" ignores other possibilities (e.g., he could be sick, at an appointment, or having a personal day). 

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The premises do not sufficiently support the conclusion. This can also apply as knowing Jimmy isn't at school doesn't inherently lead to the conclusion that he is on a family trip without additional supporting evidence.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is no sufficient causal link between the premises and the conclusion. This would apply if the conclusion implied a definite cause (e.g., a family trip) for the observation (Jimmy not being at school) without sufficient evidence to establish that specific cause.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Repeating the same proposition in different ways without adding new information or support. This doesn't appear relevant here since the argument does not repeat the premise.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assuming that a consensus or common belief supports the claim, without actual evidence. This doesn't apply since the argument does not rely on any supposed consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Using vague or ambiguous terms that cause confusion. There is no ambiguous language in the argument that would make it unclear or difficult to understand.

Based on these definitions, the argument "Jimmy isn't at school today. He must be on a family trip." can be primarily identified as an **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** and an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** type of defective argument. It potentially also has elements of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** if presumed causation is considered.

So we would mark this argument as:

**(FE, IR, WCB)**
