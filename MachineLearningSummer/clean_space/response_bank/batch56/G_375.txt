For 
<IDAA> stands for "Identify, Define, Analyze, and Apply." Let's use this method on the given statement: "Atheists are morally bankrupt."

### Identify
First, we identify the statement and examine it for the presence of a possible defective argument.

**Statement**: "Atheists are morally bankrupt."

### Define
Next, let's define the various types of defective arguments we have:

1. **Generalization (G)**: Making a broad statement based on a limited number of observations.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Listing an insufficient number of cases to support a generalization.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Providing a weak justification that doesn't support the argument.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Asserting a cause-and-effect relationship without enough evidence.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Repeating a claim without substantiating it.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assuming something is true because many people believe it to be true.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Using unclear or vague language that can be interpreted in multiple ways.

### Analyze
We analyze the statement to see which of these defective arguments apply.

1. **Generalization (G)**: The statement makes a broad claim about all atheists based on, presumably, a limited number of observations or prejudices.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement doesn't provide any specific cases or evidence to support the claim.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: No reason is given to back up the claim of moral bankruptcy.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The statement implies a causal relationship between atheism and moral bankruptcy without sufficient evidence.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: If this claim were to be repeated without evidence, it would be an example of this fallacy.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: If the speaker assumes everyone agrees without evidence, but this is not directly implied in the statement.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The term "morally bankrupt" is quite subjective and vague, leading to different interpretations.

### Apply
Applying these defective arguments to the statement:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This is clearly a broad and unfounded generalization about atheists.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** and **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The statement provides no specific evidence or reasoning, just a blanket assertion.
3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: It implies a correlation between atheism and lack of morals without evidence.
4. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The phrase "morally bankrupt" is quite vague and can be interpreted in various ways.

### Conclusion
The statement "Atheists are morally bankrupt" is primarily defective due to:

1. **Generalization (G)**: It makes a broad and unsupported claim about all atheists.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** and **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: It fails to provide any evidence or reasoning.
3. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: It uses vague language open to multiple interpretations.

Overall, the statement is a clear example of several defective argument types leading to an unsupported and prejudiced claim.
