Understood. Here's the application of the <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Analysis):

1. **Claim**: "Lesbianism is rampant in the Oklahoma schools."
   
2. **Supporting Reason**: "This must, indeed, be true, because surely the senator couldn't be mistaken about the schools in his own state."

Now let's identify and apply the defective argument types to this claim and the supporting reason:

- **Generalization (G)**: The claim broadly generalizes the situation in all Oklahoma schools without specific evidence or detailed investigation. This could unfairly label the whole school system based on anecdotal or incomplete information.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not provide a comprehensive list of evidence or instances to substantiate the claim. It merely relies on the authority of the senator without enumerating facts or data.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument assumes the claim must be true solely based on the senator's authority, which is not a conclusive reason. It fails to provide direct evidence or logical reasoning that ties the senator's assertion to the actual situation.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The statement lacks a causal explanation for why lesbianism would be "rampant" specifically in Oklahoma schools, failing to identify a clear cause-and-effect relationship.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The argument does not directly show repetition, but it rests on the idea that simply stating the senatorâ€™s authority repetitively could validate the claim, which is a form of reasoning based on repetition rather than evidence.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument relies on an implied consensus because it assumes that the senator, as an authoritative figure, has an unchallenged, widely accepted view which must be correct. This presumes broad agreement without substantiating it.

- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The term "rampant" is highly ambiguous and subjective. It could mean different levels of prevalence to different people, thereby creating ambiguity in understanding the true extent of the situation.

In conclusion, the argument "U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn says that lesbianism is rampant in the Oklahoma schools. This must, indeed, be true, because surely the senator couldn't be mistaken about the schools in his own state." is defective due to the following identified types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.
