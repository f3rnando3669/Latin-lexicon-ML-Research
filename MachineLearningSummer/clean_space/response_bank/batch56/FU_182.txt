For 
IDAA stands for Identifying Defective Argument Attribution. Let's apply it to the given statement.

Statement: "A 2005 Gallup Poll found that an estimated 25% of Americans over the age of 18 believe in astrologyâ€”or that the position of the stars and planets can affect people's lives. That is roughly 75,000,000 people. Therefore, there must be some truth to astrology!"

Here, the argument seems to rely on the belief of a large number of people to substantiate the truth claim about astrology. The defective argument types defined earlier provide us with a framework to identify the nature of the defect in the argument:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument type involves making broad assumptions based on limited evidence, but here the issue is not about making a broad assumption from few examples.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This argument type involves using a limited set of data points to draw a conclusion that requires considering all possibilities. This does not quite align with the given argument.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This relates to drawing conclusions that do not follow necessarily from the premises. Though there is a disconnect, it is specifically rooted in the appeal to popularity, not just any generic disconnect.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This type involves claiming a causal relationship without sufficient evidence to support it. While belief in astrology is mentioned, the author does not specifically establish a causal claim here.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This involves repeating a premise or conclusion as if it provides conclusive evidence. Repetition is not the core issue here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This argument type involves assuming that widespread belief is equivalent to truth. This fits the argument at hand, as the conclusion relies on the number of people believing in astrology to argue its truthfulness.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This involves using language that is open to multiple interpretations, which does not appear to be the main issue here.

The correct defective argument type for the given statement is:

**Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**

Thus, the statement relies on the flawed reasoning that the consensus or belief of a large group of people indicates the truthfulness of astrology.
