For 
To identify the defective argument type in the statement "Lahat nakamove-on na ikaw na lang hindi pa. #MarcosIsAHero," we should analyze the argument being made and see which defined defective argument type best fits.

The statement seems to imply that because everyone else has moved on, the listener should also move on, suggesting a consensus (that everyone else has already accepted something). It uses peer pressure or appeal to popularity to make a point rather than presenting a sound argument based on evidence or reason.

The defective argument type that best applies here is:

<FU> Presumptuous Consensus.

The statement assumes that because a majority has allegedly "moved on," the listener should too, without addressing the underlying issues or arguments at hand.
