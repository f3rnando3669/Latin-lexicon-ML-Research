For 
<IR> Inconclusive Reason: This argument is an inconclusive reason because the existence of ghosts is being asserted based on the testimony of a single individual, regardless of their reliability. The argument does not provide sufficient evidence or a rigorous examination of the claim, but rather relies on an anecdotal account.

This categorization falls under **Inconclusive Reason** because it provides reasoning that is not independently verifiable or substantial enough to conclusively support the existence of ghosts.
