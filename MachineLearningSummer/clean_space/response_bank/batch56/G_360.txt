For 
To apply the concept of Identifying Defective Argument Application (<IDAA>) to the statement "President Obama’s decision to arm Syrian rebels, however meagerly, has all but doomed us to an Iraq-style debacle," we would need to evaluate whether the argument falls into any of the defective argument types defined.

1. **Generalization (G)**
   - The statement seems to generalize the outcome of a specific decision (arming Syrian rebels) to a broad consequence (being "doomed to an Iraq-style debacle"). To determine if this is truly a Generalization, we need to assess whether sufficient evidence or representative examples support the claim. If not, it could be seen as overly broad or hasty generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (IE)**
   - The argument may ignore other possible outcomes of arming Syrian rebels, only considering one negative scenario. This would fit the definition of Incomplete Enumeration if it excludes other potential results or relevant factors.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
   - The reasoning may not necessarily lead to the stated conclusion. If the evidence or logic is weak in establishing a direct causal link between arming Syrian rebels and an "Iraq-style debacle," this would be a case of an Inconclusive Reason.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
   - The statement attributes a specific outcome (an Iraq-style debacle) to a single policy decision without thoroughly establishing a strong causal link. If the causal connection lacks sufficient evidence or is based on assumptions rather than concrete proof, it qualifies as Insufficient Causal Basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition may occur if the argument is reiterated elsewhere without new supporting evidence. However, in this single instance, it doesn't seem to rely on mere repetition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
   - If the argument assumes or implies widespread agreement (that the decision "has all but doomed us") without substantiating that consensus exists, it fits the category of Presumptuous Consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**
   - The term "an Iraq-style debacle" could be considered ambiguous, as it might have different interpretations. If it isn’t clearly defined what aspects of the Iraq conflict are being referenced, it could fall under Ambiguous Language.

Based on these considerations, the defective argument types that seem most relevant here are:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (IE)**
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**

Therefore, the application of <IDAA> to the given statement may lead us to identify it as suffering from insufficient causal basis, incomplete enumeration, and ambiguous language.
