For 
To apply the Identifying Defective Argument Application (IDAA) process to the statement "My uncle eats pizza and cake and he is thin. Pizza and cake aren’t the cause of obesity.", we need to analyze the argument and identify which defective argument types it might fall under. Here are the potential candidates based on your defined defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Making a broad statement based on a single example.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Drawing a conclusion based on an incomplete consideration of relevant cases.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Providing reasons that are not strong enough to support the conclusion.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Claiming a causal relationship without adequate evidence.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Repeating a statement multiple times without further substantiation.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Assuming consensus or agreement without adequate verification.
7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: Using language that is not clear and can be interpreted in multiple ways.

Let's examine the statement closely:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement is generalizing that because one person (the uncle) eats pizza and cake and is thin, pizza and cake are not the cause of obesity for everyone. This is a classic case of a broad statement based on a single example.

2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument assumes a causal relationship between eating pizza and cake and not being obese based on one example (the uncle). This lacks sufficient evidence to establish a general causal relationship.

Based on this analysis, the specific defective argument types that apply to this statement are:

- **Generalization (<G>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**

Therefore, the statement "My uncle eats pizza and cake and he is thin. Pizza and cake aren’t the cause of obesity." is an example of <G> Generalization and <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis.
