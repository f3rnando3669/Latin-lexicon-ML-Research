The argument given can be analyzed and categorized according to the defined defective argument types. The statement:

"All those opposed to my arguments for the opening of a new department, signify by saying, ‘I quit.’"

Can be analyzed as follows:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument does not appear to be an example of generalization because it does not generalize from a sample to a whole population.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This is partly relevant because the argument presents a limited and misleading choice—either support the new department or quit—but it does not exhaustively enumerate all legitimate options, such as voicing opposition or suggesting alternatives.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument might not fit this category perfectly because rather than having inconclusive reasons, it offers a conclusively flawed dichotomy.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This argument does not attempt to establish a causal relationship, so this type is not applicable.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This argument does not rely on simply repeating a proposition in a faulty manner.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This is highly relevant as the argument presumes a consensus by equating opposition to outright quitting. It manipulates the situation to make it appear as though support is unanimous unless people quit.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language used here is not particularly ambiguous, but rather manipulative and coercive.

Based on the definitions provided, the most fitting defective argument type for the given statement is **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**. The argument essentially pressures the audience to either silently agree or face an extreme consequence (quitting), presuming that there will be no opposition by way of forced consensus.
