For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Attributes and involves analyzing a given statement for potential logical fallacies or defective argument types. Let's apply <IDAA> to the statement:

"Thousands of pets are left homeless and hungry because lousy people turn them out on the streets instead of taking care of them."

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - The term "lousy people" is a generalization. It assumes all people who abandon pets are inherently "lousy." This is a broad and judgmental statement that does not account for specific circumstances or reasons.
  
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - The statement identifies "lousy people" as the sole cause of pets being left homeless. This ignores other potential factors, such as financial hardship, housing issues, or lack of knowledge about pet care that may contribute to the issue.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - The causation in the statement "because lousy people turn them out on the streets" lacks depth and conclusiveness. It oversimplifies the complex issue of why pets are abandoned and does not provide a comprehensive explanation.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - The statement does not offer sufficient evidence to support the causation that "lousy people" alone are responsible for pets being left homeless and hungry. It fails to address the broader context and contributing factors.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - This defective argument type does not specifically apply to the given statement, as there is no repetition of the proposition within it.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - The statement implies a consensus that "lousy people" are the problem without providing evidence that this view is widely accepted or justified. It presumes agreement and fails to justify it.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - The term "lousy people" is ambiguous and not clearly defined. It is subjective and open to interpretation, making the argument less clear and more vulnerable to misinterpretation.

In summary, the statement "Thousands of pets are left homeless and hungry because lousy people turn them out on the streets instead of taking care of them." exhibits several defective argument attributes: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.
