For 
<IDAA> refers to Identified Defective Argument Analysis, which is a method of analyzing and identifying defective argument types within a given statement.

The statement "If we are too scared to open the economy completely, then we'll have to keep it closed forever." could contain the following defective argument types:

1. **False Dichotomy/False Dilemma (FD)**: This is not from the list you've provided but is relevant here. The statement presents only two extreme options (completely opening the economy vs. keeping it closed forever), ignoring other possible solutions or intermediate steps.
   - **False Dichotomy**: The conclusion that we'll have to keep the economy closed forever if we don't open it completely is not necessarily true. There are other alternatives, such as opening the economy gradually or implementing safety measures to reopen partially.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning behind the conclusion is not sufficiently backed up by evidence.
   - **IR**: The statement presumes that being "too scared" directly leads to having to keep the economy closed forever without providing a solid causal link. There could be multiple factors and reasons at play that influence economic decisions.

In summary, the argument presented in the statement could be diagnosed primarily with a False Dichotomy (FD), an additional relevant identification beyond the provided list of defective argument types, and an Inconclusive Reason (IR).
