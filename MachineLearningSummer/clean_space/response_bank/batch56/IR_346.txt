<The example provided can be classified as a defective argument type.>

The fallacy in the example "By rejecting God, you are rejecting goodness, kindness, and love itself" is best understood as a form of Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>).

**Explanation:**

### Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):
- **Characteristic:** This fallacy occurs when an argument presents an insufficient list of possibilities, leading to a misleading or incorrect conclusion.
- **In this Example:** The argument suggests that rejecting God inherently means rejecting all positive moral qualities (goodness, kindness, love) without considering other potential sources of these qualities or other possibilities that might explain someone's rejection of God. It presents a false dichotomy where one either believes in God (and thus adheres to goodness, kindness, and love) or rejects God and, consequently, rejects these virtues, which is an incomplete and reductionist view.
  
The argument overlooks the complex spectrum of moral beliefs and values that can exist independently of religious faith, thus falling into the category of <FE>: Incomplete Enumeration.
