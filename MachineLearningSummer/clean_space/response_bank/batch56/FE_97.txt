First, let's break down the argument presented:

Statement: "Cassie has no school spirit—she never comes to any of our football games."
Type of Defective Argument: Guilt by Association

To apply <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument and Analysis):

1. **Identify the Argument**:
   - The claim being made is that Cassie lacks school spirit.
   - The reasoning provided is that Cassie never attends any football games.

2. **Defective Argument Type**:
   - The argument is a form of **guilt by association** because it assumes that not attending football games equates to having no school spirit.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The logic here is flawed as it inappropriately generalizes about Cassie’s school spirit based on a single criterion—attendance at football games.
   - This generalization ignores other forms of demonstrating school spirit such as participating in other school events, wearing school colors, or supporting school activities in different ways.
   - The argument also implies a narrow and insufficient causal basis (concept <WCB>) by suggesting that football game attendance is the only or primary indicator of school spirit.

Here is the application of <IDAA> to the argument:

1. **(I)** Identify: "Cassie has no school spirit—she never comes to any of our football games."
2. **(D)** Defective Argument Type: Guilt by association, as it seeks to discredit Cassie’s school spirit based on her lack of attendance at football games.
3. **(A)** Analysis:
   - Generalization (G): The argument generalizes Cassie's total level of school spirit based on a single behavior.
   - Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB): It establishes an insufficient causal relationship by linking school spirit solely to football game attendance.
4. **(A)** Conclusion: The argument is defective because it makes an unwarranted generalization and presumes an insufficient causal basis for determining school spirit. It unfairly associates a lack of attendance at football games with a lack of school spirit, which may not encompass all dimensions of being supportive of the school.
