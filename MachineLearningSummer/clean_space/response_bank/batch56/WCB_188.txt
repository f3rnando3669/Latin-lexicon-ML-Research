To analyze the given argument "People who eat yogurt have healthy guts. If I eat yogurt I will never get sick." using the definitions provided, you would identify the defective argument types (D-Type(s)) present. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement "People who eat yogurt have healthy guts" is an overly broad generalization. Not all people who eat yogurt necessarily have healthy guts, as gut health depends on a variety of factors.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not enumerate all possible factors affecting health. Assuming that eating yogurt alone will prevent sickness is an incomplete consideration of all health determinants.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The argument "If I eat yogurt I will never get sick" is inconclusive because the premise ("People who eat yogurt have healthy guts") does not logically guarantee the conclusion (never getting sick). There are many other potential causes of illness unrelated to gut health.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument implies a causal connection between eating yogurt and never getting sick without sufficient evidence. Simply having a healthy gut does not prevent all forms of sickness.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This defective argument type isn't directly evidenced in the given argument, as there's no repeated proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument presumes general consensus that eating yogurt leads to overall health and prevention of sickness without presenting robust evidence or acknowledging differing opinions.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The phrase "healthy guts" could be considered ambiguous. It is not well-defined and could be interpreted in various ways, making the argument less clear and more disputable.

In conclusion, the argument contains several defective argument types:

- **<G>**: Generalization
- **<FE>**: Incomplete Enumeration
- **<IR>**: Inconclusive Reason
- **<WCB>**: Insufficient Causal Basis
- **<FU>**: Presumptuous Consensus
- **<DEP>**: Ambiguous Language

Thus, the argument "People who eat yogurt have healthy guts. If I eat yogurt I will never get sick." exhibits multiple logical flaws and should be critically evaluated before drawing any conclusions.
