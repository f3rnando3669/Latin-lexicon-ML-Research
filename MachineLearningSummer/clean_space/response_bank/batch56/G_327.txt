For 
The argument "War on drugs instills fear to criminals so it can stop the crimes in the Philippines." can be evaluated by identifying any defective argument types as defined:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: 
   - This occurs when a broad conclusion is drawn from a small sample.
   - This argument does not seem to fall under generalization because it does not provide a specific small set of instances to generalize from.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: 
   - This occurs when not all possible causes or scenarios are considered.
   - The argument assumes that instilling fear is an effective means to stop crime, but it does not consider other potential factors that could contribute to crime or other methods of social control.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: 
   - This means the reason provided is not sufficient to support the conclusion logically.
   - The argument might fall into this category because assuming fear directly stops crimes is an oversimplification. Historical and sociological evidence would be needed to conclusively support this claim.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: 
   - This occurs when the causal link between the supposed cause (fear from the war on drugs) and the effect (stopping crime) is not well-established or justified.
   - This argument can be classified under this defective type because there is an assumption that fear alone can control crime rates, without considering other underlying factors.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: 
   - This occurs when a proposition is repeatedly presented as true without adequate evidence or elaboration.
   - In this instance, the argument does not seem to involve repeating the same proposition multiple times.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: 
   - This occurs when an argument assumes a consensus without providing evidence for such a consensus.
   - There isn't a presumption of consensus in this argument about the war on drugs within the statement provided.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - This occurs when the argument relies on vague or ambiguous terms.
   - The terms "fear" and "stop the crimes" could be considered ambiguous, as "fear" is subjective and "stop the crimes" is not clearly defined in terms of specific metrics or long-term impact.

Based on this analysis, the primary defective argument types applicable to "War on drugs instills fear to criminals so it can stop the crimes in the Philippines." are:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**

These notations indicate that the argument fails to fully consider alternate methods and factors (FE), does not provide sufficient logical support (IR), lacks a well-established causal basis (WCB), and uses terms that can be seen as vague (DEP).
