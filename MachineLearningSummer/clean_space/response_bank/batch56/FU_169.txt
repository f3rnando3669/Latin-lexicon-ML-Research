To analyze and identify any potential defective arguments in the statement "I guess I should buy my 12-year-old daughter an iPhone. Everyone at her new school has one and I want her to fit in with the other kids." using the defined defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: There seems to be a generalization that "Everyone at her new school has one." This could be an exaggeration, as it's unlikely that every single student has an iPhone.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement does not provide enough evidence or consider other potential alternatives or nuances. It assumes that fitting in can only be achieved by owning an iPhone, without considering other factors or potential counterexamples.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning that buying an iPhone will ensure the daughter fits in is not necessarily conclusive. There might be many other factors that determine whether she fits in or not.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There's an assumption of causation—that owning an iPhone causes one to fit in. However, the relationship between having an iPhone and fitting in hasn't been sufficiently demonstrated or proven.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This isn't explicitly present in the statement, though the idea could be repeatedly asserted without additional justification in a related discussion.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The statement presumes a consensus without evidence: "Everyone at her new school has one," implying a need to conform without proof of an actual consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The phrase "fit in" is somewhat ambiguous and subjective. It could mean different things to different people and the specific criteria for fitting in aren’t clearly defined.

Thus, the statement mainly includes **Generalization (G)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, and **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**. 

The revised IDAA (Identification, Description, Analysis, and Advice) analysis goes as follows:

- **Identification**: The argument's main claims are the necessity of purchasing an iPhone for the child to fit in at her new school.
- **Description**: Several defective argument types are identified:
    - Generalization (G): "Everyone at her new school has one."
    - Incomplete Enumeration (FE): Assuming a single solution.
    - Inconclusive Reason (IR): Owning an iPhone guarantees fitting in.
    - Presumptuous Consensus (FU): Unsubstantiated consensus claim.
- **Analysis**: These defective arguments weaken the justification for buying the iPhone. Overgeneralization, failure to consider alternatives, and unsupported assumptions about causation and consensus cast doubt on the necessity and effectiveness of the action.
- **Advice**: Reevaluate the decision by gathering more accurate information about the actual needs and the school's environment. Consider other factors that affect fitting in and discuss alternatives with the daughter to ensure a decision is made based on well-rounded reasoning.
