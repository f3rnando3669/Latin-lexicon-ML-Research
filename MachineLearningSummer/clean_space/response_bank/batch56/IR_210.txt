Sure, in this analysis, I will identify, define, analyze, and conclude the type of defective argument in the given statement.

1. **Identify**:
   - Statement: "My opponent raises a good point, but can we really trust him? I mean, he moved to this town only two years ago, and everyone knows that his wife left him."

2. **Define**:
   - This argument seems to rely on suggesting distrust based on irrelevant personal information (the fact that the opponent is relatively new in town and personal circumstances with his wife). 

3. **Analyze**:
   - The argument here distracts from the validity of the opponent's point and instead attacks the opponent's character and situation, which have no bearing on the actual argument at hand. 
   - The fallacy in this argument is known as an "ad hominem" attack, where the focus is shifted to irrelevant personal matters rather than addressing the point made.
   - This can align with a broader category of **Generalization (G)**, where irrelevant general characteristics (moving recently and the personal situation) are used to discredit the opponent's argument.
   - It also has elements of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** since the reasons provided (being new in town, wife's leaving) have no direct or logical connection to whether the opponent's argument is valid or trustworthy.

4. **Conclude**:
   - The predominant defective argument type in this statement is an **ad hominem** attack. While it can be specifically aligned with our defective argument types, it primarily falls under **Generalization (G)** because it uses nonspecific attributes to undermine credibility, and **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because it provides reasons that do not logically determine the trustworthiness or validity of the point being raised.

Thus, the statement "My opponent raises a good point, but can we really trust him? I mean, he moved to this town only two years ago, and everyone knows that his wife left him." employs **Generalization (G)** and **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** as defective argument types.
