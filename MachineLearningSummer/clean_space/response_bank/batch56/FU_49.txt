Certainly! "IDAA" seems to be an identifier or code you would like to apply to the defective argument in the provided statement. Let's analyze the given statement to identify which type of defective argument it corresponds to, based on the definitions provided:

### Argument:
"In this election, we've seen the highest voter turnout ever recorded. If you have any doubts about Tyler Espinoza's qualifications, just look at how many people have come out to vote for him."

### Analysis:
This argument suggests that the high voter turnout is evidence of Tyler Espinoza's qualifications. However, high voter turnout alone does not directly correlate with or validate the qualifications of a particular candidate. There could be many reasons for high voter turnout, such as a contentious election, general civic engagement, or other highly motivating factors unrelated to the candidate's qualifications.

### Defective Argument:
Given the definitions, the argument seems to closely align with the type "WCB" (Insufficient Causal Basis), because the causal link between high voter turnout and the qualifications of Tyler Espinoza is insufficiently justified. The argument does not effectively demonstrate that voter turnout is a valid measure of the candidate's qualifications.

So, the statement falls under the defective argument type **"<WCB>" (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.

### Applied Label:
<IDAA:WCB>
