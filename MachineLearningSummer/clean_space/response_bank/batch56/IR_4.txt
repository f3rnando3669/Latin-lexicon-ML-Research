Sure! First, let’s break down the statement:

"He just says that because he's a Republican."

To identify and apply the appropriate defective argument type from the given list, we need to analyze the logical flaw in the statement. The statement seems to suggest that the person's opinion is invalid simply because of their political affiliation, rather than addressing the content or merit of what they are saying.

This is a form of **ad hominem** argument where the person, rather than their argument, is being attacked. However, within the given definitions of defective arguments, this closely matches the following:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument relies on a reason that in itself doesn’t sufficiently support the conclusion.

In this case, the reason provided ("he's a Republican") does not sufficiently address or refute the content of what "he" said. It diverts away from the argument itself and thus acts as an inconclusive reason.

So, applying the predefined defective argument types, the statement "He just says that because he's a Republican" is an example of <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
