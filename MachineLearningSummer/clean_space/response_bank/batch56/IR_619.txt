The argument "Have you stopped cheating on tests? To answer yes means you cheated before. To answer no means you continue to cheat." can be identified as the defective argument type <IDAA>, where <IDAA> stands for Loaded Question or Complex Question Fallacy. 

In a Loaded Question, the question is structured in such a way that it contains an implicit assumption which traps the respondent into an admission of guilt or wrongdoing, regardless of the answer they provide.

Here's a breakdown of why this applies:

- **Loaded Question:** The question "Have you stopped cheating on tests?" presupposes that the respondent has cheated on tests in the past. It forces the person responding to admit to cheating either in the past or currently, without providing an option to deny it altogether.

Therefore, <IDAA> aptly applies to the given statement.
