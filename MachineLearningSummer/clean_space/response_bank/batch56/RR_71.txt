For 
To address the argument "Why should we put people on trial when we know they are guilty?" using the defective argument analysis approach \(<IDAA>\):

1. **Identify the Claim:**
   The implied claim here is that putting people on trial is unnecessary if their guilt is already known.

2. **Define the Argument Type:**
   This argument can be broken down based on its characteristics:

   - **Generalization \(<G>\)**: The argument assumes that because we "know" some people are guilty, this holds true universally without acknowledging the variability and complexity of individual cases.
   
   - **Incomplete Enumeration \(<FE>\)**: It fails to consider all circumstances and reasons for having trials, such as the need to ensure fairness, the protection of rights, and the role of trials in upholding justice and legal processes.
   
   - **Inconclusive Reason \(<IR>\)**: Asserts without sufficient reasoning that trials are unnecessary since "we know they are guilty," without addressing how this knowledge is established or the importance of due process.
   
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis \(<WCB>\)**: It assumes a direct cause-effect relationship between knowing guilt and the redundancy of trials without providing sufficient evidence or justification for this causation.
   
   - **Presumptuous Consensus \(<FU>\)**: The argument might be presuming a consensus on what constitutes undeniable guilt and the methods of determining it, which isn’t universally agreed upon.
   
3. **Analyze the Argument’s Defects:**
   - **Generalization**: This argument overly generalizes a complex legal and ethical issue. Guilt can only be determined through a fair and thorough trial process that accounts for all evidence and circumstances.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration**: Trials serve multiple purposes, including safeguarding human rights, ensuring justice is served correctly, and maintaining public trust in the legal system.
   - **Inconclusive Reason**: The reasoning provided is insufficient to conclude the redundancy of trials. Knowing guilt outside of the trial process is subjective and lacks the rigorous examination a trial provides.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis**: There’s no solid evidence provided to justify that knowing someone's guilt outside of trial procedures renders the trial process unnecessary.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus**: Assumes that everyone agrees on what constitutes knowing guilt and disregards the importance of legal due process.

4. **Address the Argument:**
   Legal systems mandate trials to ensure justice is applied fairly and objectively. Even if there is an assumption of guilt, due process must be followed to verify the evidence, interpret the law correctly, and protect the rights of the accused. Trials are fundamental to democracy and justice, preventing the conviction of individuals based solely on assumptions or potentially flawed evidence.<br><br>
    
This systematic examination reveals how the original claim fails to consider essential aspects of justice and legal integrity, underscoring the need for thorough and fair trial proceedings.
