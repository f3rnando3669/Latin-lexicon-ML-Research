Applying the Identifying Defective Argument Types Analysis (<IDAA>) to the statement:

"Joan is scratched by a cat while visiting her friend. Two days later she comes down with a fever. Joan concludes that the cat's scratch must be the cause of her illness."

Let's break down the argument to determine if it fits any of the defective argument types defined:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This type would involve drawing a broad conclusion from a small number of incidents. In Joan's case, she does conclude based on a single event (her own experience), but her conclusion is specific to her situation rather than a generalization to all similar cases.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This involves listing some causes or pieces of evidence but not considering all possibilities. Joan is assuming a causal relationship between the scratch and the fever without taking into account other potential causes of her illness.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This occurs when the reasoning given does not conclusively support the conclusion. Joan's reasoning that the scratch caused the fever is inconclusive because there could be many other contributing factors to her fever.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This means there is not enough evidence to establish a causal link. Joan lacks sufficient evidence to prove that the cat scratch caused her fever, as many factors could lead to a fever, and not all scratches result in illness.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This involves repeating a claim without additional evidence or support. This is not applicable here since Joan does not repeat her conclusion; she simply states it once.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This is assuming agreement or consensus where none is indicated. Joan's argument does not rely on any presumed consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This occurs when ambiguous or unclear language is used. Joan's language seems clear and specific about her experience.

Based on the analysis, the most fitting defective argument type for Joan's conclusion is:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Joan's conclusion that the cat scratch caused her fever is made without sufficient evidence to establish a clear causal link.

There is also a strong element of **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** since Joan fails to consider other possible causes for her fever. 

Thus, the argument suffers from **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** and **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**.
