For 
Let's identify and address the defective arguments in the statement "A is true because B is true, and B is true because C is true, and C is true because A is true."

The argument type here involves a circular reasoning where each proposition supports the next in a loop, ultimately leading back to the original proposition. Here is the analysis:

1. "A is true because B is true": This statement proposes that the truth of A is dependent on the truth of B.
2. "B is true because C is true": This statement proposes that the truth of B is dependent on the truth of C.
3. "C is true because A is true": This statement proposes that the truth of C is dependent on the truth of A.

To apply the defective argument types (IDAA), we analyze the logical structure:

1. **Generalization (G)**: The argument does not generalize from specific instances, so this type is not applicable.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not fail by omitting required cases, so this type is not applicable.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument could be considered inconclusive because it does not provide independent verification or evidence for any of the propositions. However, this specific type does not quite capture the core issue.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is an insufficient causal basis, but the fundamental problem is the circular logic rather than lack of causation.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The argument involves faulty repetition since it repeats and loops back to the proposition without real independent support. However, it fits another defective argument type better.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This is not applicable as it does not involve the assumption of general agreement.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language is not inherently ambiguous, so this type is not applicable.

The primary defective argument type here is **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**, as the argument's structure repeats the propositions in a self-supporting loop without independent justification for any of the statements.

In conclusion, the primary defective argument type for "A is true because B is true, and B is true because C is true, and C is true because A is true" is:

**<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**
