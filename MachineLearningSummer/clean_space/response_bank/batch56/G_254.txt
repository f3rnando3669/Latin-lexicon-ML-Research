For 
The argument "My parents are democrats, and they are good people. Therefore, all democrats must be good people." can be analyzed as follows:

1. **Identify the Argument and Conclusion:**
   - Premise: "My parents are democrats, and they are good people."
   - Conclusion: "Therefore, all democrats must be good people."

2. **Defective Arguments Analysis (IDAA):**
   - <G> Generalization: This argument makes a broad generalization based on a limited sample. The fact that the speaker's parents are good people does not logically lead to the conclusion that all democrats are good people. This is an example of a fallacious generalization because the sample size (the speaker's parents) is too small to represent the entire group of democrats.

Therefore, the argument primarily suffers from the defective argument type <G> Generalization.
