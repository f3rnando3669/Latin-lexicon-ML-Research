IDAA stands for "Identify Defective Argument/Argument Type." The statement "We cannot approve of this recycling idea. It was thought of by a bunch of hippie communist weirdos." can be analyzed to identify the defective argument type as follows:

This statement dismisses an idea based solely on those who support it rather than addressing the merits or flaws of the idea itself. This type of argument does not provide a logical reason for rejecting the recycling idea and instead relies on derogatory labeling.

Upon evaluation, it appears this falls into the category of **Ad Hominem** fallacy, which is not among the previously defined defective argument types. However, one could argue this exhibits traits of:

- **Defective Argument Type: Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The provided reason (thought of by hippie communist weirdos) does not logically relate to the rejection of the idea (recycling). It fails to address any substantive issues with the idea itself, thus rendering the reason inconclusive.

Thus, applying IDAA:
- **Defective Argument Type: Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
