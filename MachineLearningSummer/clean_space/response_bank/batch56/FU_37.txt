For 
Great! I'll apply the framework you've specified to analyze the argument in the given statement:

Statement: "I am voting for Pepitone for President because the rest of my family is voting for her, and I don't want to be the only one not doing so."

Let's identify the defective arguments in this statement:

1. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The statement relies on the fact that the rest of the family is voting for Pepitone, suggesting that the individual's decision is based on a desire to conform to the group's choice rather than an independent evaluation of the candidate.
   
2. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason given for voting for Pepitone is not directly related to her qualifications or policies. The desire to not be different from the family is not a strong, conclusive reason for such an important decision as voting for a president.

So, applying the defective argument identifiers:

1. **<FU> - Presumptuous Consensus**: The argument assumes that the collective decision of the family implies correctness or appropriateness in voting for Pepitone.

2. **<IR> - Inconclusive Reason**: The reasoning based on not wanting to be different from the family does not directly establish any qualification or competency of Pepitone as a candidate.

Hence, the statement employs these defective argument types: <FU> and <IR>.
