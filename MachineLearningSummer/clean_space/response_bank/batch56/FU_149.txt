Let's break down the argument and identify the defective argument type(s) according to the definitions provided:

Argument: "I know the professor said the Bridges of Madison County was smarmy trash and lacked any artistic worth. But I still think he's wrong. After all, it was on the best-seller list for over 100 weeks."

1. **Premise**: "The professor said the Bridges of Madison County was smarmy trash and lacked any artistic worth."
2. **Conclusion**: "I still think he's wrong."
3. **Supporting Argument**: "It was on the best-seller list for over 100 weeks."

Here’s how the different defective argument types might apply:

- <G> - Generalization: This argument does not appear to make a broad generalization.
- <FE> - Incomplete Enumeration: The argument does not avoid mentioning other relevant factors; it simply focuses on one specific point.
- <IR> - Inconclusive Reason: This may apply here because the fact that a book was on the best-seller list does not conclusively prove it has artistic worth.
- <WCB> - Insufficient Causal Basis: This argument doesn't involve establishing a causal relationship, so this doesn’t apply.
- <RR> - Faulty Repetition of Proposition: This isn’t about repeating a proposition multiple times.
- <FU> - Presumptuous Consensus: This doesn’t imply consensus; it uses the best-seller status as an authority.
- <DEP> - Ambiguous Language: The language is clear enough and does not rely on ambiguous or vague terms.

Based on this analysis, the best fit for the defective argument type in this scenario is:

<IR> - Inconclusive Reason

This is because the fact that a book was on the best-seller list does not directly address or counter the professor's claim about artistry and quality. Being a best-seller does not conclusive equate to artistic worth, rendering the reason inconclusive in proving the argument’s claim.
