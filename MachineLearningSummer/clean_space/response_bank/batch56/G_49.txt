The argument presented appears to be flawed in assuming that because a clinic makes a lot of money, each individual psychologist who works there must earn a large income. This reasoning can be analyzed using the <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Application) method with the specific defective argument types provided.

Let's break down the argument and identify the most appropriate defective argument type that applies:

**Statement**: "This clinic sure makes a lot of money. Each of the psychologists who work there must earn a large income."

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument does not present a pattern extrapolated to an entire group. Hence, it doesn't seem to fit as a generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This argument does not seem to be incomplete enumeration, as it does not deal with a list of possibilities but rather makes a specific assertion about earnings.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The conclusion drawn (psychologists earning large incomes) is not sufficiently supported just by the premise of the clinic making a lot of money. Thus, it fits the definition of an inconclusive reason.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This argument does not delve into the causal relationship that would suggest a clinic's overall income directly causes each psychologist to have a large income. It might be related, but primarily, it fails to establish a direct causal link.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This argument does not repeat a proposition to imply its truth; hence, it does not qualify as faulty repetition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument does not rely on an assumed group consensus, so it is not presumptuous consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: There is no evident ambiguity in the terms used; the argument's flaw lies more in the logical assumption than in language ambiguity.

Given these considerations, the most fitting defective argument type for this situation is:

**<IR> - Inconclusive Reason**

Thus, applying <IDAA>:

**<IR>:** The argument assumes that a high total income for the clinic necessarily implies high individual incomes for the psychologists, which is not conclusively supported. The distribution of the clinic's income could be uneven, with other factors significantly affecting individual earnings.
