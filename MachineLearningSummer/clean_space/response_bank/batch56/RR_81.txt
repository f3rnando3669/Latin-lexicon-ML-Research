For 
The statement "You must obey the law, because it's illegal to break the law" exemplifies the fallacy of **begging the question**. This type of fallacy occurs when the conclusion is assumed implicitly or explicitly in the premise, resulting in a circular argument. 

Begging the question involves making a claim that uses its own conclusion as its own justification, rather than providing any new evidence or reasoning.

So, in the context of your predefined defective argument types, this fallacy would best correspond to:

**<RR> - Faulty Repetition of Proposition.** 

In this case, the statement "You must obey the law" is simply restated as "it's illegal to break the law" without providing additional grounds for why obeying the law is necessary beyond the tautological repetition.
