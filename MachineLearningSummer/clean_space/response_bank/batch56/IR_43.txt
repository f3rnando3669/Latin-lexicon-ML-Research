For 
To analyze the given conversation using the specified defective argument types, we can break it down between Charlie's original statement and Bob's response:

**Charlie's statement:**
"Fast food is filled with salt, fat, and added sugars. We need better regulation of the industry."

- There are no defective argument types here. Charlie is making a claim about the nutritional content of fast food and suggesting a policy response.

**Bob's response:**
"That may be, but you're such a hypocrite! I saw you devour a Triple-Baconator, super-sized fries and 64 ounces of soda yesterday."

This response can be analyzed for defective argument types as follows:

1. **Red Herring (RH)**: Bob is diverting attention from the actual argument (the need for better regulation of the fast food industry) by attacking Charlie's personal behavior.
   
2. **Ad Hominem (AH)**: Bob is deflecting the argument by attacking Charlie's character instead of addressing the substance of Charlie's argument.

These are not part of the defined defective argument types, so let's consider if any of the specific defective argument types apply:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This does not seem to apply here, as Bob's statement focuses on a specific incident rather than making a broad generalization.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (IE)**: Bob does not list incomplete examples to support his argument; therefore, this type does not apply.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Bob's argument is inconclusive because attacking Charlie's personal behavior doesn't logically counter the need for better regulation. However, this is more accurately an ad hominem fallacy rather than strictly an inconclusive reason.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is no causality being debated in Bob's statement, so this type does not apply.
   
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Bob is not repeating any proposition.
   
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Bob does not appeal to a presumed consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: There is no ambiguous language in Bob's statement.

From this, while none of the specifically defined defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>) directly fit Bob's response, it most clearly falls under the broader logical fallacy types of Red Herring (RH) and Ad Hominem (AH). 

Thus, you might consider an addition to your list of defective argument types to better capture ad hominem and similar fallacies that divert attention from the actual argument being made.
