To classify the defective argument in the statement "We haven’t found the ruins of Troy, so the city of Troy didn’t really exist," let's analyze the reasoning used:

The reasoning here is that because we haven't found physical evidence (the ruins) of Troy, it's concluded that Troy didn't exist. This argument commits a logical fallacy by assuming that the absence of evidence is evidence of absence. It fails to take into account that the ruins of Troy may still be undiscovered or could have been destroyed beyond recognition.

This type of defective argument falls under the category <IR> (Inconclusive Reason). The inference made is not conclusively supported by the evidence or lack thereof.

So, the statement "We haven’t found the ruins of Troy, so the city of Troy didn’t really exist" is an example of <IR>.
