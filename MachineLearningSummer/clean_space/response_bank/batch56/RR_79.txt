The argument presented in Aida's paper can be evaluated for possible defective argument types. Aida's statement "Filthy, polluting hummers should be banned" appears to use loaded language and makes a subjective judgment without providing adequate reasoning or evidence.

Let's break down the fallacy using the identified defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G):** It does not seem to be a hasty generalization since it targets a specific subject (hummers).

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument does not attempt to list or examine all relevant factors or cases.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The statement could lack conclusive reasoning. It does not provide evidence or a structured argument to support why hummers should be banned specifically, it simply asserts that they are "filthy" and "polluting."

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The argument does not establish a clear causal relationship; rather, it makes an assertion based on perceived qualities.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The argument does not engage in repetitive assertion of a proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The statement does not suggest there is a general consensus on the matter.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The terms "filthy" and "polluting" are somewhat subjective and not clearly defined, which could lead to ambiguity in understanding the exact reasoning.

Given these observations, the statement appears to fall under **Ambiguous Language (DEP)** due to the loaded and subjective terms "filthy" and "polluting," which are not substantiated within the argument itself.

Thus, the fallacy in Aida's statement is best identified as **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**.
