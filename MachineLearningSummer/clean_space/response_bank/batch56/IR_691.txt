For 
The argument in question, "My professor, who has a Ph.D. in Astronomy, once told me that ghosts are real. Therefore, ghosts are real," is an example of a defective argument type. We can classify this using <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Application) as follows:

This argument is committing the fallacy known as **Appeal to Authority**. Let's analyze how it corresponds to our defective argument types:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: This is not a generalization.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This does not involve listing insufficient evidence.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This fits well since the premise does not logically lead to the conclusion.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This is not about insufficient causal connections.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This is not about repeating the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This argument does not rely on assumed consensus.
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The language is not particularly ambiguous here.

Therefore, the most appropriate classification for this argument under the defined defective argument types is **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, because the fact that an authority in Astronomy believes in ghosts does not provide sufficient, relevant evidence for the existence of ghosts. The expertise of the professor in Astronomy does not transfer to the topic of ghosts, making the reasoning inconclusive.
