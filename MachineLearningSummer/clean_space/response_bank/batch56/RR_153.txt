For 
The argument "A is true because A is true." is an example of a faulty argument known as *begging the question* or *circular reasoning*. 

Applying the defective argument type you've defined, this example falls under <RR>, which stands for Faulty Repetition of Proposition, as it essentially repeats the proposition without providing any external evidence or reasoning:

**Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This defective argument type involves repeating the same assertion as a reason for itself, which doesn't provide any new information or justification.

Thus, the application would be:

"This argument is an example of <RR>, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, as it simply repeats the proposition 'A' without providing any independent support or rationale."
