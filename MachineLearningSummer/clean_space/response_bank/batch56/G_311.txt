# Identifying Defective Argument Types in "Happy families make happy children."

IDAA stands for Identifying Defective Argument Types or Inference Defects in Arguments. Here, we break down "Happy families make happy children" to see if it fits into any of our defined defective argument types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), and Ambiguous Language (<DEP>).

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The statement makes a broad claim about "happy families" and "happy children" without specifying parameters or conditions. It generalizes that happiness in family life universally results in happy children, without considering exceptions or context.
   - Therefore, this argument type fits the defective argument type of Generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The statement does not list all possible scenarios or influences that might lead to happy children. It overlooks other factors that could contribute to a child's happiness, focusing solely on family happiness.
   - Thus, it can be seen as an Incomplete Enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The reasoning that happy families "make" happy children does not definitively prove the causation. It's possible that while happy families contribute to children's happiness, they are not the only factor.
   - This makes the argument fit the Inconclusive Reason type.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - The statement assumes a direct causation ("make") between happy families and happy children without providing sufficient evidence or exploring other variables that might affect the outcome. There's not enough causal basis provided in the argument.
   - Hence, this fits the Insufficient Causal Basis type.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - This defective argument does not apply here because the statement doesn’t repeat a proposition. It’s a singular claim without repetition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - The statement doesn't imply a consensus or presume a shared belief or common knowledge without evidence. It’s an individual claim rather than one that presumes agreement.
   - This argument type doesn’t apply here.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - The terms "happy families" and "happy children" are somewhat ambiguous; they are subjective and can be interpreted in various ways depending on personal views and contexts.
   - Thus, Ambiguous Language can also apply here.

### Conclusion:

The statement "Happy families make happy children." contains several defective argument types:
- **Generalization (<G>)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**

By applying the IDAA method, we can see that this assertion suffers from multiple defective argument types, reducing its argumentative strength and reliability.
