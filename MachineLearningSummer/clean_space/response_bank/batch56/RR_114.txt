For 
The statement "It is what it is!" can be associated with a defective argument type which I define as <IDAA> meaning "Identity Statement with Apparent Axiom." However, to provide a fitting context to this specific analysis, let's look at how it fits into defective arguments:

### Identity Statement with Apparent Axiom (IDAA)

**Definition:**
This type of argument presents itself as self-evident and requires no further explanation. It often assumes that the statement is universally acknowledged as true merely by virtue of its structure, often tautological, thus sidestepping actual reasoning or evidence.

**Application to "It is what it is!"**
- **Nature**: The statement "It is what it is!" appears to assert a truth based purely on its own repetition and inherent structure, without providing any external evidence or logical reasoning.
- **Defectiveness**:
  - Falls under the realm of tautological reasoning.
  - Assumes that the repetition provides conclusive evidence.

Therefore, "It is what it is!" is classified as <IDAA>, an Identity Statement with Apparent Axiom due to its tautological nature and presumption of self-evident truth needing no further justification or explanation.
