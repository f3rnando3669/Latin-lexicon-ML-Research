For 
Applying the framework of Identifying Defective Argument Attributes (<IDAA>), let's analyze the statement "You should never gamble! Once you start gambling you find it hard to stop. Soon you will spend all your money on gambling, and eventually you will turn to crime just to support your gambling addiction."

1. **Generalization <G>**: 
   - This argument makes a sweeping generalization that anyone who starts gambling will inevitably end up addicted, poor, and resort to criminal activity. It doesn't account for individuals who gamble responsibly or infrequently without such severe consequences.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>**:
   - The argument only lists negative outcomes (addiction, financial ruin, crime) and ignores any other possible outcomes of gambling (e.g., moderation, setting limits, playing for entertainment without adverse effects).

3. **Inconclusive Reason <IR>**: 
   - While it's true that gambling can lead to addiction for some, the argument doesn’t conclusively prove that it will happen to everyone. It overlooks the nuances and varying degrees of gambling habits.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>**:
   - The argument presents a slippery slope fallacy by suggesting that starting to gamble will definitely lead to crime. It lacks sufficient evidence to show a direct causal link between beginning to gamble and turning to crime for everyone.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>**:
   - This defect is not particularly relevant in this context as the argument doesn’t repeatedly state the same proposition in a way that implies it's true simply because it's repeated.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>**:
   - The argument does assume a consensus that gambling is inherently bad and leads to severe consequences without acknowledging any form of disagreement or alternative perspectives.

7. **Ambiguous Language <DEP>**:
   - Terms like "hard to stop" and "soon" are somewhat ambiguous and could vary widely in interpretation. The timeline and severity of events described lack precise definition, making the argument less clear.

**Summary**: The argument "You should never gamble! Once you start gambling you find it hard to stop. Soon you will spend all your money on gambling, and eventually you will turn to crime just to support your gambling addiction." exhibits several defective argument attributes including Generalization <G>, Incomplete Enumeration <FE>, Inconclusive Reason <IR>, Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>, Presumptuous Consensus <FU>, and Ambiguous Language <DEP>.
