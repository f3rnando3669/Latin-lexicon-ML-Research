For 
To analyze the argument "We admit that the measure is popular. But we also urge you to note that there are so many bond issues on the ballot that the whole thing is getting ridiculous." for defective argument types (labeled here as Defective Arguments Analysis Application, or <IDAA>), we need to break down the reasoning and look for any logical fallacies or deficiencies.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This does not apply, as the argument does not make an overly broad conclusion from limited evidence.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This does not seem to specifically apply either, as the argument doesn’t fail to consider all necessary cases—it's not making a categorical list that omits essential components.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This could apply. The argument suggests that the number of bond issues being high makes the whole thing ridiculous, but this is not necessarily a logically conclusive reason against the popularity of the measure or its merit.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This might apply too. The argument does not effectively establish a causal link between the number of bond issues and the "ridiculousness" or inadvisability of this particular measure. 
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This argument doesn’t repeatedly state the same thing for the purpose of making it more convincing; hence, this does not apply.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This does not apply here either, as the argument is not making an appeal to consensus that assumes everyone or a majority agrees without evidence.
7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This could partly apply. Terms like "ridiculous" are subjective and vague, which can detract from the clarity and strength of the argument.

Thus, under <IDAA>:
- **Primary defective argument types** identified are Inconclusive Reason (<IR>) and Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).
- There is also a possibility of Ambiguous Language (<DEP>) contributing to the argument's deficiency.

Therefore, the argument can be summarized as:
"Our argument states the popularity of the measure but is weakened by inconclusive reasoning (<IR>), insufficient causal basis (<WCB>), and potentially ambiguous language (<DEP>)."
