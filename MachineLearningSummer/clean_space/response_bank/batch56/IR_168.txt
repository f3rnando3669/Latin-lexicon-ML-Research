Sure, this statement "The candidate for mayor was a really bad baseball player in college! Don't vote for him!" seems to be an example of the defective argument type called Inconclusive Reason (IR). Here's how it fits that category:

### Inconclusive Reason (IR)
This argument uses an irrelevant or insufficiently related reason to make a conclusion. In this case, the candidate’s performance in college baseball has no logical bearing on their competency or fitness for the mayoral office.

To apply the <IR> label:
- **Statement:** “The candidate for mayor was a really bad baseball player in college! Don't vote for him!"
- **Defective Argument Type:** Inconclusive Reason (IR)
- **Justification:** The candidate's athletic performance in college is irrelevant to their capabilities as a mayor, making the reasoning insufficient and inappropriate for the conclusion being drawn. 

Therefore, the argument is fallacious because it draws a conclusion based on an irrelevant premise.
