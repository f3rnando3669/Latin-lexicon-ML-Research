For 
The defective argument in the given statement can be identified using the framework provided:

Let's analyze the statement: "Of course that doctor advocates vaccination—he probably owns stock in a pharmaceutical company."

This type of argument falls under the category of a faulty reasoning where the motive of the individual (the doctor) is questioned rather than addressing the actual argument or evidence for vaccination. This is typically known as an **ad hominem attack**, specifically a **circumstantial ad hominem**.

However, considering the defined defective argument types, the most appropriate might be:

**<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** The reasoning provided is inconclusive as it does not address the merits of the vaccination itself but rather casts suspicion on the doctor's motives without evidence.

So, applying the IDAA:
**Of course that doctor advocates vaccination—he probably owns stock in a pharmaceutical company. (<IR>)**
