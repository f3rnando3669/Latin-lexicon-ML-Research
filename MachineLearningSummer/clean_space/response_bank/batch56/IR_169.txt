For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Analysis) to the given scenario, we need to identify which defective argument type(s) fit the situation described:

"A woman decides to visit a certain doctor after only asking advice on the best doctors from ONE friend."

This scenario primarily demonstrates a case of <FE> Incomplete Enumeration. Here’s the analysis:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The woman relies on the opinion of just one friend to make her decision. This friend’s opinion might not be representative of the general consensus or provide sufficient information. Ideally, a broader range of sources or additional perspectives should be consulted to form a more comprehensive opinion about the best doctors.

Therefore, the argument type in this scenario is:

**Type**: <FE> - Incomplete Enumeration.
