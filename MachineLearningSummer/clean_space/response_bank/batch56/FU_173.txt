For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Arguments Applied:

1. **Original statement**: "A news story that reported that Captain Shah was under investigation was shared widely on social media. He must have been the individual who caused the crash."

2. **Identifying the defective argument types**:

   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The conclusion that Captain Shah must have been the individual who caused the crash is reached without sufficient conclusive evidence. Being under investigation does not necessarily imply guilt or causation.
   
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The widespread sharing on social media implies repeated acceptance of the initial claim without new evidence or reasoning. The assumption that repetition or popularity equals correctness is faulty.
   
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The conclusion is drawn based on the implicit assumption that social media consensus or widespread belief translates into factual correctness, which is presumptuous.

By applying <IDAA> to the given statement, we identify primarily these defective argument types: <IR>, <RR>, and <FU>.
