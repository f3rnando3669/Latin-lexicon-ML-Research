For 
Applying <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Types) to "Dismissing someone's viewpoint on an issue because he himself is inconsistent in that very thing," we can recognize this as a specific type of defective argument known as "Tu quoque" or the "appeal to hypocrisy." This argument attempts to discredit a person's viewpoint by highlighting their inconsistency or hypocrisy, rather than addressing the merits of the argument itself.

The relevant defective argument type here might be categorized as:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasoning is inconclusive because it does not directly address the argument or the issue at hand. Instead, it shifts the focus to the personal behavior of the individual, which is irrelevant to the validity of their argument.
