Certainly! In this statement, we can identify several potential defective arguments based on the definitions given:

1. <G> Generalization: The argument generalizes the behavior of all drivers in Richmond based on potentially limited observations or experiences. This might not reflect the behavior of the majority of drivers in Richmond.

2. <FE> Incomplete Enumeration: The argument assumes that the individual's experiences with drivers in Richmond represent all drivers' behavior without considering other possible behaviors or experiences. 

3. <IR> Inconclusive Reason: The argument doesn't provide specific evidence or reasons to support the claim that drivers in Richmond or in big cities, in general, are terrible. The reasoning is thus weak and unsubstantiated.

Applying the 'Identify Defective Argument Applications' (<IDAA>) process, we would break down the argument "Drivers in Richmond are terrible. Why does everyone in a big city drive like that?" and identify which defective arguments are present based on the given types:

```
- Generalization <G>: This statement makes a broad claim about all drivers in Richmond based on an unspecified number of instances.
- Incomplete Enumeration <FE>: By claiming "everyone in a big city" drives terribly, the argument fails to acknowledge the diversity of driving behaviors and does not provide a comprehensive enumeration of all cases.
- Inconclusive Reason <IR>: The argument lacks supportive evidence or logical reasoning to substantiate why drivers in Richmond or big cities in general are considered terrible.
```

Therefore, the defective arguments present in the given statement are:

1. <G> Generalization
2. <FE> Incomplete Enumeration
3. <IR> Inconclusive Reason
