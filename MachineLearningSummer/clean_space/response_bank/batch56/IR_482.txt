For 
<IDAA> stands for Ignored Defective Argument Analysis. Let’s perform this analysis step-by-step on the statement: "Ignore any scientific ideas from anyone who didn’t get a Ph.D."

1. **Generalization (G):** The statement suggests a broad conclusion that scientific ideas from all individuals without a Ph.D. are not worth considering, which is an overly sweeping generalization. There are many scientifically valid ideas that can come from people without formal Ph.D. training.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument implies that having a Ph.D. is the only criterion for making valid scientific ideas, neglecting other factors such as experience, self-study, or contributions from non-Ph.D. holders. This creates an incomplete enumeration of who can contribute valuable scientific ideas.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reasoning that not having a Ph.D. automatically invalidates someone's scientific ideas is inconclusive and unsupported. Plenty of scientific advances have been made by individuals without doctoral degrees.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The statement assumes a direct causal link between having a Ph.D. and producing valid scientific ideas without offering sufficient evidence for this causal relationship.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** If the statement has been repeated without additional evidence or support over time, it amounts to a faulty repetition of the same unfounded proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The statement presumes that there is a consensus that Ph.D. credentials are required for valid scientific ideas, which is not necessarily the case. It presumes agreement without actually establishing it.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The statement uses the term "scientific ideas" without defining it clearly. "Scientific ideas" could mean theories, hypotheses, or observational insights, among other things, making the language ambiguous.

In summary, the statement "Ignore any scientific ideas from anyone who didn’t get a Ph.D." is defective due to the presence of Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), and Ambiguous Language (DEP).
