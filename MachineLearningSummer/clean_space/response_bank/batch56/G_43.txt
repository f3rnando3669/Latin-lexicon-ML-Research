For 
<IDAA> stands for **Identification of Defective Argumentation Attributes**. Let's break down the argument in the statement "Don't use iPhones. Teachers use iPhones and teachers are extremely dorky. If you use an iPhone, you will be dorky like a teacher!" to identify the defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: The argument makes a blanket statement that all teachers are extremely dorky without evidence to support this claim.
   - **Identification**: "Teachers are extremely dorky."

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not consider all possible uses of iPhones or contexts, focusing only on teachers as a specific group.
   - **Identification**: The statement focuses only on teachers using iPhones and generalizes the outcome.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The conclusion that using an iPhone makes someone dorky like a teacher does not logically follow from the premises.
   - **Identification**: "If you use an iPhone, you will be dorky like a teacher!"

4. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument presumes a consensus that being dorky is a negative trait and applies it universally.
   - **Identification**: Implicit in the statement is the assumption that everyone agrees that being dorky is bad.

By applying <IDAA> to the statement, we can identify that the argument contains elements of **Generalization (G)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, and **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.
