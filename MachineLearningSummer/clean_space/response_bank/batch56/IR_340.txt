It seems like there might be a small confusion in your request. You mentioned applying <IDAA>, which is not defined in your list of defective argument types. However, let's assume you possibly meant to identify defective arguments (IDAA) within the given statement.

The argument in question is: "I shouldnâ€™t be punished for staying out past my curfew because I did the dishes earlier today."

Here are the potential defective arguments present:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided (doing the dishes) is not conclusively connected to the conclusion (not being punished for staying out past curfew). Doing chores does not logically exempt someone from following other rules or consequences unrelated to those chores.

2. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The argument could also fall into ambiguous language if the context concerning the relationship between the chores and curfew is unclear or if terms are being used in a way that's intentionally vague to sidestep the actual issue of breaking curfew.

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the given statement reveals at least "Inconclusive Reason (IR)" and potentially "Ambiguous Language (DEP)" as defective argument types present in the reasoning.
