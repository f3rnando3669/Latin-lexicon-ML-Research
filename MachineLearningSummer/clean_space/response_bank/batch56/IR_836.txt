Sure, let's analyze the given argument using the specified defective argument types:

Accused on the 6 o'clock news of corruption and taking bribes, the senator said that we should all be very wary of the things we hear in the media, because we all know how very unreliable the media can be.

The argument contains several defective elements:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The senator's statement that "the media can be very unreliable" doesn't provide conclusive evidence about the specific accusation of corruption and taking bribes. It shifts the focus from the concrete accusation to a general reliability issue, which doesn't directly address the claims made against him.

2. **Generalization (G)**: The statement assumes that because the media can be unreliable in some cases, it is unreliable in this specific case. This is an overgeneralization from a possibly limited set of instances to assert that the media is unreliable in all cases, especially pertinent ones like this.

3. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The phrase "very unreliable" is ambiguous and subjective. The degree and nature of the unreliability are not specified, making it difficult to assess the validity of the senator's counter-claim based on media unreliability.

These identified defective arguments within the senator's statement divert attention from the actual issue (the accusation) to a broader and less defined critique of the media.
