Certainly! Let's apply the specified defective argument definitions to the statement:

*"Every time I go to sleep the sun goes down. Therefore, my sleeping causes the sun to set."*

In this case, the defective argument type that best applies is:

<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis): This argument fails to establish a sufficient causal connection between the speaker's action (going to sleep) and the occurrence (the sun setting). The correlation of these two events does not imply causation, and the argument is defective due to the lack of an adequate causal link between sleeping and the sunset.

So, we can label this argument as <WCB>.
