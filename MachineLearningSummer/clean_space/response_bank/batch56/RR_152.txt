Let's examine the argument: "The number of pirates in existence decreased as the global average temperature rose. Therefore, we can conclude that hotter weather reduces piracy." This is an example of assuming a causal relationship between two correlated variables without sufficient evidence of causality.

We can apply the defective argument types to better understand the flaws in this reasoning. One of the defective argument types directly relevant here is:

<WCB> - Insufficient Causal Basis:
This defective argument type occurs when a causal connection is asserted without adequate evidence. In this case, the argument claims that hotter weather causes a reduction in piracy simply because there is a correlation. However, correlation does not imply causation, and without further evidence to establish a direct causal link, the argument remains flawed.

Conclusively, the argument about pirates and temperature should be identified primarily as a defective argument of type <WCB>, Insufficient Causal Basis.
