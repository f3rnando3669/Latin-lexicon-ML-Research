For 
Let's break down the argument "President Petutti ordered a military strike that killed many civilians. He is no different than any other mass murderer and he belongs in prison!" and identify any defective argument types (IDAA - Identify Defective Argument Types and Apply) present:

1. **Generalization (G)**
   - The claim that President Petutti is no different than any other mass murderer is a hasty generalization. It draws a broad conclusion based on a specific event without sufficient evidence to support such a sweeping comparison.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
   - This argument doesn't consider various factors or an exhaustive list of circumstances that could distinguish President Petutti's actions from those of a mass murderer. It is a narrowly focused enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
   - The reason provided (ordering a strike that killed civilians) is inconclusive as it doesn’t necessarily equate to mass murder. The context, intent, and legal implications are not conclusively addressed.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
   - There is insufficient causal analysis linking the president’s actions directly to being a mass murderer. The argument implicitly assumes direct causation without examining underlying complexities.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
   - This does not appear directly in the argument. The statement is straightforward without repetition of a faulty proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
   - The argument assumes that labeling President Petutti as a mass murderer is a consensus without empirical or broad social backing for such a position. This assumes agreement that hasn’t been established.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**
   - The term "mass murderer" is loaded and ambiguous; it can imply different things in different contexts. Using such a term without clarity can lead to misinterpretations or emotional bias.

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the argument “President Petutti ordered a military strike that killed many civilians. He is no different than any other mass murderer and he belongs in prison!”, we identify the following defective argument types:

- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**

The statement contains multiple types of defective arguments, making it a weak and fallacious argument overall.
