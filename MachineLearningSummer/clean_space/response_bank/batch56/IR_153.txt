The argument "We haven’t found King David’s tomb, so King David didn’t really exist," can be analyzed for its defects and classified as follows:

This argument seems to commit the error of **hasty generalization** under the broader category of **Insufficient Evidence**. The lack of specific evidence (King David's tomb) is inappropriately taken to imply the nonexistence of King David himself. The fact that archaeology has not produced certain evidence does not conclusively prove historical nonexistence.

Let's apply the established defective argument types to this statement:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Assuming the evidence we have (or lack thereof) represents all possible evidence without comprehensive exploration or consideration. Just because we haven't found the tomb doesn't mean we won't find other compelling evidence in the future.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasoning used is inconclusive because the absence of evidence (a tomb) is not definitive proof of nonexistence. Many historical figures' resting places remain undiscovered, yet their existence is well-supported by other forms of evidence.

Given these observations, we can conclude that the argument about King David's nonexistence primarily suffers from **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** and **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** arguments:

```
<FE>: Assuming lack of evidence for King David's tomb means no evidence will ever be found.
<IR>: Using the absence of the tomb as definitive proof of nonexistence.
```
