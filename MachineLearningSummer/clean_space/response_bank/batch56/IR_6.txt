For 
The given statement "We're going to celebrate New Year's Eve this way because that's how we've always done it" represents a type of argument that relies on tradition or past practice as a justification for continuing the same behavior. 

To apply an identifier for defective argument type to this, we can label this type of reasoning more specifically with the following:

**<RR>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition.**

Here, the argument is fallacious because it repeats a proposition (celebrating New Year's Eve in a certain way) without providing new reasoning or evidence, instead relying solely on the repetition of past practice as justification. Thus, it does not adequately support the conclusion beyond the claim that it's been done this way before.
