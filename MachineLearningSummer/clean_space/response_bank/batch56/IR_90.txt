To apply the defective argument types to the statement "While in math class, the student next to you says 'math makes no sense, it can’t be real so I must not need this,'" let's analyze the argument to identify the potential fallacy.

The student is making several claims:
1. Math makes no sense.
2. Therefore, it can't be real.
3. Because of the two previous points, I must not need this.

Firstly, consider the claim that "math makes no sense." This is a subjective statement and might be a personal opinion (whether or not it’s true), but it isn't an inherently defective argument by itself.

However, when the student jumps from "math makes no sense" to "it can’t be real," they are making a logical leap without sufficient justification. This transition seems to fall under the argument type <IR> (Inconclusive Reason). The student hasn't provided enough evidence or reasoning to conclude that because math doesn't make sense to them, it gives sufficient grounds to declare math as unreal.

Next, the statement "so I must not need this" based on the previous potentially flawed premise that math is not real, seems presumptuous. Here, the student is presuming a consensus or a generalized conclusion based on their individual subjective experience without providing concrete arguments.

This presumptive conclusion could arguably fall under <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus) as the individual is assuming their subjective experience (or a general perception) is shared or can be generalized.

In summary, the student has committed fallacies that can be categorized as:

1. **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** - Failing to provide sufficient evidence for the claim that math is not real based on their lack of understanding.
2. **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)** - Presuming that their lack of need for math (based on their personal belief) applies universally.

Therefore, the fallacies committed in the student's argument apply primarily to <IR> and <FU>.
