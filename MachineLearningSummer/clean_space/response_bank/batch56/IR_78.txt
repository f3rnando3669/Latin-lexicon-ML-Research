It seems you have defined several defective argument types, but it appears that you want to apply the "Identification of Defective Argument Analysis" (<IDAA>) to the statement provided. Let's break down the argument and identify any defective argument types present:

Original Statement:
"I hope I presented my argument clearly. Now, my opponent will attempt to refute my argument by his own fallacious, incoherent, illogical version of history."

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The speaker is implying that the opponent's argument will inherently be fallacious, incoherent, and illogical. This is a broad generalization without specific evidence.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The claim that the opponent's argument will be fallacious, incoherent, and illogical is made without providing any reason or evidence. It is preemptively dismissing any counterargument without engaging with the content.

3. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - The speaker presumes a consensus that the opponent's version of history is inherently flawed without providing substantial support or evidence to this effect.

4. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - Terms like "fallacious," "incoherent," and "illogical" are used pejoratively without clear definitions or examples of how the opponent’s argument fits these descriptions. This use of ambiguous language can be seen as another layer of dismissal without adequate justification.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - The speaker repeats the idea that the opponent’s argument will be flawed multiple times through different descriptors (fallacious, incoherent, illogical), which could be seen as attempting to reinforce the proposition without additional support.

So, applying the Identification of Defective Argument Analysis (<IDAA>) to this statement, we find that it contains elements of <G>, <IR>, <FU>, <DEP>, and <RR>.
