<IDAA> refers to Identifying and Describing the Applicable Argument Analysis.

When we analyze the statement: "Today late for ten minutes, tomorrow late for an hour, and then someday you will simply cease to show up," we can break it down to identify which defective argument types are present.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The statement infers a broad conclusion based on a single occurrence or a limited number of instances. Being late one day or a couple of times does not necessarily mean that someone will eventually stop showing up entirely. This is a classic form of hasty generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The argument fails to consider other possible outcomes. It assumes that lateness will inevitably increase to the point of complete absence, without acknowledging other possibilities like correcting the behavior or external factors that could resolve the issue.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - There is an assumption of a direct causation without sufficient evidence. The argument does not sufficiently establish why being late one day necessarily leads to being late for a longer period and eventually not showing up at all.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - The argument lacks a robust causal basis. While there may be a pattern suggested, the reasoning does not provide a sufficient causal link to justify the severe conclusion. There could be many reasons for the initial lateness that do not lead to the catastrophic outcome predicted.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - The progression in the argument (ten minutes late turning into an hour and then complete absence) is repetitive but without provided evidence for each step. It's an exaggerated linear projection without concrete support for each stage of lateness escalating.

Given these analyses, the statement "Today late for ten minutes, tomorrow late for an hour, and then someday you will simply cease to show up" can be identified as primarily containing the defective argument types of **Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE),** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. 

To a lesser extent, it may also involve elements of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** due to the lack of substantial evidence linking each statement step-by-step, and **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** due to the extrapolation of the lateness increasing without solid grounding for each claim made.
