For 
<IDAA> stands for "Identify Defective Argument Application." Let's break down the argument to see what kind of logical fallacy or defective argument type it fits into.

The argument stated is: 

"Whatever happens by chance should be punished, because whatever happens by chance is a departure from law and all departures from law should be punished."

Here is the step-by-step breakdown of each part of the argument:

1. **Premise 1:** Whatever happens by chance is a departure from law.
2. **Premise 2:** All departures from law should be punished.
3. **Conclusion:** Therefore, whatever happens by chance should be punished.

1. **Generalization:** This argument does not seem to be based on a general statement applied to all cases without sufficient evidence. **<G> is not applicable**.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration:** This argument does not list incomplete cases leading to the conclusion. **<FE> is not applicable**.

3. **Inconclusive Reason:** There is no indication that the reasons provided fail to support the conclusion due to insufficient evidence or logical linkage. **<IR> is not applicable**.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis:** The argument assumes without establishing that departures from law caused by chance events should be punished. However, this doesn't primarily rely on the cause and its insufficiency. **<WCB> is not applicable**.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** The argument does restate its premises to confirm the conclusion directly, so this seems involved more in circular reasoning. **<RR> may be applicable**.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus:** The argument does not claim consensus as a basis of the conclusion. **<FU> is not applicable**.

7. **Ambiguous Language:** "Departure from law" and "happens by chance" could have ambiguity regarding their interpretations, though not clear cut enough to form a basis. **<DEP> is marginally applicable**.

However, considering the whole argument structure, the argument involves a form of **circular reasoning** because it assumes what it is trying to prove:

- The premises assume that any departure from law, including those by chance, should be punished, and the conclusion reiterates this without providing independent justification.

Thus, the **logical fallacy COMMITS is Circular Reasoning**, and the defective argument type best suited here would likely be **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**.
