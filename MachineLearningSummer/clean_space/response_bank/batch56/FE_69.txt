For 
It looks like you've defined several types of defective arguments, but none of them are labeled <IDAA>. However, I can help identify the type of defective argument in the statement "You're either for America or against her!!!" based on common argumentative fallacies.

The statement "You're either for America or against her!!!" is presenting a false dichotomy or false dilemma. This is a logical fallacy where only two extreme options are considered, when in fact there may be a range of alternative positions.

If we were to use one of your predefined categories, the statement could perhaps fall into a new, yet undefined category like False Dichotomy. However, since you have not defined this category, I'll explain with a hypothetical category <FD> (False Dichotomy):

```markdown
**<FD> False Dichotomy:** The argument falsely presents only two possible options or outcomes, ignoring other potential alternatives.
```

Therefore, applying <FD> to "You're either for America or against her!!!" we get:

```markdown
**<FD>** "You're either for America or against her!!!" - This statement falsely presents only two opposing options, ignoring other possible stances and nuances in opinion.
```

If you wish to define such a category in your existing list, you may consider adding <FD> to cover similar cases in the future.
