For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Application) to the statement "Did the pollution you caused increase or decrease your profits?", we need to examine the components of the question to determine if it fits any of the defective argument types defined:

1. **Generalization (G)**: Making a broad statement based on limited evidence.
   - **Analysis**: This question does not seem to involve generalization; it is specific to pollution and profits.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Presenting an incomplete list or options.
   - **Analysis**: The question presents only two outcomes (increase or decrease) and excludes other possibilities such as having no effect. Therefore, it could be seen as an incomplete enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Using inconclusive or irrelevant evidence to support a claim.
   - **Analysis**: The question does not provide evidence or reasoning; it simply asks about the potential impact.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Suggesting a causal relationship without sufficient evidence.
   - **Analysis**: The question presupposes a causal relationship between pollution and profits without providing evidence for that connection. This could mean it lacks sufficient causal basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Repeating a statement without providing new evidence.
   - **Analysis**: The question does not involve repetition of a proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assuming consensus or agreement without justification.
   - **Analysis**: The question does not assume consensus; it is inquiring about an outcome.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Using language that is unclear or open to multiple interpretations.
   - **Analysis**: The language in the question is specific and clear, referring directly to pollution and profits without ambiguity.

Based on this analysis, the most fitting defective argument types for this question are:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: For only listing 'increase or decrease' without considering 'no effect.'
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: For implying a causal relationship between pollution and profits without supporting evidence.

So, the question "Did the pollution you caused increase or decrease your profits?" can be classified as:

<FE>, <WCB>
