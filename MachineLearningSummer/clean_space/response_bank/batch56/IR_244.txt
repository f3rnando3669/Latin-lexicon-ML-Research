<IDAA>: Identify Defective Argument Types Applied

Let's break down the argument "Why doesn't Tim get a real job like normal people instead of trying to launch that Internet business from home?" and identify which defective argument types may be present:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument assumes that working traditional jobs is the norm and launching an Internet business is not a "real job," making a broad generalization about what constitutes legitimate work.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The phrase "like normal people" suggests a limited perspective that fails to acknowledge the diversity of career paths and entrepreneurial endeavors, thus not considering all the valid options.

3. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The term "real job" is ambiguous and can be interpreted in various ways. What constitutes a "real job" can vastly differ based on personal opinions and societal standards.

In summary, the given argument contains the following defective argument types:

- Generalization (G)
- Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
- Ambiguous Language (DEP)
