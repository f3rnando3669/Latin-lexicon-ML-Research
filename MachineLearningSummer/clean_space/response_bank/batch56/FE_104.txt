For 
The argument "Either we go to war, or we appear weak" can be identified as a defective argument, specifically an <IDAA> (Invalid Dichotomy/Ambiguous Alternatives). This type of fallacy occurs when a situation is presented as having only two exclusive alternatives, ignoring other plausible options.

Let's break down why this is an <IDAA>:

1. **Invalid Dichotomy**: The statement suggests that there are only two possible outcomes â€” either going to war or appearing weak. This overlooks a range of other possibilities, such as diplomatic negotiations, economic sanctions, coalition-building, peace talks, etc.

2. **Ambiguous Alternatives**: The alternatives presented are not necessarily mutually exclusive and are overly simplistic. "Going to war" and "appearing weak" are not the only defining actions or outcomes in complex international relations.

Therefore, the argument "Either we go to war, or we appear weak" can be categorized under the <IDAA> defective argument type due to its false dichotomy and oversimplification.
