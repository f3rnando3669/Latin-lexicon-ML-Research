For 
The argument provided can be categorized into a defective argument type. Let's break it down:

1. **Identifying the Defective Argument Type:**
   - The statement "Every time I go to sleep, the sun goes down. Therefore, my going to sleep causes the sun to set." draws a direct causal relationship between two events based on their coincidental occurrence.
   - This draws a conclusion about causation from mere temporal correlation without sufficient evidence to support the causal link.

2. **Classifying the Defective Argument Type:**
   - Based on the definitions provided for defective arguments, the argument falls under the category <WCB> "Insufficient Causal Basis."

Therefore, applying <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Analysis) to the statement:

"Every time I go to sleep, the sun goes down. Therefore, my going to sleep causes the sun to set." can be classified as:

- **Defective Argument Type:** <WCB>
- **Reason:** The argument assumes a causal relationship between two events solely based on their co-occurrence without providing sufficient causal basis.

Thus, the identification of the defective argument type for the given statement is <WCB>, Insufficient Causal Basis.
