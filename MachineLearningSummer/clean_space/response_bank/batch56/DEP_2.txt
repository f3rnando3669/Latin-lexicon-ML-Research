<IDAA>: Apply Defective Argument Analysis

Let's break down the passage with respect to the identified defective argument types:

**Passage:**
"I see nobody on the road," said Alice.
"I only wish I had such eyes," the king remarked..."To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why it's as much as I can do to see real people, by this light."

**Analysis:**

1. **Alice's Statement:**
   - "I see nobody on the road," said Alice.
   - Here, Alice is likely using the term "nobody" to mean that she doesn't see any person on the road, which is clear and straightforward.

2. **King's Reply:**
   - "I only wish I had such eyes," the king remarked..."To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why it's as much as I can do to see real people, by this light."
   - The king's response capitalizes on the ambiguity in the word "nobody." He humorously misconstrues Alice's statement to mean she can literally see a person named "Nobody."

**Identified Defective Argument:**

The king's reply involves **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**, where the ambiguity lies in the interpretation of "nobody." Alice's "nobody" simply means "not anyone," whereas the king whimsically interprets "Nobody" as a specific person. 

**Conclusion:**

The passage humorously plays with ambiguous language, leading to a misunderstanding that falls under the category of <DEP>.
