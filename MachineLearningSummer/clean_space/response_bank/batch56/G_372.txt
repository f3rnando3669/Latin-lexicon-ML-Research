For 
<IDAA> stands for "Identify Defective Argument Applications." When we analyze the argument presented in the statement "Allowing overnight guests in the dorm rooms will lead to nothing but trouble: promiscuity, teen pregnancy, and eventually, a bunch of unwed mothers on campus, trying to complete their degrees while raising a child," we can identify several defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument assumes that allowing overnight guests will inevitably lead to promiscuity, teen pregnancy, and unwed mothers. It generalizes this outcome without considering other possible outcomes or individual differences.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument lists negative consequences (promiscuity, teen pregnancy, unwed mothers) without acknowledging any potential positive or neutral outcomes, thus presenting an incomplete enumeration of possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The argument gives reasons (such as promiscuity and teen pregnancy) but does not conclusively link these reasons to the policy change. The connection between allowing overnight guests and these outcomes is weak and not substantiated by evidence.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: There is an insufficient causal basis for the claim that allowing overnight guests will directly cause these negative outcomes. The argument fails to establish a clear causative link between the policy and the stated consequences.

In summary, the argument contains multiple defective elements: Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, and Insufficient Causal Basis.
