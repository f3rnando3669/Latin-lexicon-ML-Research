The argument you've provided can be analyzed for potential defects in reasoning using the defective argument types defined above:

**Argument:** "Don't ever gamble! Once you start, you won't be able to stop, and you'll end up bankrupt."

1. **Generalization (G):** The argument suggests that everyone who starts gambling will inevitably be unable to stop and will end up bankrupt. This is an overgeneralization, as it doesn't account for individuals who gamble responsibly or those who gamble occasionally without encountering severe financial issues.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument presents only one possible outcome (bankruptcy) of gambling, neglecting other possible outcomes such as responsible gambling, setting limits, or even winning some amount of money.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reasoning provided — that starting to gamble leads directly to being unable to stop and then to bankruptcy — lacks sufficient evidence to be conclusive. There are many steps and variables between starting to gamble and ending up bankrupt that aren't accounted for.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal link between starting to gamble and ending up bankrupt is presented as definitive without enough evidence. There are many factors contributing to financial ruin, and it's not established that gambling is the sole or primary cause in all cases.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The argument does not seem to involve the repetition of a proposition in a faulty manner, so this defective argument type does not directly apply here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument does not explicitly claim a consensus or general agreement from others to support its conclusion. Therefore, this defective argument type does not apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The language used in the argument is fairly straightforward and does not appear ambiguous. Therefore, this defective argument type does not apply either.

In summary, the argument "Don't ever gamble! Once you start, you won't be able to stop, and you'll end up bankrupt" primarily suffers from **Generalization (G)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. These types highlight the argument's failure to account for varying outcomes, the lack of conclusive evidence, and an over-simplified causal relationship.
