For 
To apply the defined defective argument types to the given sentence involving Alastair Campbell, let's closely analyze the nature of the argument and determine which defects, if any, are present:

**Sentence:** "In the space of a couple of days, Alastair Campbell has managed to turn an argument about the way the government presented its case for war in Iraq into an entirely different dispute about the way the BBC covered what was going on in Whitehall at the time."

Given definitions:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** This defect involves making broad claims based on limited evidence.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This defect involves presenting an argument that is incomplete because it fails to consider all possibilities or relevant factors.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This defect occurs when the argument presented doesn't lead logically to a definitive conclusion.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This defect attributes a cause-and-effect relationship without sufficient evidence.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This defect involves repeating a proposition without adding any supporting evidence.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This defect assumes a consensus or agreement that has not been demonstrated.
7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** This defect uses language that is unclear or open to multiple interpretations.

**Analysis:**

The sentence reports a change in focus from one issue (the government's presentation of its case for war in Iraq) to another (the BBC's coverage of Whitehall during that time period) attributed to Alastair Campbell.

### Identifying Defects:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument might be incomplete since it suggests there are only two arguments under dispute without acknowledging other possible relevant arguments or factors. A more complete enumeration would consider various other angles and nuances related to both the government’s and the BBC's actions.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The sentence suggests that an argument was "turned" into another dispute, but doesn't explain how or why this shift happened. It doesn't provide a solid, logical link or reasoning that leads conclusively to why attention shifted, hence the reasoning appears inconclusive.

### Application:

Given the nature and structure of the argument provided in the sentence, here's how we can apply the identified defects:

**"In the space of a couple of days, Alastair Campbell has managed to turn an argument about the way the government presented its case for war in Iraq into an entirely different dispute about the way the BBC covered what was going on in Whitehall at the time."**

- This sentence may lack completeness in presenting all relevant factors or possibilities, demonstrating **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**.
- The reasoning in the statement is somewhat inconclusive as it doesn’t provide a clear logical explanation for the shift in the argument, demonstrating **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**.

Thus, the sentence can be seen to exhibit <FE> and <IR> as per the definitions of the defective argument types.
