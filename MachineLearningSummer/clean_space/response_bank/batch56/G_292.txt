For 
The statement "Blondes are less intelligent than people with other hair colors." needs to be analyzed for defective argument types as specified. Here's the application of various defective arguments, summarized by the IDAA (Identify Defective Argument Applications):

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - The statement makes a sweeping generalization about all people with blonde hair based on no specific evidence. This is a classic example of overgeneralizing from perhaps one or a few instances to an entire group.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - The statement fails to consider the variety and diversity within the group of people with different hair colors and within the group of blondes. It provides no exhaustive list or valid statistical backing for its claim.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - There is no conclusive reasoning provided as to why blondes would be less intelligent. The statement jumps to a conclusion without presenting any substantial argument or evidence.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - The statement implies a causal relationship between hair color and intelligence without any scientific or logical basis. Hair color has no known causal link to intelligence, making the argument unsupported.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - Repeating such a statement without new evidence or rationale doesn’t make it any more valid or credible. If this statement is often echoed in society, it still holds no factual ground and therefore is classified under faulty repetition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - The statement might falsely presume a consensus or common belief that isn't backed by evidence. Assuming society widely agrees with this incorrect stereotype is a form of fallacious reasoning.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - The term “intelligent” is used ambiguously without clear definition or criteria. Intelligence can be measured in numerous ways, and without specifying how intelligence is being evaluated, the claim remains unclear and misleading.

Overall, the statement "Blondes are less intelligent than people with other hair colors." can explicitly be identified as a defective argument by testing positive for all defined defective argument types, denoted as:
- Generalization (G)
- Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
- Inconclusive Reason (IR)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
- Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
- Ambiguous Language (DEP)
