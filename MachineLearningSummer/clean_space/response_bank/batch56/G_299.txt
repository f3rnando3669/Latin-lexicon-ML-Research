To evaluate the argument provided using the framework of the defective argument types defined, we need to analyze how and where the argument might exhibit these specific defects.

Argument: 
"If America doesn’t send weapons to the Syrian rebels, they won’t be able to defend themselves against their warring dictator. They’ll lose their civil war, and that dictator will oppress them, and the Soviets will consequently carve out a sphere of influence that spreads across the entire Middle East."

Let’s break down and evaluate the argument step by step:

**1. "If America doesn’t send weapons to the Syrian rebels, they won’t be able to defend themselves against their warring dictator."**
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: This statement assumes a direct cause-and-effect relationship without sufficient evidence. It's not conclusively established that American weapons are the only or even a necessary factor for the rebels' ability to defend themselves.

**2. "They’ll lose their civil war, and that dictator will oppress them,"**
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: The argument assumes that the rebels' loss will automatically lead to oppression without considering other possible outcomes or mitigating factors.

**3. "and the Soviets will consequently carve out a sphere of influence that spreads across the entire Middle East."**
- **<G> Generalization**: This is a broad and likely exaggerated conclusion about the Soviets’ potential influence based on a single event. It generalizes the outcome of one regional conflict to the entire Middle East.
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: By asserting a chain of events without sufficient backing, the argument repeats the assumed outcomes as facts.

**4. Overall Structure**
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**: The term "sphere of influence" is vague and can be interpreted in various ways, making the argument less precise and more open to interpretation.
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: It implicitly assumes a consensus on the outcomes without proper substantiation. The argument presumes everyone agrees that these are the likely outcomes.

In conclusion, the argument “If America doesn’t send weapons to the Syrian rebels, they won’t be able to defend themselves against their warring dictator. They’ll lose their civil war, and that dictator will oppress them, and the Soviets will consequently carve out a sphere of influence that spreads across the entire Middle East," exhibits defective argument types: <IR>, <WCB>, <G>, <RR>, <DEP>, and <FU>. These defects collectively undermine the argument by relying on unsubstantiated cause-and-effect assertions, generalizations, and ambiguous or presumptuous language.
