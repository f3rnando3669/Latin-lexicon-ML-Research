For 
To analyze the argument "Every girl I've dated has been a nurse. I must only be compatible with nurses!" using the defective argument types defined, we observe the following:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument makes a sweeping generalization from a limited set of experiences (the girls the speaker has dated) to all potential romantic compatibilities. It assumes that since all previous partners were nurses, this pattern must hold universally without sufficient evidence to support this conclusion.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument fails to consider other possible professions or traits that might be compatible with the speaker. It overlooks the broad range of people and professions that could lead to a successful relationship, focusing solely on the small sample of past experiences.

Therefore, the argument "Every girl I've dated has been a nurse. I must only be compatible with nurses!" can be classified under:
- Generalization (<G>)
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
