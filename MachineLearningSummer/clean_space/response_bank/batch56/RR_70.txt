For 
The argumentative statement "This has to work so it will work." can be analyzed using the defective argument types provided. Here's the breakdown:

- **Generalization (G)**
  - This would involve making a broad statement or conclusion based on limited evidence. This particular argument does not seem to be a generalization.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
  - This is when not all relevant alternatives or factors are considered. This statement does not list alternatives or fail to consider them.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
  - This involves giving reasons that do not necessarily lead to the conclusion reached. The statement "This has to work so it will work" fits this category since the necessity (having to work) does not logically ensure the outcome (it will work).

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
  - This argument occurs when the cause and effect relationship is not sufficiently established. The statement might be seen as having insufficient causal basis because it does not provide adequate support for why needing to work would cause it to work.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
  - This occurs when the proposition is repeated without substantiation. "This has to work so it will work" could be considered a form of faulty repetition as it essentially restates the claim without providing new evidence or reasoning.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
  - This is assuming that something is true because many people think it is. The statement does not appeal to a consensus so it does not apply here.

- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**
  - This involves using vague or unclear language. The phrase itself is straightforward, so it doesnâ€™t seem to be ambiguous in this context.

Considering the definitions and applying <IDAA> (Identify Deficiency in Argument Application) to this statement:

**Defective Argument Types Identified:**
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** The necessity does not logically ensure the outcome.
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** It repeats the claim without substantiation.

Therefore, applying <IDAA> to "This has to work so it will work," we label it with:
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**
- **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**
