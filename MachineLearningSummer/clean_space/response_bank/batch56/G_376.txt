<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Types and Assigning Acronyms. Let’s apply this method to the statement “If I make an exception for you then I'll have to make an exception for everyone.”

1. **Generalization (G):** This argument type involves taking a general rule derived from a few cases and applying it broadly without proper justification.
   - Application: The statement assumes that making one exception will necessarily lead to a general rule without sufficient evidence. It generalizes the outcome from one action to all similar potential actions.
   - **Type:** <G> 

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This involves listing some cases but disregarding others that may be relevant.
   - Application: The argument doesn't consider situations where exceptions could be managed on a case-by-case basis, thereby incompletely enumerating the possibilities.
   - **Type:** <FE> 

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This involves providing reasons that do not adequately support the conclusion.
   - Application: The reason that one exception necessitates making exceptions for everyone is inconclusive without further support regarding why no intermediate steps are possible.
   - **Type:** <IR> 

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This occurs when a cause-and-effect relationship is asserted without enough evidence.
   - Application: The statement asserts a causal relationship without sufficient evidence that making one exception will cause a need to make all others.
   - **Type:** <WCB>

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This occurs when a proposition is repeated as a reason for itself without additional support.
   - Application: This type is not clearly applicable to the given statement.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This involves assuming that one's argument is supported by a broad consensus without evidence.
   - Application: This type does not seem applicable to the statement as it doesn't involve consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** This involves using unclear or ambiguous language that can lead to various interpretations.
   - Application: The language used in the statement appears clear and unambiguous for its context.
  
Thus, analyzing the statement “If I make an exception for you then I'll have to make an exception for everyone,” we can identify the following defective argument types:

- Generalization (<G>)
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)

The combined identification with their corresponding acronyms could be summarized as:
`<IDAA><G><FE><IR><WCB>`
