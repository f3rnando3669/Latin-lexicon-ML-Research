For 
The argument presented in the statement:

“While you may have concerns about my votes about the environment, I can assure you that I am an open-minded individual. What we should really discuss is my record on votes that expanded educational opportunities for all children.”

can be analyzed for defective argument types as follows:

1. **Shifting Focus (IDAA - Ignoring the Discussion At-Any-Available):** The individual avoids addressing the specific concern raised about their environmental votes by shifting the discussion to a different topic— their record on votes related to educational opportunities. This tactic sidesteps the initial issue without providing a substantive response.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The assurance of being an "open-minded individual" is an inconclusive reason. It doesn't directly address the specific concerns about the individual's environmental votes. Being open-minded does not necessarily equate to making environmentally sound voting decisions.

3. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There is an implicit suggestion that the concerns about the environment can be set aside because discussing educational opportunities is somehow presumed to be more important or universally acceptable. This presumption might not align with everyone's priorities and thus is faulty.

It's noteworthy to identify that a more thorough examination might reveal additional defective argument types, but these are the primary categories that can be applied to this specific statement based on the given definitions.
