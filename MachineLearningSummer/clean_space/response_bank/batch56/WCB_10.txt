The argument "I sneezed at the same time the power went off. My sneeze did something to make the power go off." can be analyzed and identified as a defective argument type as follows:

The argument appears to assert a causal relationship between two events: sneezing and the power going off. However, this suggested causation lacks a sufficient causal basis. Just because two events occur simultaneously does not mean that one caused the other.

Thus, this argument can be categorized under:

**<WCB> - Insufficient Causal Basis**

This type of defective argument occurs when a causal connection is claimed without adequate justification or evidence to support that connection. The mere coincidence of the sneeze and the power outage is not sufficient to establish a causal link between the two events.
