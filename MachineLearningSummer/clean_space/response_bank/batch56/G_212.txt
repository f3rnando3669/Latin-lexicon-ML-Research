For 
Applying the Identifying Defective Argument Analysis (IDAA) to the statement provided:

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The statement assumes that accepting the figurative nature of one story (Adam and Eve) automatically leads to a change in perception towards all similar Old Testament stories without considering individual nuances.
   - Example: "If you accept that the story of Adam and Eve was figurative, then you will do the same for most of the Old Testament stories of similar literary styles."

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The argument fails to consider alternative viewpoints or outcomes from accepting the figurative nature of biblical stories, presenting a narrow path without acknowledging the full spectrum of possibilities.
   - Example: "Once you accept that, you won’t be a Christian anymore; you will be a dirty atheist..."

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The reasons provided do not conclusively lead to the stated outcomes. The leap from figurative interpretation to atheism and moral decay lacks a logically sound connection.
   - Example: "Once you are there, the New Testament and the story of Jesus does not make sense…"

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - There is an insufficient causal basis suggesting that accepting biblical stories as figurative will lead to atheism and subsequent immoral behavior.
   - Example: "you will be a dirty atheist, then you will have no morals and start having sex with animals of a barnyard nature."

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - This argument does not seem to repeat a proposition that creates a faulty reasoning cycle within itself.
   - Not Applicable.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - There is an implicit assumption that a consensus exists among believers regarding the detrimental effects of viewing biblical stories figuratively.
   - Example: "So you better take the story of Adam and Eve literally..."

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - The statement uses ambiguous and emotionally charged language (e.g., "dirty atheist," "that chicken looks delicious") to elicit a strong emotional reaction rather than a logical discourse.
   - Example: "you will have no morals and start having sex with animals of a barnyard nature."

### Summary:
The provided argument demonstrates several defective argument types:
- **<G> Generalization:** Assumes figurative acceptance of one story leads logically to figurative interpretation of all similar stories.
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:** Does not consider a range of plausible perspectives.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** Reasoning does not conclusively dictate outcome.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** Unsupported causality between accepting figurative story and extreme outcomes.
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** Assumes universal consensus on the harmful effects of figurative interpretations.
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language:** Uses emotionally charged, ambiguous language to make its point.

The overall argument is significantly flawed due to its reliance on these defective argument types.
