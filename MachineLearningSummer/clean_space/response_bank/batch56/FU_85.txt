Sebastian's reasoning in this scenario can be classified under the defective argument type called Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>).

Sebastian observed that several of his friends had bought a new fidget spinner and concluded that it must be a very cool gadget and that everyone else probably thought so as well. He presumed a consensus across a larger group based on the behavior of a smaller subset (his friends), which is an unfounded generalization about the opinions or actions of the broader population. 

Therefore, the fallacy Sebastian fell into is <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).
