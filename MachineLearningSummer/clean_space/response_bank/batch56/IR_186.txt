The question "What type of propaganda uses negative words or feelings against an idea, product, or person?" refers to a specific type of propaganda tactic known as **Name-Calling**.

Applying **Identify Defective Argument Types (IDAA)** to the context of the propaganda technique involves recognizing how arguments and rhetoric can be flawed or manipulative. Hereâ€™s how the defective argument types could be relevant to understanding and analyzing name-calling propaganda:

1. **<G> Generalization**: Name-calling might involve broad generalizations about a person, group, or product without sufficient evidence, making sweeping claims that may not be true for every case.

2. **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: This could occur if the negative claims or words focus on a limited range of characteristics or incidents while ignoring positive aspects or important context.

3. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The negative words or feelings used in name-calling might not provide any substantial reasoning or evidence to support the negative view, relying instead on emotional reactions.

4. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: This might manifest if the name-calling attributes negative qualities or outcomes to the target without a justified causal connection.

5. **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: In name-calling, the same negative terms or phrases might be repeated over and over in an attempt to reinforce the negative association, without providing new evidence or reasoning.

6. **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: There could be an assumption that everyone agrees with the negative attributes being ascribed, even if this consensus is not based on evidence or if there is significant disagreement.

7. **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**: Name-calling often employs vague or ambiguous negative terms that can be interpreted in multiple ways, making it harder to challenge the negativity effectively.

By understanding these defective argument types, one can better identify and critically evaluate the use of name-calling in propaganda and other forms of persuasive communication.
