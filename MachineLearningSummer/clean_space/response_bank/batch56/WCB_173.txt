For 
To analyze the statement "You're not feeling well because you use your phone so much." using the defective argument types defined, we can identify potential flaws in the argument:

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This argument suggests a causal relationship between phone usage and not feeling well without enough evidence to substantiate it. There could be many reasons why someone is not feeling well, and asserting phone usage as the cause requires more scientific or empirical backing.

This argument type is applicable here because the statement fails to provide adequate proof or reasoning to establish a direct causal link between phone usage and the individual's health condition. It presumes causation from mere correlation or an anecdotal observation, which is insufficient and logically flawed.

Therefore, the label for this assessment of the statement would be **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**.
