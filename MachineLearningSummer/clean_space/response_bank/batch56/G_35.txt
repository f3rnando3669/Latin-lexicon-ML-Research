To apply the <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Application) framework to the statement provided:

"My friend swears the mechanic at that shop overcharged her last week and after looking at her invoice it seems she’s right. So don’t take your business there, as you’ll definitely get ripped off."

we analyze it for any defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: The statement makes a broad conclusion about the shop (that everyone will get ripped off) based on a single instance (the friend's experience). 

   **Example Argument Type**: <G>
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: There may be other experiences or instances where customers were charged fairly, but these are not acknowledged.

   **Example Argument Type**: <FE>
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning is inconclusive. One instance does not sufficiently prove that the mechanic consistently overcharges all customers.

   **Example Argument Type**: <IR>

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument implies a causal relationship (that taking your business there will result in being overcharged) without sufficient evidence that the shop’s pricing is always unfair.

    **Example Argument Type**: <WCB>
    
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The argument does not display faulty repetition.

    **Example Argument Type**: N/A

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument does not claim a widespread consensus.

    **Example Argument Type**: N/A

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language used in the argument does not display significant ambiguity.

    **Example Argument Type**: N/A

In summary, the key defective argument types in this statement are:

1. <G> Generalization
2. <FE> Incomplete Enumeration
3. <IR> Inconclusive Reason
4. <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis

Identification of defective argument types helps in critically evaluating the strength and validity of arguments made.
