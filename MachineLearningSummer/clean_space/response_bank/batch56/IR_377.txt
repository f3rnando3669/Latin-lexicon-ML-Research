IDAA, which appears to be a method for identifying and defining argumentation flaws, can be used to analyze the argument "Words with strong feelings that bring about feelings in the reader. Strong words (+ or -) specifically used to sway the reader."

Upon closer inspection, the statement itself doesn't present a clear argument but rather describes a rhetorical technique. However, we can assess potential defective arguments that might arise from the abusive use of strong words meant to sway the reader. Hereâ€™s an analysis applying the previously defined defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: 
   - If the statement implies that all uses of strong words are manipulative and meant to sway the reader, it can be seen as an overgeneralization. Not all uses of emotive language are manipulative; they can sometimes express genuine sentiment or passion.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The statement could be criticized for presenting an incomplete perspective. It mentions strong words that evoke feelings but doesn't enumerate other factors that might influence the reader, such as logical reasoning, evidence, and context.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: 
   - The argument that strong words are specifically used to sway the reader might be inconclusive if it fails to provide enough evidence or logical foundation to demonstrate that such language always has the intended swaying effect.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - If the statement suggests a causal relationship between strong words and shifting reader opinion without adequate evidence, it would suffer from an insufficient causal basis. Not all strong words necessarily cause a change in the reader's views.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - If the statement repeats the idea that strong words sway readers without providing new supporting evidence or rationale, it could be considered a faulty repetition of proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - There might be an assumption that there is a general consensus that strong words sway readers. If the statement assumes agreement without substantiation, it would fall under presumptuous consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - The term "strong words" could be considered ambiguous. What qualifies as a "strong word"? There needs to be a clear definition or context for the term to avoid ambiguous language.

By applying IDAA, the argumentation flaws related to the use of emotive language in rhetoric can be identified and scrutinized, revealing areas where more precision or additional evidence may be needed to strengthen the argument.
