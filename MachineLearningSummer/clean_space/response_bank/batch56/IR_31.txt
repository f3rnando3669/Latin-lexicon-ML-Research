For 
To apply <IDAA> (identify defective argument types) to the argument "Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist and perhaps the foremost expert in the field, says that evolution is true. Therefore, it's true," we need to identify if there are any flaws among the defined defective argument types.

Here’s the argument outlined and analyzed against each defined defective argument type:

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - This argument doesn't involve a broad generalization from specific cases. Therefore, Generalization is not a fit.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - The argument does not involve an incomplete list of supporting examples. Therefore, Incomplete Enumeration is not applicable.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - The argument partially fits here because it relies solely on Dawkins' authority as an expert without additional evidence. This presents an insufficient basis for the conclusion.
   
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - The argument doesn’t present a causal relationship, so Insufficient Causal Basis does not apply here.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
   - The argument is a form of appeal to authority, rather than simply repeating a proposition without support. Hence, Faulty Repetition of Proposition isn’t applicable.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - The argument does not claim consensus or imply that because others agree, it must be true. Therefore, Presumptuous Consensus does not apply here.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - The argument is clear in its language and definitions, so Ambiguous Language doesn’t fit.

After evaluation, the defective argument type **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** seems to be the most applicable here, as the argument relies on authority rather than providing substantive evidence for the truth of evolution.

Therefore, applying <IDAA> to the argument leads to:
- **<IR>**: The argument relies on authority rather than direct evidence, which is an insufficient reason to conclude that the claim is true.
