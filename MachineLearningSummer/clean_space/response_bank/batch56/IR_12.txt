For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Attribute Analysis. Let's analyze the statement:

"Kerry’s plan will raise taxes by at least $900 billion his first hundred days."

When assessing whether this argument is flawed, we need to consider if it falls into one or more of the defective argument types defined earlier.

1. **Generalization (G)**
   - This argument does not seem to generalize from a specific instance to a broader conclusion. It's a specific claim about Kerry’s plan.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
   - The argument makes a claim about Kerry’s plan without providing enough details, evidence, or considering other possible outcomes. This could be seen as an incomplete enumeration since it does not list other potential factors that could affect tax increases.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
   - The reasoning behind the claim is not provided, making it potentially inconclusive. There is no rationale, context, or evidence given to support why or how taxes will increase by $900 billion.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
   - The argument asserts a causal relationship (Kerry’s plan will cause a $900 billion tax increase) without establishing adequate grounds for causation. Therefore, it may have an insufficient causal basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
   - This statement does not repeat itself; hence it does not apply here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
   - The argument does not necessarily suggest that a consensus exists on this point or presume agreement without evidence.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**
   - The term "Kerry’s plan" could be seen as somewhat ambiguous without further detail, but it’s not the most significant issue with the argument.

**Analysis**:
- The argument seems to primarily suffer from Incomplete Enumeration (FE) and Inconclusive Reason (IR) due to the lack of supporting evidence and reasoning.
- It may also have an Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB) as it fails to establish a causal link beyond the assertion.
  
Thus, applying <IDAA>, we can summarize that the statement:
"Kerry’s plan will raise taxes by at least $900 billion his first hundred days."
is characterized by:

- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: It lacks comprehensive evidence or detail supporting the claim.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The reasoning behind the claim is not provided.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: It fails to adequately establish a causative link between Kerry’s plan and the tax increase.
