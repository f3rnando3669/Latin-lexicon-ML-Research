For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Arguments Application. Let's apply it to the statement provided:

"I am voting for Smith for President. My whole family is Democrat, so I'll be voting that way, too."

Let's identify the defective argument types present in this statement:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The speaker suggests that because their whole family is Democrat, they too will vote Democrat. This ignores other essential factors and reasons someone might consider when voting, such as the specific policies, qualifications, or character of the candidate.

2. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The speaker assumes that family consensus (all being Democrats) is a sufficient reason to make a personal voting decision. This presumption overlooks individual critical thinking and independent evaluation of the candidates.

In conclusion, the statement "I am voting for Smith for President. My whole family is Democrat, so I'll be voting that way, too." primarily demonstrates the defective argument types of Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>) and Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>).
