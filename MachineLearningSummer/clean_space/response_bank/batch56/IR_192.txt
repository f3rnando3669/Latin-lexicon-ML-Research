For 
To apply the Identified Defective Argument Analysis (IDAA) to the statement "His opinions about sports mean nothing - he can barely tie his own shoes!", we need to determine if it corresponds to any of the defective argument types defined earlier. 

First, let's examine the categories we've defined:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Making broad claims based on limited or insufficient evidence.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Failing to consider all relevant cases or options.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Drawing a conclusion that doesn't logically follow from the premises.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Claiming a causal relationship without adequate justification.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Repetition of a statement without proper evidence or logical reasoning.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Assuming that a general consensus exists without sufficient evidence.
7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: Using vague or unclear terms to make a point.

The statement in question, "His opinions about sports mean nothing - he can barely tie his own shoes!" seems to be an example of an ad hominem attack. Instead of addressing the opinions about sports, the argument attacks the person's ability to tie their shoes, implying that this personal characteristic invalidates their opinions on sports.

This statement falls under the category of **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, as it attempts to draw a conclusion (his opinions about sports are meaningless) that does not logically follow from the premise (he can barely tie his own shoes). The ability to tie shoes has no logical connection to the validity of someone's opinions on sports.

Thus, the identified defective argument type for the statement is:

**<IR> Inconclusive Reason**.
