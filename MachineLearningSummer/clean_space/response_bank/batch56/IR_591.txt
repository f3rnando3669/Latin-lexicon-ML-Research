For 
To apply the IDAA (Identify Defective Argument Types in the Assertion) method to the statement "Ms. Drayer, the smartest person in the universe, says the debate is the best class, therefore it is," we need to identify which defective argument types are present in this assertion. Here's the analysis:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - This type is not obviously applicable as the statement does not generalize from a limited set of observations.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - This does not fit as there's no enumeration or list being incompletely used.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - This might fit because the reason given (Ms. Drayer's intelligence) does not conclusively prove the conclusion (the debate being the best class). The intelligence of Ms. Drayer does not logically necessitate that her opinion is correct.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - This isn’t directly applicable since the argument does not address a causal relationship.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - This does not apply as the argument does not involve repetitive assertion.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - This does not fit since no consensus or majority opinion is being claimed.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - This may apply slightly, as terms like "smartest person in the universe" are hyperbolic and not clearly defined, leading to ambiguity.

Based on the definitions and the analysis, the most fitting defective argument types for the assertion are:

**Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The argument relies on the supposed authority of Ms. Drayer without providing a substantial reason that directly supports the conclusion.

**Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The statement’s hyperbolic language ("smartest person in the universe") adds ambiguity because it is an exaggerated and unvalidated claim that does not provide a clear, rational basis for the conclusion.

Thus, the defective argument types in the given assertion are <IR> and <DEP>.
