The argument provided can be analyzed using the defined defective argument types to identify the flawed reasoning within it:

**Statement:**
"My opponent claims that water pollution is endangering our city waters. But have you thought about all of the air pollution in China? Where they have to wear masks sometimes in the city? That's what we really need to worry about."

This statement appears to be a form of **Red Herring** or an attempt to distract from the original issue (water pollution) by bringing up a different issue (air pollution in China). This type of argument diverts attention away from the topic at hand rather than addressing it directly. 

Hereâ€™s the application of the identified defective arguments types:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement shifts the focus to air pollution in China, without fully addressing the claim about water pollution in the speaker's city. The speaker does not provide enough information on water pollution but rather lists another unrelated issue.
  
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The speaker repeats a different, unrelated concern (air pollution in China) rather than refuting or confirming the validity of the original claim (water pollution). 

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The speaker implies that their audience should be more concerned with air pollution than water pollution, assuming a consensus without providing adequate justification or evidence to prioritize one issue over the other.

Therefore, the argument can be considered defective mainly through these three types:

**<FE>: Incomplete Enumeration**
**<RR>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition**
**<FU>: Presumptuous Consensus**

With this analysis, it is clear that the argument fails to adequately address the original concern about water pollution in the city by improperly shifting the focus to air pollution elsewhere.
