For 
It appears that you haven't defined the defective argument type labeled as <IDAA>. Based on the context and the other defective argument types you've described, it is likely that <IDAA> refers to some kind of argumentative flaw or fallacy, but without the specific definition, it is challenging to apply it systematically.

However, I can still analyze the statement and the reply to identify potential argument flaws according to the other types you've defined:

**Statement**: "The purpose of the Cadet Program is to prepare youth for Air Force Basic Military Training."

**Reply**: "This is true because I heard it from the Wing Commander."

Here are the potential argument flaws present in this exchange:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The reply relies solely on one authority figure—the Wing Commander—without considering other possible sources or evidence that might contribute to understanding the purpose of the Cadet Program.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reply does not provide a substantive reason for why the initial statement is true. Hearing something from the Wing Commander does not inherently make the statement true, and it does not address why the Cadet Program’s purpose is what it is purported to be.

3. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The reply essentially repeats the assertion by appealing to an authority (Wing Commander) without providing additional justification or reasons for the assertion.

4. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The reply presumes that the Wing Commander's opinion is universally accepted as fact, without offering explanation or validation of this consensus.

To improve the argument, the reply could include more robust evidence or reasoning that is independent of mere authority:

- Reference to official documentation or mission statements from the Cadet Program.
- Statistical data or information about Cadet Program outcomes.
- Testimonies from multiple credible sources about the nature and objectives of the Cadet Program.

In summary, without knowing the specific definition of <IDAA>, we have identified several possible defective argument types within the statement and reply using the definitions provided. If <IDAA> were defined, it might align with one of these or potentially identify another aspect of the flawed argument.
