For 
The argument provided can be analyzed using the defined defective argument types:

"Since Anna Camacho became vice president of the parent-teacher association, student performance has declined and teacher morale is down. We on the school board believe that Camacho bears sole responsibility for the downtrend."

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument attributes the decline in student performance and teacher morale solely to Anna Camacho becoming vice president without providing sufficient evidence or exploring other potential causes for these issues. Causation is presumed based purely on a temporal correlation, which is a common fallacy.

To illustrate:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument does not necessarily generalize from a few instances to a broad conclusion.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not enumerate a limited set inaccurately to reach its conclusion.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: There could be an element of this, as the reasons given are not conclusive in linking Camacho directly to the decline.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The argument does not repeat propositions to create a faulty impression of truth.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument does suggest consensus but does not do so in a way that falls under this specific defect, unless if the "We on the school board" assertion presumes agreement without basis.
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The language in the argument does not appear to be ambiguous.

In conclusion, the primary defective argument type that applies here is **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
