For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Types and Attributes) to the statement "But, Dad, I know you smoked when you were my age, so how can you tell me not to do it?", we need to analyze the argument for any defective argument types defined.

1. **Generalization (G)**: This defect involves making a broad conclusion based on limited evidence. The statement at hand doesn't seem to generalize but rather points to a specific instance— the father's past behavior.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This defect lists examples incompletely to support a conclusion. Here, the argument does not list multiple instances but focuses solely on the father's past actions.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This defect includes reasons that do not logically lead to the conclusion. The argument could be seen as inconclusive because the father's past smoking does not logically justify or validate the child's smoking. An important point (health risks, changing perspectives) is missing which would be necessary to make a strong argument.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This defect involves a lack of sufficient cause-and-effect relationship. The argument does not demonstrate a cause-effect relationship between the father’s past behavior and what is permissible for the child.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This defect involves repeating a proposition without adding new information. This argument does not appear to be a repetitive assertion but instead attempts to reason based on the father’s past actions.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This defect assumes agreement or consensus without verification. The argument assumes the father's past actions somehow provide a consensual or justified basis for the child’s behavior, without considering current context or reasons.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This defect occurs when language is vague or unclear. The statement is quite direct and does not seem to suffer from ambiguity.

Thus, the primary defective argument types present in the statement are:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument's reason (father's past actions) does not conclusively justify the child’s current behavior.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument presumes that the father's past behavior implicitly consents or justifies the same behavior in the child.

In summary, the argument "But, Dad, I know you smoked when you were my age, so how can you tell me not to do it?" can be primarily identified as having defective argument types of Inconclusive Reason (<IR>) and Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>).
