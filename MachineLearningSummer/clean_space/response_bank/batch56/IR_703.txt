For 
<IDAA> is not defined in the initial list of defective arguments you provided. However, based on the description of the argument, it seems to fall under a fallacy typically known as "appeal to tradition" or "argumentum ad antiquitatem."

Since its specific type is not defined in your list, here is a suggestion for defining and labeling it:

<IDAA>: (We could define this as "Insufficient Deference to Antiquity Argument")
Argues that "we've always done it that way." In other words, because something worked in the past, it is the correct thing to do.

The segment provided fits this classification perfectly:
<IDAA> Argues that "we've always done it that way." In other words, because something worked in the past, it is the correct thing to do.

If you prefer one of the already defined defective argument types, the argument "we've always done it that way" could be somewhat related to <G> Generalization, as it implies a conclusion based on a broad historical practice. However, the specific emphasis on tradition and past practice makes it distinct, thus warranting its own defined category.
