For 
The statement in question is:

"Teachers don't have lives. My best friend said her English class was hard, and the one I'm in is hard too. All English classes must be hard."

Let's apply the specified defective argument types to this statement:

1. **Generalization (G)**: 
   - The argument generalizes based on limited evidence. 
   - "All English classes must be hard" is a generalization based specifically on only two experiences (your friend's and your own).

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - The statement makes a sweeping conclusion without considering other possibilities.
   - It assumes that because two English classes are hard, all English classes everywhere must be hard, ignoring variations in teaching methods, curriculum, and individual student experiences.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The reasoning provided is insufficient to support the conclusion.
   - "My best friend said her English class was hard, and the one I'm in is hard too" does not conclusively prove that all English classes are hard. This small sample size lacks the robustness to offer a definitive conclusion.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - There's an implied causation without sufficient evidence.
   - Just because two English classes are hard doesn't mean the inherent nature of English classes is to be hard.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - Repeating a premise doesn't strengthen an argument, but this doesn't quite apply to the context of the given argument since it's not literally repeating the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - There's an assumption that the small sample size (your friend and you) reflects the consensus of all English course experiences.
   - It assumes unanimity of difficulty among English classes without actual evidence of a broader consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - The statement "Teachers don't have lives" is vague and ambiguous.
   - It could be misinterpreted in various ways (e.g., teachers are very dedicated, teachers don't have personal lives, etc.) without further context.

Thus, "Teachers don't have lives. My best friend said her English class was hard, and the one I'm in is hard too. All English classes must be hard." can be classified with the following defective argument types:

- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)** (for the first part: "Teachers don't have lives")

By analyzing the statement using these defective argument types, we can see the numerous logical weaknesses present in the argument.
