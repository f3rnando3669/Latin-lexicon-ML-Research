For 
To apply the defective argument analysis (<IDAA>) to the statement "Children who play violent video games act more violently than those who don’t," we must identify if any of the defined defective argument types apply to it. 

**Analysis of the Statement:**

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This statement could be seen as a generalization because it makes a broad claim about all children based on potentially limited evidence. It lacks nuance and doesn’t take into account individual differences or other factors that could influence violent behavior.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement might reflect incomplete enumeration because it doesn’t consider other potential factors contributing to violent behavior, such as environment, upbringing, socioeconomic status, mental health, etc. It simplifies the cause to only the exposure to violent video games.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Without sufficient evidence, the reasoning in the statement could be considered inconclusive. It makes a definitive claim without providing supporting data or research findings that directly link violent video games to increased violent behavior in children.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The statement attributes a causal relationship between violent video games and violent behavior without demonstrating a sufficient causal basis. Correlation does not necessarily imply causation, and there could be other mediating factors involved.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The statement does not appear to involve repetition, so this defective argument type does not apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: If the statement is presented as common knowledge or as something generally accepted without backing evidence, it might be presumptuous consensus. However, the given sentence does not explicitly imply a consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The statement's language isn’t particularly ambiguous, though terms like "act more violently" could benefit from a clearer definition or context. It is somewhat clear but not necessarily vague.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the above analysis, the following defective argument types apply to the statement:
- Generalization (<G>)
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)

Therefore, we can articulate the issues with the statement "Children who play violent video games act more violently than those who don’t" by highlighting these defective arguments, illustrating that the claim needs more comprehensive evidence and specificity to be considered valid.
