For 
To categorize the argument "Forty million people won't be wrong. Please buy the latest iPhone 12." using the defective argument types defined earlier, we need to identify the main flaw within the argument. 

The assertion "Forty million people won't be wrong" implies that because a large number of people believe something, it must be true or correct. This kind of reasoning relies on the presumed consensus of many people to support the argument.

Given the argument types defined, the most fitting categorization for this argument is:

<FU> Presumptuous Consensus.

Thus, this argument falls under the defective argument type <FU>, as it is relying on the supposed agreement of a large number of people to validate its claim without providing substantive evidence for the quality or value of the iPhone 12.
