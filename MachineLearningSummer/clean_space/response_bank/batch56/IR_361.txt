For 
The argument "argues that a proposition is true because it has not yet been proven false" fits into the defective argument type known as:

- **<IDAA> Argumentum ad Ignorantiam (Argument from Ignorance):** This fallacy occurs when it is asserted that a proposition is true because it has not yet been proven false, or vice versa.

So the application of **<IDAA> (Argumentum ad Ignorantiam)** to the given argument would be:

**<IDAA>**: "The proposition is argued to be true solely on the basis that it has not been proven false."
