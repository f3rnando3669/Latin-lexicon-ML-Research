For 
In the given argument, "My grandmother smoked for 80 years and died at 100. Obviously, smoking isn’t harmful," the reasoning employed is flawed. Let's analyze it based on the defective argument types you've defined:

1. **Generalization (G)**: The conclusion that smoking isn’t harmful is based on the experience of a single individual (the grandmother). This represents an overgeneralization from one anecdote to a broader claim about the effects of smoking.

2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument assumes a causal relationship between smoking and the grandmother's longevity without adequate evidence. It overlooks other potential factors that could have contributed to her long life, such as genetics or overall lifestyle.

By examining the argument through the lens of the defined defective argument types, it clearly falls under:
- **Generalization (G)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

Therefore, the defective argument can be identified as <IDAA: G, WCB>.
