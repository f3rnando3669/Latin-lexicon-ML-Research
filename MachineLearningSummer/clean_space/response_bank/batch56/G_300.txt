For 
The argument "All women care about are their looks" can be evaluated using the defective argument types you've defined. Here's an application of each type to this statement:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This statement is a classic example of hasty generalization. It takes a stereotype and applies it universally to all women, without acknowledging individual differences.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement overlooks other possible interests and concerns that women might have. It falsely restricts the scope of women's interests to their looks.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The argument lacks a solid foundation or evidence to support the claim. No reason or evidence is provided to justify why looks are supposedly the sole concern for all women.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: There is no causal link provided to explain why women would care only about their looks. Even if some women prioritize their appearance, the statement fails to explain why that would be the only thing they care about.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The argument assumes that just stating "all women care about are their looks" is enough to make it true without providing additional support or evidence.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The statement presumes that there's a general consensus that all women care mainly about their looks, which is not supported by evidence. It presupposes an agreement that may not exist.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The term "care about" is vague and can be interpreted in various ways. Additionally, it simplifies a complex issue into an overly broad statement without specifying the context or nature of this "caring."

From this analysis, we can see that the statement "All women care about are their looks" is flawed through multiple defective argument types including Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Presumptuous Consensus, and Ambiguous Language.
