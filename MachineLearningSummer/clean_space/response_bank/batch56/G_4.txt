For 
<IDAA> stands for the Identification and Analysis of Defective Arguments.

To apply <IDAA> to Ammar's statement:

"We've got to stop them from banning poetry. Once they start banning one form of literature, they will never stop. Next thing you know, they will be burning all the books!" Ammar demanded.

1. **Identify Defective Arguments**:
   - The statement contains a slippery slope argument, which assumes that taking a specific action will inevitably lead to a chain of related (and usually negative) events.
   
2. **Analyze Each Defective Argument**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: There is a hasty generalization that banning poetry will lead to banning all forms of literature.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not consider all possible outcomes or steps between banning poetry and burning books, presenting an incomplete enumeration of potential consequences.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasoning is weak and does not conclusively establish that banning poetry will lead to burning all books.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: There is an insufficient causal basis to claim that one specific action (banning poetry) will directly lead to an extreme and unrelated action (burning all books).

In summary, Ammarâ€™s statement suffers from multiple defective argument types, including Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, and Insufficient Causal Basis.
