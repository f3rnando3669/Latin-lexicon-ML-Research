For 
To analyze the argument "All of my friends are coming to my birthday party. If Micah doesn't, she might as well tell me that she doesn't like me." using the defective argument types described, let's break down the argument and see which types apply:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   The speaker implies that since all their other friends are coming, Micah should too. This seems to generalize the behavior or intention of all friends to Micah without considering individual circumstances.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   The argument does not cover all possible reasons why Micah might not attend the party. There could be various justifiable reasons such as prior commitments, health issues, etc. This presents an incomplete enumeration of the possible reasons for her absence.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   The speaker concludes that if Micah does not attend, it means she does not like the speaker. This is an inconclusive reason because not attending the party has many potential explanations that do not necessarily relate to Micah's feelings towards the speaker.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   There is an implied causal relationship between attending the party and liking the speaker. While attending might often indicate a positive relationship, not attending does not sufficiently cause or prove a lack of affection.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   This type doesn't seem to apply directly here as there’s no repeated proposition. However, there's a narrative built on an unsubstantiated assumption.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   There's a suggestion that the consensus (all friends coming) reflects on Micah’s feelings. It’s a presumptive stance where the speaker assumes a universal norm that should apply to Micah without direct evidence regarding her personal situation.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   The phrase "she might as well tell me that she doesn't like me" is loaded with emotional context but ambiguous regarding its logical underpinning and Micah's actual position if she doesn’t attend the party.

Based on the identified types, the argument could be critically analyzed as follows:

"This argument represents <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, and potentially <G>:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The speaker doesn’t consider various reasonable and innocuous reasons why Micah might not attend the party.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Concluding that not attending the party equates to disliking the speaker is not a sufficiently supported inference.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** There is a lack of sufficient causal basis to claim that not attending the party indicates a personal dislike.
- **Generalization (<G>):** The assumption that all friends attending implies Micah should attend relies on an overgeneralization of individual actions.

Thus, the claim "If Micah doesn't come to the party, she doesn't like me" is logically flawed as it uses incomplete reasoning and overgeneralization without sufficient causal or comprehensive basis."
