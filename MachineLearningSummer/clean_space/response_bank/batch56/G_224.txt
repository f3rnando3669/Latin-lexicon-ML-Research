For 
Certainly! To apply the defective arguments to the statement "Asians make lousy athletes, but do well at the Math Olympiad.":

#### <G> Generalization:
This statement generalizes a whole group of people based on limited evidence or stereotypes. It assumes that all Asians fit into these specific categories (lousy athletes and good at the Math Olympiad) without considering individual variations.

#### <FE> Incomplete Enumeration:
The statement doesn't consider the wide range of abilities within any group. There are many Asians who excel in various athletic endeavors and those who may not do well at math competitions. By not accounting for exceptions, it presents a skewed view.

#### <IR> Inconclusive Reason:
There is no supporting evidence provided to substantiate the claim that "Asians make lousy athletes, but do well at the Math Olympiad." The reasons behind such a broad statement are unclear and unsubstantiated.

#### <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:
The statement fails to establish any causal relationship. It doesn't explain why Asians would generally be poor athletes or good at mathâ€”it simply asserts it without a causal basis.

#### <RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:
The statement could potentially be the result of repetition of a stereotype rather than a conclusion drawn from valid reasoning or evidence.

#### <FU> Presumptuous Consensus:
The statement assumes consensus on these stereotypes without providing any evidence that such agreement exists within informed communities. It presumes that such generalizations are widely accepted or true.

#### <DEP> Ambiguous Language:
The terms "lousy athletes" and "do well at the Math Olympiad" are vague and ambiguous. What qualifies as a "lousy athlete"? How well does someone need to perform in the Math Olympiad to be considered doing well? Such ambiguity can lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations.

By examining the statement through each of these defective argument types, it's clear that it is fundamentally flawed and based on stereotypes, lacking evidence, clarity, and comprehensive reasoning.
