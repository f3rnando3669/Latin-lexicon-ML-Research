For 
The passage "I bought a ticket to win a new car at the mall, since I have never won anything like that in the past." can be analyzed for potential types of defective arguments:

Let's look at each type individually to see if it applies:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This type of argument involves drawing a broad conclusion from a small sample size. The statement doesn't seem to be generalizing from a few specific cases to a broad conclusion, so this does not seem applicable.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This occurs when not all possibilities are considered. The statement primarily focuses on the individual's past experience, making a specific case rather than omitting possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This involves drawing a conclusion from reasons that do not necessarily support it. The individual claims that because they've never won something like this in the past, they bought the ticket. This is inconclusive because past experiences do not provide a logical reason for future results in a random event. **This argument can be classified under inconclusive reason (IR).**

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This type of argument assumes a causal relationship without sufficient evidence. There is no clear causal claim in the statement, so this doesn't apply.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This involves repeating a statement or claim without providing new evidence. The statement is a single claim about one action, so repetition doesn't apply here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This assumes that a consensus or common belief validates a claim without actual evidence. The statement is a personal anecdote and does not make any consensus claims.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This occurs when language with multiple meanings is used to make unclear arguments. Here the language is clear; therefore, this doesn't apply.

Applying **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** is appropriate for the statement: "I bought a ticket to win a new car at the mall, since I have never won anything like that in the past." The past lack of wins does not logically support the likelihood of a win this time.
