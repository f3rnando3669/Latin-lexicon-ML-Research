The argument presented can be analyzed as follows:

**"Joey's refrigerator broke after Rachel moved in; therefore, Rachel caused Joey's refrigerator to break."**

This argument can be classified under:

**Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

Explanation: The argument assumes a causal relationship between Rachel moving in and the refrigerator breaking without sufficient evidence to establish such a link. Merely stating that one event occurred after another does not provide an adequate causal basis to conclude that Rachel moving in caused the refrigerator to break. This type of reasoning exemplifies the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy, where it is assumed that if one event follows another, the first must be the cause of the second.
