The dialogue provided is an instance of an argumentum ad hominem, which is when someone attacks the person making an argument rather than addressing the argument itself. However, it seems you want to analyze this using a specific defective argument designation, namely <IDAA>.

To apply <IDAA> (which I will infer as Invalid Diversion by Ad Hominem Attack), you can break down the conversation as follows:

1. **Charlie’s Argument**: 
   - Claim: Fast food is filled with salt, fat, and added sugars.
   - Conclusion: We need better regulation of the industry.

2. **Bob’s Response**:
   - Attack: Bob calls Charlie a hypocrite.
   - Example: Bob mentions Charlie eating unhealthy fast food recently.

Analysis:
- **Charlie’s Argument Type**: Charlie presents a reasoned argument about the need for better regulation of the fast food industry based on its unhealthy content.
- **Bob’s Response**: Instead of addressing the argument about regulation and the unhealthy content of fast food, Bob attacks Charlie personally by pointing out his hypocritical behavior.

Therefore, Bob’s response can be categorized as a defective argument type:
- **<IDAA> Invalid Diversion by Ad Hominem Attack**: Bob diverts from the topic of unhealthy fast food regulation to attack Charlie's personal behavior, which does not invalidate Charlie’s original argument about the need for regulation.

Thus, the analysis clearly shows that Bob's argument falls under <IDAA> as he uses an ad hominem attack to divert from the original issue presented by Charlie.
