For 
The argument "If we legalize pot, the next thing you know people will want to legalize meth and heroin." can be analyzed for defective argument types as follows:

1. **Slippery Slope** - The argument presents a slippery slope where legalizing marijuana (pot) is asserted to inevitably lead to legalizing much harder controlled substances like meth and heroin, without providing solid evidence that one will lead to the other.
   - **Type**: <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)

2. **Faulty Comparison** - This argument assumes a direct and certain progression from legalizing marijuana to legalizing much more dangerous substances without considering the many legislative, social, and cultural factors that differentiate these substances.
   - **Type**: <G> (Generalization) 

Therefore, applying the defective argument analysis yields the following types for this statement:

- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**
- **<G> (Generalization)**
