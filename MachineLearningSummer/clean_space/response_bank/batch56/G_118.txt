For 
Applying In Defective Argument Analysis Approach (IDAA) to the statement "There was a fight at school today. Violence is a growing problem in school," we need to evaluate whether the reasoning contains any identified defective argument types.

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument type occurs when a broad statement is made based on limited evidence.
   - **Analysis**: The statement might make a broad generalization about violence in schools based on a single event (a fight). This could mean that the generalization is unsupported by sufficient evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This occurs when an argument does not account for all pertinent instances.
   - **Analysis**: The statement provides an example of one fight and then concludes that violence is a growing problem. Without a comprehensive enumeration of all instances of violence, the claim may be incomplete.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This occurs when the reason provided does not sufficiently support the conclusion.
   - **Analysis**: The fight mentioned might not conclusively establish that violence is increasing overall. Other factors could be at play, and the conclusion might be drawn prematurely without more data.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This occurs when the cause attributed to a situation is not sufficiently established.
   - **Analysis**: The statement does not provide evidence to link a single fight with a larger trend of increasing violence. There’s a lack of causal basis for the conclusion.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This occurs when a statement is repeated as evidence without additional support.
   - **Analysis**: This defect does not appear applicable here as there’s no repetition of a proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This occurs when a claim is presented as if a consensus exists without evidence.
   - **Analysis**: The conclusion about violence being a growing problem could imply a broader consensus without providing evidence or representing multiple viewpoints.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This occurs when ambiguous language is used, leading to unclear propositions.
   - **Analysis**: The term "growing problem" is somewhat ambiguous and may lack clarity. It’s not measured or defined in this context, potentially leading to misinterpretation.

**Conclusion based on IDAA**:
The statement "There was a fight at school today. Violence is a growing problem in school," primarily suffers from **Generalization (G)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, and **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**. It generalizes a significant issue based on a single instance, does not enumerate other instances, provides an inconclusive reason, lacks a sufficient causal basis, and uses somewhat ambiguous language.
