For 
To apply the concepts defined as defective argument types to the statement "She has always associated with shady people, so she must not be trustworthy," we need to identify the type of defective argument(s) that this statement exemplifies. Here are the potential defective argument types that could apply:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This applies because the argument is making a sweeping generalization based on her associations with "shady people." It assumes that because she has been around people of questionable character, she herself is not trustworthy, which may not be true in all cases.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This could also apply because the argument might be selectively presenting information (i.e., her association with shady people) without considering other factors or counterexamples that might provide a fuller picture of her trustworthiness.

Considering these observations, we could identify the argument as a Generalization (<G>) and potentially an Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>) if there is a lack of comprehensive evidence provided.

So, applying IDAA (Identification of Defective Argument Application):

- Generalization (<G>)
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)

Thus, the argument "She has always associated with shady people, so she must not be trustworthy" is an example of **<G>** Generalization and may also involve **<FE>** Incomplete Enumeration.
