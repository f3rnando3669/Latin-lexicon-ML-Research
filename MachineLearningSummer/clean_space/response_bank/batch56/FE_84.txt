Sure, let's break down the argument using the defined defective argument types and identify any relevant issues it may have.

The argument is:

**"If you can't prove that Ken had an affair with the nanny, then he's been faithful to his wife."**

1. **Generalization (G):** This argument might suffer from a generalization if it's implying that not being able to prove an affair necessarily means being faithful, which oversimplifies a complex situation. It generalizes the concept of fidelity based on the absence of proof.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument assumes only two possibilities: either Ken had an affair, or he was faithful. However, there could be many other nuanced situations that this argument does not consider, making it an incomplete enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reasoning that follows from the argument is inconclusive; it suggests that the lack of evidence of infidelity implies fidelity, which is not a logically sound conclusion. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The argument might claim causation without sufficient basis: not proving an affair does not necessarily cause or imply fidelity. There could be other unexamined causes that should be considered.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** In this argument, there is no repetition of a proposition, faulty or otherwise, so this defective argument type does not apply here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There is no claim made about a consensus in the argument, so this defective argument type is not applicable here.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The argument itself does not particularly use ambiguous language, as the terms "proving an affair" and "faithful" are clear in this context.

In conclusion, the defective argument types that apply here are Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), and Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB). 

The primary issue is <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) because the core of the argument is flawed: just because an affair cannot be proven does not logically entail that Ken is faithful. Absence of evidence does not equate to evidence of absence. Incomplete Enumeration (FE) and Generalization (G) also significantly affect the overall statement.
