For 
Applying <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Attributes) to the statement:

"Everyone is buying the new iPhone thatâ€™s coming out this weekend. You have to buy it too."

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The statement implies that because "everyone" is buying the new iPhone, it is a universally good idea. This is an overgeneralization because it assumes that what is good for some (or even many) is necessarily good for everyone without considering individual circumstances.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The statement does not provide a comprehensive list or evidence to back up the claim that "everyone" is buying the new iPhone. It fails to account for people who may not be interested in the new iPhone or cannot afford it.

3. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - By saying "everyone is buying," the statement assumes a collective agreement or consensus that may not actually exist. It presumes that there is a unanimous decision without verification.

Overall, the argument relies heavily on social pressure and the assumption of unanimous behavior to persuade an individual to buy the new iPhone, making it faulty in its reasoning.
