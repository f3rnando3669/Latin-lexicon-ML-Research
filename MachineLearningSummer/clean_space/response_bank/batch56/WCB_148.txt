Okay, let's analyze the given argument using the defective argument types. 

The argument is:

"Violence among teens has risen the last five years. Video game playing among teens has also risen the last five years. Therefore, playing video games causes teens to be violent."

Here's the step-by-step identification:

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument assumes a causal relationship between two correlated trends without sufficient evidence. Just because both violence among teens and video game playing have increased does not necessarily mean that one causes the other. There could be other contributing factors or underlying causes that are not considered.

This argument is primarily an example of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because it jumps to a causal conclusion without adequate evidence to support the relationship between video game playing and teen violence.
