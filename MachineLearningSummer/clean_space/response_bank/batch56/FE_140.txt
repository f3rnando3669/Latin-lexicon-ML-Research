It seems like you've outlined various types of defective arguments but haven't defined what "IDAA" stands for. However, based on the context, if we assume "IDAA" is intended to identify and diagnose an argument for potential defects, let's analyze the argument: "You can go to bed in 5 minutes or you can go to bed in ten minutes. What's your choice?"

This argument might be trying to restrict someone's choices artificially, which is a form of a defective argument.

Here are possible defective argument types that could apply:

1. **False Dilemma (or False Dichotomy)**: This is when only two options are presented, but there may be other alternatives. The argument suggests that the only choices are going to bed in 5 or 10 minutes, but it disregards other possible times.

The argument doesn't perfectly fit the predefined defective argument types from your list, but if I had to categorize it under one of the nearest types, I might consider:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This comes close, as it limits the options artificially. While not a perfect match, it represents the idea that the options presented are not exhaustive.

So applying <IDAA>, we identify that the argument is presenting a limited choice set, leading us to consider that it is a **False Dilemma** or an example of **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**.
