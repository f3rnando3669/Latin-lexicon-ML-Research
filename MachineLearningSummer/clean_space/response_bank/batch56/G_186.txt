For 
In analyzing the given argument, "Eugene is silly in class. Harry is his friend, so Harry must be silly, too." we can identify the defective argument types that apply:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument assumes that because Eugene is silly, his friend Harry must also be silly. This is a hasty generalization based on the behavior of one individual applied to another without sufficient evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument fails to consider other possibilities or factors that might differ between Eugene and Harry. Just because they are friends does not necessarily mean they share all characteristics.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The conclusion that Harry is silly is drawn without sufficient or conclusive evidence. Friendship alone is not an adequate reason to assert that Harry behaves the same way as Eugene.

Given these observations, the argument "Eugene is silly in class. Harry is his friend, so Harry must be silly, too." exhibits defective reasoning primarily due to <G>, <FE>, and <IR>.
