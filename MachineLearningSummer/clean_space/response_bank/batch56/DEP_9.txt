For 
Certainly! The analysis of the given argument can be labeled using the defective argument type called Ambiguous Language (DEP). Here's the application:

---

**Argument Content**: 
"The fallacy of equivocation occurs when a key term or phrase in an argument is used in an ambiguous way, with one meaning in one portion of the argument and then another meaning in another portion of the argument."

**Defective Argument Type**: Ambiguous Language (DEP)

**Reason**: This argument describes the fallacy of equivocation, which inherently involves ambiguous language. The same key term or phrase is used with different meanings in different parts of the argument, causing ambiguity and confusion. Therefore, it exemplifies a case of Ambiguous Language (DEP). 

---

By applying DEP (Ambiguous Language) here, the specific nature of the defect—equivocation due to ambiguity—is precisely identified.
