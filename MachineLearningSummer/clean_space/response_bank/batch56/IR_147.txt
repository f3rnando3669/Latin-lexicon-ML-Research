For 
The argument "You're wrong because you're ugly!" can be assessed for defects using the defined defective argument types, but rather than fitting into the provided categories directly, it falls best under the realm of an **ad hominem** fallacy. However, since you've also provided a framework for defective argument analysis, we can attempt to classify it along these lines:

**Defective Argument Analysis:**
- Argument: "You're wrong because you're ugly!"
- Defective Type: **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**

**Reasoning:**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This argument is an example of an inappropriately attributed reason, where a personal characteristic (ugliness) is irrelevant to the validity of the argument. The "reason" given (that the person is ugly) does not logically relate to the person's "wrongness" in any substantial way, thus making it inconclusive and irrelevant. 

Therefore, applying **IDAA** to the argument "You're wrong because you're ugly!" results in it being classified as an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
