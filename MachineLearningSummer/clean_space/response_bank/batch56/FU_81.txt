Sure! Based on the defective argument types that you have defined, let's apply <IDAA> (Identification and Diagnosis of Argumentative Anomalies) to the statement "Everyone is doing the Low-Carb Diet."

1. **Generalization (G)**:
    - The statement "Everyone is doing the Low-Carb Diet" is an example of a generalization. It implies that without exception, all people are following this diet, which is likely not true and overly broad.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
    - The claim does not provide a complete enumeration of all possible dietary preferences, ignoring those who are following other diets or none at all. It suggests a false completeness.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
    - The statement can be seen as providing an inconclusive reason if it is being used to argue that one should also follow the Low-Carb Diet simply because others are doing it. This is a weak reason as it does not offer substantive evidence.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
    - This argument type may not directly apply unless the statement is used to infer that the Low-Carb Diet is effective because everyone is supposedly doing it, without evidence to support this causal link.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
    - If the statement is repeated frequently without additional evidence or reasoning, it might fall under this category. However, based on the given single statement, this defective argument type may not apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
    - This statement assumes a consensus ("Everyone is doing...") that may not exist or be substantiated. It implies common acceptance without sufficient evidence or inquiry into its truth.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
    - The word "everyone" is used ambiguously. It lacks precision and can be misleading because it is an absolute term that is rarely accurate in real-world situations.

Based on <IDAA>, the primary defective argument types applicable to the statement "Everyone is doing the Low-Carb Diet" are Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), and Ambiguous Language (DEP).
