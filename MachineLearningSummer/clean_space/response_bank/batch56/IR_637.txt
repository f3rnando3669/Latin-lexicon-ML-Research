For 
It seems that you've defined several defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, and <DEP>). However, you mentioned applying <IDAA> to the question, "Do you think that we should convict this criminal?" but <IDAA> was not defined among your defective argument types.

Assuming <IDAA> stands for a specific type of defective argument type intended to be defined, let’s first clarify and then apply it. If <IDAA> has not been explicitly defined, I'd need to hypothesize what it might stand for based on typical defective argument types.

One common defective argument type that might fit with the context of this question is **Loaded Question** (also known as a complex question or presupposition). A loaded question contains a presupposition that might limit direct responses or unfairly frame the subject.

Consider that <IDAA> might relate to **Loaded Questions**:

**Loaded Question (LQ)**: This is a question that contains an implicit assumption that the respondent cannot directly dispute without appearing to endorse it.

Applying **Loaded Question (LQ)** to "Do you think that we should convict this criminal?" we can break down the inherent issues:

- **Implicit Assumption**: The question presupposes that the person in question is indeed a criminal. By asking if "we should convict this criminal," it assumes guilt beforehand, without room for establishing innocence or exploring the full context.
- **Impact**: This type of question limits the respondent’s ability to fairly address the issue because answering "yes" or "no" might both suggest acceptance of the presupposition of guilt.

Thus, rephrasing the question to avoid the defective argument can be helpful:

**Non-Defective Rephrase**: "Do you think that we should convict the accused individual?" 

This allows the respondent to consider the guilt or innocence of the person in question without an implicit bias.
