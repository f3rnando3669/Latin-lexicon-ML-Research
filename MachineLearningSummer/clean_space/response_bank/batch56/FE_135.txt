Given the definitions of defective argument types, we can apply the method of identifying defective argument types (IDAA) to the statement provided:

"Growing up, many children are told to eat their dinner or else they would never grow big and tall. What fallacy is this?"

### Analysis:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - This does not seem to be a broad generalization about a whole group based on limited data.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - This argument does not list some possibilities to the exclusion of others, so incomplete enumeration does not seem to apply.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The statement seems to suggest a causal relationship without sufficient evidence to solidly confirm it, which points to a potential issue of inconclusive reasons.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - The argument suggests that not eating dinner directly results in not growing big and tall, which is a simplification and likely lacks sufficient causal basis. There are many factors affecting growth besides eating dinner, such as genetics and overall nutrition.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - The statement does not repeat a proposition to claim its truth.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - The argument does not suggest that something must be true just because many children are told so.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - The language used is not particularly ambiguous; it is straightforward.

### Conclusion:

The argument fits primarily into the category of <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) because the causation implied between eating dinner and growing big and tall is overly simplistic and does not account for numerous other factors that influence growth. Therefore, this statement can be classified as having the fallacy of Insufficient Causal Basis.
