For 
"IDAA" stands for *Identify Defective Argument Types* and Apply. To identify and apply defective argument types to the statement "You should always do what you are being told because following the rules is important," we need to analyze the logical structure and identify any flawed reasoning. 

Here is the analysis:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The statement suggests a broad generalization: "You should always do what you are being told." This does not account for situations where following rules might be harmful or unjust. 

2. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - The reasoning in the statement circles around itself: "You should always do what you are being told because following the rules is important." Following the rules is presented as a reason to follow the rules, which doesn't add new justification and is a repetitive assertion without independent support.

Here's the application:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** The statement "You should always do what you are being told" generalizes the act of obeying without considering exceptions or the context of the rules being followed.
2. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reasoning provided ("because following the rules is important") simply repeats the notion of following the rules without offering an independent reason.

Therefore, the statement "You should always do what you are being told because following the rules is important" contains defects in the form of Generalization (<G>) and Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>).
