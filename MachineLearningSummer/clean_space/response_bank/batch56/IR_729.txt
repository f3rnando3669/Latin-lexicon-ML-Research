For 
<IDAA> stands for Identification and Application of Defective Argument Analysis. Let's identify and apply the defective argument types to the provided dialogue between the reporter and the politician.

**Reporter: “It’s been two years since your policies were implemented, and so far they have failed to reduce unemployment rates.”**

**Politician: “I have been working hard ever since I came into office, and I’m happy to say that I met with many business leaders throughout the country, who all say that they are glad to see that our hard work is paying off.”**

### Analysis

1. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)** - The politician doesn't address the reporter's concern directly (the failure to reduce unemployment rates) but instead repeats a positive outlook about meeting business leaders and working hard, which is a different proposition altogether.

2. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)** - The politician attempts to infer a consensus among business leaders as a basis for claiming success. However, these statements from business leaders do not directly address the unemployment rates, making it an assumption that their positive feedback directly translates to economic success.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** - The response provided by the politician is non-specific and fails to address the specific metric being questioned (unemployment rates). Statements about working hard and meeting with business leaders are inconclusive reasons because they don't provide concrete evidence regarding the unemployment issue.

### Conclusion
Thus, the politician’s reply mainly showcases three defective arguments:
- **<RR>:** The politician’s assertion about hard work and positive feedback doesn't directly address the unemployment issue raised.
- **<FU>:** The politician uses presumptively positive feedback from business leaders to imply success, which is not substantiated regarding unemployment.
- **<IR>:** The response is inconclusive as it doesn't specifically tackle the failure to reduce unemployment rates. 

This analysis shows how the politician's argument is defective by not effectively addressing or refuting the concern regarding unemployment rates.
