For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application. Let's identify the defective argument types in the given example:

"Luke didn't want to eat his vegetables, but his father told him to think about the poor, starving children in a third world country who don't have anything to eat."

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument implies that Luke should eat his vegetables because there are starving children in other countries, but there is no direct causal connection between Luke eating his vegetables and the condition of starving children in another part of the world.

2. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument makes an implicit assumption that everyone would agree that thinking about starving children should compel Luke to eat his vegetables, without providing any evidence that such a consensus actually exists.

In this example, the main defective argument types are <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) and <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).
