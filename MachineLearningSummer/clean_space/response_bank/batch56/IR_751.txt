For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Analysis. Applying <IDAA> to the statement:

"The speaker or writer appeals to the audience's trust by establishing his credibility or trustworthiness as a writer or speaker?"

First, let's analyze this statement to determine if it fits any of the defective argument types defined:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This involves making a broad claim based on limited evidence. This statement does not appear to make such a broad claim.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This occurs when only a limited set of cases are considered or listed. This statement does not involve an incomplete list.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This involves an argument where the support does not conclusively lead to the conclusion. The statement might fit this category if the establishment of credibility is seen as insufficient proof of trustworthiness. 

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This is when a causal connection is asserted without sufficient evidence. The statement does not make a causal claim.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This is related to repeating the same proposition without adding new information or evidence. The statement does not involve repetition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This is assuming everyone agrees without evidence of consensus. The statement doesn't assume a consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This involves using language that has multiple meanings or is unclear. The terms "credibility" and "trustworthiness" could be vaguely defined or overlap, leading to potential ambiguity.

On analyzing "The speaker or writer appeals to the audience's trust by establishing his credibility or trustworthiness as a writer or speaker", the most applicable defective argument types could be:

- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: Establishing credibility or trustworthiness doesn't necessarily mean that the audience should trust everything the speaker says without further evidence or reasoning.
  
- **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language)**: The terms "credibility" and "trustworthiness" might be seen as somewhat overlapping or vague, which could lead to an ambiguous reading of the statement.

Thus, the statement could be flagged under:

- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**
- **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language)**
