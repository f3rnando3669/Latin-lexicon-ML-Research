For 
The given statement "That answer you just gave cannot be right because you are always so rude." exemplifies a type of defective argument.

To apply <IDAA> (Identification, Definition, Analysis, and Assessment) to this statement, follow these steps:

1. **Identification**:
   - Identify the conclusion of the argument: "That answer you just gave cannot be right."
   - Identify the premise provided to support that conclusion: "you are always so rude."

2. **Definition**:
   - Define the nature of the defective argument by matching it with the provided categories:
     - The premise (being rude) does not logically support the conclusion (the incorrectness of the answer).
     - This type of argument is typically known as an ad hominem fallacy, where an argument attacks the character of the person making a statement rather than the statement itself. 

3. **Analysis**:
   - Analyze why the argument is defective:
     - The argument fails to address the actual content or correctness of the answer.
     - Instead, it shifts focus to the personality trait (rudeness) of the person providing the answer, which is irrelevant to determining the correctness of the answer itself.

4. **Assessment**:
   - Assess the impact of the defective argument:
     - Using personal attacks to dismiss arguments is not valid reasoning and undermines rational discussion.
     - For an argument to be strong, its premises must logically support its conclusion, which this argument fails to do.

Hence, the given argument falls into the category of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because it does not provide a valid reason related to the content of the answer itself. Instead, it brings in a tangentially related, and insufficient, personal characteristic (rudeness) that is unrelated to the correctness of the provided answer.
