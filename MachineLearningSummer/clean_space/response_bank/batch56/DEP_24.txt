For 
The type of defective argument present in the dialogue between Steve and Chuck is <DEP>, or Ambiguous Language. Let's break down why:

1. **Steve:** "I think it is fantastic that you and Sylvia are getting married!"
   - Here, Steve uses the word "fantastic" in a common, positive sense, implying that he is very happy and excited about the event.

2. **Chuck:** "I cannot believe you think my getting married only exists in my imagination! That is what fantastic means, after all."
   - Chuck interprets "fantastic" in its less common sense, implying something imaginary or unreal.

**Reasoning:**
- The word "fantastic" has multiple meanings. While commonly it means something great or wonderful, it can also mean something is imaginary or not real. Chuck chooses to interpret Steve's usage of "fantastic" in the less common sense, leading to a misunderstanding.

This demonstrates how ambiguous language can create confusion and lead to defective arguments, hence applying <DEP> (Ambiguous Language).
