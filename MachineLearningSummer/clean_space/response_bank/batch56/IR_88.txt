In the context of the defective argument types you have provided, <IDAA> can be interpreted as "Identify Defective Argument Applied As."

To analyze the argument "You have to give me a passing grade. I spent 150 hours on that project and missed every party this quarter," we can look at the types of defective arguments you listed and determine if any of them match the reasoning presented in the statement.

1. **Generalization (G)**: This doesn't apply since the argument isn't based on generalizing from a small sample.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This doesn't apply since the argument is not based on an incomplete listing of possibilities or factors.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This might apply because the reasons given (time spent and sacrifices made) are not conclusive evidence for deserving a passing grade. The quality of the work should be the determining factor for grading, not effort alone.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This could apply as well, since there is an assumed causation between the time spent/sacrifices made and the grade deserved, which is not necessarily valid.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This doesn't seem to apply since the argument isn't based on repeating a proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This doesn't apply since there is no presumption that others agree or have consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This doesn't apply as there is no ambiguous language utilized in the argument.

Based on this analysis, the defective argument types that best apply to the provided statement are **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
