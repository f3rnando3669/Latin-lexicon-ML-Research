In order to apply <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Attributes) to the statement "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. You can't give me a ticket for doing what every other driver on the road was also doing," we need to analyze the argument for any defective argument types defined earlier. Let's break down the statement:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The argument might involve a generalization because it assumes that the behavior of a group (other drivers) justifies individual actions. However, this is not the primary issue in this context.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - There's an implicit enumeration of drivers' behaviors, but the statement does not specify whether all drivers indeed drove the same speed, so it could potentially be incomplete. But again, not the primary defect here.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The argument does not put forth a conclusive reason why the officer shouldn't give a ticket, but rather relies on what others are doing without linking this directly to legal or safety reasoning.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - There's no causal link established between other drivers' behaviors and the legality or safety of the action. This argument ignores why speed limits are enforced (for safety reasons) and presumes mutual behavior is a sufficient basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - The argument repeats the notion that because others are doing it, it is acceptable. However, merely repeating a behavior doesn't validate its correctness or legality.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - This type of argument can be identified here, as it assumes consensus with other drivers as a basis for action's permissibility. The presumption is that conforming to a collective behavior is sufficient justification, which is misleading.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - The language used isn't particularly ambiguous; it's quite clear about the intended argument.

Given the analysis, the defective argument types most applicable to the statement "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. You can't give me a ticket for doing what every other driver on the road was also doing." are:

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument fails to provide a causal link justifying why the equal behavior should exempt the individual from legal consequences.
2. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument improperly relies on the notion that consensus (everyone else speeding) should govern its acceptability.

Thus, <IDAA> identifies <WCB> and <FU> as the key defective argument types in this statement.
