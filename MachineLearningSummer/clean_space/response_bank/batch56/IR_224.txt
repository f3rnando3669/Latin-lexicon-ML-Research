<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application. Applying <IDAA> to "An abusive attack against someone making the argument, instead of the argument itself, is called a/an ad hominem attack." 

In this case, the argument mentioned is about an ad hominem attack, which is a type of defective argument. However, it does not seem to fall under any of the specific defective argument types defined such as Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Presumptuous Consensus, or Ambiguous Language. 

Ad hominem attacks are specifically characterized by the focus on the person rather than the argument, so it stands as its own type of logical fallacy rather than fitting neatly into the listed categories.
