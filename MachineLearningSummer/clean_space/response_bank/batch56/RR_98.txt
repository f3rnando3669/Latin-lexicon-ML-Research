For 
To analyze the argument "You can't give me a C. I'm an A student." using the defective argument types defined, we can break down what is inherently flawed in the reasoning:

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The speaker assumes that being an "A student" inherently means they cannot receive a C grade, suggesting an implied consensus that being labeled as such exempts them from ever getting a lower grade. This is presumptuous because it assumes agreement on a standard that may not be universally held.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument lacks an adequate causal relationship. Merely because they are usually an A student doesn't causally ensure they can't perform at a C level on a particular occasion or assignment.

By applying the identified defective argument types, we can see that the reasoning is flawed because it assumes consensus without basis and lacks a solid causal connection. The correct IDs applied are <FU> and <WCB>.
