For 
It seems you would like to apply a specific defective argument type, labeled as <IDAA>, to the provided statement. However, "IDAA" is not defined among the defective argument types you have listed. The provided defective argument types are:

1. Generalization (<G>)
2. Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
3. Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
4. Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
5. Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
6. Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
7. Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)

Based on the statement "Don't listen to her even though she's a doctor. She isn't a good person, so her opinion is invalid," let's analyze it for potential logical fallacies or defective argument types among those listed:

1. **Ad Hominem Attack**: This statement attacks the character of the person (claiming she is not a good person) rather than addressing the merit of her opinion as a doctor. This type of fallacy doesn't directly align with the labeled defective arguments provided but is a recognized logical fallacy.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasoning that "she isn't a good person" leads to her opinion being invalid is not conclusively justified. Her personal character doesn't inherently affect the validity of her professional opinion.

To synthesize, we can say that the statement predominantly suffers from an **ad hominem** fallacy, as it discredits her opinion by attacking her character rather than her qualifications or the content of her opinion.

Considering the definitions provided, <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) seems the closest match since the reasoning for dismissing her opinion is not adequately justified. However, it's important to note that in standard logical fallacy terminology, this is more accurately described as an **ad hominem** attack.
