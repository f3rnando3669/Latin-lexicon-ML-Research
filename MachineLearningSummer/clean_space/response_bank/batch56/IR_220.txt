Applying the Identifying Defective Argument Assessment (<IDAA>) to the statement:

> "Saying that you support a specific candidate for class president, only because he has recently been diagnosed with cancer is an example of which fallacy?"

This statement can be assessed as follows:

The argument is suggesting that the candidate should be supported for class president **solely** due to their recent cancer diagnosis. This implies that the diagnosis is being used as the primary or even sole justification for the candidate's qualifications, rather than discussing their policies, abilities, or other relevant qualities that would make them a suitable candidate.

This type of reasoning is problematic and can be classified under the defective argument type called **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**. The diagnosis of cancer is not a sufficient causal basis for determining someone's qualifications for a leadership role like class president. It conflates personal circumstances with professional skills and suitability, which are not causally connected in a valid or sufficient manner for the argument being made.
