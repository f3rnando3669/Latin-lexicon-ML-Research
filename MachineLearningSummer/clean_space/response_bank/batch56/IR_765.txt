For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Attributes, where the goal is to pinpoint which of the predefined defective argument types are present in a given statement.

Let's analyze the statement: "I saw Ashton Kutcher in a commercial for male skin care. He's looking good for his age, so I'm willing to try the product. He must know what he's talking about."

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument might be making a generalization about the effectiveness of the product based solely on Ashton Kutcher's appearance. However, it's more relevant to look at other defective types here.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not consider other factors or alternatives that might also influence his appearance, such as genetics, lifestyle, or other skin care products. Thus, it falls under the Incomplete Enumeration category.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The statement assumes that because Ashton Kutcher looks good, the skin care product must be effective. This reasoning is inconclusive because his appearance might not necessarily be due to the product advertised.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument asserts a causal relationship between the advertised product and Kutcher's good looks without sufficient evidence to substantiate this claim.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: There's no repetition of a proposition here, so this type is not applicable.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The statement doesnâ€™t really suggest a broad consensus or majority opinion, so this type is not applicable either.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The language in the argument does not seem ambiguous; the statements are quite direct.

Based on the analysis:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**

These three defective argument types are most relevant to the statement in question.
