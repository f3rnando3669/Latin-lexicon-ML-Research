For 
The phrase "Ninety percent of all people surveyed said that McDonald's is better than Burger King so it must be true." represents the fallacy of **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.

Here's the reasoning:
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** refers to a fallacy where it is assumed that because a majority or a significant number of people believe something, it must be true.
- In this case, the argument is that McDonald's is better than Burger King simply because a large percentage of surveyed people believe so, which doesn't provide a valid reason for the claim's truth. It relies on the assumption that the majority opinion is inherently correct.
