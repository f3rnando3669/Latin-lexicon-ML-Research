For 
<IDAA>: Infinite Regress

The argument provided by Ernie leads to an infinite regress, where each explanation calls for the same kind of explanation at a deeper level, without providing a concrete stopping point or resolution. Here's how it fits the pattern:

Bert's questions and Ernie's answers follow an endlessly recursive structure:
1. **How do eyes project an image to your brain?**
2. **Think of it as a little guy in your brain watching the movie projected by your eyes.**
3. **Ok, but what is happening in the little guy in your headâ€™s brain?**
4. **Well, think of it as a little guy in his brain watching a movie...**

This series of responses fails to satisfactorily answer Bert's original question because it keeps deferring the explanation to yet another "little guy" in an infinite sequence. This is a classic example of an infinite regress, revealing that the argument is structurally flawed and does not provide a meaningful or finite explanation.
