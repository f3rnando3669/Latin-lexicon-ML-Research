The fallacy that Sara used in her argument can be identified as <G> a defective argument type called Generalization. 

Sara took a survey result from a specific and limited group (1st graders at a local elementary school) and used it to support a conclusion for a much broader and different group (all high school students). This is an example of jumping to a conclusion based on insufficient evidence and assuming that what is true for one small group applies to a much larger and different group. This is a classic case of overgeneralization.
