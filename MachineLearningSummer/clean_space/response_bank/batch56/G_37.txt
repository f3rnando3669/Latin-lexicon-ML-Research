For 
To analyze the given statement using the Defective Argument types defined:

Statement: "All writing teachers must be awesome because Ms. Lopez is."

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument tries to generalize the awesomeness from a single instance (Ms. Lopez) to all writing teachers, which is not valid without sufficient evidence. 

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not consider other writing teachers who might not be awesome. It only bases the conclusion on Ms. Lopez, which presents an incomplete enumeration of all writing teachers.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasoning that Ms. Lopez being awesome means all writing teachers are awesome, is inconclusive. There is no logical connection or sufficient evidence provided to make this leap in conclusion.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: There is no causal basis presented that would reasonably attribute the characteristic of being "awesome" from Ms. Lopez to all other writing teachers. The cause (Ms. Lopez being awesome) doesn't sufficiently justify the effect (all writing teachers are awesome).

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The statement does not actually involve repetition of the proposition, so this does not apply here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The statement assumes a consensus that all writing teachers are awesome based on one example, without showing that others share this view or that there is a general consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The term "awesome" is subjective and can be interpreted in many different ways. This ambiguity can create confusion and weaken the argument's clarity.

Given this analysis, the argument in the statement can be primarily identified as a **Generalization (<G>)** due to its reliance on one example to generalize a quality to an entire group without sufficient evidence, and it also heavily hints at **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**, **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** due to the lack of comprehensive reasoning and evidence.
