For 
The term <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Application) can be applied to the statement "Did your misleading claims result in you getting promoted?" by identifying the relevant defective argument types present in the statement:

1. **<IRT> (Inconclusive Reason)**: This question assumes a causal relationship between "misleading claims" and the effect of "getting promoted" without providing sufficient evidence to substantiate this linkage. It presumes that one event led directly to the other without clear proof.

2. **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language)**: The use of the term "misleading claims" is inherently ambiguous and open to interpretation. What qualifies as a "misleading claim" can vary greatly without a clear definition, making the argument dependent on subjective interpretation.
