For 
<IDAA> refers to Identifying Defective Argument Application Analysis. Below is the analysis of the given argument:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
    - Jeannette assumes that her excellent memory from high school will apply universally to the more complex material in her anatomy and physiology course without considering the differences in difficulty and depth of the subjects.
    - Example Identified: "...because of her excellent memory, she got through high school without studying."

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
    - Jeannette overlooks the necessity to engage in active studying of the new terms rather than solely relying on passive listening in class to retain the information.
    - Example Identified: Jeannette hasn’t accounted for the possibility that passive listening might not be enough to memorize over 200 terms.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
    - Jeannette’s reasoning that her memory will be sufficient for the exam because it worked in high school is not convincingly proven; different contexts (high school vs. college) require different strategies and efforts.
    - Example Identified: "...she will remember the terms just from having heard them mentioned in class."

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
    - There’s a lack of sufficient evidence to conclude that Jeannette’s past success was purely due to her memory; it could have been due to other factors like the nature of the tests, less complexity of the material, or different study habits.
    - Example Identified: Assuming that her memory alone led to her success in high school without considering other factors.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
    - Jeannette repeatedly relies on the proposition that her excellent memory will help her, without providing new or varied evidence to support this in the face of different academic demands.
    - Example Identified: Repeated statements on her excellent memory will secure her success without additional supporting evidence.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
    - Jeannette presumes universal agreement (self-agreement) on the adequacy of her memory for success in exams without considering contrasting opinions or strategies from educational advisors or peers.
    - Example Identified: Implicit assumption that her memory is sufficient without seeking external advice or evidence.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
    - The term “excellent memory” is ambiguously used without specifying what it entails or how it was measured, leading to a vague and unsupported basis for her confidence in the outcome.
    - Example Identified: Vague reference to “excellent memory” without contextual definition or elaboration.

In summary, the main argument suffers from a range of defective reasoning types including Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Presumptuous Consensus, and Ambiguous Language. Each contributes to the fallacious nature of Jeannette’s confidence in her memory alone as sufficient preparation for her anatomy and physiology exam.
