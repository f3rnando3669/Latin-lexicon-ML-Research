For 
<IDAA> stands for Identified Defective Argument Analysis. Let's analyze the argument "Since it was a deathbed confession, it must be true." by identifying if there are any of the defined defective argument types present.

1. **Generalization (G)**: This is not applicable here because the statement doesn't make a broad generalization based on a small sample.
  
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This defect involves presenting an incomplete list to support a conclusion. Since the statement doesn't enumerate multiple points, this isn't applicable.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This could be applied here, as the fact that a statement was made on a deathbed is not a conclusive reason for it to be true. More supporting evidence would be necessary to strengthen the claim.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This isn't directly applicable as the argument doesn't discuss causality.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The statement does not involve repeating the proposition in an attempt to make it true.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This doesn't apply as there's no indication of assuming a consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language is quite clear and direct, so no ambiguity is present here.

Thus, the argument "Since it was a deathbed confession, it must be true" can be classified under **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, since a deathbed confession alone doesn't necessarily guarantee the truthfulness of the statement without additional supporting evidence.
