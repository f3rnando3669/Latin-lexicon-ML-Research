For 
Given the argument: "1 = a number; 2 = a number; therefore 1 = 2," we can identify the defective argument type under the defined categories:

- **Generalization (G):** This argument does not make a sweeping generalization from a few instances, so <G> is not applicable.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This argument does not fail due to an incomplete list or set of instances, so <FE> does not apply.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This argument does jump to an incorrect conclusion without proper reasoning, so <IR> might be considered, but let's explore further.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** There is no causal relationship being erroneously inferred here, so <WCB> does not apply.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** There is no repetition of a flawed premise, so <RR> does not apply.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument does not rely on presumed consensus, so <FU> is not applicable.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The terms used are relatively clear and not ambiguous, so <DEP> does not apply.

The best fit for categorizing this argument would be <IR> — Inconclusive Reason — as the argument's conclusion (1 = 2) is entirely unsupported by the given premises. The premises merely state that both 1 and 2 are numbers, but this does not logically lead to the conclusion that they are equal; the reasoning here is inconclusive and invalid.
