Sure, I'll analyze the argument using the types of defective arguments listed:

The given argument is: "Look at that face! Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that as the face of our next president?"

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument implicitly generalizes that a person's appearance is a determining factor for their capability or suitability to hold the office of the president. However, this is a broad and unsupported generalization since many factors besides appearance impact a person's eligibility and capability to be president.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: It assumes that everyone shares the speaker’s opinion about the unattractiveness or unsuitability based on appearance alone. It does not acknowledge any other potential qualifications or merits of the candidate.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The argument is based on subjective judgment of facial appearance, which is inconclusive for assessing a person's capability to serve as president. A person’s facial features do not provide valid evidence about their skills, intelligence, policies, or leadership qualities.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reasoning fails to establish a causal relationship between a person's face and their potential success or failure as president. Appearance and presidential effectiveness do not have a direct causal link.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This particular argument does not involve the faulty repetition of a proposition as it primarily consists of rhetorical questions without repeating propositions for emphasis.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The statement presumes that there is a widespread agreement or consensus that no one would vote for someone based on their appearance. This presumption is not substantiated and is presented as if it’s a shared belief without evidence.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The phrase "look at that face" is ambiguous. It's unclear what specific features or characteristics of the face the speaker finds objectionable or why those features would be relevant to presidential capability. This ambiguity weakens the argument.

In summary, the given argument can be classified as displaying Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), and Ambiguous Language (<DEP>).
