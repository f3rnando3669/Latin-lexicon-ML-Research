To properly apply the given defective arguments to the statement, "His house is about half the size of most houses in the neighborhood. Therefore, his doors must all be about 3 1/2 feet high," you must identify which types of defective arguments are present in the reasoning. Let's analyze and apply each relevant type:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This fallacy occurs when a broad conclusion is made based on limited evidence.
   - Analysis: The argument makes a sweeping conclusion (the size of the doors) based on the size of the house.
   - Application: The claim that the doors must be around 3 1/2 feet high because the house is half the size is a **Generalization (G)**.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This happens when not all possibilities or relevant instances are considered.
   - Analysis: The argument does not take into account that door sizes are standardized and not proportional to the overall house size.
   - Application: Assuming all doors are about 3 1/2 feet high due to the house size without considering other factors is an **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This occurs when the evidence presented does not logically support the conclusion.
   - Analysis: The argument presents no solid link between the size of the house and the dimensions of its doors.
   - Application: The reasoning provided is insufficient to conclude the door height, qualifying this as an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This fallacy occurs when a cause-and-effect relationship is asserted without sufficient evidence.
   - Analysis: The assertion that a smaller house necessarily leads to smaller doors lacks detailed causal support.
   - Application: The lack of proper causal connection makes this an **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This fallacy repeats a proposition without providing new evidence for it, reinforcing it incorrectly.
   - Analysis: The argument does not involve repetition, so this fallacy does not apply here.
   - Application: Not applicable (**Not RR**).

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This occurs when it is assumed that everyone agrees with a conclusion without evidence of such consensus.
   - Analysis: The argument does not reference or assume a consensus, so this fallacy does not apply here.
   - Application: Not applicable (**Not FU**).

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This fallacy uses language that can be interpreted in more than one way, leading to confusion.
   - Analysis: The argument is straightforward in its wording with no ambiguous terms.
   - Application: Not applicable (**Not DEP**).

In summary, the defective argument types present in the statement "His house is about half the size of most houses in the neighborhood. Therefore, his doors must all be about 3 1/2 feet high" are:

- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
