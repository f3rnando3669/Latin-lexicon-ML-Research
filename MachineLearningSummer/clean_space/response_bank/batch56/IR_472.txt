The statement "I don't know about you, but I would never take the word of a woman who never finished school." can be analyzed for defective argument types as follows:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** The speaker is making a generalization about all women who have not finished school, implying that none of them are trustworthy. This is an overgeneralization based on the educational background of women.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The speaker is implying that lack of formal education is the sole or primary determinant of trustworthiness, ignoring other factors that might influence someone's credibility, such as experience, intelligence, or integrity.

To use the identified defective argument types, we can flag the statement like this:

"This argument is both a **Generalization (<G>)** and an **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** because it unfairly judges the credibility of individuals based on a single factor (educational attainment) without considering other relevant attributes."

Would you like further analysis on this argument or information on a different type of defective argument?
