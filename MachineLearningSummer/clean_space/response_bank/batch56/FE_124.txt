For 
<IDAA (Emotional Appeal)> is a logical fallacy that attempts to manipulate an emotional response in place of a valid or compelling argument.

Applying <IDAA> to the given statement:

"I’m raising funds to help cure XYZ disease. If you don’t donate, then you’re part of the problem."

This argument can be classified as <IDAA (Emotional Appeal)> because it tries to provoke guilt or fear to compel someone to donate. It does not provide a substantive reason why the person should donate beyond implying that refusing to do so makes them responsible for the problem.
