<IDAA> stands for Identification of Defective Argument Application. To apply <IDAA> to the given conversation, we first need to examine the argument exchange and identify if any defective argument types are present.

**Conversation:**
- Person 1: "We should argue with logic and facts."
- Person 2: "You should grow a brain before you open your mouth."

**Analysis:**
1. **Person 1** is recommending that arguments should be based on logic and facts. This is a straightforward and valid suggestion.
2. **Person 2** responds with an ad hominem attack, which is an attempt to discredit Person 1 by insulting their intelligence rather than addressing the argument or suggestion made by Person 1.

**Defective Argument Type Identified:**
- **Ad Hominem Attack (not listed but recognizable):** Person 2’s response does not use logical reasoning or facts to counter Person 1's suggestion. Instead, it directly insults Person 1, which is a classic ad hominem fallacy. This could potentially fall under the category of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** if we consider that Person 2's response fails to provide any counter-argument, making their reasoning inconclusive or irrelevant.

- Additionally, **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** might be tangentially relevant. If Person 2 implies that Person 1's intelligence is widely recognized as insufficient, it could be seen as presuming a consensus about Person 1’s cognitive abilities without evidence. 

- However, **Ambiguous Language (DEP)** is also somewhat applicable if we consider that "grow a brain" is an ambiguous idiomatic expression. It is not a literal statement and could be unclear in its intended meaning, though the primary issue remains the personal attack rather than language ambiguity.

Given these points, the most direct application would be:
- <IR> for the lack of a logical or factual counter-argument to Person 1’s statement.
- A recognition of an **ad hominem fallacy** for the personal insult.

**Conclusion:**
For "Person 1: 'We should argue with logic and facts' Person 2: 'You should grow a brain before you open your mouth'"
- The defective argument types identified are:
  - <IR> - Inconclusive Reason due to failing to address the original argument with logic or facts.
  - An unlisted but relevant **Ad Hominem Attack** due to the personal insult directed at Person 1.
