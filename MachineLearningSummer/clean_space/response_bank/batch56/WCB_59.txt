The argument presented is:

"Why are you hitting your computer!?"
"The last time my wifi was weak, I hit my computer and it got better."

Let's analyze and identify the potential defective arguments:

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - The reason provided assumes a causal relationship between hitting the computer and the wifi getting better without sufficient evidence to support that hitting the computer affects the wifi. It is more likely that the improvement in wifi was coincidental or caused by some other factor.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The argument suggests that hitting the computer 'worked' a specific instance, implying it is a valid solution. This reasoning is not conclusive since it does not account for other potential causes for the wifi improvement.

Given the above analyses, the primary defective argument type here is:

**<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**:
The belief that hitting the computer causes the wifi to improve lacks sufficient causal evidence.

A secondary type to consider might be:

**<IR> Inconclusive Reason**:
The improvement in wifi after hitting the computer one time does not provide a sound basis to conclude that hitting the computer is a reliable solution.
