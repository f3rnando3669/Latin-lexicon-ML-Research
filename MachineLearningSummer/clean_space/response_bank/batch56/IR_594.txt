For 
The type of defective argument in "My father told me that the sky is green. So it must be the truth." is Inconclusive Reason (IR).

This argument is defective because it relies solely on the authority of the father without providing any additional supporting evidence to substantiate the claim that the sky is green. Authority alone is insufficient to establish the truth of a claim, especially in cases where the claim can be empirically verified.
