For 
The given statement, "You'll make the right decision because you have something that not many people do: you have heart," can be analyzed for defective arguments using the specified types. 

Upon analyzing the statement, here are some possible defective arguments applied to it:

1. **Generalization (G)**: The statement assumes that having "heart" (a general and vague quality) alone guarantees making the right decision without considering other factors that might influence decision-making.
   
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The statement links "having heart" as the sole reason for making the right decision, suggesting a causal relationship without sufficient evidence to support that having heart directly causes one to make the right decision.

Since the statement is an attempt to support or justify how someone will make the right decision based on an emotional quality, applying **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** seems the most appropriate because it inadequately establishes a causal link between the quality (having heart) and the outcome (making the right decision).

So, the applied defective argument type for this case would be:
**<WCB>**
