The argument provided can be considered defective using the identified defective argument types.

"If we ban Hummers because they are bad for the environment, eventually the government will ban all cars, so we should not ban Hummers."

Let's examine the argument:

1. Generalization (<G>): The argument makes an overly broad generalization by suggesting that banning Hummers (specifically harmful due to their environmental impact) will inevitably lead to banning all cars, without providing sufficient evidence to support this escalation.

2. Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>): The argument implies that banning Hummers and banning all cars are the only possibilities, ignoring other nuanced or balanced approaches such as promoting eco-friendly cars or setting specific emissions standards.

3. Inconclusive Reason (<IR>): The suggestion that banning Hummers will lead to banning all cars lacks a direct or strong causal link, making the reasoning speculative and inconclusive.

4. Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>): There is an assumption that banning one type of vehicle will lead to banning all types, which is not adequately backed by evidence showing a direct causal connection.

5. Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>): The argument may be seen to repeatedly imply that banning one thing necessarily leads to banning similar things, but this is an unsupported repetition of a flawed assumption.

6. Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>): The argument presumes that if Hummers are banned, it will inevitably be supported by an assumed group consensus to ban all cars, without proof that such a consensus exists or will form.

7. Ambiguous Language (<DEP>): There is ambiguity in the term "ban all cars," as it is not clearly defined how or why this extreme measure would logically follow from the initial action of banning Hummers.

In summary, the argument about banning Hummers can be critiqued as defective due to its use of generalization, incomplete enumeration, inconclusive reasoning, insufficient causal basis, faulty repetition of a proposition, presumptuous consensus, and ambiguous language.
