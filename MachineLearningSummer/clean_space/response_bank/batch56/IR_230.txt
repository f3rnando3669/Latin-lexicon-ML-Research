It seems like you want to classify the argument in the given example according to certain types of defective arguments you've defined. However, I don't see a definition for the argument type labeled <IDAA>. If you meant to identify the flawed reasoning using one of the types provided (such as <G>, <FE>, etc.), I'll analyze the example and apply the relevant identifier.

Example: 
"A teacher tells Billy to stop talking, and he yells back: 'Sarah was talking too!'"

This is an example of a common argumentative fallacy known as "Two Wrongs Don't Make a Right" or "Tu Quoque" (appealing to hypocrisy), where someone tries to deflect criticism away from themselves by pointing out similar behavior in others. 

Although the provided defective argument types do not directly match this fallacy, the closest relevant types in this context seem to be:

1. **<IR> - Inconclusive Reason**: Billy’s response does not address the teacher’s instruction or justify his own behavior; instead, he diversifies and deflects.
2. **<DEP> - Ambiguous Language**: The use of "Sarah was talking too" could potentially fall under this if one interprets it as purposefully ambiguous to shift blame without addressing personal responsibility.

However, the most accurate description might actually be outside the provided categories, falling more aptly under "Tu Quoque" specifically.
