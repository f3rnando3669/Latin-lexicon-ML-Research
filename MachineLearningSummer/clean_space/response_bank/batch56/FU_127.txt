For 
IDAA, or Identifying Defective Argument Analysis, is the process of scrutinizing an argument to determine if it falls into any of the pre-defined defective argument types. Let's apply IDAA to the statement:

"This fallacy assumes something is true (or right, or good) because other people agree with it."

In this context, we can identify the defective argument as follows:

- **Defective Argument Type:** <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)
- **Reasoning:** The fallacy described assumes that the truth or validity of a statement is based merely on the agreement of others, which falls under the fallacy of Presumptuous Consensus. It is an erroneous argument because the consensus of people does not inherently validate the truth, correctness, or goodness of a proposition.

Thus, the analysis indicates that the statement exemplifies the defective argument type <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).
