For 
The argument presented, "Harold’s new book is well-written because Harold is a wonderful writer," exemplifies a specific type of faulty reasoning where the conclusion is simply a restatement of the premise, implying redundancy and circular logic. In this context, to apply the defective argument type, we first need to categorize the argument according to the definitions provided.

The argument can be classified under the defective argument type <RR> - Faulty Repetition of Proposition. Here, the proposition "Harold’s new book is well-written" is being justified by stating essentially the same proposition in a different form, "Harold is a wonderful writer." The reasoning is circular because it does not provide an independent basis for the conclusion; it merely rephrases the original statement.

Therefore, the defective argument type applied to the argument "Harold’s new book is well-written because Harold is a wonderful writer" is <RR> - Faulty Repetition of Proposition.
