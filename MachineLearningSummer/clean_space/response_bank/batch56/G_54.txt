Sure! Let's apply the given defective argument types to analyze the statement "A year is 365 days long, so I celebrate my birthday every 365 days."

The argument seems to be structured as:

1. A year is 365 days long.
2. Therefore, I celebrate my birthday every 365 days.

To analyze this, let's see which defective argument types might apply.

1. **<G> Generalization:** The statement doesn't seem to be a generalization as it's discussing a specific instance related to the individual's birthday and the length of the year.
 
2. **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:** This may apply if we consider the missing details about how leap years, which have 366 days, could affect the frequency of birthday celebrations. The statement fails to enumerate all cases (regular years and leap years).

3. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** The reasoning seems conclusive within the context given (ignoring special cases like leap years), hence not suitable for <IR>.

4. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** The cause and effect relationship is directly tied, so <WCB> doesn't seem to apply here.

5. **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** This argument doesn't involve repetition of a proposition to substantiate it, so <RR> is not applicable.

6. **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** There is no claim based on the presumed unanimous agreement, so <FU> is not applicable.

7. **<DEP> Ambiguous Language:** The language used is quite clear unless we consider the ambiguity regarding leap years. Ambiguity about what "365 days" could implicitly omit (i.e., the year-to-year variance due to leap years) could classify this argument under <DEP>.

Thus, the defective argument types that apply to "A year is 365 days long, so I celebrate my birthday every 365 days" are:

- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:** Fails to account for the variations due to leap years.
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language:** Ambiguous with respect to how leap years are included in the duration of a year.

By focusing on these types, we can recognize and correct the logical deficiencies present in the argument.
