For 
To analyze the argument "Going to prom (when you don't want to) because 90 percent of your classmates are going" using the defined defective argument types, we can break it down as follows:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - The argument might imply that because a significant majority of classmates are attending, it must be a good or necessary action. This could be considered a broad generalization that does not account for individual preferences or situations.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - This argument does not consider other potential reasons for going or not going to prom, thus lacking a complete enumeration of relevant factors.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The reason provided for attending prom is that most classmates are going. However, this doesn't adequately address the person's personal preferences or reasons for not wanting to attend, making it an inconclusive reason.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - The causal connection implied here is weak; just because many people are doing something does not necessarily provide a sufficient cause for another individual to do the same, especially if they do not want to.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - This argument does not explicitly involve the faulty repetition of a proposition. It does not repeatedly assert its central claim in a problematic way.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - This argument relies on the assumption that the consensus of the majority (90 percent of classmates) inherently justifies doing something. It presumes that following the crowd is the correct action without individual justification.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - The language used in this argument is not particularly ambiguous. The terms and numbers are clear, and thus it does not fall under this defective argument type.

For the given argument "Going to prom (when you don't want to) because 90 percent of your classmates are going," the most applicable defective argument types are:

- **FU (Presumptuous Consensus)**
- **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**
- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**
- **G (Generalization)**

By applying <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Attributes), we see that the argument primarily relies on presumptive consensus and does not provide a conclusive or sufficient personal reason for the individual to attend prom, also possibly relying on a broad generalization.
