Applying the defective argument type definitions, we can analyze the reasoning in the given statement. The statement to analyze is:

"The government is convinced that it was a bomb that brought down the aircraft. “Our countrymen believe it was a bomb,” said the president. “A survey done a few days after the crash indicates that almost seventy percent of the people believe it was a terrorist’s bomb.”"

Upon examining the statement, the primary type of defective argument that seems to apply is Presumptuous Consensus <FU>. Here's the breakdown:

- The conclusion (that a bomb brought down the aircraft) relies on the reported belief of the citizens.
- The president supports the conclusion by referring to a survey stating that almost seventy percent of people believe it was a terrorist's bomb.

This constitutes <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus) because the argument assumes that the opinion of the majority (or a large group of people) on a complex and technical matter is sufficient evidence to arrive at a definitive conclusion, which is not necessarily valid. Public opinion, especially shortly after an event, may not be based on detailed investigation or expert analysis, and thus it is not a reliable basis for concluding the cause of the incident.
