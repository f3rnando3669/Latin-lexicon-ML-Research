<IDAA>: Identify Defective Arguments Analysis

Statement: "Now you tell me she looks presidential, folks. I look presidential."

1. <G> Generalization:
   - This statement might be generalizing the criteria for looking "presidential" based solely on appearance or superficial judgments, without specifying what those criteria are.

2. <FE> Incomplete Enumeration:
   - The statement does not provide a complete list of reasons or qualities necessary for looking "presidential." It only gives an informal and vague assertion without detailed support.

3. <IR> Inconclusive Reason:
   - The reasoning that someone "looks presidential" is subjective and open to interpretation. This lacks a conclusive and objective basis.

4. <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:
   - The claim lacks a clear explanation of why looking "presidential" equates to actually being qualified for the Presidency. The causal link between appearance and capability is not established.

5. <RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:
   - The statement does not repetitively argue the same exact point in this case, so this defective argument type might not apply here.

6. <FU> Presumptuous Consensus:
   - The speaker assumes that the audience will agree with the claim that she looks presidential without providing substantive evidence, relying on presumed collective agreement.

7. <DEP> Ambiguous Language:
   - The word "presidential" is ambiguous and can vary greatly in meaning. Different people might have different interpretations of what it means to look "presidential."

In summary, the statement "Now you tell me she looks presidential, folks. I look presidential" can be analyzed to contain elements of Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), and Ambiguous Language (<DEP>).
