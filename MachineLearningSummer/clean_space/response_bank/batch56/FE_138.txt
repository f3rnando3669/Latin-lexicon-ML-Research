For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Types. Let's apply <IDAA> to the example argument "Dad, either you let me go to the party or you're a bad dad."

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument doesn't involve making a broad, sweeping statement about a category based on limited evidence, so it isn't a Generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument presents a false dichotomy by suggesting only two possible options (letting the speaker go to the party or being a bad dad). This is a form of the incomplete enumeration fallacy because it ignores other possibilities (e.g., the dad could have other valid reasons to restrict the party attendance while still being a good dad).

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument assumes the conclusion without sufficient evidence, which might suggest an inconclusive reason. However, it is more accurately characterized by the false dichotomy aspect described above.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is no attempt to claim a causal relationship in this argument, so it doesn't fit under Insufficient Causal Basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The argument doesn't involve repetition of a statement to assert its truth without additional reasoning, so it isn't a Faulty Repetition of Proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument doesn't seem to rely on an assumed widespread agreement or consensus, so it doesn't fit Presumptuous Consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language used in the argument is quite clear and unambiguous, so it doesn't fall under Ambiguous Language.

Based on the analysis, the most applicable defective argument type here is **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**.
