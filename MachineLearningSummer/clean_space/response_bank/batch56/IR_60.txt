For 
<IDAA>: Identifying Defective Argument Application

Let's analyze the dialogue for any potential defective arguments:

1. Mother: "It’s bedtime Jane." 
   - This statement is directive and not an argument, so no defective argument applies here.

2. Jane: "Mom, how do ants feed their babies?"
   - This is a question, not an argument.

3. Mother: "Don’t know dear, close your eyes now."
   - This response dismisses the question without addressing it. It could be seen as an example of avoiding the topic, but it doesn't necessarily fit into the defined defective argument categories <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP> since it’s not making an argument, just redirecting.

4. Jane: "But mama, do ant babies cry when they’re hungry?"
   - This is another question and not an argument.

In this exchange, Jane is consistently posing questions, while the Mother is trying to enforce bedtime without engaging in the topic initiated by Jane. None of the statements fit perfectly into the defective argument categories as posed, since they aren’t functioning as arguments but rather directives and questions.

In summary, in applying <IDAA>, while it's interesting to note the potential for dismissal or redirection, none of the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP> strictly apply to this dialogue as it lacks argumentative content.
