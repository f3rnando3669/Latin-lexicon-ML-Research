For 
To apply the identification and classification of Defective Arguments (<IDAA>) to the statement: "The art teacher spoke in the trial as a witness in support of testing perfumes on animals, and he persuaded me."

**Analysis:**

The statement provided suggests that the speaker was persuaded by the art teacher's support for testing perfumes on animals, but the reasoning behind this persuasion is not clear. We need to determine if there's a defective argument type involved.

1. **Generalization (G)** - This statement does not provide a broad principle based on limited examples.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** - This statement is not about listing incomplete examples to make a case.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** - This could be relevant. The statement implies the art teacher's profession is relevant to the ethical argument about animal testing, which logically doesn't follow.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** - There is no causal relationship being implied here.
   
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** - The statement doesn't involve repeating a proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** - There's no appeal to a consensus implied here.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)** - Although the terms "persuaded" and "spoke" are clear, the source of the persuasion (the art teacher's arguments) is the only focus.

**Conclusion:**

The defective argument type most applicable here is **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, because the profession of the art teacher (a non-expert in the field of animal ethics or testing) does not logically support or refute the practice of testing perfumes on animals. It's a non-sequitur to assume their profession gives their opinion more weight in this context.

Therefore, applying <IDAA>:

**Defect Identification**: <IR>
**Explanation**: The art teacher's profession is irrelevant to the ethical considerations of testing perfumes on animals, leading to inconclusive reasoning for the persuasion.
