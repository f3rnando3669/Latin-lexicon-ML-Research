To analyze the argument provided under the context of the defective argument types defined, it is necessary to break down the components and assess which faulty reasoning patterns are present. Here's the argument:

"There is ... a radical element, a homosexual agenda that wants to redefine what marriage is. They want to say that a marriage not only is one man and one woman but it is two men or it is two women. What logical reason is there to keep us from stopping expansion of that definition to include three people or an adult and a child, or any other odd combination that we want to have? ... and it does not even have to be limited to human beings by the way. I mean it could be anything. ... There is no reason why we cannot just completely erase whatever boundaries that currently exist on the definition of marriage and say it is a free-for-all, anything goes."

Applying <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Analysis):

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The argument uses a broad and unspecific claim about a "homosexual agenda" without providing specific evidence or examples of such an agenda existing and aiming to redefine marriage.
   - Example: "There is ... a radical element, a homosexual agenda that wants to redefine what marriage is."

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The argument lists potential expansions of marriage definitions (e.g., "three people," "an adult and a child," "anything... any other odd combination") as though these are the only or inevitable consequences without considering the actual stances or boundaries being proposed.
   - Example: "What logical reason is there to keep us from stopping expansion of that definition to include three people or an adult and a child, or any other odd combination that we want to have?"

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The argument assumes that allowing same-sex marriage will inevitably lead to all other forms of relationships being accepted as marriages without a clear rationale.
   - Example: "There is no reason why we cannot just completely erase whatever boundaries that currently exist on the definition of marriage and say it is a free-for-all, anything goes."

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The argument suggests a causal link between allowing same-sex marriages and a breakdown of all marriage boundaries without sufficient evidence to support this causal connection.
   - Example: "What logical reason is there to keep us from stopping expansion of that definition to include three people..."

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - The argument repeats the notion that redefining marriage to include same-sex couples will lead to extreme and unacceptable marriage definitions without addressing counterarguments or providing new evidence.
   - Example: The repeated assertion of "any other odd combination" and "anything goes" without addressing why same-sex marriage specifically undermines traditional boundaries.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - The argument presumes that the audience will agree with a slippery slope argument without presenting a well-reasoned or widely accepted basis for this consensus.
   - Example: "What logical reason is there to keep us from stopping expansion of that definition..." presumes consensus that recognizing same-sex marriage logically leads to an erosion of all marriage definitions.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - The term "homosexual agenda" is ambiguous and loaded, creating a negative connotation without a clear, factual basis.
   - Example: The use of "homosexual agenda" to imply a wide-ranging and nefarious plan without specific details or factual underpinning.

In conclusion, the argument exhibits multiple defective argument types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), and Ambiguous Language (<DEP>). Each of these falls into specific fallacious reasoning patterns that undermine the overall logic and validity of the argument.
