The argument presented can be classified as a defective argument type under the label <IDAA>, which stands for Identifying Defective Argument by Acronym Application. 

The argument "If you don't get up early every day you will be late. The more you are late the more trouble you will get into. The more trouble you get into, you will end up losing your job and your family will starve." demonstrates characteristics of being overly simplistic and drawing extreme conclusions from limited information, making it seem unreasonable and alarmist. 

Given the definitions provided:

- <G> (Generalization): The argument doesn't necessarily generalize about a population or group; it's more linear and specific.
- <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration): The argument does not enumerate scenarios; it presents a chain of singular conditions.
- <IR> (Inconclusive Reason): This fits well as each conclusion (trouble, job loss, starvation) doesn’t logically follow just from being late.
- <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis): This also fits because the causal links between being late, getting into trouble, losing a job, and starving are insufficiently supported.
- <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition): The argument doesn't rely on repetition.
- <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus): There’s no consensus presumed.
- <DEP> (Ambiguous Language): There isn’t much ambiguity here since the terms are straightforward.

Therefore, the argument can be best classified as demonstrating types <IR> and <WCB>:

**<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** The reasons provided are inconclusive because the sequence of events leading from not waking up early to family starvation is highly speculative and lacks strong, logical justifications at each step.

**<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The causal links in the argument (e.g., being late leading directly to job loss and family starvation) lack sufficient evidential basis and are oversimplified.

Overall, the argument is an example of both Inconclusive Reason and Insufficient Causal Basis because it jumps to extreme conclusions without adequately supporting the intermediate steps.
