For 
The argument "I don’t understand why you’re saying I broke a promise. I said I’d never speak again to my ex-girlfriend. And I didn’t. I just sent her a quick text." can be analyzed using the defective argument types defined above. To identify the specific defective argument type applied (IDAA), we look for the most fitting categorization among the defined types.

This argument can be primarily classified as <DEP>, Ambiguous Language. Here’s why:

- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The term "speak" is ambiguous. The speaker is trying to manipulate the interpretation of "speaking" to mean only verbal communication, deliberately excluding other forms of communication such as texting. This usage of ambiguous language hides the fact that the promise was likely meant to encompass all forms of communication with the ex-girlfriend, not just verbal conversation.

Therefore, when analyzing this statement for defective arguments, the correct application (IDAA) would be:

**<DEP> - Ambiguous Language**.
