For 
To apply the concept of Identifying Defective Arguments and Evaluating Arguments (<IDAA>) to the statement "We will teach this miserable traitor (Snowball) that he cannot undo our work so easily," you need to analyze it for any of the defective argument types you’ve outlined. Here's the analysis:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This is not really a case of generalization, which involves drawing a broad conclusion from a small sample.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This argument does not involve listing possibilities incompletely.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The statement does suggest a reason "he cannot undo our work so easily," but it’s more an assertion without backing it up with evidence.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This argument does not clearly establish any actual causal relationship explicitly, it’s more a promise of action.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This argument does not involve repeating the same proposition to force it to be accepted.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: There is an underlying assumption that everyone agrees on the traitor's misdeed and the need to teach him a lesson, but this statement itself does not invoke a consensus directly.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: There might be some ambiguity in terms like "traitor" and "undo our work," which could mean different things to different people depending on their perspective.

Based on this, the statement can be classified primarily under <DEP> (Ambiguous Language) due to the subjective and potentially unclear terms used without precise context or evidence. Additionally, elements of <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) are present since the claim about Snowball's inability to undo their work is asserted without clear reasoning or supporting evidence. 

Therefore, the defective argument types identified in the statement are:
1. <DEP> - Ambiguous Language
2. <IR> - Inconclusive Reason
