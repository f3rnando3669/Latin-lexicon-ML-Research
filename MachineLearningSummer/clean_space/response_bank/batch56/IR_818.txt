Sure, before I apply the Identifying Defective Argument Application (IDAA) to the given argument, let's break down what each defective argument type means:

1. **Generalization (G)**: Making a broad statement based on a limited set of examples.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Failing to consider all possible options or cases.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Reasons that do not logically support the conclusion.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Claiming a cause-and-effect relationship without sufficient evidence.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Repeating a proposition without providing additional support.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assuming that because some people agree, it must be true.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Use of language that is unclear or can be interpreted in multiple ways.

Now let's analyze the argument provided:

**Argument:** "Yes, I do think that all drunk drivers should go to prison, but your honor, he is my son! He is a good boy who just made a mistake!"

This argument seems to rely heavily on emotion and personal circumstances rather than logical reasoning. Applying the IDAA, the following defective argument types could be identified:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The fact that he is the speaker's son and is perceived as a "good boy" who "just made a mistake" does not logically support the conclusion that he should not go to prison. The reasoning provided is insufficient to refute the initial stance that all drunk drivers should go to prison. The emotional appeal does not alter the legal consequences set by law.

Given this analysis, the defective argument type present in the statement is:

**<IR> Inconclusive Reason**.
