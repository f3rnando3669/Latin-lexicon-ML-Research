For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Arguments and Analyzing Appropriateness, whereby we inspect the given argument for defects and ascertain its validity and appropriateness.

"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, look at the bloody clothes, the murder weapon. Imagine the helpless screams of the victim. Such a crime deserves no verdict except guilty, guilty!"

Applying <IDAA> to the statement, the following defective arguments can be identified:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument relies on a visceral emotional appeal by presenting selected evidence (bloody clothes and murder weapon) without considering all possible evidence and circumstances related to the case. It does not account for, nor consider, alternative explanations or evidence that might suggest innocence.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The statement urges the jury to consider the gruesome details of the crime scene and the emotional response it evokes as sufficient reason to determine guilt. This is an inconclusive reasoning tactic because it does not directly establish a logical connection between the presented evidence and the defendant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

3. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The use of evocative language ("helpless screams of the victim") manipulates the emotional responses of the audience, potentially leading them toward a biased conclusion. This phrasing is ambiguous in its manipulation, focusing more on evoking horror than on presenting objective, concrete evidence for the defendantâ€™s guilt.

Thus, the argument suffers from these defects, making it inappropriate for a fair and rational examination of the case.
