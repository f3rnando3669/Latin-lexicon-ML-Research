For 
Applying <IDAA> (Identification of Defective Arguments) to the given statement:

**Statement:**
"My new sport psychology intervention works! I chose the player with the lowest batting average based on the last game from each of the teams in our amateur baseball league. Then I gave each of them my 5-minute intervention. And almost all of them improved their batting average in the next game!"

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - The speaker is making a general claim that the intervention works based on a small and specific sample size (players with the lowest batting average from each team).

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - The speaker claims success based on observations from a single subsequent game, which is an incomplete sample that does not consider other potential games, other players, or different conditions.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - The speaker does not provide conclusive evidence that the intervention was the actual cause of the improvement. Other factors, such as natural performance variation or the players' general progression, are not considered.
   
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - The reasoning relies on the observed improvement being due to the intervention without sufficient evidence to support this causal claim. The improvement could be due to random chance or other unexamined factors.
   
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - The argument does not exhibit a repetition of the same proposition to reinforce it. This defective argument type may not be directly applicable here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - The speaker assumes the validity of the intervention based on their own conclusion without seeking broader consensus or testing over a larger sample or period of time.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - "Works" is a vague term. Does it mean any improvement, significant improvement, or consistent improvement? The results need clearer definitions and quantified outcomes.

**Additional Consideration:**
The statistical phenomenon of **regression to the mean** is relevant here. Players with the lowest batting averages are likely to improve in the following games simply because of statistical tendency rather than because of the intervention.

**Overall Identification:**
The argument can be seen as defective primarily due to <G> (Generalization), <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration), <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis). Additionally, <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus) and <DEP> (Ambiguous Language) further highlight its weaknesses.
