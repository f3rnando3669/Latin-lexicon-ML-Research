To analyze the given statement "Billy murdered all those people because I spanked him when he was a child." and identify its defective argument types, let's apply the specific defective argument types:

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - This argument makes a direct causal claim that Billy's act of murder is due to being spanked as a child. The causal connection is insufficiently established with no evidence showing a direct link between spanking and committing murder.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The reason provided (spanking) is not conclusively tied to the outcome (murdering people). There are many other factors that could contribute to such violent behavior, and one cannot conclusively claim that spanking alone led to the murders.

3. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - The language used in this argument might be seen as ambiguous, as "spanking" and "murdered all those people” are terms that may need more precision. “Spanking” can vary greatly in its intensity and context, and “murdered all those people” is a broad phrase lacking specific details.

Therefore, the argument "Billy murdered all those people because I spanked him when he was a child." can be identified as incorporating the following defective argument types:
- <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis
- <IR> Inconclusive Reason
- <DEP> Ambiguous Language
