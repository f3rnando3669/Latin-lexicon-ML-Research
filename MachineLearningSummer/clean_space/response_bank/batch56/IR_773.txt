For 
<IDAA> stands for identifying defective argument types.

In the given argument, "I know the exam is graded based on performance, but you should give me an A. My cat has been sick, my car broke down, and I’ve had a cold, so it was really hard for me to study!” Demanded Aun." several defective argument types can be identified:

1. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The reasons given by Aun (sick cat, broken car, having a cold) do not conclusively support the conclusion that they deserve an A.

2. **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**: The term "it was really hard for me to study" is vague and subjective, making it an ambiguous reason for deserving an A instead of grades based on performance.

These argument flaws highlight inadequacies in the reasoning presented by Aun.
