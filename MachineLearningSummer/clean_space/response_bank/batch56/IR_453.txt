For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application. By identifying and analyzing the argument in question, we can determine if it falls under one of the predefined defective argument types:

In the conversation between Mike and Ken:

- **Mike:** It is morally wrong to cheat on your spouse, why on earth would you have done that?
- **Ken:** But what is morality exactly?
- **Mike:** It’s a code of conduct shared by cultures.
- **Ken:** But who creates this code?...

To analyze this using <IDAA>:

1. **Ken's First Response:** "But what is morality exactly?"  
   This response shifts the focus from the initial claim about cheating being morally wrong to a broader and more abstract question about the nature of morality itself. This can be seen as a form of **<IR> Inconclusive Reason** because it doesn't address the specific claim about the immorality of cheating. Instead, it redirects the conversation towards a philosophical debate about the definition of morality without providing a conclusion related to the initial concern.

2. **Mike's Second Response:** "It’s a code of conduct shared by cultures."  
   Mike attempts to define morality in a general sense, but this explanation may lack precision and could be open to interpretation. As such, it might be considered **<DEP> Ambiguous Language** because "a code of conduct shared by cultures" is a broad and somewhat vague explanation. It doesn't specify what these codes entail or how they apply to the specific situation of cheating on a spouse.

3. **Ken's Second Response:** "But who creates this code?..."  
   This response again shifts the focus to another abstract question about the origin of moral codes. This line of questioning can be categorized as **<IR> Inconclusive Reason** again. It continues the pattern of avoiding the direct issue of the moral implications of cheating and instead tries to open a new, unrelated discussion.

By using <IDAA>, we see that the dialogue involves:

- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason** for Ken's questions, which serve to divert the discussion rather than address Mike's initial assertion about the morality of cheating.
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language** for Mike's attempt to define morality in a broad and potentially unclear manner.

In summary, the exchange involves defective arguments mainly in the form of inconclusive reasoning by Ken and ambiguous language by Mike.
