For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Analysis. Let's break down the dialogue to see if it contains any of the defective argument types defined:

Mike: It is morally wrong to cheat on your spouse, why on earth would you have done that?

Ken: But what is morality exactly?

Mike: It’s a code of conduct shared by cultures.

Ken: But who creates this code?

**Examination of Arguments:**

1. **Mike's Initial Claim:** "It is morally wrong to cheat on your spouse, why on earth would you have done that?"
   - This is a statement of a moral belief, with an implicit assumption that Ken is aware of and agrees with this moral principle. It does not inherently contain a defective argument based on the provided definitions.

2. **Ken’s Response:** "But what is morality exactly?"
   - Ken introduces a philosophical question which seems to deflect the original assertion. This may be seen as an attempt to sidestep the issue rather than addressing it directly (though it is not inherently one of the defined defective arguments).

3. **Mike's Explanation:** "It’s a code of conduct shared by cultures."
   - This definition is a form of generalization about morality. It may oversimplify the complexity of moral systems, potentially fitting as <G> (Generalization) since it assumes all cultures share a single code of conduct uniformly.

4. **Ken’s Follow-up Question:** "But who creates this code?"
   - Ken's question pursues a deeper understanding of morality which isn't directly an argument but could be aiming to reveal complexities that Mike's explanation did not address.

Given this examination, the identified defective argument can be as follows:

- **Mike's Generalization about Morality**: Mike's response can be tagged as <G> (Generalization). By simplifying morality to a "code of conduct shared by cultures," Mike may not account for the variability and complexity of moral codes across different cultures.

Thus, the identified defective argument is <G> Generalization in Mike's claim: "It’s a code of conduct shared by cultures."
