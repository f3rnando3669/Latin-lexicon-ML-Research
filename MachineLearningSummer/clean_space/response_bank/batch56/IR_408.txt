For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Applications) to the dialogue between the daughter and the mom, let's break down the conversation and see if any of the defined defective arguments are being used.

**Dialogue:**

1. **Daughter: Mom, I want that doll!**
2. **Mom: Let's get home and I'll get you a popsicle!**
3. **Daughter: Ooh, popsicle!**

**Step-by-step Analysis:**

- **Identification of the types of responses and reasoning:**

  - The daughter clearly states what she wants (the doll).
  - The mom responds by redirecting the daughter's attention to a popsicle instead.
  - The daughter shifts her focus and expresses interest in the popsicle.

- **Assessment for defective arguments:**

  - This scenario doesn’t entail the reasoning behind the request for the doll or why it is being redirected, but it can be analyzed for distraction and redirection.

Looking at the types of defective arguments:

- **<G> Generalization**: Not applicable here since no general conclusions are being drawn.
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: Not applicable as there is no enumeration of options or matters.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: Not directly applicable since no explicit reason is given.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: Not directly applicable related to causation.
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: Not relevant since there is no repetitive proposition.
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: Not applicable since no consensus or majority opinion is being presumed.
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**: Not immediately applicable as the language is clear in this context.

**Final Application:**

There isn’t a direct match for the given defective arguments. However, considering the response redirection:

- We might infer an application related indirectly, which isn't defined among the listed types but often termed as "Red Herring," a distraction technique to shift attention away from the request or argument made by the daughter. While **Red Herring** is not explicitly defined within the provided defective arguments, it most closely matches here.

Therefore, while <IDAA> does not find a direct match among the defined defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP>, this dialogue could be loosely classed as employing a distraction or redirection technique, akin to a Red Herring.
