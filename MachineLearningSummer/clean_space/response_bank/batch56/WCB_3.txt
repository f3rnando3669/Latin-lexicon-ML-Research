OK, let's first clarify what you mean by <IDAA> and then we can apply it to the statement provided.

<IDAA> stands for Identify and Discuss Argument Analysis. It involves:

1. Identifying the argument or claim made.
2. Determining if the argument falls into any of the defective argument types defined: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language (<DEP>).
3. Discussing why the argument fits into one or more of these categories.

Let's apply <IDAA> to the statement "You said that 'runs' occur to statistically independent phenomena such as roulette wheel spins."

1. **Identifying the Argument**: The statement suggests that "runs" (streaks of similar outcomes) can occur in statistically independent events like roulette wheel spins.

2. **Determining the Defective Argument Type(s)**:
    - This could possibly fall under <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) because the statement assumes that because runs are observed, there is an implication without strong support concerning the true randomness or independence of events.
    - It might also fall under <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) if the speaker is implying that the occurrence of runs provides a causal explanation for some outcome without sufficient evidence.

3. **Discussion**:
    - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The presence of runs in statistically independent events is not sufficient on its own to conclude anything about the nature or cause of those runs without additional statistical analysis or evidence. The argument is lacking in the necessary support to be considered conclusive.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: If the statement were trying to establish that the presence of runs indicates some form of causal relationship, it would lack the necessary causal foundation. Independent phenomena do not interact; thus, any inference that runs suggest otherwise would be unsupported.

So, the most fitting defective argument type for the provided statement appears to be both Inconclusive Reason (<IR>) and possibly Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), depending on the full context of the argument.
