For 
To apply the defect types to the argument "President Reagan was a great communicator because he had the knack of talking effectively to the people," we need to analyze the reasoning and see if it fits any of the defined defective argument types:

- **Generalization (G)**: This defect occurs when a conclusion is drawn from an inadequate number of cases. This argument does not present a broad claim based on insufficient instances, so it does not fit Generalization.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This defect occurs when not all possibilities are considered. The argument focuses solely on a single trait without weighing other potential traits or methods effective communicators might possess, making it an incomplete enumeration. However, the assertion is quite specific to President Reagan, considering only one perspective could align with Incomplete Enumeration.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This defect arises when the reasons provided do not sufficiently support the conclusion. The argument hinges on “talking effectively to the people” as the sole reason for being a “great communicator,” which may be viewed as not sufficiently conclusive. Not every instance of talking effectively equates to being a great communicator, so it seems the reasoning here is inconclusive.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This defect is when the cause-and-effect relationship is not sufficiently established. The argument doesn't provide enough basis to conclude that effective communication directly equates to being a "great communicator." There might be other contributing factors to his greatness not considered here.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This defect arises when the argument merely rephrases the conclusion without providing new support. In the given argument, it essentially restates President Reagan’s ability to communicate effectively as being a great communicator, which seems to fit this defect.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This defect occurs when it is assumed that the viewpoint is universally accepted without evidence. The argument does not appeal to a consensus but rather introduces a specific reasoning, making it less applicable under this definition.

- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This defect arises when the language used has multiple interpretations. While the term "great communicator" can have different interpretations, in this context, it doesn't seem overly ambiguous.

Let's summarize the identified potential defects:
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not consider other traits that might make Reagan a great communicator.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument’s reason does not definitively prove Reagan’s greatness as a communicator.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The argument repeats the idea of effective communication without adding substantial new information.

Therefore, the argument type defect <IDAA> could be a combination of:
1. Incomplete Enumeration (FE),
2. Inconclusive Reason (IR),
3. Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR).

Thus, a more accurately flagged argument type defect for this argument could be:

- **FE, IR, RR**.
