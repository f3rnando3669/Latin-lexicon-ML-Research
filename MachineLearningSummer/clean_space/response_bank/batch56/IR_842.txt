For 
The statement in question exemplifies a form of **Irrelevant Conclusion** or **Red Herring**, where the argument diverts attention from the main issue to something tangentially related. This type of fallacy distracts from the actual point being debated.

Here is the categorization based on the defective argument types defined:

1. **Statement:** "You say that Coach Smith pressured teachers to give his students passing grades. But don’t you agree that athletics are important to schools? Don’t they build character?"
2. **Analysis:** The main issue is whether Coach Smith pressured teachers to give his students passing grades. Instead of addressing this accusation directly, the argument shifts focus to the unrelated (yet positive) aspects of athletics.
3. **Defective Argument Type Applied:** <IR> Inconclusive Reason.

So, the argument provided can be categorized under <IR>.
