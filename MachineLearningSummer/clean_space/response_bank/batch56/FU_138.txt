For 
To apply the Identification of Defective Argument Types Analysis (IDAA) to the statement "Everyone should like coffee: 95% of teachers do!" you would follow these steps:

1. **Identify the argument**: 
   The statement is making an argument that "everyone should like coffee," using the fact that "95% of teachers do" as its primary support.

2. **Examine the argument structure**:
   - Premise: 95% of teachers like coffee.
   - Conclusion: Everyone should like coffee.

3. **Check for defective argument types**:

   - **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument may be a generalization because it takes the preference of a specific group (teachers) and applies it broadly to everyone. However, it is not clear whether this argument qualifies strictly under <G> without additional context about the typicality or size of the group.
     
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument cites a statistic about a subgroup (teachers) and wrongly assumes that this subgroup's preferences are indicative of the preferences of the entire population. 

   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason given (95% of teachers like coffee) is not conclusive enough to justify the conclusion (everyone should like coffee). This reflects an assumption that teachers' preferences necessarily translate to a universal preference without adequate justification.
   
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument implies a causal connection (because teachers like coffee, everyone should) without sufficient evidence to support the causal claim.
   
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: There is no indication that the argument merely restates its proposition repeatedly, so this is not applicable here.
   
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument assumes that the consensus of a specific group (teachers) should dictate universal preference, without addressing the broader population's possibly divergent preferences.
   
   - **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The language in the statement is not inherently ambiguous, so this defective argument type does not apply.

4. **Draw conclusions**:
   The primary defective argument types applicable to "Everyone should like coffee: 95% of teachers do!" are:

   - **FE (Incomplete Enumeration)**, because it assumes that the partial data point (teachers' preferences) is representative of the whole population.
   - **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**, because the reasoning given is not sufficient to justify the broad conclusion drawn.
   - **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**, as it insufficiently implies a causal relationship where none has been established.
   - **FU (Presumptuous Consensus)**, because it presumes that the opinion of a select group should be adopted universally.

By applying IDAA, we determine that the argument is defective mainly due to the presumption that the preferences of a specific group (teachers) should be generalized to the entire population without sufficient justification.
