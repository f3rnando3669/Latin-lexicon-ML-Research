For 
Certainly! Here is the application of defining and identifying defective argument types based on your given argumentative statements:

1. **Argument**: "If the government allows psychologists to prescribe medications there will be no basis to block them from obtaining competence and legal authority to conduct other traditionally medical procedures such as diagnosing minor skin irritations, treating a sprained ankle, setting a broken bone, and performing neurosurgery."
    - **Defective Arguments Applied**:
        - **Generalization (G)**: It is assumed that allowing psychologists to prescribe medication would inevitably lead to an extreme progression where they undertake all types of medical procedures, without considering the distinct regulatory and educational steps involved in each medical specialty.
        - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument neglects the various checks, balances, and intermediate steps involved in the regulation of medical procedures, leading to an incomplete account of how regulatory bodies operate.
        - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The rationale connecting the prescription of medication to performing complex medical procedures like neurosurgery is unsupported and overly speculative.

2. **Argument**: "Never reduce a fee for any patient for any reason or else you'll find yourself constantly reducing fees for everyone, everyone will take advantage of you, your patients will lose respect for you and for therapy, and you'll lose money and go bankrupt."
    - **Defective Arguments Applied**:
        - **Generalization (G)**: The conclusion that reducing a fee once necessarily results in ubiquitous fee reductions, universal disrespect, and eventual bankruptcy is an exaggerated generalization.
        - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The idea that every reduction in fees will lead to a continuous reduction for everyone is an unsupported repetition of the initial claim.
        - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assumes universally that all patients will take advantage of the practitioner and lose respect, which is a presumption that may not align with reality.
        - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The causal link between reducing a fee once and eventual bankruptcy lacks solid grounding, presenting an inconclusive line of reasoning.

**Explanation**:
Both arguments employ a slippery slope type of reasoning, wherein a relatively minor action is claimed to lead inevitably to extreme and negative outcomes without adequate evidence or justification. This incorporates defective argument types by overgeneralizing consequences (G), making unsupported leaps in reasoning (IR), and presuming consensus or behavior without proper backing (FU).
