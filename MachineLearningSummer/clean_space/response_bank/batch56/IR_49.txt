For 
<IDAA> means "Identify the Defective Argument Applied" to the given statement.

Let's analyze the argument in the statement: "Aaron Rodgers says you should get State Farm Insurance on your home, car, motorcycle, or trailer!"

This type of argument is appealing to authority or celebrity endorsement. Aaron Rodgers, a professional football player, is not necessarily an expert on insurance. Using his endorsement as a reason for purchasing insurance is fallacious because his fame or success in sports does not make him a credible source on insurance matters.

Identifying the defective argument type from the list, we could classify it as <FU> - Presumptuous Consensus. This is because the argument assumes that because a well-known figure endorses a product, it must be a good choice, relying on presumed consensus rather than sound reasoning or expert advice.

<IDAA> <FU>
