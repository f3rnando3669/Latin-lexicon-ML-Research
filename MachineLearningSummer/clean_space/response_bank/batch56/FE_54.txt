For 
<IDAA> to "Student: You didn't teach us this; we never learned this.

Teacher: So, you're either lazy or unwilling to learn, is that right?"

The Teacher's response can be classified as an <IDAA> (Defective Argument Type). Specifically, this seems to be an instance of a **False Dichotomy** or **False Dilemma** where the Teacher is presenting only two extreme possibilities ("lazy" or "unwilling to learn") as the only explanations, disregarding other potential reasons the student might not have learned the material (e.g., perhaps it was not sufficiently covered, or perhaps the student had a legitimate reason such as absence or misunderstanding).

So, the Teacher's argument falls under the category of Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), as it fails to provide a plausible, comprehensive basis for the claim by excluding other valid possibilities.
