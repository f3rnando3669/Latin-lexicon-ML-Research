Sure, I understand that the specified defective argument types are:

- **Generalization (<G>)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**

To apply the Identifying Defective Argument Analysis (IDAA) to the question, "What is the appeal being used through this sad little girl?" we need to analyze the nature of the argument and determine if it fits into any of the defective categories defined above.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This doesn't seem to involve a broad generalization based on insubstantial evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The question doesn't list options or fail to mention some important possibilities; it is open-ended.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The question doesn't seem to provide a reason at all, conclusive or otherwise.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: No causal claims are made in the question.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: There's no repetition or proposition being reconsidered.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The question doesn't make any assumptions about a consensus or majority agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The question is somewhat ambiguous in its language. The phrase "the appeal being used" could be open to interpretation. What kind of appeal is meantâ€”emotional appeal, logical appeal, ethical appeal? The term "sad little girl" also injects emotional weight without clear context, which might lead to multiple interpretations or assumptions.

Based on these points, the defective argument type most applicable might be **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**. The question uses language that can be interpreted in multiple ways without clarifying the specific nature of the appeal or the context in which it is being assessed.
