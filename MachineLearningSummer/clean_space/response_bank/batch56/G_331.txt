For 
The argument "Fred, the German, stole my wallet. Therefore, all Germans are thieves." can be analyzed and identified as containing the defective argument type <G> â€” Generalization.

Here's the breakdown:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: This occurs when a conclusion is made about a whole group based on an inadequate sample size. In this case, the argument concludes that all Germans are thieves based on the actions of one individual German, Fred. This single instance is not sufficient to make a reliable generalization about the entire population of Germans.

Therefore, according to the defective argument types defined earlier:

- **Defective Argument Type**: <G>
- **Reason**: The argument makes a broad generalization about all Germans based on the behavior of one individual, which is not logically justifiable.
