For 
**Identifying Defective Argument Application (IDAA):**

The argument given is: 
"If there is no objective morality, then all the bad people will not be punished for their bad behavior after death. I don’t like that; therefore, morality must be objective."

Let's analyze the argument using the identified defective argument types.

1. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The premise that there needs to be an objective morality to ensure bad people are punished is a subjective belief. Just because someone doesn't like the idea of bad people not being punished (an emotional response), it doesn't logically follow that objective morality must indeed exist. The personal dislike of a scenario does not provide conclusive evidence for the existence of objective morality.

2. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument implies a subjective preference as justification for an objective truth. This kind of argument often assumes that because it would be unfortunate or undesirable if something were true, it cannot be true. However, personal preferences or societal consensus do not determine factual truths or objective moral standards.

In summary, the argument uses an emotional reaction to a hypothetical scenario ("I don’t like that") to conclude a factual claim ("morality must be objective"), which is a classic case of **IR (Inconclusive Reason)** and also touches upon **FU (Presumptuous Consensus)** by implying subjective preferences can dictate objective realities.
