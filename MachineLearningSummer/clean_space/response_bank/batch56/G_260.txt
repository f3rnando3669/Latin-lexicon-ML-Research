For 
Analyzing the given statement using the defined defective argument types (IDAA stands for "Identify Defective Argument Types and Analyze"), we can break down the argument as follows:

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - Claim: "People are creating too much waste."
   - Analysis: This is a general statement without specifying which people or providing data to support the extent of waste creation.
   - Evaluation: This is a broad generalization without specific evidence. \(<G>\)

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - Claim: "The temperature will continue to rise, natural disasters will occur more frequently, the animals will starve to death, and the planet will basically turn into Venus!"
   - Analysis: This statement lists a series of dire outcomes without exhaustively considering all potential factors and outcomes, and it lacks explicit data or a comprehensive overview of all relevant scientific evidence.
   - Evaluation: The argument relies on a limited selection of adverse outcomes. \(<FE>\)

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - Claim: "The planet will basically turn into Venus."
   - Analysis: The comparison between Earth and Venus is extreme and unlikely, lacking a clear causal link or enough evidence to support such a conclusion.
   - Evaluation: The reasoning is inconclusive and hyperbolic. \(<IR>\)

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - Claim: "People are creating too much waste, [...] and the planet will basically turn into Venus."
   - Analysis: Although waste creation and environmental degradation are issues, the direct causal link between current waste production and transforming Earth into a Venus-like planet is not substantiated with sufficient evidence.
   - Evaluation: The causal basis is insufficient to support the extreme outcome described. \(<WCB>\)

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - The argument does not directly feature a repetition of a proposition; it presents a chain of escalating consequences instead.
   - Evaluation: Not applicable. 

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - The argument does not explicitly state or imply a presumptuous consensus.
   - Evaluation: Not applicable.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - Phrase: "The planet will basically turn into Venus."
   - Analysis: The statement uses dramatic and ambiguous language by comparing Earth to Venus without a clear and precise scientific explanation.
   - Evaluation: The use of "basically turn into Venus" introduces ambiguity. \(<DEP>\)

Summary with Identified Defective Argument Types:
- \(<G>\): General statement on waste creation.
- \(<FE>\): Limited selection of outcomes.
- \(<IR>\): Inconclusive reasoning with extreme comparison.
- \(<WCB>\): Insufficient evidence linking waste and Venus-like transformation.
- \(<DEP>\): Use of ambiguous language.

Overall, the argument presented in the statement relies on several flawed reasoning types, including generalization, incomplete enumeration, inconclusive reasoning, insufficient causal basis, and ambiguous language, making it an alarmist and weakly-supported claim.
