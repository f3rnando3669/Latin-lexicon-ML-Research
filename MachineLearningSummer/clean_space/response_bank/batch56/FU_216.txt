Certainly! To apply the concept of Defective Arguments Analysis to the statement "I am voting for Smith for President because the rest of my family is voting for him," we need to identify which defective argument types (from the ones defined) are applicable.

Let's break down the statement and look for defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - This doesn't seem to apply directly because the statement doesn't make a broad claim based on a small sample.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - This argument doesn't enumerate different options or categories incompletely, so it doesn't fit.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - This can apply because the reason provided (family voting for Smith) does not sufficiently justify the decision to vote for Smith. 

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - This argument type involves a lack of adequate causal reasoning. The reason given (family's voting preference) doesn't have a direct causative link to why Smith should be the preferred candidate, so this might apply.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - This argument type entails repeating a proposition without further support, which doesn't directly apply here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - This could apply because the argument assumes the correctness of the choice based on the consensus of a familiar group (family), presuming their decision is a valid basis to follow.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - Thereâ€™s no ambiguous or unclear language in the statement, so this doesn't apply.

### Defective Argument Analysis:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason (because the rest of the family is voting for him) is not a strong, evidence-based reason to justify the decision to vote for Smith.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal linkage between family voting for Smith and the decision to vote for Smith is weak and lacks sufficient rationale.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There's an assumption that the family's decision forms a valid basis for the speaker's decision, which is a presumptuous stance that doesn't critically engage with the candidate's qualifications or policies.

So the statement "I am voting for Smith for President because the rest of my family is voting for him" exhibits the following defective argument types: <IR>, <WCB>, and <FU>.
