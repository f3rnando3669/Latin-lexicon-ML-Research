For 
The term <IDAA> isn't defined in the list of defective argument types you provided. However, I can infer that it might stand for "Identity Attack Argument" or something similar, given the context of the example provided. This type of argument is also commonly referred to as an ad hominem attack. 

An ad hominem argument attacks the person making an argument rather than addressing the argument itself. In the provided example:

“Oh, please. What would you know about labor laws? You don’t even have a job.”

This statement dismisses the person's knowledge about labor laws purely on the basis that they don’t have a job, rather than evaluating the merits of their understanding or argument concerning labor laws. This is a classic example of an ad hominem fallacy, where the attack on the person's circumstance (unemployment) is irrelevant to the substantive issue (knowledge of labor laws).

If <IDAA> is meant to mean something specific and distinct, please provide additional context or a definition for better clarity. For now, I'll assume it refers to some form of an ad hominem attack based on the given statement.
