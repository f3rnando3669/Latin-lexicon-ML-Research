For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Type. Given the statement "Children should not listen to rap music. Everyone knows that," let's analyze it:

1. Generalization (<G>): This argument doesn't seem to be a generalization of a specific instance to a broad conclusion. It lacks specific instances to generalize from.

2. Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>): This argument doesn’t attempt to list cases or instances, so this fallacy doesn’t apply.

3. Inconclusive Reason (<IR>): The statement lacks strong supportive reasoning—there is no clear explanation given as to why children should avoid rap music. However, this category might not perfectly fit since it's more about the absence of proper reasoning rather than an inconclusive one.

4. Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>): There is no causation or link provided between rap music and harm to children in this argument.

5. Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>): The argument simply states "Everyone knows that" without repeating the proposition multiple times in different forms.

6. Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>): The statement "Everyone knows that" implies that the consensus alone is a reason, presuming wide-reaching agreement when it may not be justified. This fits the fallacy of Presumptuous Consensus.

7. Ambiguous Language (<DEP>): The argument doesn’t hinge on ambiguous language.

Thus, upon careful evaluation, the defective argument type that best applies is:

<FU> Presumptuous Consensus.

So, applying <IDAA> to the statement:

**Children should not listen to rap music. Everyone knows that.**
<IDAA> <FU>: "Everyone knows that" presumes a consensus without providing actual evidence or supporting reasons.
