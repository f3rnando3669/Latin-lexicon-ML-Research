Applying the concept of Identifying Defective Argument Alternatives (<IDAA>) to the statement:

"Once a year, a miracle causes this large rock to float about ten centimeters off the ground since supernatural powers want us to remember the martyrs who died in that spot."

We can identify the following defective argument types in the statement:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The statement claims that supernatural powers cause the rock to float to remind people of martyrs. However, it does not provide sufficient evidence to conclusively link the floating rock to supernatural powers or the martyrs. The reason given is speculative and lacks substantial proof.
  
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal relationship suggested (that supernatural powers cause the rock to float to remember the martyrs) is not supported by any empirical evidence or logical reasoning. There is no established connection demonstrated between the cited cause (supernatural powers and martyrs) and the effect (rock floating).

3. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The term "supernatural powers" is not clearly defined. It is ambiguous and leaves open the question of what specific powers or forces are being referenced, making the argument unclear and open to multiple interpretations.

These identifications highlight the statement's flaws in reasoning, evidence, and language, which undermine its credibility.
