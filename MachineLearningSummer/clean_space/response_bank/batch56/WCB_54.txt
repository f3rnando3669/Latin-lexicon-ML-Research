For 
Using the <IDAA> acronym (Identify, Define, Analyze, and Address) to evaluate the argument:

**Identify:**
The argument consists of two statements:
1. "All the schools in the area had to be kept closed for most part of the week."
2. "Many parents have withdrawn their children from the local schools."

**Define:**
To analyze this argument using the defective argument types we've defined:

- **Generalization (<G>):** Making broad claims based on limited evidence.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Failing to consider all relevant possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Providing reasons that do not conclusively support the conclusion.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Assuming a cause-and-effect relationship without sufficient evidence.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Repeating a claim without additional support.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Assuming a widespread agreement or belief without justification.
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** Using language that is open to multiple interpretations.

**Analyze:**
1. The fact that all schools were closed for most of the week appears to be a statement of fact, needing no further evidence at this stage of analysis.
2. The claim that many parents have withdrawn their children from local schools could be related, but the argument does not make the causal linkage explicit. There is an implied cause-and-effect relationship, suggesting that the school closures are the reason for the withdrawals.

Given this, the argument primarily suffers from:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The argument assumes that the reason parents withdrew their children is because the schools were closed for most part of the week, but it does not provide sufficient evidence to establish this causal linkage. Other reasons for the withdrawals are possible and have not been addressed.

**Address:**
To strengthen the argument, provide evidence that directly links the school closures to the parents' decisions to withdraw their children. This could involve presenting data showing a correlation between the closure period and withdrawal rates, or citing testimonials from parents attributing their decisions to the closures.

Revised Argument:
1. "All the schools in the area had to be kept closed for most part of the week due to hazardous weather conditions."
2. "Many parents have withdrawn their children from the local schools, citing the frequent closures as a primary reason for their decision, as indicated by recent surveys and direct feedback from parents."

This provides a more solid causal basis for the argument, addressing the initial defective argument type.
