For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Analysis) to the statement "I have served over 20 years in the military, and based on my professional opinion, I believe more money needs to be spent on protective armor and military vehicles," we will analyze the potential defective arguments used:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument does not appear to be making a generalized statement based on insufficient evidence.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement does not list incomplete options that could be considered flawed.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The argument here relies heavily on the authority and professional opinion of the speaker without providing specific evidence to support the claim that more money will necessarily lead to better outcomes. While the speaker's experience could be valuable, the lack of additional evidence or reasoning can make the argument inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The speaker implies a causal relationship between spending more money and improved protection but does not provide evidence or specific reasoning to support how an increase in spending would directly result in the desired outcomes.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The argument does not seem to repetitively state a proposition in a faulty manner.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The speaker does not appear to claim a consensus or assume an agreement without evidence.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The language used is not particularly ambiguous as the terms "protective armor" and "military vehicles" are fairly clear.

Considering the analysis, the potential defective arguments present in the statement can be identified as:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The argument relies on the authority of the speaker's professional opinion without providing specific evidence or detailed reasoning.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal link between spending more money and achieving better protection is asserted without detailed substantiation.

These points highlight where the argument might fail to be fully compelling or robust due to lack of evidence and reasoning.
