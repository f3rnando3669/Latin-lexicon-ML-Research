For 
To break down the statement "Executions are moral because we must have a death penalty to discourage violent crime." into its logical components and identify defective argument types, we can apply the provided definitions of defective arguments.

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - Definition: Extending a conclusion to all cases based on a few examples.
   - Application: The statement does not seem to involve a generalization, as it does not provide specific cases to make a universal claim.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Definition: Drawing a conclusion based on incomplete considerations.
   - Application: The statement claims that executions are moral based solely on their supposed deterrent effect on violent crime. It fails to consider other ethical or practical arguments against capital punishment, such as the risk of executing innocent people, potential social biases, or human rights issues.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Definition: Drawing a conclusion using an argument that does not definitively lead to the conclusion.
   - Application: The statement assumes that because the death penalty might deter violent crime, it is therefore moral. This reasoning is inconclusive because the effectiveness of deterrence does not directly establish the moral correctness of executions. Other moral frameworks or considerations are left unexplored.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Definition: Ascribing a cause-and-effect relationship without sufficient proof.
   - Application: The argument presumes that the death penalty causally leads to a decrease in violent crime. This presumed causation is often debated and lacks clear, unequivocal evidence to support a direct cause-and-effect link.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - Definition: Repeating the same claim without additional supporting evidence.
   - Application: The statement does not involve faulty repetition, as it does not reiterate the original proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - Definition: Asserting that a conclusion is true because many people believe it.
   - Application: The statement does not base its claim on a presumptive consensus, so this does not apply here.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - Definition: Using vague or ambiguous language that can lead to misinterpretation.
   - Application: The terms "moral" and "discourage" are somewhat subjective and open to different interpretations. The language could be seen as ambiguous, but this is not the primary defect in the argument.

Given the analysis, the primary defects in the argument "Executions are moral because we must have a death penalty to discourage violent crime." relate most closely to:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument does not consider all relevant factors and other possible objections to the death penalty.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The link between deterring crime and morality is not sufficiently established.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The assumption that the death penalty leads to a reduction in violent crime lacks sufficient evidence.

Therefore, the argument can be categorized under <FE>, <IR>, and <WCB> type defects.
