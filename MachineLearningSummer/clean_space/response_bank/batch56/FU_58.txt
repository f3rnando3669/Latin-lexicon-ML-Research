Certainly! To analyze the argument "Everybody is late coming back from lunch, so it shouldn't matter if I'm late," using the defective arguments you've defined, let's see if any of these types apply:

<G> Generalization:
The statement "Everybody is late coming back from lunch" may be an overgeneralization. It potentially assumes that everyone indeed is late without providing specific evidence.

<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:
If only a few people are observed being late, and the statement assumes "everybody" is late, it would be an incomplete enumeration of all individuals.

<IR> Inconclusive Reason:
The argument "it shouldn't matter if I'm late" based on the initial premise might seem inconclusive. The reasoning does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that being late is acceptable.

<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:
This type does not strictly apply here because there's no causal relationship being inferred in the given statement.

<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:
This defective argument type does not apply here as there is no repeated proposition in the argument.

<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:
The statement assumes a consensus (that being late is acceptable) from the presumed action of everyone else being late, which could be presumptuous without explicit agreement.

<DEP> Ambiguous Language:
In this context, the language isn't particularly ambiguous, so this defective argument type does not apply here.

Applying <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Application) to the argument, we find:

- It is primarily an <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration), as the claim about "everybody" might be based on observing just a few individuals.
- It also reflects <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), since the reasoning from the premise "everybody is late" to the conclusion "it shouldn't matter if I'm late" is not sufficiently sound.
- Additionally, it can be seen as <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus) since it presumes that because others are late, it is agreed that being late is acceptable without explicit evidence of consensus.

Therefore, the argument "Everybody is late coming back from lunch, so it shouldn't matter if I'm late" can be categorized under <FE>, <IR>, and <FU>.
