In order to classify the argument you provided under the different defective argument types, it's important to identify which specific fallacy or defective reasoning is being illustrated. Let's analyze the argument step-by-step:

The original statement is: "I admire the president for being a good role model."
The reply is: "But the New York Times says he’s a lousy role model, so you’re wrong."

Let's break down the reply:
1. The reply doesn't directly address the reasons why the original speaker admires the president as a role model.
2. Instead, the reply appeals to the authority of the New York Times to refute the original speaker's opinion.

This response relies on an appeal to authority and does not directly engage with the qualities or behaviors of the president that may or may not make him a good role model. Let's identify which defective argument types apply here:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reply uses an inconclusive reason as it does not directly negate the characteristics or reasons for considering the president to be a good role model. It bypasses the actual content of the argument by citing an external source's opinion.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This might not exactly fit, as there's no direct repetition of an argument here, but rather a deferral to an authority without critical engagement.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument assumes that the New York Times's stance is a consensus or authoritative enough to dismiss any differing opinions outright without further justification.

Given these points, <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Application) would likely classify this argument as <IR> Inconclusive Reason, because the reply doesn't address the specific reasons given for the admiration, it just refers to another source.

Thus:

<IDAA>: <IR>
