For 
The given statement "Good source of Vitamin D"...*doesn't mention the terrible amounts of sugar." can potentially fall under a few of the defined defective argument types, depending on the context and focus of the analysis:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: If the argument is suggesting that a product is not beneficial solely based on the omission of negative aspects (sugar content), it is failing to present a complete picture by not fully enumerating all relevant factors. The product might still be a good source of Vitamin D despite its sugar content.

2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: If the argument implies that the mention of Vitamin D as a benefit is negated by the high sugar content without establishing a direct causal connection between the two (i.e., how much the sugar negates the benefit of Vitamin D), it might be lacking a solid causal foundation.

Thus, you can label this argument as:

- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)** because it only highlights the good aspect (Vitamin D) while omitting another significant aspect (sugar), possibly misleading the audience by not providing a comprehensive evaluation.
