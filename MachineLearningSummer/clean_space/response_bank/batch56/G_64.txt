The argument presented is: 

"I can't trust the mayor or the governor. All politicians must be liars."

Analyzing this statement under the provided framework of defective argument types, we can identify the dominant fallacy. The argument is an example of a hasty **Generalization (G)**. The speaker extrapolates a judgment about "all politicians" based on the speaker's distrust of only two individuals (the mayor and the governor).

### Breakdown:
- **Generalization (G):** The assertion that "All politicians must be liars" is an overgeneralization. It unfairly attributes the perceived untrustworthiness of a very small sample (the mayor and the governor) to an entire group (all politicians).

Thus, applying **Generalization (G)** to the stated argument correctly identifies the defective nature of the reasoning, as it relies on insufficient evidence to support the sweeping conclusion.
