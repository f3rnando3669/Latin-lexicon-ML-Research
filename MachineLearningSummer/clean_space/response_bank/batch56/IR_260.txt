Certainly! To apply the concept of Defective Arguments Analysis to the provided statement, let’s identify and label the potential defective arguments present:

Statement:
"I have been accused of using an ad hominem approach in trying to defend my research. But those who attack me and my research are also using ad hominem. And they started it!"

1. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   The argument attempts to dismiss the accusation of an ad hominem approach by pointing out that the opponents also use ad hominem attacks. This does not address the validity of the initial critique but rather shifts the focus by repeating the same faulty reasoning.

2. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   The phrase "they started it" can be considered ambiguous. This kind of phrasing shifts blame without providing specific context or evidence, which leaves it open to various interpretations and causes confusion about the actual issue.

3. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   Implicitly assumes that because the opponents have also used ad hominem attacks, this somehow justifies the speaker’s use of similar tactics, suggesting an unfounded consensus on the acceptability of ad hominem arguments.

In summary, the provided statement incorporates elements of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** by reiterating similar attacks instead of addressing the core issue, **Ambiguous Language (DEP)** by using vague terms like "they started it", and **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** by implying mutual acceptability of the behavior without solid justification.
