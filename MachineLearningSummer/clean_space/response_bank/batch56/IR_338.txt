For 
To apply an argument defect analysis annotation (IDAA) to the given statement, we need to identify the type of defective argument used. The statement is:

"Of course Marx' theories about the ideal society are bunk. The guy spent all his time in the library."

Let's break down this statement in terms of the specified defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G):** This argument doesn't generalize from a small sample to a sweeping conclusion.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This argument doesn't provide partial or incomplete lists.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The statement does provide a reason (Marx spent all his time in the library) but it is not necessarily inconclusive on its own.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reason given (spending time in the library) doesn't have a direct causal relationship with the validity of Marxâ€™s theories. The statement assumes that just because Marx was in the library, it implies his theories are faulty, which lacks a sufficient causal basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This argument doesn't repeat a proposition to justify itself.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This argument doesn't rely on the assumption that everyone agrees with it.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The language used isn't particularly ambiguous in this context.

So, the most appropriate defective argument type for this statement is:

**<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis.**

Therefore, the annotated argument is:

"Of course Marx' theories about the ideal society are bunk. The guy spent all his time in the library." <WCB>
