It seems you've defined several types of defective arguments that can undermine the validity of a claim. To apply these to an argument, we need to understand what each type represents and see if they are being used in the given statement.

Let's dissect the statement "I am only slightly obese. That is perfectly normal here in America." and see which, if any, of the given defective argument types apply:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This occurs when a general statement is made based on a limited amount of data or specific examples.  
   - This statement does not appear to generalize from limited data but rather makes a claim about being slightly obese being normal in America.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This involves making a conclusion based on an incomplete examination of the necessary factors or elements.  
   - The statement doesn’t explicitly enumerate factors. However, it could hint at this by implying that all or most Americans are slightly obese without sufficient evidence.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This pertains to presenting an argument where the reasons given do not conclusively support the conclusion.  
   - The statement uses "perfectly normal" as a justification, which may not be a strong or conclusive reason to validate being slightly obese. Hence, this could apply.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This is present where there is an insufficient causal link between the premise and the conclusion.  
   - The statement doesn’t seem to argue a causative reason.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This involves repeating the initial proposition without providing supporting evidence.  
   - There isn’t a repetition of the proposition here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This is when an argument assumes consensus or agreement that hasn't been established.  
   - The statement presumes that because being slightly obese is considered "normal", it is acceptable. This could fit <FU>.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This pertains to using language that is unclear or has multiple interpretations.  
   - Terms like "slightly obese" and "perfectly normal" can be seen as ambiguous since they are subjective.

Applying <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Applications), we can conclude the following for the statement:

"I am only slightly obese. That is perfectly normal here in America."

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Assumes that a state of slight obesity is representative of the norm without covering a sufficient range of evidence.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: States "perfectly normal" as justification doesn't follow conclusively with the health implications of obesity.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Assumes consensus that being slightly obese is normal and acceptable.
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: Uses potentially unclear or subjective terms like "slightly obese" and "perfectly normal".

Each of these defective argument types could potentially apply to the statement, indicating various ways the reasoning could be flawed.
