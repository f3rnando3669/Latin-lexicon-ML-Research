For 
<IDAA> stands for Instructional Design of Argument Analysis.

To apply <IDAA> to the argument "If we teach Anton how to drive the car, he’ll want to learn how to fly helicopters next!" we would need to identify which, if any, of the defective argument types it falls under. Here’s a breakdown:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument does not seem to generalize from a few instances to a broad conclusion. It hypothesizes a sequence of events specific to Anton.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not list cases or reasons incompletely. It is a straightforward prediction about Anton’s potential interests.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The connection between driving a car and wanting to fly helicopters is largely speculative and lacks a direct causal link. This argument could be considered inconclusive because it assumes wanting to drive a car will naturally lead to wanting to fly a helicopter without providing a strong basis for why that would be the case.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: There is a causal claim (learning to drive a car will lead to wanting to fly helicopters). This claim lacks sufficient evidence or reasoning to show a direct cause-and-effect relationship. Therefore, it could be categorized under <WCB>.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The argument does not excessively repeat the same idea; it presents a single chain of reasoning.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument does not rely on assumed general agreement or consensus; it’s specific to Anton.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The language is not particularly ambiguous; it’s quite clear in stating the prediction about Anton’s future actions.

So, the argument: "If we teach Anton how to drive the car, he’ll want to learn how to fly helicopters next!" could be classified under **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** because it speculates on a future sequence without adequate reason and asserts a causal relationship without sufficient evidence.
