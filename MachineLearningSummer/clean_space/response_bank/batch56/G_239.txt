For 
It looks like you've defined several types of defective arguments, each labeled with a specific code for clarity. However, you haven't defined what <IDAA> stands for. Based on the context, I assume it might be a meta-code to indicate an evaluation or identification of the defective argument types.

Assuming <IDAA> means "Identify Defective Argument Applied Analysis," let's break down the given argument, "My first time walking the dog went terribly, so my dog is a terrible one," and identify which defective argument types apply:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The argument makes a sweeping generalization based on a single instance (the first time walking the dog). This is a faulty generalization because it doesn't consider other variables or additional experiences with the dog.

Thus, the argument "My first time walking the dog went terribly, so my dog is a terrible one" can be categorized under:

- **<G> Generalization:** The conclusion that the dog is terrible is based on a single, isolated incident, which is insufficient to make a well-founded generalization.

So, <IDAA>: <G>
