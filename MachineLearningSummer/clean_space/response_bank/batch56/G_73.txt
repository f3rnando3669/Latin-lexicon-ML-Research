For 
The argument "If you allow the students to redo this test, they are going to want to redo every assignment for the rest of the year." can be evaluated using the defective argument classification. For this argument, the primary defective argument type appears to be:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: This is a hasty generalization, where the conclusion that students will want to redo every assignment for the rest of the year is based on insufficient evidence. The argument assumes that allowing a redo in one situation will automatically lead to students wanting redos in all situations, which may not necessarily be the case.

Therefore, the argument "If you allow the students to redo this test, they are going to want to redo every assignment for the rest of the year." can be characterized as:

**<G>: Generalization**

There may be other defective argument types that also apply, but <G> seems to be the most fitting in this context.
