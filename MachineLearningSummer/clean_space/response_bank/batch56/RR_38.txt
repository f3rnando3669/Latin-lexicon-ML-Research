All right. Let's apply the identified defective argument types to the statement "Cell phones, high-tech devices that cause severe distractions and cyberbullying should be banned in schools."

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement implies that all cell phones cause severe distractions and cyberbullying without considering that not all instances of cell phones in schools lead to these issues. The argument generalizes the negative outcomes of some usages of cell phones to all usages.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument doesn't consider other factors that could also cause distractions and bullying besides cell phones. For instance, social dynamics, school policies, and other technological devices are not considered.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The provided reasons—distractions and cyberbullying—are not conclusively shown to be caused by cell phones exclusively. Additionally, the statement doesn’t provide sufficient evidence that banning cell phones will solve these problems effectively.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: There is no detailed analysis or evidence that banning cell phones will indeed eliminate or significantly reduce distractions and cyberbullying. Other underlying issues are not addressed, weakening the causal basis of the argument.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The argument repeats the negative impacts (distractions and cyberbullying) without additional justification or evidence, making it sound like an assertion rather than a well-supported argument.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The statement presumes that there is a general consensus or widespread agreement that cell phones should be banned in schools because of their link to distractions and cyberbullying. However, it does not provide evidence of such a consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: Terms like "severe distractions" and "cyberbullying" are somewhat ambiguous and not clearly defined. What constitutes a "severe distraction" or the specific types of "cyberbullying" are not clarified, leading to potential misunderstandings or misinterpretations of the argument.

By identifying these defective arguments, we gain a better understanding of the weaknesses in the claim that cell phones should be banned in schools because they cause distractions and cyberbullying.
