For 
To apply the Defective Argument Analysis Acronym (IDAA) to the argument "Every time that rooster crows, the sun comes up. That rooster must be very powerful and important!", we need to evaluate which of the defined defective argument types apply to this argument.

1. **Generalization (<G>):** This argument does not seem to be making a broad or generalized statement from specific instances.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This argument does not list multiple causes of an effect, and hence, incomplete enumeration doesn't fit.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The argument is inconclusive because it draws a conclusion (the rooster is powerful and important) based on a temporal correlation, not causation.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This is a clear case of <WCB>, as the argument assumes a causal relationship without providing sufficient evidence. Just because the rooster crows and the sun rises afterward does not prove that the rooster causes the sunrise.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The argument doesn't repeat propositions to establish a faulty conclusion; hence this type does not apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** There is no indication of claiming consensus in this argument.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** The language isn't ambiguous, but rather the logical connection made is fallacious.

From the above analysis, the defective argument type <IDAA> most relevant to the statement "Every time that rooster crows, the sun comes up. That rooster must be very powerful and important!" is **<WCB> - Insufficient Causal Basis.**
