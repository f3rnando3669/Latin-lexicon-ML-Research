Matt has committed an "Irrelevant Deflection of Attention Argument" (<IDAA>). This type of argument attempts to divert attention from the actual issue at hand—in this case, Matt's opponent's qualifications for class president—by focusing on unrelated personal attacks. Matt's comments about his opponent's smoking habit and personal relationship are irrelevant to her ability to perform the duties of class president, making his argument fallacious.
