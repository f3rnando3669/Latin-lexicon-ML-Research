Certainly! The argument “If we allow gay people to get married, then the next thing you know people will be wanting to marry their pets!” can indeed be evaluated for defective argument types (Defective Arguments Applied Analysis, or <IDAA>). Here’s an analysis based on the definitions provided:

- **<G> Generalization**: This argument generalizes the institution of marriage by equating it to something as far-fetched and unrelated as people marrying their pets. This is a broad and unfounded leap in logic, implicating a <G> Generalization fallacy.
  
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The argument extends the legalization of gay marriage to an extreme scenario without providing a conclusive reason for the connection. It assumes that one form of marriage equality would naturally lead to extreme cases, which are not only unlikely but also unsupported by evidence.
  
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: The claim lacks a sufficient causal basis, as there is no established causal link between allowing same-sex marriages and the social acceptance of marrying pets. The premise does not logically lead to the conclusion.

- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: Often, this argument is used under the assumption that there is a broad societal agreement that permitting same-sex marriage would lead to absurd consequences. However, this consensus is far from established and is presumptuous, implying a <FU> defective argument.

Given the argument, applying <IDAA>:

- **Generalization (<G>)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**

Thus, the argument exhibits multiple defective types, particularly Generalization, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, and Presumptuous Consensus.
