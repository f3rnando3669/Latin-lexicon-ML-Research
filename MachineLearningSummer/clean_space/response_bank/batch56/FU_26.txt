For 
The argument presented by Juror Seven in Act 1, where he says "There are still eleven of us who think he's guilty. You're alone," can be identified as a defective argument type called Presumptuous Consensus, defined as <FU>.

Juror Seven is appealing to the number of people who hold a particular belief to persuade Juror Eight, implying that the majority's opinion should be more convincing or correct simply because it is the majority. This fallacy asserts that the consensus validates the argument without addressing the underlying reasons or evidence relating to the case itself.

Therefore, we apply <FU> to the argument Juror Seven made:

**His attempt to use numbers to persuade Eight is <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).**
