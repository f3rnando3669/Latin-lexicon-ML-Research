The argument "Grizzly bears can't be dangerous! They're too cute." falls under the defective argument type called **Defective Appeal to Appearance** (IDAA).

In this argument, the claim that grizzly bears are not dangerous rests solely on their appearance ("too cute"), which is an irrelevant factor for determining their potential danger. Appearance does not provide any factual basis for assessing the threat level posed by grizzly bears.

Thus, the defectiveness arises from the appeal to an irrelevant aspect (appearance) to make a broader and misleading claim about the nature of grizzly bears.
