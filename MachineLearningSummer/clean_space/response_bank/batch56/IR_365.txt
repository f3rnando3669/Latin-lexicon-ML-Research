For 
<IDAA> stands for Irrelevant Deflection of Accusation Argument. This type of defective argument occurs when a response to an accusation or critique does not directly address the substance of the accusation but rather deflects it by introducing an unrelated point.

Let's apply <IDAA> to the provided statement:

"My opponent says I am weak on crime, but I have been one of the most reliable participants in city council meetings."

In this case, <IDAA> is applicable because the response does not address the accusation of being weak on crime. Instead, it deflects by mentioning the person's reliability in city council meetings, which is irrelevant to the issue of crime policy or effectiveness in addressing crime. This argument type distracts from the original issue rather than directly refuting or addressing the accusation.
