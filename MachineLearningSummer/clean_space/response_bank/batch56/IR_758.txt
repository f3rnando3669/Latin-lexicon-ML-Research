For 
The sentence "You can't prove that mermaids actually don't exist and therefore it's reasonable to say that they do" is an example of a defective argument known as an Appeal to Ignorance <IDAA>.

**Explanation:**

**Appeal to Ignorance (IDAA)**: This fallacy occurs when it is argued that a proposition is true simply because it has not been proven false, or vice versa.

In this case, the statement "You can't prove that mermaids actually don't exist and therefore it's reasonable to say that they do" posits the existence of mermaids based on a lack of evidence against their existence. This reasoning is flawed because the absence of proof against something does not constitute proof for it. Hence, it fits the definition of an Appeal to Ignorance <IDAA>.
