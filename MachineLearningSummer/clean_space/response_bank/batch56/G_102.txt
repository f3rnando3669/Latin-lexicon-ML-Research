For 
<IDAA> stands for Identify Defective Argument Applications. Given the provided statement, let's analyze each segment of the argument to spot any defective arguments:

1. "If I don't take the right classes in high school, then I won't be able to get into a good college."

2. "If I don't get into a good college, then I won't be able to get a job."

3. "If I can't get a job, then I am going to end up homeless."

Let's apply the defective argument types:

1. The assumption that not taking the right classes in high school will necessarily prevent one from entering a good college might be an **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**. Admissions criteria include a wide range of factors, not just the classes taken in high school.

2. The claim that not getting into a good college will prevent one from being able to get a job is an overly sweeping statement and can be categorized as **<G> Generalization**. Many people find successful careers without attending what might traditionally be considered good colleges. 

3. The idea that not getting a job will inevitably result in homelessness is also an **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**. There are numerous possible outcomes between not having a job and becoming homeless, such as relying on social support, having backup savings, or alternative means of income.

Overall:

- The argument shows **<IR> Inconclusive Reason** in multiple places for suggesting causal connections that are not definitively substantiated.
- The part about not getting into a good college leading to joblessness also displays **<G> Generalization**.
