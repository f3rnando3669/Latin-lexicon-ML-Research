For 
To apply the Identifying Defective Argument Analysis (IDAA) to the statement, "It is the center of the spectrum of two extremes of deficiency and excessiveness," we need to examine the argument for defects based on the defined argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This statement does not seem to be a generalization that applies a conclusion to all cases based on a limited number of instances.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: In this statement, there isn't a list of items or positions that are incompletely enumerated.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The statement does not present a causal or logical connection that could be considered inconclusive. It's more of a definition or descriptive phrase rather than an argument with premises and conclusions.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The statement doesn't propose a cause-effect relationship that is insufficiently supported.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The statement doesn't repetitively assert a proposition in a faulty manner.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The statement doesn't claim a consensus or majority opinion without adequate support.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The phrase "the center of the spectrum of two extremes of deficiency and excessiveness" could be considered ambiguous because it doesn’t clearly define what "the center" is referring to. It leaves room for interpretation about what is deficient, what is excessive, and what exactly constitutes the “center” of such a spectrum.

Based on this analysis, we can categorize this statement as potentially involving the defective argument type **Ambiguous Language (DEP)** due to its vagueness and lack of precise definition, which would make the argument unclear or open to multiple interpretations.
