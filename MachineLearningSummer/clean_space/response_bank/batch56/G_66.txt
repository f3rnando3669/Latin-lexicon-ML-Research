For 
The argument provided by Pastor Pete contains several defective argument types. Let's analyze it step-by-step and apply the defective argument types appropriately:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - Pastor Pete claims, "People are turning to God everywhere," which is a broad claim based on a limited sample size (people interviewed at his church). This is an overgeneralization since it assumes a trend based on a small, non-representative group.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - By stating that 9 out of 10 people he interviewed have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, Pastor Pete gives an impression that this is a comprehensive result. However, the enumeration is incomplete as it doesn't account for the entire population and is limited to his church attendees.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The evidence provided (9 out of 10 people in his church) is not conclusive proof that people are turning to God everywhere. The sample is biased and cannot be generalized to the whole population.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - Pastor Pete implies a causal relationship between his interviews and the global trend of people turning to God. However, interviewing a biased group in his church doesn't provide a sufficient causal basis for concluding such a widespread phenomenon.

Let's put these into the context of the given conversation:

**Pastor Pete: People are turning to God everywhere! 9 out of 10 people I interviewed said that they had a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.**
- **G**: Broad claim based on a limited sample size.
- **FE**: Incomplete enumeration provided (only people in his church).
- **IR**: The reason given does not conclusively support the claim.
- **WCB**: Insufficient causal basis due to the biased sample.

**Fred: Where did you find these people you interviewed?**
**Pastor Pete: In my church.**
- **FE**: The enumeration remains limited to his church-going group, further strengthening the defective argument types identified above.

In summary, Pastor Pete's argument can be critiqued using the identified defective argument types: **Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), and Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
