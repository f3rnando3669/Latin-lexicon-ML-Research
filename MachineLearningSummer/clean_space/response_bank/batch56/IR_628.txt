<IDAA> stands for Identify Defective Argument Applying Annotation. Given the question "What type of persuasive writing is used to influence readers’ feelings (pathos)?", we would be on the lookout for any of the defective argument types defined in your instructions. 

Let's break down the question and see if we can identify any defective arguments:

1. **Generalization (G):** This type involves making broad claims based on limited evidence.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This type happens when not all the necessary elements are listed or considered.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This type involves reasoning that doesn't conclusively support the conclusion.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This occurs when a causal connection is asserted without enough evidence.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This involves repeating a proposition that's flawed or unproven.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This occurs when one assumes collective agreement without proper evidence.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** This involves using language that's intentionally or unintentionally unclear, making the argument defective.

In the specific question given:
"What type of persuasive writing is used to influence readers’ feelings (pathos)?"

This is simply a question seeking information and doesn’t provide any argument or proposition of its own. Therefore, there's no defective argument to annotate here. The provided information is straightforward and fact-seeking, so none of the defective argument types apply.

In brief: <IDAA> is not applicable to "What type of persuasive writing is used to influence readers’ feelings (pathos)?" because it is a straightforward, factual question without any inherent argumentative content.
