The description you've provided for "IDAA" seems to be missing, but I'll assume you're asking for identifying and analyzing the type of defective argument present in the statement: "someone who is poor is more credible than someone who is rich?"

To apply the defined defective argument types to this statement, let's conduct an analysis.

1. **Generalization (G)** – This argument could be seen as a generalization since it broadly claims that people who are poor are more credible than those who are rich without providing evidence or considering individual differences. It makes a sweeping statement without acknowledging exceptions or specific contexts.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** – The argument might fall under Incomplete Enumeration if it's implying that all cases of credibility between poor and rich people have been considered, which likely isn't the case. It does not enumerate all the possible characteristics that might contribute to a person's credibility.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** – This type of argument might also apply if the statement is based on inconclusive reasoning. It assumes a simple cause-effect relationship without substantial evidence to support the claim that poverty or wealth directly influences credibility.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** – The argument may suggest a causal relationship between poverty and credibility without sufficient basis. It fails to provide or establish a credible mechanism by which being poor inherently makes someone more credible.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** – This does not seem particularly applicable unless the argument is being repeatedly asserted without additional evidence or logic which is not indicated in the provided statement.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** – If the argument assumes that everyone agrees that poor people are more credible than rich people without presenting this as a widely held or verified belief, it could be seen as a presumptuous consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)** – The statement uses terms like "credible," "poor," and "rich" which can be subject to various interpretations. The ambiguity in defining these terms can lead to confusion or misinterpretation.

In summary, the most fitting defective argument types for the statement "someone who is poor is more credible than someone who is rich" appear to be:

- **Generalization (G)** – for making a broad, unsupportive claim.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** – for not considering all factors in regard to credibility.
- **Illogical Reasoning (IR)** – for assuming a flawed cause-effect relationship.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** – for lacking a plausible causal mechanism.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)** – due to potential vagueness or multiple interpretations of key terms.

Each of these contributes to the overall logical deficiency of the argument presented.
