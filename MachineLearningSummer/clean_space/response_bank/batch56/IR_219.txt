For 
The argument provided is: "Word processed papers are clearer and more error-free than typed papers because they make use of new technology."

Let's apply the <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Types) to the given argument:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - Is the argument making a broad generalization without sufficient evidence? In this case, it is generalizing that all word processed papers are clearer and more error-free. However, the clarity and error-free nature depend on various factors, such as the person using the technology.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Is the argument presenting an incomplete list or failing to consider all possible options? The argument does not consider other factors that contribute to clarity and error-free documents such as the skills of the user, the quality of the typing, and proofreading.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Is the reason provided not sufficiently proving the conclusion? Simply stating that new technology leads to clearer and more error-free papers is not conclusive. There needs to be more evidence or explanation of how the technology improves clarity and reduces errors.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Is the causation claimed without sufficient basis? The argument claims that new technology (word processing) makes papers clearer and more error-free without explaining the causal mechanism or providing evidence.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - Is the argument repeating the proposition without adding new information? This argument does not seem to fall under this category.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - Is the argument assuming there is a consensus when there might not be one? The argument does not imply a consensus, so this does not apply here.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - Is the argument using ambiguous language or terms? The terms "clearer" and "more error-free" can be subjective and may mean different things to different people.

Based on these analyses, the defective argument types that apply are:

1. **Generalization (G):** It's broadly generalizing that all word processed papers are clearer and more error-free.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Fails to consider all factors affecting clarity and errors in papers.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason provided is not conclusive enough to support the claim.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** There is a weak causal link provided between new technology and improved clarity and error reduction.
5. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** Uses subjective terms that can be interpreted in various ways.
