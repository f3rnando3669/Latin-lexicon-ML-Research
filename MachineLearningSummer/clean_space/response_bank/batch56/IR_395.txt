<IDAA>: Identify Defective Arguments in Assertion

To analyze the assertion "Saying that the burden of proof lies not with the person making the claim, but with someone else to disprove," we can identify it as a defective argument type called Presumptuous Consensus, denoted by <FU>.

Here's the identification breakdown:

1. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This type of defective argument occurs when it is assumed that a claim is true simply because the burden of proof is shifted to disprove it, rather than proving it in the first place.

Applying <IDAA>:
- The statement moves the burden of proof from the claimant (who should substantiate their claim with evidence) to someone else, implicitly assuming agreement or consensus on the truth of the claim without proper justification.
- This implies a false expectation that the claim holds true unless disproven, which is not a logically sound basis for validation.

Thus, the assertion "Saying that the burden of proof lies not with the person making the claim, but with someone else to disprove" is an example of a defective argument type <FU>, or Presumptuous Consensus.
