To apply the Identifying Defective Argument Analysis (IDAA) to the argument "Because students do not do homework virtually when quarantined, we should get rid of all computers," we need to pinpoint which defective argument types are present in this statement.

1. **Generalization (G):** The statement makes a broad conclusion (get rid of all computers) based on a limited observation (students do not do homework virtually when quarantined). This is an overgeneralization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument does not consider other possible solutions to the problem (e.g., improving online education methods, providing better resources and support for students, addressing specific challenges faced by students). It jumps to an extreme solution without considering the full range of alternatives.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The fact that students do not do homework virtually when quarantined does not directly lead to the conclusion that all computers should be disposed of. The reasoning is not adequately supported, as the premise does not sufficiently justify the conclusion.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The argument assumes a causal relationship between students not doing homework and the presence of computers without properly establishing that correlation. It ignores other potential factors that could contribute to the issue, such as lack of motivation, teaching methods, or environmental distractions. 

Considering the above analyses, the given argument can be classified as:
- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

Thus, the argument "Because students do not do homework virtually when quarantined, we should get rid of all computers" is fundamentally flawed due to these identified defective reasoning types.
