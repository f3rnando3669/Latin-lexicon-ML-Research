For 
The argument "There's no way you know this - you're clearly too young to understand!" can be analyzed and identified as an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. This type of argument indicates that the reason provided (the person's age) is not sufficient or conclusive to support the conclusion (that the person does not understand something). Age alone does not determine one's knowledge or understanding of a subject.

There isn't a clearly defined <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Type) in the list provided, but following that logic, we recognize <IR> applicable here.
