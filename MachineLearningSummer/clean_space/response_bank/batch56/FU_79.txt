For 
Let's break down the provided statement and identify any defective argument types (IDAA) associated with it:

### Statement: "Everyone is/is not doing it! It must/must not be a good thing!"

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
   - The statement assumes the behavior of everyone based on observation or hearsay. It does not account for instances where people may be doing it for reasons independent of its inherent goodness or badness, thus failing to consider all possibilities.
   
2. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
   - The conclusion that something is good or bad purely based on whether everyone is doing it (or not) is an inconclusive reason. Popularity or lack thereof doesn't necessarily correlate with the inherent value of an action or thing.

3. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
   - This statement suggests that the agreement, or lack thereof, among people is sufficient to determine the goodness or badness of something, which presumes consensus to be a valid authority without further inspection of the action or thing itself.

4. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**
   - The terms "good" and "everyone" can be seen as ambiguous. "Good" can have different meanings in different contexts (moral, practical, etc.), and "everyone" is rarely literal and can imply different groups or scopes of people without clarification.

So the identified defective argument types (IDAA) in the statement are:
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**

These defective argument types together weaken the rational basis of the statement. Understanding these flaws can help in critically evaluating similar arguments encountered in discourse.
