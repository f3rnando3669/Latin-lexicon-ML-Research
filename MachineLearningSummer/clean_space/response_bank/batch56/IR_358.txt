Sure, let's analyze the statement given with the argument types defined.

The statement to be analyzed is: "We don't know for sure that phones lower students' success levels, so there's no need to ban them."

This statement can be considered a form of <IR> - Inconclusive Reason. The argument given is that because there is no conclusive evidence proving that phones lower student success levels, therefore, they should not be banned. Here, the speaker is using the lack of definitive evidence as a justification for not taking action (banning phones), even though the absence of evidence is not necessarily evidence of absence.

So, applying the Inconclusive Reason (<IR>) defective argument type:

"We don't know for sure that phones lower students' success levels, so there's no need to ban them." - This is a form of <IR> because it relies on inconclusive reasoning, suggesting that without definitive evidence, action is unnecessary.
