The argument presented is an example of a reasoning flaw that aligns with several defective argument types, but we can focus on identifying the most prominent one(s).

### Analysis of the Argument:

"If there is no freewill, then we are not ultimately in control of our actions. If this is true, our entire system of justice would be seriously flawed. This would be very bad; therefore, freewill must exist."

### Identification of Defective Argument Types Applied:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument suggests that if the absence of freewill leads to bad consequences (such as a flawed justice system), then freewill must exist. This is an example of a *faulty consequential reasoning* where the negative or detrimental implications of a proposition are used to assert the truth of the proposition without proving its truth independently.

2. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The term "freewill" can be philosophically and scientifically complex and the argument does not clearly define what is meant by it, nor does it address different interpretations or nuances that could entirely change the argumentâ€™s meaning and validity.

Therefore, applying IDAA:

**Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
The argument jumps to the conclusion that freewill must exist because the alternative has negative consequences. This is not a logically valid reason for freewill's existence; it merely highlights undesirable outcomes of not having freewill.

**Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
The definition and understanding of "freewill" are not explicitly clarified in the argument. The argument makes broad assertions based on a possibly flawed or partial understanding of the term "freewill."

Applying IDAA to the argument reveals:
- **<IR>**: The argument concludes that freewill must exist based on the negative consequences of its nonexistence, which is an inconclusive reason.
- **<DEP>**: The argument involves ambiguous language, particularly with the term "freewill," which is not clearly defined and leaves the argument open to varying interpretations that might void its logic.
