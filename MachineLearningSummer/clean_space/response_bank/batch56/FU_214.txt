For 
Certainly! The acronym <IDAA> appears to request the identification and analysis of defective argument types applied to a given statement.

Let's analyze the statement: "If you are a true American, you will ask your congressman to vote against NAFTA."

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - This argument implies a broad generalization. It suggests that a "true American" is defined by their opposition to NAFTA, which is not necessarily true for all Americans.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - The argument doesn't consider other ways one might express their patriotism or views on trade agreements. It's possible to be a "true American" and support NAFTA or have a neutral stance.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The reasoning provided (being a "true American") is not conclusive proof for the action suggested. There could be numerous reasons why an individual might support or oppose NAFTA that have nothing to do with their patriotism.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - The argument assumes a direct causal link between being a "true American" and opposing NAFTA without sufficient evidence to support such a causation.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - This argument doesn't seem to rely on repetition, so this defect does not apply to the given statement.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - The statement presumes that all true Americans share the same opinion on NAFTA, which overlooks the diversity of thought and opinion among Americans.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - The phrase "true American" is quite ambiguous and can be interpreted in many ways, making the argument less clear and more open to personal interpretation which weakens its persuasive power.

In conclusion, the defects found in this argument include Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), and Ambiguous Language (<DEP>).
