The argument "You can start a family early, or build financial stability for a better family life in the future" falls under the defective argument type <IDAA> which stands for Inadequate Dichotomy or Artificial Alternatives. 

This argument presents a false dilemma by implying that there are only two options available: either start a family early or build financial stability for a better family life later. It ignores other possible alternatives such as balancing both aspects simultaneously, delaying family start for reasons other than financial stability, or different personal priorities and life approaches altogether.
