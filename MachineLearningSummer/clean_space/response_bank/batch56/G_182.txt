<IDAA>: Inaccurate Discrimination By Association Argument

The given argument indeed seems to fit the description of an Inaccurate Discrimination By Association Argument. The speaker is incorrectly associating Emmy's viewing habits with her sister's viewing habits. The argument dismisses Emmy's personal claim about her own habits based on a supposed fact about her sister's preferences. This type of argument is defective because it assumes that what is true for one person in a group must also be true for another person in that group, without sufficient evidence to make such a broad generalization. Thus, hereâ€™s the application:

"Don't try to tell me that you only watch educational programming, Emmy! I know for a fact that your sister only watches reality television." <IDAA>
