Given your definitions of defective argument types, we will identify and apply the appropriate defective argument types to the statement: "Fred the Australian stole my wallet. All Australians are thieves!"

1. **Generalization (<G>)**
   - This statement makes a sweeping generalization about an entire group based on the actions of a single individual. It assumes that because one Australian (Fred) stole the wallet, all Australians are thieves.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
   - It fails to consider the full range of evidence or examples. It only presents one instance (Fred stealing the wallet) and concludes a general rule about all Australians without further evidence.

Combining these two, we can note that both <G> and <FE> are applicable defective arguments in this case. The statement "Fred the Australian stole my wallet. All Australians are thieves!" demonstrates both Generalization and Incomplete Enumeration.
