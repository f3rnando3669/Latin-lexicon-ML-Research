For 
Applying the provided defective argument types to "Students who want cell phones in school have no idea what they're talking about." can be done as follows: 

<G> Generalization: The statement generalizes all students who want cell phones in school by implying that none of them know what they're talking about. This may not be true for all students.

<FE> Incomplete Enumeration: The argument does not consider all possible reasons why students might want cell phones in school. It assumes that there is no valid reason without examining any.

<IR> Inconclusive Reason: The statement does not provide any substantial reason or evidence for why students don’t know what they’re talking about. It's a conclusory statement without due support.

<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis: There is no causal link provided between students wanting cell phones and the assertion that they don’t know what they’re talking about. The argument fails to connect the cause (wanting cell phones) and effect (lack of knowledge).

<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition: The argument is not repeating the proposition in a faulty manner, hence this is not applicable here.

<FU> Presumptuous Consensus: The speaker presumes a consensus that students wanting cell phones in school is universally agreed to be a sign of ignorance without any evidence of such a consensus.

<DEP> Ambiguous Language: The phrase "have no idea what they're talking about" is ambiguous and subjective, as it does not specify what aspect the students lack understanding in, or in what manner their understanding is deficient.

Therefore, the argument could be an example of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.
