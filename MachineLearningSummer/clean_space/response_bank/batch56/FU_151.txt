For 
< IDAA > stands for "Identify Defective Argument Analysis." In this case, we need to apply IDAA to the argument: "AttP 3: Shirley MacLaine selling copies to many people makes her topic of choice true."

We will identify which defective argument type applies here:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This would involve making a broad conclusion based on insufficient evidence but doesn't seem to apply here.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Listing some but not all possibilities to support an argument; not quite relevant to this scenario.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: An argument that does not provide sufficient evidence to conclusively support the conclusion; this one might be fitting.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Suggesting a cause-and-effect relationship without proper evidence - this is a close candidate.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Repeating a claim without additional evidence—doesn’t apply here.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assuming that if many people believe it, it must be true - this seems directly related.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Using vague or equivocal terms; not directly applicable here.

Analyzing the argument "Shirley MacLaine selling copies to many people makes her topic of choice true":

- The argument implies that the popularity of Shirley MacLaine's sales indicates the truth of what she is selling.
- This aligns with the defective argument type where the truth of a proposition is presumed based on its widespread acceptance.

Therefore, the defective argument type that best applies here is:

**< FU > Presumptuous Consensus**: The argument erroneously assumes that because many people buy Shirley MacLaine's materials, her topic of choice must be true. Popularity or high sales do not inherently validate the truthfulness of the content.
