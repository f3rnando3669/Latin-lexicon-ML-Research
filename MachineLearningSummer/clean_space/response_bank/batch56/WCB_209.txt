The argument presented in "I sneezed exactly at the same time the power went off. My sneeze mustâ€™ve done something to make the power go off." is an example of a defective argument type called **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. 

**Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** refers to attributing a cause-and-effect relationship between two events without sufficient evidence to support such a connection. In this case, the coincidence of sneezing and the power going off at the same time is not adequate evidence to claim that the sneeze caused the power outage.
