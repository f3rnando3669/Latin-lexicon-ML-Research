For 
To apply IDAA (Identify Defective Argument Attributes) to the statement "Trump presents a dark image of America if Clinton is elected, with ‘Syrian refugees flooding in, illegal immigrants convicted of crimes staying,’" we will identify any defective argument types from the list you provided:

1. **Generalization (G)**
   - This applies if the statement makes broad generalizations without sufficient evidence or specifics. In this case, saying "Syrian refugees flooding in" and "illegal immigrants convicted of crimes staying" can be seen as large generalizations without concrete evidence supporting such outcomes.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
   - This would be relevant if the statement presents a partial list, implying it’s exhaustive. The statement lists selective issues without acknowledging other potential outcomes or factors of Clinton's policies, which seems to be an attempt to create a certain narrative while leaving out other possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
   - This applies if the reasoning provided to support a conclusion is not strong enough. The statement connects Clinton's election with a "dark image of America" without providing thorough or conclusive evidence that these specific outcomes will materialize.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
   - This matches if the argument assumes a causal relationship without sufficient basis. The statement assumes that Syrian refugees and illegal immigrants staying in America are direct results of Clinton being elected without offering concrete evidence or a causal link.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
   - This defective argument type doesn't seem to apply here, as the statement does not repeat the claim in a faulty manner for emphasis.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
   - This would be the case if the argument falsely presumes a consensus. The statement does not explicitly reference a so-called consensus supporting Trump’s claims, so this doesn’t apply here.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**
   - This applies when language or terms are vague or ambiguous. The term "dark image of America" can be seen as ambiguous as it is a general and subjective statement open to interpretation without specific clarification.

In summary, the following defective argument types apply to the given statement:
- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**

The analysis shows that the argument provided by Trump in this statement is riddled with various defective argument attributes, making it a critical example of how fear-based and unsubstantiated claims can be lacking in logical rigor.
