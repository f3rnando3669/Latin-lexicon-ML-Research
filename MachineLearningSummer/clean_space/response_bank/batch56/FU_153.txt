For 
<|vq_11677|>Certainly! In order to apply the defective argument types (DAAs) to the statement "Everyone else is doing it, so should you," we analyze the argument's structure and type. The statement appeals to the idea that an action is justified or correct because it is widely practiced. 

Here's a breakdown of how this statement fits into one of the known defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - While this argument does involve a form of generalization about the behavior of "everyone else," it doesn’t quite fit the technical sense of generalizing from a small sample to a larger group. So, this isn't the best fit.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The statement doesn't list different groups or instances leading to a conclusion by exclusion, so it doesn't fit the definition of Incomplete Enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The statement doesn't necessarily present a premise that doesn’t conclusively support the conclusion; rather, it presents a premise centered on consensus rather than support.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - There is no causal claim being made here about the universality of behavior leading to a certain result, so this doesn’t apply in this context.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - This isn’t a repetition of a proposition to make it appealing. It is an attempt to persuade based on popularity.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - This fits perfectly. The argument assumes that since “everyone” is doing something, it must be right or desirable. It presumes a consensus without considering whether this supposed consensus is well-founded or correct. 

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - The language isn't particularly ambiguous. It is quite clear in asserting the appeal to popularity.

Hence, the appropriate defective argument type here is <FU>, **Presumptuous Consensus**. 

So, we can label the argument as follows:

```
“Everyone else is doing it, so should you.” <FU>
```
