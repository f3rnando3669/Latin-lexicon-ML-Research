<IDAA>: Identify Defective Argument and Analyze Argument

Let's analyze the statement "Researchers are frauds who don’t earn their salaries" using the defective argument types defined.

1. **Generalization (G)**: The statement makes a sweeping generalization about all researchers, implying that every researcher is a fraud and does not earn their salary without any specific evidence or consideration of individual cases.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This type of defective argument involves listing only a few instances and claiming it represents the whole without adequate evidence. If the statement is based on specific incidents without considering the entire population of researchers, it would be an <FE>.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The statement implies an accusation ("Researchers are frauds") without providing sufficient reasoning or conclusive evidence to support such a strong claim. It leaves out the detailed rationale that would be necessary to substantiate such an accusation.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Assuming there is an implied causation—that because some researchers might have committed fraud, all of them don't earn their salaries—then there is an insufficient causal basis to conclude that all researchers are frauds based on potentially isolated cases.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This defect involves repeating a proposition without proving its truth. If the statement "Researchers are frauds who don’t earn their salaries" is reiterated over and over without evidence, it would be considered an <RR>.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: If the statement asserts that "everyone knows" or "everyone agrees" that researchers are frauds, without actual consensus or proof, it would fall under <FU>.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The term "fraud" may also be ambiguous in this context, without clear definition or explanation of how all researchers allegedly commit fraud, making the statement potentially ambiguous in nature.

Based on the analysis, this statement primarily exhibits a **Generalization (G)** because it makes a broad, unchecked claim about the entire group. It also could be considered under **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, and could potentially involve elements of **Ambiguous Language (DEP)** depending on the context and exact presentation of the argument.
