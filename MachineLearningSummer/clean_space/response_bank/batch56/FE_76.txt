For 
<IDAA> seems to be a distinctive identifier you are using for analyzing or labeling a specific argument based on the definitions provided. Generally, <IDAA> might stand for something indicative of the context, such as "Identify Defective Argumentation Approach." Regardless of its specific meaning, the argument you provided can be analyzed in terms of the defective argument types defined earlier.

"The speaker insinuates that there are only two options despite this not being true."

This statement suggests that the speaker is presenting a false dichotomy or a binary choice fallacy. However, none of the specific defective argument types defined (Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Presumptuous Consensus, Ambiguous Language) directly correspond to this specific fallacy. 

In classical terms, this is known as a "false dilemma" or "false dichotomy."

If we try to fit it into one of the defined types, we could consider:

- <FE> Incomplete Enumeration: The notion that the speaker is insinuating there are only two options might fit under this category. By only presenting two options, the speaker is ignoring other possible alternatives, thus not providing a complete enumeration of the possible choices.

Therefore, based on your definitions, the analysis of the argument would be:

<IDAA> <FE>: The speaker insinuates that there are only two options despite this not being true.
