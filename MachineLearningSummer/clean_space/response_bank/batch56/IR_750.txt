For 
The term <IDAA> was not defined in the initial list of defective argument types you provided. Therefore, it is unclear how to apply <IDAA> to the given statement: "We believe on what we believe in."

However, let's analyze the statement using the defective argument types that were defined:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This statement does not seem to be a generalization as it doesn't make a broad statement based on limited information.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This does not list alternatives or options incompletely; hence it's not an incomplete enumeration.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The statement asserts belief without providing reasons or evidence. It may be somewhat related to an inconclusive reason, as it doesn't give a substantive reason for the belief.
   
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is no causal relationship being discussed, so this does not fit.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This could be classified under faulty repetition of the proposition, as it essentially repeats the idea of believing without providing new information.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The statement does not assume a consensus, so it doesnâ€™t fit this category.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language used is not particularly ambiguous; rather, it is straightforward yet tautological.

Based on this analysis, the statement "We believe on what we believe in" would most likely fall under the category of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**, as it repeats the same idea without offering additional insight or evidence.
