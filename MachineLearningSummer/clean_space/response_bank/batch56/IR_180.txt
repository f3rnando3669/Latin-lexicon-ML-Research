For 
<IDAA> refers to identifying and applying defective argument types to a given statement. Let's break down and identify any defective arguments in the given statement, "Who are you to ask fast food restaurants to give us nutritional facts? I saw you eat Taco Bell last night!"

1. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This type might suggest that since both the speaker and the addressee eat fast food, they implicitly agree that it's inappropriate to demand nutritional facts. This is not a strong case here but may be seen if the statement implies the addressee's consumption invalidates their position universally.

2. **Personal Attack / Ad Hominem** (though not listed as one of the seven types, it's an important fallacy to note here): The argument attacks the person asking for nutritional facts based on their personal eating habits rather than addressing the merit of the request for nutritional information itself. This is a clear case of an ad hominem fallacy, which diverts from the argument's substance by attacking the individual.

Given the list of defective argument types provided, **none of the seven definitions perfectly match an ad hominem attack**. However, as part of sound reasoning, recognizing flawed arguments even if not categorized under <IDAA> is crucial. Here's how the other types do not specifically apply:

- **Generalization (G)**: There's no broad generalization being applied.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not fail due to a lack of listing comprehensive options.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided (eating Taco Bell) is irrelevant but not necessarily inconclusive to the point being argued, it just attacks character.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There's no causal claim being made that can be insufficient.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Thereâ€™s no repetition involved.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language of the argument is quite clear and straightforward in its personal attack.

In conclusion, we identify the argument's primary flaw as a **personal attack (ad hominem)**, though it does not fall under the provided definitions in <IDAA>.
