Sure, let's analyze the argument "Vote for me or live through four more years of higher taxes." using the concept of defective argument types. 

The argument presents a false dichotomy, suggesting that there are only two possible outcomes: either voting for the speaker or experiencing higher taxes. This oversimplifies the situation and neglects other possible scenarios, such as voting for another candidate who might also propose lower taxes or other policy changes that could affect the tax situation.

This type of reasoning doesn't fit exactly with the definitions provided. Instead, this argument is best identified as a logical fallacy known as a false dilemma (or false dichotomy), which isn't specifically listed in the defective argument types you've defined. However, it has implications of several:

- It could be a Generalization (G) because it oversimplifies the variety of outcomes.
- It might also suggest an Incomplete Enumeration (FE) by presenting limited options.

So, the argument can be identifed as closer to a combination of <G> and <FE> in the provided defective argument types.
