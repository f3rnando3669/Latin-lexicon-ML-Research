For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application. To apply <IDAA> to the statement "We will not rest until we reach a day when not one single veteran falls into homelessness," we need to determine if the statement fits any of the defined defective argument types.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement does not appear to generalize from a small sample to a broad conclusion.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This type involves presenting an argument that pretends to offer all possible reasons but misses out on some. This doesn't quite fit the given statement, as no list or enumeration is involved.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This applies if the argument does not lead conclusively to its conclusion. The given statement sets an idealistic goal, but without evidence or reasoning on how it will be achieved, which seems to fit.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The statement does not provide a cause-and-effect argument, so this type does not apply.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This involves repeating a proposition without adding new information or justification. The given statement doesn't repeat a proposition, so this type does not apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This involves assuming consensus without evidence. The statement does not suggest a consensus, so this type does not apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The statement could be seen as ambiguous because "not one single veteran" could be interpreted differently. However, the primary issue seems to be more about the lack of concrete reasoning rather than ambiguity.

Given the analysis, the most fitting defective argument type for the statement "We will not rest until we reach a day when not one single veteran falls into homelessness" is **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. The statement presents a goal without providing concrete steps or evidence on how it will be achieved, making the reasoning inconclusive.
