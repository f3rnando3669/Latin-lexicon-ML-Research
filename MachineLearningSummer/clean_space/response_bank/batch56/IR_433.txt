For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Types and Applying Annotations.

Given the statement: "It's common sense that if you smack your children, they will stop the bad behavior. So don't tell me not to hit my kids."

Let's identify the defective argument types in it:

1. "It's common sense that if you smack your children, they will stop the bad behavior."

   - This part of the statement assumes without evidence or proper reasoning that physical punishment is an effective way to stop bad behavior. This can be classified as <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) because it offers a reason that is not supported by conclusive evidence. Additionally, the phrase "common sense" is often used to claim consensus without actual evidence, which can also be identified as <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).

2. "So don't tell me not to hit my kids."

   - This part of the statement implies that because the speaker believes the initial claim is true, others should not advise against it. This is an example of <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), where the conclusion does not logically follow just because the proposition was stated initially.

So, the annotated defective argument would be: 

"It's common sense that if you smack your children, they will stop the bad behavior. <IR><FU> So don't tell me not to hit my kids. <RR>"

By identifying these defective argument types, we can see that the statement is not well-supported and relies on faulty reasoning and assumptions.
