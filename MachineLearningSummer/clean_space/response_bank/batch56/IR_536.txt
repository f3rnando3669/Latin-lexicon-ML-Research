For 
<IDAA> stands for **Identified Defective Argument Analysis**.

First, let's analyze the argument: "Why would you lend money to someone who looks like they don't have a job?"

This argument appears to be suggesting that a person's appearance is a reliable indicator of their employment status and, by extension, their ability or willingness to repay money. Let's break down the potential defects in this argument:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument assumes that anyone who "looks like they don't have a job" will definitely not be able to repay the money. This is an overgeneralization because it ignores the fact that appearances can be deceiving and not all individuals who might "look" a certain way have the same financial habits or statuses.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument fails to consider other relevant factors that might influence someone's ability to repay money, such as personal savings, other sources of income, or support systems. It erroneously simplifies the issue to one aspect â€” appearance.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasoning provided does not conclusively lead to the conclusion. Just because someone "looks like they don't have a job" doesn't necessarily mean they will not repay the money. The premise does not provide sufficient basis for the conclusion.

4. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The phrase "looks like they don't have a job" is highly subjective and ambiguous. Different people might have different interpretations of what this looks like, leading to inconsistencies in the application of the argument.

### Applying <IDAA>:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument makes a sweeping generalization about people based on their appearance.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument overlooks many other factors that could influence the decision to lend money.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasoning does not sufficiently support the conclusion that lending money to someone based on their looks is unwise.
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The term "look like they don't have a job" is vague and subjective.

Therefore, the argument "Why would you lend money to some who looks like they don't have a job?" can be categorized under multiple defective argument types, namely Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), and Ambiguous Language (<DEP>).
