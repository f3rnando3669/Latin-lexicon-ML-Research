The acronym <IDAA> is not defined in the provided context, so I'll proceed with the understanding that we are supposed to identify a defective argument and then provide a better rebuttal.

In the provided instance, the rebuttal given by the Harvard debater is:

"Thoreau could never know that Adolph Hitler would agree with him."

This argument might be classified under the defective argument type <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis). The Harvard debater uses an association with a historically negative figure (Hitler) to undermine Thoreau's advocacy for civil disobedience, but there is no causal link or reasonable basis connecting Thoreau's philosophy with Hitler's atrocities. The mere agreement of Hitler with a particular aspect of Thoreau's beliefs does not invalidate Thoreau's concept of civil disobedience.

A better rebuttal might be framed around the specific principles and contexts of Thoreau’s advocacy. For example:

"While Thoreau advocated for civil disobedience to protest unjust laws, it's important to consider the context in which he lived and the specific types of injustices he was addressing. Thoreau's arguments were formulated in a specific historical and cultural context, aimed at addressing governmental overreach and moral objections to slavery and the Mexican-American War. However, modern applications of civil disobedience must consider the potential for unintended consequences and the overall effectiveness of such actions in achieving justice without resulting in chaos or harm."

This improved rebuttal directly engages with Samantha Booke’s argument by examining the context and implications of Thoreau’s ideas rather than relying on a questionable association with another historical figure.
