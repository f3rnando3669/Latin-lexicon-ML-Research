The argument presented can be analyzed for its defective argument types as follows:

**Dicky: So how do you think life began?  
Ralphie: Simple. Aliens from another planet seeded this planet with life billions of years ago.  
Dicky: OK, but how did that alien life form begin?  
Ralphie: Simple. Aliens from another planet seeded that planet with life.**

### Identification of Defective Argument Types:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - This is present in Ralphie's response because he does not provide a conclusive or satisfactory answer regarding the origin of life. Instead, Ralphie only shifts the question to another planet, which does not solve the issue but rather defers it continuously without addressing the fundamental problem. The argument lacks a conclusion that logically follows from the initial question of how life began.

2. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - Ralphie’s response falls into this category as well because he essentially repeats the same proposition without providing new information or evidence. Instead of explaining the origin of life for the alien that seeded the planets, Ralphie repeats the same proposition about aliens seeding life, creating a circular argument.

In summary, the argument contains the following defective argument types:

- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**

This analysis shows that Ralphie’s explanations do not genuinely address the origins of life and merely loop back to the same point, rendering the argument as inconclusive and circular.
