Certainly! Hereâ€™s a breakdown of which defective argument types may apply to the statement "I know that what I experience is real because I can see, hear, smell, touch and taste everything."

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument assumes that the five senses (seeing, hearing, smelling, touching, tasting) are sufficient to determine reality. It neglects other potential factors or ways of knowing that could also contribute to understanding reality.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument uses sensory experiences as evidence for what is real, but it does not conclusively prove the existence of reality. Sensory experiences can be subjective and deceptive (e.g., illusions, dreams, and hallucinations).

3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument implies a causal relationship between sensory experience and reality without sufficient evidence. Sensory data alone do not necessarily establish the truth of external reality; they might just be responses to stimuli.

4. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The term "real" in the statement can have multiple interpretations (objective reality, subjective experience, philosophical concept, etc.). The argument does not clarify what type of reality it refers to, which makes the conclusion ambiguous.

In conclusion, the statement displays **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, and **Ambiguous Language (DEP)** defects.
