To apply the defective argument classification system to the statement "The writer or speaker intentionally misleads the audience by using a word with a double or ambiguous meaning," we'll determine which defined defective argument type best categorizes this scenario.

In this case, the argument hinges on the use of an ambiguous term that can confuse or mislead the audienceâ€”this falls under the defect of "Ambiguous Language." Therefore, we classify it as:

**<DEP> Ambiguous Language**

So, the defective argument type applied is:

**<DEP> The writer or speaker intentionally misleads the audience by using a word with a double or ambiguous meaning.**
