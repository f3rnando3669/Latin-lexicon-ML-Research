The fallacy committed in "Dave wants you to break into the spooky cabin with him. 'Everyone does it,' he claims" can be identified and classified using the defined defective argument types. 

Dave's argument relies on the idea that since everyone breaks into the spooky cabin, it must be acceptable for you to do the same. This is an example of an **appeal to common practice** or **bandwagon fallacy**, where the fact that many people engage in an activity is used as a justification for the activity.

According to the defective argument types provided:

- **Generalization (G)**: Involves making a broad conclusion based on a limited set of evidence.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Relies on presenting a limited or non-representative sampling of possible cases.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning doesn't firmly support the conclusion.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Lacks a sufficient causal link between the evidence and the conclusion.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Involves stating the same point repeatedly as if it provides stronger proof.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assumes a consensus that may not actually exist or be based on sound reasoning.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Utilizes vague or ambiguous terms to obscure the argument's weaknesses.

The most fitting defective argument type for this situation is **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**, as Dave's reasoning relies on the assumption that a consensus or common behavior (everyone does it) justifies the act of breaking into the cabin.
