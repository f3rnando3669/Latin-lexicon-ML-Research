Based on the definitions provided, the argument "All the popular guys at school are dyeing their hair purple, so you should, too!" can be analyzed for defective argument types as follows:

**Generalization (<G>)**
- The argument makes a broad generalization that since the popular guys are dyeing their hair purple, it implies that everyone else should follow suit. This assumes that what's fitting for a specific group (the popular guys) should be extended to all individuals.

**Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
- This argument is predicated on a limited sample (just the popular guys) and suggests a course of action for everyone without considering the preferences or actions of others who might not be in the same group. It doesn't acknowledge other factors or groups who might influence a decision.

**Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- The given reasoning lacks a logical connection between popularity and the necessity of dyeing one's hair purple. It does not provide a sound basis for why one should emulate this specific behavior other than popularity.

**Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
- The argument presumes that popularity or the actions of a popular group automatically dictate a consensus or a social norm that should be followed by everyone else, without substantiating why this consensus is actually valid or necessary.

Combining these defective argument analyses, the argument "All the popular guys at school are dyeing their hair purple, so you should, too!" applies the following flawed reasoning types:

1. Generalization (<G>)
2. Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
3. Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
4. Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)

Each of these identifies specific flaws in the argument's reasoning, highlighting how it fails to conclusively support the claim it makes.
