For 
Certainly! First, let's determine the relevant defective argument types (Designated Deficiency Analysis Argument Types) in the given argument:

**Argument:** "If you miss practice, it means you were probably goofing off. People who goof off drop out of school and end up penniless."

Let's break this down:

1. "If you miss practice, it means you were probably goofing off."
   - This statement generalizes the reason for missing practice to likely being goofing off, which might not be the case for everyone.

2. "People who goof off drop out of school and end up penniless."
   - This statement makes a cause-and-effect claim that students who goof off will inevitably drop out and face financial ruin, which may not always be true and lacks sufficient evidence.

### Applying Defective Argument Types:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** 
   - The statement "If you miss practice, it means you were probably goofing off" suggests a broad generalization without considering other possible reasons for missing practice (e.g., illness, family emergencies, or other commitments).

2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The statement "People who goof off drop out of school and end up penniless" assigns a direct cause-and-effect relationship between goofing off, dropping out, and ending up penniless, without sufficient causal evidence to support this claim.

### Analysis Summary:

The argument relies on:
1. **Generalization (<G>)** in assuming that missing practice is primarily due to goofing off.
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** in claiming that goofing off leads to dropping out of school and resulting in financial ruin.

Thus, the defective argument analysis of the provided statement highlights the use of <G> and <WCB>.
