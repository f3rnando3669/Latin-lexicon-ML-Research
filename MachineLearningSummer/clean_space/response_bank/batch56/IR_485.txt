To apply the defective argument analysis format <IDAA> (Identify/Describe/Analyze/Avoid) to the given dialogue, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify** the defective argument:
   - The defective argument type in the dialogue is <IR> (Inconclusive Reason). Doc dismisses Marty’s claim based on his own immediate skepticism without investigating or considering potential evidence.

2. **Describe** the argument:
   - **Marty**: Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985.
   - **Doc**: I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!

   In this exchange, Marty presents a claim about being from the future and requests help. Doc, however, rejects Marty's claim by implying that it must be a practical joke and promptly dismisses him without further consideration.

3. **Analyze** the defect:
   - The defect here is that Doc's rejection relies on an **Inconclusive Reason**: he assumes Marty's claim is a practical joke because it seems unbelievable on its face. Doc does not inquire further, request evidence, or explore other possibilities that could substantiate Marty’s claim. Marty's statement could have been investigated further, but Doc’s inaccuracy in reasoning leads to an immediate, dismissive conclusion.

4. **Avoid** the defective argument:
   - To avoid such a defective argument, it's crucial to remain open-minded and not to dismiss claims outright without examining them. In a similar situation, one should:
     - Ask for more information or evidence.
     - Consider the context and any past experiences that might lend credibility to the claim.
     - Engage in a dialogue to explore the details further before forming a final judgment.
     
For instance, Doc could have responded by saying, "That’s quite an extraordinary claim. Do you have any proof or evidence to support what you're saying?" This approach opens a constructive dialogue and a chance to evaluate the claim more thoroughly.
