The argument presented can be assessed using the categories of defective argument types defined as follows:

- **<G> Generalization**: Overreaching conclusions based on insufficient data.
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: Inadequate listing of necessary evidence.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: Reasons offered do not conclusively support the argument.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: Causal link is weak or missing.
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: Circular reasoning or the argument repeats itself without proving anything.
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: Assuming unanimous agreement without sufficient evidence.
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**: Use of unclear or vague terminology.

The argument provided is: 

"The word of Zorbo the Great is flawless and perfect. We know this because it says so in The Great and Infallible Book of Zorboâ€™s Best and Most Truest Things that are Definitely True and Should Not Ever Be Questioned."

In this context, the argument type that most fittingly applies is **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**. This type points to circular reasoning where the proposition is supported by itself without independent evidence. Here, the claim that "The word of Zorbo the Great is flawless and perfect" is supported solely by a book that asserts its own infallibility, thereby relying on its own claim to validate itself, a classic case of circular reasoning.
