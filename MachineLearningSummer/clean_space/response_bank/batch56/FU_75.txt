For 
The argument "everybody's doing it, so it must be a good thing to do" uses the idea that widespread adoption or acceptance of a behavior or action is evidence of its goodness or correctness. However, this argument can be defective. Let’s identify which defective argument types might apply (IDAA):

1. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This argument presumes that because many people are participating in an activity or behavior, it must be correct or good. It relies on assumed consensus rather than providing objective evidence for why the action is good.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument that an action is good simply because it is widely done doesn’t conclusively demonstrate the quality or value of the action itself. It fails to directly link widespread participation to the inherent goodness of the action.

In this case, the most fitting label would be **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** since it directly pertains to the assumption that general agreement or participation equates to the correctness of the action.
