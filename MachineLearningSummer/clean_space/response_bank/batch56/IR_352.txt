The argument provided falls under a defective type called **Irrelevant Appeal to Authority** (<IDAA>). This occurs when an argument relies on the authority of someone who is not a genuine expert in the relevant field.

Here’s an analysis of why the provided statement is an Irrelevant Appeal to Authority:

1. **Non-expertise**: The speaker claims to play a doctor on a television show ("Bimbos and Studmuffins in the OR"), but they are not a real doctor. The skills required to portray a doctor on TV do not translate to actual medical expertise.

2. **False authority**: The argument suggests that because the speaker plays a doctor on a TV show, their endorsement of MorphiPill 2000 as a “safe and effective pain killer” should be trusted. This misleadingly attributes authority and credibility to the speaker based on an unrelated domain of expertise (acting).

3. **Professional opinion**: By claiming that it is their “professional medical opinion,” the statement misrepresents the speaker’s actual profession (acting) and uses this misrepresentation to unduly influence the audience’s trust in the product being advertised.

Overall, the argument attempts to leverage the perceived authority of a fictional role to validate a medical claim, which is both irrelevant and deceptive.
