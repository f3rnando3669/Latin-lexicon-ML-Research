The argument presented in the statement "Why should merely cracking down on terrorism help to stop it, when that method hasn't worked in any other country?" can be analyzed for potential defects in reasoning. Here's how it could be broken down using the defective argument types defined earlier:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement might be using a broad and unsupported generalization by suggesting that cracking down on terrorism hasn't worked in any other country. This ignores any nuances or specific contexts where such measures might have shown success or partial success.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement could be presenting an incomplete enumeration by implying that it has considered all instances of cracking down on terrorism across all countries. This ignores the fact that different countries may have different levels of success based on varying strategies, contexts, and definitions of 'success.'

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasoning provided is inconclusive because it jumps to the conclusion that cracking down on terrorism will not work without thoroughly examining the reasons why it failed in other cases and whether those reasons apply to the current situation.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument may lack a sufficient causal basis by assuming that the failure in other countries directly implies it will fail universally, without considering other contributing factors or potential differences in implementation.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This does not seem applicable in this context, as the argument doesn't rely on repeating a proposition to establish its truth.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: It seems to presume a consensus that cracking down on terrorism hasn't worked in any other country, without providing evidence that this is a widely accepted or thoroughly vetted viewpoint.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: Terms like "merely cracking down" could be seen as ambiguous, as they do not specify what measures are included in "cracking down." The effectiveness of anti-terrorism measures can heavily depend on how they are implemented.

To summarize, the statement "Why should merely cracking down on terrorism help to stop it, when that method hasn't worked in any other country?" primarily fits the defective argument types of **Generalization (<G>)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**, and **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**. It potentially also involves **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**, **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**, and **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**.
