For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Analysis, which we'll apply to analyze the conversation for defective argument types.

**Pastor Pete:** People are turning to God everywhere! 9 out of 10 people I interviewed said that they had a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.  
**Fred:** Where did you find these people you interviewed?  
**Pastor Pete:** In my church.

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - Pastor Pete claims, "People are turning to God everywhere!" based on interviews conducted in his church. This is a Generalization because he is extending a finding from a specific, non-representative group to the entire population.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - The claim that 9 out of 10 people interviewed said they had a personal relationship with Jesus Christ can be considered **Incomplete Enumeration**. Without knowing the total number of people interviewed or the diversity of the sample, it's unclear how representative these findings are of the broader community.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - The reasoning based on church interviews does not conclusively support the broader claim about people everywhere. This represents **Inconclusive Reason** because the conclusion about widespread belief cannot be drawn solely from data gathered in a single church.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - If Pastor Pete suggests that the interviews from his church alone can illustrate a wider trend (implying causation from this limited sample), this would be an **Insufficient Causal Basis**. The church congregation may have its own dynamics leading to higher religiosity, not necessarily reflecting a broader social trend.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - Pastor Pete does not repeat his claim multiple times in the given conversation, so **Faulty Repetition of Proposition** does not seem applicable here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - Pastor Pete presumes a consensus by stating "People are turning to God everywhere!" Despite only having evidence from a specific, unrepresentative group, this is **Presumptuous Consensus**, assuming widespread agreement or trend without sufficient evidence.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - The phrase "turning to God everywhere" is somewhat ambiguous without clear definitions of "turning to God" and "everywhere." The lack of specificity can be seen as **Ambiguous Language** since it leaves room for multiple interpretations.

By identifying these defective argument types using <IDAA>, we can see that Pastor Pete's argument suffers from multiple logical issues:
- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**

Thus, Pastor Pete's conclusion is poorly supported by his argument.
