Let's break down and analyze the argument in the statement "I shop at Natural Happy Sunshine Store (NHSS), which is much better than your grocery store because at NHSS everything is natural including the 38-year-old store manager’s long gray hair and saggy breasts." using each of the defective argument types defined:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This statement appears to generalize the quality of the entire NHSS based on the claim that "everything is natural," which is not necessarily a reliable indicator of the store's overall quality compared to another grocery store.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not provide a comprehensive list of reasons why NHSS is better than any other grocery store. It focuses solely on the claim that "everything is natural" without addressing other factors that might be relevant in evaluating the quality of a grocery store.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument states that NHSS is better because "everything is natural including the store manager’s physical attributes." This reasoning is not necessarily convincing or conclusive. Physical attributes of a store manager do not logically contribute to the overall quality of a grocery store.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The statement lacks a sufficient causal basis to claim that NHSS is superior. There is no evidence presented that natural products (or the natural state of the store manager) causally relate to the overall superiority of the store.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The argument might be repetitively asserting the superiority of NHSS based on the vague and repeated idea of 'natural' without valid supporting evidence or differentiation from competitors.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The claim presumes that the consensus on the value of natural attributes is universally accepted and that this is sufficient to claim superiority. It assumes agreement on what "better" means without a shared understanding or proof.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The term "natural" is ambiguous and can mean different things to different people. The argument is unclear as to what precisely "natural" entails and why it should lead one to conclude that NHSS is better, especially considering its application to the store manager’s physical appearance.

In conclusion, the argument "I shop at Natural Happy Sunshine Store (NHSS), which is much better than your grocery store because at NHSS everything is natural including the 38-year-old store manager’s long gray hair and saggy breasts," suffers from numerous defective argument types: Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Presumptuous Consensus, and Ambiguous Language. These defects make the argument unconvincing and poorly substantiated.
