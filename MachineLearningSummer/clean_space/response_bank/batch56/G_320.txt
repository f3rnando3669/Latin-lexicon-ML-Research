For 
The argument "Annie must like Starbucks because all white girls like Starbucks" can be evaluated using the defective argument types defined:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument makes a sweeping generalization about a group (all white girls) and applies it to an individual (Annie). This is a form of hasty generalization, as it assumes what is true for the group must be true for an individual without sufficient evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument fails to consider other possibilities. It assumes that liking Starbucks is a universal trait for all white girls without acknowledging that individual preferences can vary widely.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning is not compelling. It does not provide a solid basis for the conclusion that Annie specifically likes Starbucks. The premise is insufficient to definitively conclude the given statement.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument implies a causal relationship (being a white girl causes liking Starbucks) without providing evidence for such a basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The argument does not fit this defective argument type, as it does not involve any repetition of the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This argument may seem to rely on a presumed consensus that "all white girls like Starbucks" without any empirical data or consensus supporting this stereotype.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: There isn't significant ambiguity in the language used in this statement, so this category does not apply here.

Thus, we can identify the argument primarily as a **Generalization (G)** and **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, with elements of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** as well as **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.
