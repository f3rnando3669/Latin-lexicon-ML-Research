The argument presented is an example of the logical fallacy known as **Appeal to Authority**. In this scenario, the mother's reasoning for not allowing you to go to the mall is solely based on her authority ("because I'm the mom and I say so") rather than providing a logical or evidence-based explanation. This type of fallacy assumes that a claim is true because an authority figure asserts it without providing further justification.

Let's break down the logic to clarify:
- You ask for permission based on a request to the authority (your mother).
- The authority (your mother) denies the request.
- When asked for justification, the authority figure provides a response that relies only on their position of authority rather than reasoned evidence.

Thus, the fallacy here is **Appeal to Authority**, or an **Authority-Based Argument**.
