Certainly! Before applying the <IDAA> (Identification of Defective Argument Attributes) to the statement "four out of five dentists agree that brushing your teeth makes your life meaningful," let's break it down using the defective argument types provided:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This applies when a broad statement is made based on a limited sample.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This occurs when not all relevant cases or possibilities are considered.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This involves drawing a conclusion that does not logically follow from the premises.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This involves claiming a causal relationship based on insufficient evidence.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This occurs when the same assertion is repeated without providing new evidence.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This relies on the assumption that consensus implies correctness.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This involves using language that is unclear or open to multiple interpretations.

Now, let's evaluate the statement:

“Four out of five dentists agree that brushing your teeth makes your life meaningful.”

1. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
    - The statement tries to argue that because a majority of dentists agree on something, it must be true or meaningful. The appeal to the number of dentists agreeing is used as a way to validate the statement without providing substantial evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
    - It specifies that four out of five dentists agree but does not provide information on how many dentists were surveyed, in what context, or if those surveyed are representative of the entire dentist community.

3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
    - The statement makes an implicit causal claim that brushing your teeth leads to a meaningful life, but it does not provide sufficient evidence to support this causal relationship. What makes life meaningful involves numerous factors far beyond dental hygiene alone.

4. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
    - The term "meaningful" is highly subjective and open to various interpretations. The language used is ambiguous and does not concretely define what specifically is meant by “meaningful.”

Thus, the statement “Four out of five dentists agree that brushing your teeth makes your life meaningful” exhibits the following defective argument attributes:

- **FU**: Presumptuous Consensus
- **FE**: Incomplete Enumeration
- **WCB**: Insufficient Causal Basis
- **DEP**: Ambiguous Language
