For 
Apply <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Attribute) to "to define a person based on faulty opinions derived by judgments made about a group, a class, or race of people":

The statement provided fits the defective argument type <G> (Generalization). Here's the reasoning:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This defective argument type describes situations where conclusions are drawn about an individual based on characteristics or opinions applied to a larger group, class, or race. 

In the context of defining a person based on faulty opinions derived from judgments about a group, a class, or a race of people, it is inherently making a broad generalization. The faults in this approach arise because the attributes of the broader group may not accurately describe the individual. Therefore, this statement aligns with the characteristics of the argument type Generalization (<G>).

Let's denote the statement with the type:
- "To define a person based on faulty opinions derived by judgments made about a group, a class, or race of people" <IDAA> <G>.
