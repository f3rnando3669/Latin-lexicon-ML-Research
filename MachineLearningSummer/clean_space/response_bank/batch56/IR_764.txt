For 
The question "When Donald Trump called Hillary Clinton 'Killary' to discredit her and her reputation as a presidential candidate, he committed which logical fallacy?" involves an example of a logical fallacy where someone attempts to attack the character of a person rather than addressing the merits of their argument. This type of fallacy is commonly known as an ad hominem attack.

However, the question is to apply the previously defined defective argument types. None of the exact terms (Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Presumptuous Consensus, Ambiguous Language) perfectly aligns with the ad hominem fallacy in their strict definitions. 

Nevertheless, the closest defective argument type among those provided would be:

**<DEP: Ambiguous Language>**, as the nickname "Killary" is a form of loaded language intended to evoke emotions and biases rather than provide a rational basis for argument. This usage introduces ambiguity by conflating and emotionally charging the discussion surrounding Hillary Clinton.

To summarize, applying <IDAA> to the statement might yield:

"When Donald Trump called Hillary Clinton 'Killary' to discredit her and her reputation as a presidential candidate, he committed an argument type: <DEP>. He used Ambiguous Language, which aimed to distract from logical discussion by leveraging emotionally charged and pejorative connotations."
