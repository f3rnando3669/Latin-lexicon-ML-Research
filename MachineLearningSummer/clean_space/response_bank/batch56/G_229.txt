For 
To apply defective argument analysis (<IDAA>) to the statement "There aren’t any good restaurants in Sydney; I tried two and they were both horrible.”, we should identify the type of defective arguments present:

The statement suggests that because the individual tried two restaurants in Sydney and found them horrible, all restaurants in Sydney must be bad. This reasoning involves a flawed generalization based on a very limited and unrepresentative sample.

### Analysis:
1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument assumes that the entire restaurant scene in Sydney can be judged based on the experience at only two restaurants. This is a hasty generalization since it doesn't consider the larger variety of restaurants in the city.
   - **Defective Argument**: <G> Generalization
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument fails to consider that there are likely many more restaurants in Sydney that the individual has not tried, thus making their sample size incomplete and insufficient for making a broad conclusion.
   - **Defective Argument**: <FE> Incomplete Enumeration

Therefore, the defective arguments present in the statement are:
1. **Generalization** (<G>)
2. **Incomplete Enumeration** (<FE>)

This identification shows that the conclusion drawn in the statement is not supported adequately due to these logical fallacies.
