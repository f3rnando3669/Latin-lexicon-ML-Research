For 
To apply the defective arguments analysis (<IDAA>) to the statement "Everyone is doing it. You should too.", it is important to identify which specific types of defective arguments are present. 

Here is the analysis of the statement:

1. **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: This argument assumes that because "everyone" (a very general and likely incorrect representation) is doing something, it is the right course of action for the individual without providing a comprehensive enumeration of who "everyone" entails.

2. **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: This argument implies that the widespread acceptance or participation makes something right or advisable, without offering robust justification beyond the alleged consensus.

Based on the analysis, the defective arguments present in the statement "Everyone is doing it. You should too." are primarily <FE> and <FU>.
