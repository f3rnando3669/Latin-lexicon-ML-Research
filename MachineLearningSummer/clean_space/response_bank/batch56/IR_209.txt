Certainly! Let's apply the match for defective argument types to the given statement: 

“No one has ever been able to prove definitively that extra-terrestrials exist, so they must not be real.”

Here are the mappings for potential defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: Drawing broad conclusions from limited evidence.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Listing only a part of the possible cases.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Providing an argument that doesn't support the conclusion adequately.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Assuming a cause-and-effect relationship without sufficient basis.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Repeating a claim without providing new justification.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assuming something is true because it is believed by many.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Using language that can be interpreted in multiple ways, thereby creating confusion.

Applying **IDAA** (Identifying Defective Argument Aspects):

The given statement suggests that because we cannot definitively prove the existence of extraterrestrials, they must not be real. Let's break this down:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The fact that something hasn't been definitively proven does not logically lead to a conclusion that it doesn't exist. Just because there isn't definitive proof, it doesn't mean the opposite is true (that they must not be real). The absence of proof isn’t equivalent to proof of absence. Therefore, the reasoning is inconclusive in terms of negating the existence of extraterrestrials solely based on the current lack of definitive proof.

Thus, the primary defective argument aspect in the given statement is:

**Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
