For 
The statement "I know five people from Kentucky. They are all racists. Therefore, Kentuckians are racist." can be broken down and analyzed for defective arguments. Here's how it applies to the types defined:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument makes a sweeping generalization based on a small, unrepresentative sample. The personal experience with five individuals is used to infer a characteristic about an entire group, which is not logically sound.
  
   - **Type**: Generalization (<G>)

### Explanation:

This argument is defective under the type Generalization because it unfairly extrapolates the traits of a few individuals to an entire population without sufficient evidence to support such a broad claim.

Therefore, the defective argument type for this statement is:

- **<IDAA>: <G> (Generalization)**
