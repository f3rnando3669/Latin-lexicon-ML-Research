For 
Let's apply the defined defective argument types to the given statement:

**Statement:** "My mother has always told me not to drink milk after eating fish because she knows a friend whose skin got patched after drinking milk and eating fish together. Besides, many other people have told me the same thing so it must be true."

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument is based on the experience of a single friend of the mother and unspecified "many other people." This is an insufficient basis for a general claim, as it does not consider the entire range of scientific and anecdotal evidence available.

2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The argument implies a causal relationship between drinking milk with fish and getting skin problems. However, it does not provide a scientifically proven causal mechanism for why this combination would cause patched skin, making the conclusion unfounded based on the given evidence.

3. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The argument leans on repetition from different people as evidence ("many other people have told me the same thing so it must be true"), suggesting that repetition or popularity of a notion equates to its truth, which is logically unsound.

4. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The assertion that "many other people have told me the same thing so it must be true" falls under presumptuous consensus. This indicates a belief that the truth of the claim is validated by the number of people who support it rather than any empirical evidence or logical reasoning.

After applying the defined defective argument types, we can classify this statement as containing:

- **FE** (Incomplete Enumeration): Relying on limited anecdotal evidence.
- **WCB** (Insufficient Causal Basis): Assuming a causal link without scientific backing.
- **RR** (Faulty Repetition of Proposition): Repeating the claim as validation of its truth.
- **FU** (Presumptuous Consensus): Believing in the truth based on the number of people who assert it.
