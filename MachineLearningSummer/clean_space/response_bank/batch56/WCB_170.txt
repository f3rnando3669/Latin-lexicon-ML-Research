For 
<I wore my lucky red shirt when I took the test, so that is probably why I did so well on the test.> involves <WCB>.

Here's why:
- <WCB> stands for Insufficient Causal Basis. This type of defective argument occurs when a causal relationship is asserted without sufficient evidence.

The argument claims that wearing a lucky red shirt caused the good performance on the test. However, there is no sufficient causal evidence to support that wearing a specific shirt directly influenced the test results. Therefore, this is an argument with an insufficient causal basis.
