For 
In the dialogue between Jen and Bridget, the argument made by Bridget contains a form of reasoning that is self-defeating and circular. However, the exact defective argument types as defined previously (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>) do not directly encompass this particular type of flawed reasoning. 

The interaction goes as follows:

**Jen**: Donâ€™t you realize that all this drinking you are doing is making your family miserable?
**Bridget**: Yes, I do.
**Jen**: Then what are you doing about it?
**Bridget**: Drinking to forget.

In this specific case, Bridget's reasoning could be seen as a form of inconclusive reasoning or a faulty cause-and-effect justification:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Bridget acknowledges the problem but her solution doesn't address or resolve the issue, making her reasoning inconclusive.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Bridget's justification ("Drinking to forget") lacks a logical or sufficient causal basis, as it's evident that drinking further contributes to the problem rather than resolving it.

Thus, we can identify it majorly as <IR> due to the inconclusiveness of Bridget's reasoning in addressing and solving the problem of her family's misery caused by her drinking habit.
