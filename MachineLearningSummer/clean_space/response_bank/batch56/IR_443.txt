The argument presented can be analyzed as follows:

**Statement:**
"Dad, it's difficult to make a living on my salary."
"Consider yourself lucky. When I was your age, I was living on $40 a week."

**Identified Defective Argument Analysis (IDAA):**

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The father's response may be seen as a generalization because it assumes that his past experience directly and exclusively relates to the current situation without considering possible changes in economic circumstances, inflation, cost of living, or other factors that might differ significantly between the two time periods.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - An Incomplete Enumeration could be present if the father’s statement overlooks other factors that might affect their child’s current financial situation, such as higher living costs, different career paths, or the varying demands of different professions.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The father’s reasoning might also be inconclusive. Just because he lived on $40 a week when he was younger does not necessarily mean his child should be able to manage similarly without acknowledging the major changes in economic conditions over time.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - There is an insufficient causal basis if the father implies that since he managed with less money, his child should also manage, without taking into account other factors that contribute to financial stability or well-being today.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - The repeated assumption that the father’s past experiences are wholly applicable to the current situation is likely faulty. The proposition is not sufficiently justified by simply stating past conditions.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - Presumptuous Consensus might come into play if the father assumes that everyone from his generation or in similar situations would agree that his past earnings were sufficient, thereby presuming widespread agreement without sufficient evidence.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - The argument isn’t particularly ambiguous in language, but if there were any phrases or terms used that could be interpreted in multiple ways or are not explicitly clear, it could fall under Ambiguous Language. In this case, "$40 a week" might have different implications historically versus currently but isn't inherently ambiguous in this example.

In summary, the father's argument primarily suffers from Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, and Insufficient Causal Basis. These defective arguments weaken the justification of his claim that his child should consider themselves lucky and manage similarly with their current salary.
