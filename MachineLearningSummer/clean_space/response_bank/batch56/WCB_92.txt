The argument presented is:

“President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up. Therefore, I think Jones is responsible for the rise in crime."

Let's analyze this argument for the defective argument types (DATs) defined:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument does not appear to suffer from overgeneralizing from a particular instance. It's making a specific claim about the relationship between taxes and crime under President Jones.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument could be claimed to suffer from this defect if it ignores all other possible reasons for the rise in crime. The argument doesn't consider any alternative explanations or factors that may have contributed to the increase in crime rates, suggesting an incomplete enumeration of causes.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument could be said to have inconclusive reasoning because it assumes a causal relationship based on temporal correlation. Just because one event followed another doesn't conclusively establish causation.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This argument does seem to fit this category as well. It identifies a sequence of events but doesn't provide evidence of a causal mechanism linking the tax increase to the rise in violent crime, making it an insufficient causal basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: There is no repeated proposition in this argument.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument does not appeal to a consensus or presume one, so this defect does not apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The argument doesn’t seem to use ambiguous language. The terms “taxes” and “violent crime” are specific in this context.

Based on the analysis, the defective arguments most applicable to this statement are:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not consider other potential causes for the rise in crime.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument assumes a causal relationship merely based on temporal succession.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument lacks evidence of a direct causal link between the tax increase and the rise in violent crime.

In conclusion, the argument can be criticized primarily on the grounds of **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
