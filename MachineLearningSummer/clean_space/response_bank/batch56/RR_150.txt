For 
The statement "We know he’s not lying since he says he’s telling the truth." exhibits the defective argument type called Faulty Repetition of Proposition, which you have defined as <RR>.

In this case, the reasoning is circular because it simply restates the proposition to support itself, without providing any additional evidence or reasoning. The claim "he’s telling the truth" is being used to prove itself, which is a classic example of a circular argument.

Thus, the statement can be identified as:

"We know he’s not lying since he says he’s telling the truth." <RR>
