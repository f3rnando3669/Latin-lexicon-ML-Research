It looks like you're trying to identify defective arguments in the statement "Bush was 'determined to knock down Saddam Hussein' because of his 'nuclear bomb potential.'" Let's break it down and see which type of defective argument (if any) applies to this claim.

1. **Generalization (G)**
   - This doesn't seem to be a case of drawing a broad conclusion from specific instances, so Generalization might not apply here.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
   - This argument doesn't list many instances or aspects, so it doesn't fit the definition of Incomplete Enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
   - The reason provided ("nuclear bomb potential") may be argued to be inconclusive without further evidence or context. This could suggest that Inconclusive Reason may apply, as the argument might not be sufficiently supported.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
   - Insufficient Causal Basis might apply here if the evidence linking the determination to remove Saddam Hussein to his nuclear bomb potential is weak or lacking. This requires assessing the strength of the connection between the cause and effect.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
   - There's no indication of a faulty repetition of the proposition within the given statement.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
   - The argument does not seem to be based on assuming a consensus or general agreement without evidence, so Presumptuous Consensus might not apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**
   - Ambiguous Language could be applied if the terms "determined" or "nuclear bomb potential" are not clearly defined or if there is ambiguity in what exactly is meant by these phrases.

Based on the analysis, the most fitting defective argument types for the given statement could be:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The statement might not provide sufficient reason or evidence to substantiate the claim.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** If the claim lacks a strong causal connection, this type could apply.

The application of these defective argument types would then look like this:

**<IR>: 'Bush was "determined to knock down Saddam Hussein" because of his "nuclear bomb potential."' The reason given is inconclusive as it does not provide sufficient evidence to support the claim.**

**<WCB>: 'Bush was "determined to knock down Saddam Hussein" because of his "nuclear bomb potential."' The causal connection between the determination and the nuclear bomb potential is not sufficiently established.**
