For 
To apply IDAA (Identifying Defective Argument Attributes) to the given passage, let's break down the argument and match it against the defined defective argument types:

---

**Passage**: "During the early 2000s, the search for a cause of autism led to vaccines, though no scientific link has been found between the administration of vaccines and the onset of autism. The time that children are vaccinated and the time they're diagnosed do closely correlate, however, leading upset parents to assign blame to the immunizations, for lack of a better explanation."

---

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - Generalization occurs when a broad statement is made based on limited evidence or cases.
   - In the passage, there's an implicit generalization in how upset parents blame vaccines for autism without specific scientific evidence to support such a broad claim.
   - **Attribute**: **<G>**

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - Incomplete Enumeration involves listing examples or instances and mistakenly suggesting that the list is exhaustive.
   - While this doesn't clearly fit the passage, it can be inferred that suggesting vaccines are to blame is an incomplete consideration of all possible causes of autism.
   - **Attribute**: **<FE>**

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - Inconclusive Reason is when an argument is presented as supporting a conclusion, but the support is insufficient or doesn't logically lead to the conclusion.
   - This matches well with the passage: the correlation between vaccination and autism diagnosis timing does not logically lead to causation.
   - **Attribute**: **<IR>**

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - Insufficient Causal Basis is when an argument assumes a causal connection without sufficient evidence.
   - This is directly applicable here as the passage discusses how parents attribute autism to vaccines without scientific evidence.
   - **Attribute**: **<WCB>**

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition involves repeating a claim to establish its truth, irrespective of new evidence or logic.
   - While the passage speaks to a repetitive claim (vaccines causing autism), it's not focused on the repetition itself as much as the correlation.
   - **No clear match** for **<RR>**.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - Presumptuous Consensus involves assuming that the belief or opinion of a group is automatically correct.
   - The passage implies that many parents believe in the vaccine-autism link due to timing correlation, even without evidence.
   - **Attribute**: **<FU>**

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - Ambiguous Language refers to using vague or unclear language that can lead to misunderstandings.
   - This does not prominently feature in the passage as the language is relatively clear regarding parents' beliefs.
   - **No clear match** for **<DEP>**.

---

**Summary of Defective Argument Attributes (<IDAA>)**:

- **<G> Generalization**: Implicit broad statements by parents blaming vaccines.
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: Vaccines mentioned without considering other possible causes.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: Correlation does not imply causation.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: Assuming a causal link without scientific evidence.
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: Parents' consensus presumed correct without evidence.
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: Not clearly applicable.
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**: Not clearly applicable.
