For 
Defective Arguments:

1. **Generalization (G)**: A conclusion drawn from a small sample size or inadequate evidence.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Drawing a conclusion based on too few instances or failing to account for all relevant cases.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Using a premise that does not logically or sufficiently support the conclusion.
   
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Claiming a causal relationship without enough evidence to support it.
   
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Repeatedly asserting a proposition without providing additional evidence.
   
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assuming a consensus or agreement exists when it does not.
   
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Using language that is unclear or can be interpreted in multiple ways.

Let's now apply **Ambiguous Language (DEP)** to the question "What did you use to wipe your fingerprints from the gun?" 

This question potentially contains ambiguous language since the question presumes that the person used something to wipe off fingerprints, which may not necessarily be true. This presumption can lead to misunderstanding or misinterpretation about what actually happened. The use of "wipe your fingerprints from the gun" implicitly assumes the person in question had fingerprints on the gun and took action to remove them, which may not be established or true. 

Therefore, the ambiguity lies in the presumption embedded in the question that could lead to misleading or inaccurate conclusions.
