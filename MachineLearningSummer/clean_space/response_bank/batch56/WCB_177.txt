The argument "It rained and then we lost the game. Every time it rains, we're going to lose." can be analyzed for defective argument types as follows:

- **Generalization (<G>):** This argument takes a specific occurrence (it rained and the team lost) and generalizes it to all instances (every time it rains, the team will lose). This form of overgeneralizing from a single event or a few events without substantial evidence is a defective argument.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The argument suggests that rain causes the team to lose the game, but there is no evidence provided to substantiate a causal link between rain and losing the game. This is an example of asserting a causal relationship without sufficient causal basis.

Hence, the argument "It rained and then we lost the game. Every time it rains, we're going to lose." fits the definitions of Generalization (<G>) and Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).
