The argument provided in the statement "This is usually used in a company's slogan, using words that are very vague and nonspecific, but sound really nice. ex: 'Eat Fresh.' 'Expect More. Pay Less.'" can be identified as having the defective argument type <DEP> called Ambiguous Language.

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Definition of DEP**: Ambiguous Language refers to the use of words or phrases that are vague, nonspecific, or have multiple meanings, which can lead to misunderstandings or interpretations that support the argument without substantial evidence.

2. **Example in Argument**: The phrases "Eat Fresh." and "Expect More. Pay Less." are highlighted as examples of slogans that are designed to sound appealing while being deliberately vague and nonspecific.

By applying <IDAA> (Identification of Defective Argument Attribute) to the provided statement, one can see that it fits the description of <DEP> (Ambiguous Language) because the slogans use language that is inherently ambiguous and lacks clear, specific meaning, which can mislead or manipulate the audience into drawing positive but unsupported conclusions.
