For 
The type of defective argument applied here is False Dichotomy or False Dilemma. This fallacy occurs when only two choices are presented in a situation where more options are available. Judge Danforth's statement, "you are either with this court or against it," presents a binary choice, eliminating any middle ground or other possibilities.

However, the codes provided (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>) do not directly correspond to the False Dichotomy fallacy. None of the provided defective argument types (<IDAA>) specifically aligns with the False Dichotomy fallacy. 

Thus, this example: 
"Judge Danforth in the play, 'The Crucible,' offers Proctor two choices: you are either with this court or against it" 

**is NOT an example of any of the provided defective argument types** (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>) but rather falls under the category of False Dichotomy or False Dilemma fallacy.
