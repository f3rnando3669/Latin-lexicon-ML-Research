The argument you provided can be analyzed and evaluated based on the defective argument types we've defined:

**Statement:**
"The greatest thing that we can do is to love each other. Love is better than any other emotion."

**Analysis:**

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - The statement may be considered a generalization because it makes a broad and sweeping claim that "the greatest thing we can do is to love each other" without providing specific evidence or context to support this claim.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - The argument mentions that "Love is better than any other emotion" without considering or enumerating other emotions comprehensively. It fails to discuss or weigh other potential emotions that might also be considered valuable or great.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - The statement does not provide substantive reasoning or evidence to support why love is purported to be the greatest act or emotion. The reasons offered are inconclusive and do not firmly establish the superiority of love over all other emotions.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - The argument lacks a causal basis, i.e., it does not explain the cause-effect relationship or how loving each other leads to it being the greatest action we can undertake. It asserts a conclusion without a sufficient causal foundation.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - The argument somewhat repeats the idea that love is superior without adding new evidence or reasoning. Saying "Love is better than any other emotion" essentially restates the primary assertion without further clarification.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - The statement presupposes a consensus that love is universally deemed the greatest thing we can do and inherently better than other emotions, without considering possible differing perspectives or beliefs.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - The language in the statement is somewhat ambiguous regarding what is meant by "greatest" and "better." These terms are subjective and could be interpreted in various ways, making the argument unclear without further definition or context.

**Conclusion:**
The argument incorporates several defective argument types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), and Ambiguous Language (DEP). These defects undermine the strength and validity of the argument presented.
