In the given dialogue:

"Ashley: It is morally wrong to cheat on your spouse; why on earth would you have done that?
Hannah: But what is morality exactly?
Ashley: It’s a code of conduct shared by cultures.
Hannah: But who creates this code?..."

Hannah is committing the fallacy of Inconclusive Reason, which is defined as <IR>. 

Here's why:

Hannah's responses steer the conversation away from addressing the specific issue at hand (i.e., why cheating on your spouse might be morally wrong) by raising increasingly abstract questions about the nature of morality. This tactic diverts the discussion into an infinite regress of definitions without ever addressing Ashley’s initial point. In essence, Hannah engages in a form of sophistry that prevents any concrete conclusions from being reached regarding the original moral assertion. 

Therefore, applying <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Approach/Analysis), Hannah has committed the fallacy of <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
