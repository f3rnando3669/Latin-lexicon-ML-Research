For 
The defective argument type applied to the statement "Sure, that charity group is under investigation for misusing funds, but everyone deserves a healthy meal" is `<IR>` (Inconclusive Reason).

Here’s the reasoning:

- The argument mentions that a charity group is under investigation for misusing funds, which is a serious allegation that needs addressing.
- However, the argument shifts focus to a different point — that everyone deserves a healthy meal.
- While the latter statement is valid and morally appealing, it does not address or resolve the concern about the misuse of funds by the charity group.
- Hence, the reason provided is inconclusive in the context of the original issue (misusing funds).

Thus, the argument type applied here is `<IR>` (Inconclusive Reason).
