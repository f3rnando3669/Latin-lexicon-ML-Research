The analysis of the argument provided involves identifying defective argument types and understanding their fallacies. In this case,

**Argument Analysis:**

1. Statement: "Every time Joe goes swimming he is wearing his Speedos."
2. Conclusion: "Something about wearing that Speedo must make him want to go swimming."

This argument can be identified using the defective argument types as follows:

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
    - The argument implies a causal relationship between Joe wearing his Speedos and his desire to go swimming. This falls under <WCB> because it suggests causation without sufficient evidence. Joe wearing Speedos every time he swims doesn't necessarily mean that wearing Speedos is what makes him want to swim; there could be other factors involved.

So, the appropriate defective argument type here is <WCB>:

**<WCB>**: Insufficient Causal Basis

The given argument, "Every time Joe goes swimming he is wearing his Speedos. Something about wearing that Speedo must make him want to go swimming," exemplifies the Insufficient Causal Basis defective argument type. The conclusion about the Speedo causing the desire to swim is reached without adequate evidence, assuming causation from mere correlation.
