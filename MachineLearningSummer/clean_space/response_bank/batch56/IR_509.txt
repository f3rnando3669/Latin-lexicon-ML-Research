For 
The argument "No one has ever been able to prove that extraterrestrials exist, so they must not be real." can be pointed out as a defective argument type:

<FU> Presumptuous Consensus: This argument is faulty because it presumes that the lack of proof or consensus on the existence of extraterrestrials equates to their non-existence. The absence of evidence is not sufficient proof of non-existence. Just because no one has proven extraterrestrials exist, it does not logically follow that they definitely do not exist. There may simply be a lack of evidence or technological limitations in detecting them.
