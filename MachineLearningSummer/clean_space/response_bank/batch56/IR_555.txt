For 
To apply the concept of Identifying Defective Argument Types (<IDAA>) to the statement "Of course Lou would want to go biking on field trip day - biking is the only thing he ever does! He shouldn't be allowed to choose an activity," we can analyze the argument and identify potential defective argument types present.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement "biking is the only thing he ever does" suggests a generalization about Lou's activities. By stating that biking is the only thing Lou does, it overlooks any other interests or activities he might partake in.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The claim that "biking is the only thing he ever does" also indicates an incomplete enumeration. It presumes to list all activities Lou engages in but only names one, thus excluding the possibility of other interests.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The conclusion "He shouldn't be allowed to choose an activity" is drawn from the premise that Lou always chooses biking. This is an inconclusive reason because just because Lou prefers biking does not necessarily justify why he should not be allowed to choose an activity for the field trip.

Therefore, the statement can be seen as combining several defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, and <IR>. These lead to a potentially flawed conclusion about Lou's ability to choose an activity for the field trip.
