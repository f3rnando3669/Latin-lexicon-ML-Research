The statement "I've had bad luck for so long that I'm bound to have good luck now." can be identified as an example of a defective argument type known as Incomplete Enumeration (FE).

Reasoning: The statement assumes a bounded cycle of luck without considering all factors or possibilities that could affect the outcome. It suggests that a change in fortune is inevitable based solely on past bad luck, which is an incomplete analysis and doesn't account for the complexity and variability of real-life situations.
