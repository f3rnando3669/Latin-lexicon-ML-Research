For 
The statement "A mother says that she does not trust her pediatrician because he has never been a mother" can be analyzed for the type of defective argument it represents.

**Argument Analysis:**
The mother is dismissing the expertise of the pediatrician solely based on the fact that the pediatrician has never been a mother, implying that only someone who has been a mother is qualified to give trustworthy pediatric advice.

This type of reasoning falls under the defective argument type known as **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**.

**Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
This occurs when the reason provided does not adequately support the conclusion. In this case, the mother's lack of trust in the pediatrician based on his not being a mother does not sufficiently account for the pediatrician's professional training, experience, and knowledge in the field of pediatrics.

Therefore, the identification of the defective argument type applied to the given statement is:
**<IR>: Inconclusive Reason.**
