For 
<IDAA> stands for Identify Defective Arguments Applied. 

Let's analyze the given statement: "Don't listen to her advice about math. She doesn't even know how to tie her own shoes!"

This argument appears to be a defective type because it attacks the person rather than addressing the actual argument or evidence they present. This type of defective argument is commonly known as an ad hominem attack. Given the definitions we have, the closest match would be considered an **Inconclusive Reason**.

Thus, applying <IDAA>, we would label this argument as:

<IDAA><IR> "Don't listen to her advice about math. She doesn't even know how to tie her own shoes!"

Here, <IR> stands for **Inconclusive Reason**, indicating that the reason given (her inability to tie her shoes) is irrelevant to the validity of her advice about math.
