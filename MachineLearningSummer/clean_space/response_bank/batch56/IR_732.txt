The argument "Explaining that trusting the other politician will cause everyone to lose their homes and jobs" can be analyzed for potentially defective arguments. Here’s how we can apply the defined defective argument types and identify if any apply:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument might not fit under Generalization unless it attempts to draw broad, unsupported conclusions from limited data. If the claim that everyone will lose their homes and jobs is based on limited and unrepresentative examples, it could be a generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This argument could suggest an incomplete enumeration if it posits losing homes and jobs as the only possible outcomes without considering other alternatives or explanations.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: If the reasoning provided is not adequate to support the conclusion (e.g., just stating it without substantial evidence), this could constitute an inconclusive reason.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: If the logical connection between trusting the politician and losing homes and jobs is not well-established or substantiated, this would be a classic case of an insufficient causal basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Unless the argument repeatedly makes the same unfounded proposition without adding new evidence, faulty repetition might not apply here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This argument doesn’t seem to rely on an assumed general agreement, so this type of defective argument might not be relevant.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: If terms like "trusting the politician" or "lose their homes and jobs" are used ambiguously and not clearly defined, leading to misinterpretation, then ambiguous language could apply.

Let's narrow it down:

- The primary defect here appears to be **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, as the statement draws a very strong causal link without providing sufficient evidence to establish how trusting the politician directly leads to everyone losing their homes and jobs.
- Additionally, if the statement is overly broad and assumes that such a severe outcome applies universally without a nuanced examination, **Generalization (G)** could also be applicable.

Thus, the most fitting defective argument types are likely:

**<WCB>**: Insufficient Causal Basis

**<G>**: Generalization

By identifying these defective arguments, we can better analyze and critique the validity of the given statement.
