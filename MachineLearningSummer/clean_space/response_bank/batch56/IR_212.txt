Applying the **Defective Arguments Annotations and Assessment (IDAA)** to the statement:

*"You haven't held a steady job since 1992. Worse than that, we couldn't find a single employer who'd provide you with a good reference."*

we can analyze it for possible defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: There is a generalization implied here about the person's capability and reliability based on their job history since 1992 and the lack of good references. This might not take into account recent changes, efforts, or specific circumstances.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement does not consider all possible factors or other achievements the person might have had since 1992; it focuses only on employment and references.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The absence of a steady job or good references isn't necessarily conclusive evidence of the person's overall capability or future potential. It presents a limited view that may not lead to a firm conclusion regarding their employability.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Saying that the person hasn't held a steady job since 1992 and assuming it's solely due to their incompetence does not establish sufficient causality. There may be various other reasons for this situation which are entirely overlooked. 

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This argument doesn't really repeat a proposition in a faulty manner, so it doesn't seem applicable here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument could be seen as suggesting a consensus among employers without really substantiating this consensus or considering differing opinions. 

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The use of "steady job," "worse," and "good reference" might be inherently vague and lack clear, objective standards.

Given these points, the argument in the statement can be seen primarily as a combination of Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), and Inconclusive Reason (<IR>).

**Annotated Statement:**

*"You haven't held a steady job since 1992. (G, FE) Worse than that, we couldn't find a single employer who'd provide you with a good reference. (G, IR, FU)"*

This analysis helps to break down and evaluate the potential weaknesses and implicit assumptions in the argument as presented.
