For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Type) to the question "Which case is not a False Dichotomy?", we need to analyze and determine which, if any, of the defective argument types listed matches or does not match the scenario provided.

First, let’s break down what a False Dichotomy is:
- A False Dichotomy (or False Dilemma) occurs when an argument presents two options as the only possible choices when, in fact, other alternatives exist.

The given question is "Which case is not a False Dichotomy?" itself may not necessarily fit within the defective argument types defined earlier as it is an inquiry rather than an argument.

However, we can still analyze given cases and determine whether any match the definition of a False Dichotomy. For this exercise, let’s hypothetically analyze several statements that might present scenarios:

1. "We either have to cut down the forest or face economic ruin."
   - This is a False Dichotomy because it presents two extreme options without considering other possibilities like sustainable development.

2. "You can either be with us or against us."
   - This is also a False Dichotomy as it ignores the possibility of neutral or alternative positions.

3. "In terms of favorite fruits, you can like only apples or bananas."
   - Again, a False Dichotomy as it ignores the existence of other fruits.

To address the question, we can assume the following correct application:

**Which case is not a False Dichotomy?**

Option D: The scenarios presented above (Cutting the forest, Us or against us, Apples or Bananas), albeit hypothetical, are all examples of False Dichotomy.

To frame the answer with defective argument types:

If we analyze Option D within the framework of defective argument types,

1. **Generalization (<G>)**
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**

The defective argument type most closely related to False Dichotomy is potentially an **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** as it fails to consider all possible choices. However, False Dichotomy in its strongest form isn't exactly a match to these stipulated defective types.

Therefore, responding to the given:

**Application of <IDAA>:**

The case "Which case is not a False Dichotomy?" analytically doesn't apply within the frames <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>, because they do not directly embody a scenario of False Dichotomy.

We conclude that there is no direct application to <IDAA> for the given False Dichotomy within the prescribed defective arguments. Rather, hypothetical productive answers to false dichotomy could be accurately grouped under incorrect "black and white" logic or answers can reformulate a better nagle avoiding such artificial limits.
