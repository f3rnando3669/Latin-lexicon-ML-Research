For 
The argument in the text "Everything I say is true. This is true because I said it, and everything I say is true." can be analyzed and identified as a defective argument type.

Applying <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Approach) to this statement, we can spot the following types of defective arguments:

1. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The argument is circular, continuously referencing itself without bringing in an external justification. It states its conclusion as one of its premises: "Everything I say is true" is used to justify itself.

Here's how the <RR> applies to the statement:

The statement "Everything I say is true. This is true because I said it, and everything I say is true." exemplifies a Faulty Repetition of Proposition because it relies on a circular reasoning pattern where the assertion "everything I say is true" is used to support the same assertion, thus leading to a logical loop without providing independent evidence.

Therefore, the defective argument identified in this instance is <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
