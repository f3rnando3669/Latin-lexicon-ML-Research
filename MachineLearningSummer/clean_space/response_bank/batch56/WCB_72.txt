For 
<IDAA> stands for Identify Defective Argument Types and Analyze. Let's break down the given statement, "Jimmy isn’t at school today. He must be on a family trip," and identify which defective argument types apply.

1. **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>**: The statement assumes that the only reason Jimmy isn’t at school today is that he must be on a family trip. This reasoning overlooks other possible explanations, such as illness, a personal appointment, or another family emergency.

2. **Inconclusive Reason <IR>**: The provided evidence ("Jimmy isn’t at school today") is insufficient to conclusively determine that he is on a family trip. There is no direct connection or supporting evidence between Jimmy's absence and the assumption of a family trip.

In summary, the argument has elements of both Incomplete Enumeration (for not considering other possibilities) and Inconclusive Reason (for lacking sufficient evidence to support the conclusion).

Therefore, the argument type analysis for "Jimmy isn’t at school today. He must be on a family trip" involves:
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
