To analyze the argument "Many homosexuals have AIDS. Therefore, homosexuality causes AIDS." using the defective argument types defined, we can identify the specific flaws in the reasoning:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument takes the observation that 'many homosexuals have AIDS' and makes a broad conclusion that applies to all homosexuals or indicates a direct causal relationship. This is a form of hasty generalization because it does not consider other factors or variations within the population.

2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument claims a causal relationship between homosexuality and AIDS without sufficient evidence to support this claim. It ignores other possible causes of AIDS, such as unsafe sex practices or intravenous drug use, and fails to account for the complex nature of how the disease is transmitted.

Based on the defective argument types, the argument most clearly fits <G> (Generalization) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis). The statement makes a broad generalization from a potentially limited observation and makes a causality claim without adequate evidence to support it.

Therefore, the appropriate defective arguments to apply are:

**<G> Generalization and <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis.**

To be precise, the critical analysis of the argument leads to:

"Many homosexuals have AIDS. Therefore, homosexuality causes AIDS." exhibits the defective argument types <G> (Generalization) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
