For 
The argument "You think labor unions are good? You know who else liked labor unions? Karl Marx, thatâ€™s who." can be classified as:

**<IDAA>**: Identifying Defective Argument Application.

In this case, the defective argument type being applied is:

**Guilt by Association**: This fallacy occurs when someone tries to discredit a position by associating it with an undesirable person or group. The argument attempts to dissuade support for labor unions by tying them to Karl Marx, using the negative connotations some people might have about Marx rather than addressing the merits or faults of labor unions directly. 

In summary, this is an instance of Guilt by Association, where the support of an individual (Karl Marx) is used improperly to tarnish the idea of labor unions.
