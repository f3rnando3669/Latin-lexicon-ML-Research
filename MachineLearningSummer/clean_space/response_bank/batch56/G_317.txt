For 
The argument presented, "If we let your brother stay, weâ€™ll have to let your whole family stay," falls into the category of a Defective Argument Type known as **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**. This specific argument relies on an assumed chain reaction without adequate justification or evidence for why allowing one person to stay necessarily implies that the entire family must also be allowed to stay. It fails to consider any middle ground or conditional nuances that could exist in the situation.

Thus, the argument is defective because it oversimplifies the scenario and presumes an exaggerated consequence without providing a solid causal link between allowing one person and allowing the entire family.
