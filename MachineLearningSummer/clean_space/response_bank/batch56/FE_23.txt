Certainly! We can identify and analyze the defective argument in the given statement by applying the previously defined argument types.

Statement: "I thought you were a good person, but you were not at church today."

- **Generalization (G)**: This could be seen as a generalization because it implies that being a good person is directly tied to attending church, which is oversimplifying and not necessarily true for every individual.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This argument might be listing an insufficient number of criteria for being a "good person", implying that not attending church is a sufficient reason to undermine someone's goodness, ignoring many other possible criteria.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning provided is inconclusive because not attending church on a particular day does not conclusively determine someone's moral character.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There isnâ€™t enough causality to link not attending church directly with not being a good person, so it fails under insufficient causal basis.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This defective argument type doesn't apply directly here, as the statement doesn't repetitively assert the same proposition without additional support.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument might assume that there is a consensus that attending church is a universal measure of goodness, which is not necessarily agreed upon by all.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The term "good person" could be considered ambiguous because it lacks a clear, universally accepted definition in this context.

To summarize, several defective argument types can be applied to this statement, particularly Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), and Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).
