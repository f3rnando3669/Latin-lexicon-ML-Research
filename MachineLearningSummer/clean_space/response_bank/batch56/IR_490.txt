The fallacy committed in the argument presented is **Ad Hominem**. An Ad Hominem fallacy occurs when someone attacks the character or personal traits of their opponent rather than engaging with the substance of their argument.

In this specific instance, instead of providing valid reasons or evidence as to why your opinion on which movie to see is better, you attack your friendâ€™s personal habit of picking their nose and claim that this makes them untrustworthy. This does not address the merits of the movie choices and thus deviates from the actual topic of the debate, relying instead on irrelevant personal criticism.
