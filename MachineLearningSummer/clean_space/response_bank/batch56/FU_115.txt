For 
The argument provided ("The majority of people are voting for John Doe, so he must be the best candidate.") is an example of a defective argument type, which can be identified and analyzed using the defined categories.

In this case, it fits into the type called **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**. This is because the argument assumes that the consensus - in this context, the majority vote - directly correlates with the quality of the candidate (that John Doe is the best candidate) without providing substantive evidence to support this claim. It presumes that the majority's opinion inherently determines the candidate's suitability or competence, which is a logical flaw.

So, applying IDAA (Identify Defective Argument and Associate) to the given statement:
"The majority of people are voting for John Doe, so he must be the best candidate."

Defective Argument Type: **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
