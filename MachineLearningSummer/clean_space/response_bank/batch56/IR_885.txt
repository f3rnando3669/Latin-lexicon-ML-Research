Let's define <IDAA> as follows:

<IDAA> refers to a defective argument type called **Improper Delegation of Authority or Appeal to Authority**.

Given the definition of <IDAA>, the statement "Presenting an unqualified person or institution as a source of credible information" correctly identifies an instance of improperly delegating authority to a source that lacks the necessary qualifications, expertise, or knowledge to be considered credible or reliable in the context being discussed.
