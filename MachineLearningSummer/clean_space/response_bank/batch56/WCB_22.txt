For 
<IDAA> stands for Identify Defective Argument Analysis. Let's apply this analysis to the given argument.

### Argument Analysis
**P1.** Lead poisoning can contribute to violent behavior.
**P2.** Many inner city children have dangerous levels of lead in their blood.
**C.** Therefore, violent crime in the inner city can be solved by curing the lead problem.

### Defective Argument Types Identification

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument may commit a <G> if it is assumed that lead poisoning is the sole or primary cause of violent behavior in all cases. Although lead poisoning can contribute, there are other factors involved in violent crime.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This argument may commit an <FE> because it suggests that curing lead poisoning will solve violent crime without considering other factors such as socio-economic conditions, education, family environment, and other possible contributors to violent behavior.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This argument may commit an <IR> because the premises provided (lead poisoning contributing to violent behavior and high lead levels in inner city children) do not conclusively support the assertion that solving the lead issue will entirely solve violent crime.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This argument may commit a <WCB> because the causal link between lead poisoning and violent crime reduction isn’t sufficiently established. There might be a correlation, but it doesn’t conclusively prove a direct causality strong enough to base the conclusion solely on it.

5. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This argument may commit a <DEP> if terms like "violent crime" or "solved" are not well-defined. The ambiguity might lead to misinterpretation regarding what is meant by "solving" the problem and what constitutes "violent crime."

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the primary defective argument types present in the given argument are:
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**

Thus, the given argument is likely problematic because it fails to consider the multifaceted nature of violent crime and overestimates the impact of a singular factor (lead poisoning) in its prevention or resolution.
