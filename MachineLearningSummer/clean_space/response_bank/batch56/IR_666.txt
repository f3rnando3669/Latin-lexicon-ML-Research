For 
<IDAA> refers to an Identified Defective Argument Analysis. Let's analyze the argument between Jack and Nick:

1. **Jack: I have tiny, invisible unicorns living in my anus.**
2. **Nick: How do you figure?**
3. **Jack: Can you prove that I don't?**
4. **Nick: No.**
5. **Jack: Then I do.**

This argument can be broken down and analyzed for defective argument types:

1. **Jack: I have tiny, invisible unicorns living in my anus.**
   - This is a bold, unsubstantiated claim without evidence. This might fall under <G> (Generalization) because it's a sweeping statement based on no provided data.

2. **Nick: How do you figure?**
   - Nick is asking for the reasoning or evidence behind Jack's claim. 

3. **Jack: Can you prove that I don't?**
   - This suggests a burden of proof fallacy, where Jack is shifting the burden of proof onto Nick. Also, this is a type of argument from ignorance, which is not explicitly covered in the provided defective argument types but closely relates to false assumptions.

4. **Nick: No.**
   - Nick’s answer is direct and honest but doesn't address the burden of proof fallacy. He doesn't have evidence to disprove an essentially unfalsifiable claim.

5. **Jack: Then I do.**
   - Jack concludes that because Nick cannot disprove the claim, it must be true. This conclusion is clearly based on a faulty reasoning.

Upon thorough analysis, the primary defective argument types are:

- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** Jack's reasoning that because Nick cannot disprove the claim, it must be true, is inconclusive. The absence of disproof does not equate to proof.
- **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language):** The term “unicorns” is used in a fantastical context which could be argued as misleading or designed to intentionally obscure meaningful discussion.
- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):** Jack's claim implicitly assumes there are only two possibilities: either Nick can prove the unicorns do not exist, or they do exist. This excludes other possibilities, such as the claim being meaningless or inherently unprovable.

In summary, Jack's argument can be identified as defective due to the following types:
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the given dialogue reveals the use of inconclusive reasoning, misleading language, and incomplete enumeration in Jack's argument.
