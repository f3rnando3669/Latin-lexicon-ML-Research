For 
Your request involves identifying the defectiveness of the given argument using specific codes for different types of argumentative defects. The argument you presented is:

"No one should believe our dear lady Senator who has had an adulterous relationship."

For this argument, the defect type can be identified as:

- **Ad Hominem (Attacking the Person)**: This type of flaw involves attacking a person's character or personal traits instead of engaging with their arguments or the actual issue at hand.

Since your provided list of defective argument types does not directly cover Ad Hominem, I will also consider if any of the provided types could approximately match the argument's deficiency:

<IR> - Inconclusive Reason:
- This argument could be considered to have an inconclusive reason. The personal attack on the Senator does not necessarily connect logically to the truth or falsity of her statements or policies.

<DEP> - Ambiguous Language:
- The phrase "dear lady Senator" might be using ambiguous or sarcastic language to undermine the Senator, but this is a weaker alignment with the given defective argument definitions.

None of the other types directly match the nature of an ad hominem attack. Therefore, the closest match based on your provided definitions would be:

**<IR> - Inconclusive Reason**

This marks the argument as defective because it relies on attacking the Senator's character rather than providing a logically sound reason why she should not be believed in her professional capacity.
