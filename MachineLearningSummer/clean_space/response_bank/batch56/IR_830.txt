For 
In the argument presented, Jamila discredits Xavier by attacking his character, mentioning that he smokes and cheated on reading quizzes. This type of argument is known as an ad hominem attack, where the focus is placed on irrelevant personal traits or actions of an individual rather than the issue or argument at hand.

While none of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>) you defined explicitly label ad hominem attacks, this situation might be closest to <IR> (Inconclusive Reason). This is because Jamila provides reasons unrelated to Xavier's capabilities or policies as a class president to argue that he does not deserve to win, which do not provide a conclusive reason for her claim.

Thus, applying IDAA (Identify Defective Argument Application):

Jamila has committed the fallacy of <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) by attacking aspects of Xavier's personal life that do not directly pertain to his suitability as a class president, thus failing to provide a conclusive reason why he shouldn't win.
