For 
The argument "I didn’t steal your pen—I borrowed it" could be classified under <DEP> (Defective Argument: Ambiguous Language). 

**Reasoning:**
The statement uses the words "steal" and "borrow," which can be interpreted in various ways depending on the context. The ambiguity lies in the overlapping connotations of these terms; while "steal" implies taking something without permission and with no intention of returning it, "borrow" generally implies having permission and intending to return it. Without clear context or agreement on the definitions of these terms in the specific situation, the argument's effectiveness is hindered by its reliance on potentially ambiguous language.
