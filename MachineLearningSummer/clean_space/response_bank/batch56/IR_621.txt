For 
Applying the IDAA (Identify, Define, Analyze, Address) framework to the given statement:

**Identify:** The argument to be analyzed is: "You say that we have exaggerated the problem with global warming, but have you even considered how much more the homeless suffer when temperatures soar?"

**Define:** The given argument could potentially contain one of the defective argument types defined earlier. The argument seems to shift the focus from whether global warming is exaggerated to the suffering of the homeless during high temperatures.

**Analyze:** 
1. **Defective Type:** This argument is an example of <IR> (Inconclusive Reason). The reason given (homeless suffering from heat) does not directly address whether the problem of global warming is exaggerated.
2. It potentially introduces a red herring, a rhetorical technique where the speaker brings up an irrelevant issue to divert the discussion.

**Address:**
To address this defective argument:
1. Acknowledge the concern for the homeless: "It's indeed tragic that the homeless suffer more when temperatures soar."
2. Redirect the focus back to the original issue: "However, this does not necessarily provide evidence that the problem of global warming is exaggerated or not. Can we look at scientific data or expert opinions to address the question of whether global warming is being exaggerated?"

By identifying the shift in focus (type <IR>), defining it as an inconclusive reason, analyzing its impact on the argument, and addressing it respectfully, we maintain a clear, logical discussion focused on the initial claim.
