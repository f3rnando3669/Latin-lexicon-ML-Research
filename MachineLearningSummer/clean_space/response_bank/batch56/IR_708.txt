For 
It appears that "<IDAA>" represents a set of defective argument types (though its specific definition isn't provided).

Let's examine the argument:

"He can't be a great athlete; he didn't adopt the stray dog on the street."

To determine which defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>) apply:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument does not make a broad generalization from a specific instance related to adopting stray dogs.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not provide a list that is incomplete, so this does not apply.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided (failing to adopt a stray dog) is unrelated to the conclusion (being a great athlete), making the connection unjustified and therefore inconclusive. So, this argument falls under <IR>.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: There is no causal relationship established or even suggested between adopting a stray dog and being a great athlete, so this does not apply.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The argument does not restate the same proposition with different wording for emphasis, so this does not apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument does not assume a consensus on the matter of adopting stray dogs being related to athletic greatness, so this does not apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This argument does not use ambiguous language; it is clear but logically flawed in its reasoning.

Thus, the defective argument type that applies to "He can't be a great athlete; he didn't adopt the stray dog on the street" is:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
