For 
To apply defective argument analysis (IDAA) to the statement "We should abolish the death penalty. Many respected people, such as Imran Kader, have publicly stated their opposition to it," we need to identify whether the argument employs any of the defined defective argument types. Let's examine the argument for possible defects:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** Generalization involves making a broad statement based on a limited set of examples. This defect does not appear to apply here, as the argument does not generalize from specific instances.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Incomplete Enumeration occurs when an argument lists instances or cases but fails to consider all relevant possibilities. The argument cites respected people opposing the death penalty but does not claim to present an exhaustive list or address all viewpoints. Therefore, this defect does not seem appropriate.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This occurs when the reasons given do not logically lead to the conclusion. The argument essentially says, "Respected people oppose the death penalty; therefore, we should abolish it." The endorsement by respected people does not necessarily provide a conclusive reason for abolishing the death penalty, making this defect possibly relevant.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This type of defect arises when a causal claim is not adequately supported by evidence. Since the argument does not provide a causal claim or reasoning related to causes leading to the conclusion, this defect does not apply.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This occurs when an argument repeats the conclusion itself as a purported reason. The statement does not repeat the conclusion as a reason, so this defect does not apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This defect arises from assuming a consensus where none has been established. By referring to respected people like Imran Kader as representing the opposition, there might be an implicit assumption of a general consensus against the death penalty, suggesting that it appeals to authority rather than establishing broad consensus. Therefore, this defect might be relevant.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** Ambiguous language involves using terms that are vague or can be interpreted in multiple ways. The argument does not appear to hinge on ambiguous terminology.

Based on this analysis, the primary defects in the argument appear to be:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The support provided (opinions of respected people) does not logically compel the conclusion (abolishment of the death penalty).
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The argument might be assuming a broader consensus based on the opinions of a few respected people, without establishing this consensus rigorously.

So, applying IDAA to the statement points out the following defective argument types:

### Argument: "We should abolish the death penalty. Many respected people, such as Imran Kader, have publicly stated their opposition to it."
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**

These defects highlight that the argument relies too heavily on the authority of a few individuals without providing robust, logically conclusive reasons for the proposed action.
