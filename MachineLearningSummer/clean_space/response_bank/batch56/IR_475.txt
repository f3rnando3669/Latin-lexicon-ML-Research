To apply the definitions of defective argument types (DAs) to the statement "Animals tread softly upon the earth without shoes, so all other living beings should follow suit," we can analyze it through the lens of these argument types. Here’s a detailed application:

**Argument Analysis for: "Animals tread softly upon the earth without shoes, so all other living beings should follow suit."**

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument type refers to overgeneralizing based on insufficient evidence or specific cases. The statement does overgeneralize, as it assumes all animals without shoes serve as an appropriate model for all living beings, which is not necessarily true (e.g., many living beings have different needs and contexts).

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This refers to drawing conclusions from an incomplete set of instances. By focusing on animals that tread softly without shoes, the argument ignores animals that don't fit this pattern or any other living beings like humans for whom shoes might be necessary for various reasons.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This type of argument involves drawing conclusions based on reasons that do not adequately support the conclusion. The premise that animals tread softly without shoes does not sufficiently lead to the conclusion that all living beings should follow suit. The reasoning is incomplete and doesn't account for many other factors.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This involves attributing a cause without sufficient grounding. The argument might be seen as suggesting a causality (animals tread softly because they have no shoes) irresponsibly, ignoring physiological differences that make this causal attribution unwarranted.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This is the unwarranted repetition of the same proposition. The given argument doesn't seem to repeat a proposition but tries to derive a new directive (all living beings should do something) from an observed phenomenon (animals tread softly).

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This refers to assuming consensus or agreement without evidence. Here, it assumes that because animals (seemingly unanimously) tread softly without shoes, there is a consensus that all living beings should do the same, a consensus that is unsubstantiated.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This involves using unclear or ambiguous terms. The phrase “tread softly” could be interpreted in different ways, leading to ambiguity. Furthermore, "all living beings" is very broad and could mean different things in different contexts, making the statement ambiguous.

**Primary Defective Argument Types Identified**:
1. Generalization (<G>)
2. Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
3. Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
4. Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
5. Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
6. Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)

Thus, the statement "Animals tread softly upon the earth without shoes, so all other living beings should follow suit" serves as an example of multiple defective argument types, particularly <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.
