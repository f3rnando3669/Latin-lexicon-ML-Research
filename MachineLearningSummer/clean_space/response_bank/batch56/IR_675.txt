For 
The argument provided, "A real video game would include set goals!" can be analyzed with the given defective argument types, but the specific application of <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Application) requires recognizing which type of defective argument it fits. Let's examine the argument:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - **Definition:** Making a broad statement based on a limited number of cases or a specific instance.
   - **Application:** The argument makes a broad claim about what constitutes a "real video game" without considering the diversity and variety within video games. This is a generalization because it suggests that all real video games must have set goals, excluding other types of video games that may not have rigid goals yet still be considered real by many players.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - **Definition:** Providing a list of options or reasons that is incomplete or ignores important possibilities.
   - **Application:** The statement implies that having set goals is a necessary criterion for a game to be real without acknowledging other important characteristics that define video games. This is an incomplete enumeration because it suggests only one aspect (set goals) as defining, ignoring many other features games might have.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - **Definition:** Providing evidence that does not conclusively support the claim.
   - **Application:** The statement asserts a conclusion without providing sufficient reasoning to support why set goals are essential for a game to be considered real. There is no backing for the necessity of set goals.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - **Definition:** Asserting a causal relationship without adequate evidence.
   - **Application:** The argument might imply that set goals cause a game to be "real," but without sufficient evidence, this causal relationship is unfounded (if we interpret goals as causal to the "realness").

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - **Definition:** Repeating a proposition without adding any new information or reasoning.
   - **Application:** If the statement were part of a larger argument that repeatedly insists on set goals being necessary without new supporting points, it could be faulty repetition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - **Definition:** Assuming consensus or common agreement without evidence.
   - **Application:** The argument presumes that everyone agrees that set goals are a criterion for a real video game without providing proof of this consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - **Definition:** Using vague or ambiguous terms.
   - **Application:** The phrase "real video game" could be considered ambiguous as it is open to interpretation. What constitutes a "real" video game might vary widely among different people or within different contexts.

Given these categories, the argument "A real video game would include set goals!" could primarily be categorized as a **Generalization (<G>)** because it makes a sweeping claim about what defines a real video game without considering the variety within the medium. It could also be seen as involving **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** and **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)** due to its narrow focus and potentially unclear terminology.
