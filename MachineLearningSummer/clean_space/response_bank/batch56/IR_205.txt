Based on the definitions of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, and DEP), the statement "We cannot listen to John’s opinion on global warming because he is a tree hugger" can be analyzed for any inherent defects.

<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Attributes. Let’s apply this to the given statement:

1. **Generalization (G):** This statement does not seem to be making a broad generalization based on a small sample or limited evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This argument is not specifying a list or options, so there's no incomplete enumeration present.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason given for dismissing John's opinion ("because he is a tree hugger") is not a valid or conclusive reason. It assumes that being a "tree hugger" disqualifies someone from having a valid opinion on global warming without logically explaining why. This appears to fit the description of providing inconclusive reason.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** There is no cause-and-effect relationship being claimed here, so this does not apply.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The argument does not repeat a proposition in a faulty manner.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The statement does not assume consensus or imply agreement among a group, so this does not apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** "Tree hugger" is a pejorative term that might be seen as ambiguous in its implications, but in this context, it is more of a label than intrinsically ambiguous language.

Given this analysis, the defective argument present in the statement "We cannot listen to John’s opinion on global warming because he is a tree hugger" most closely aligns with:

<IR> - Inconclusive Reason: The reason provided for dismissing John's opinion is not logically sufficient or valid. The term "tree hugger" does not inherently invalidate someone’s opinion on global warming.
