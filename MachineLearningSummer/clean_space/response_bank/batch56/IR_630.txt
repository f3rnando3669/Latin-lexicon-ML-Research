To apply the identified defective argument type system (IDAA) to the statement "Dr. Bloom cannot be a competent marriage counselor because he is divorced," we need to analyze the reasoning flaw present in the argument.

The argument implies that Dr. Bloom's ability to be a competent marriage counselor is invalidated by his own divorce. This reasoning type can be classified as:

**Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**  The argument assumes that being divorced necessarily means one cannot offer competent advice on marriage. However, it fails to consider other potential factors that contribute to Dr. Bloom's qualifications, such as his education, experience, or methodologies. It oversimplifies the situation by attributing competency or the lack thereof to a single factor (marital status).

While another analysis might consider the argument as a type of Ad Hominem, thus diverting from the established defective argument types:

**Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** best fits this example within the provided definitions, since it directly relates to incomplete or selective reasoning.
