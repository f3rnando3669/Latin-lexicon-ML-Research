For 
<IDAA> can be defined as a defective argument type called **Improper Demand for Absent Assumption**. In this case, it refers to the fallacy of shifting the burden of proof onto an opponent, requiring them to disprove your claim instead of providing evidence to prove it yourself. This fallacy is also known as **Shifting the Burden of Proof** or **Argumentum ad Ignorantiam** (appeal to ignorance).

Here’s how it applies to the given statement:

**Statement:** "Falsely requiring an opponent to 'disprove' instead of you 'proving' your argument."

**Defective Argument Type:** <IDAA> – **Improper Demand for Absent Assumption**

**Explanation:** The argument employs <IDAA> because it improperly demands that the opponent disprove the claim, rather than the claimant providing necessary evidence to substantiate the argument. This tactic inappropriately shifts the burden of proof and can lead to the mistaken notion that a claim is true simply because it hasn't been conclusively disproven.
