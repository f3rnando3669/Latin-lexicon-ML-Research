For 
< IDAA > stands for Identify Defective Argument Application. Given the definition and application process, let’s analyze the statement: 

"You tell me it's unpatriotic to cheat on federal income tax reports. Well, you should know. You've never once listed your huge bonuses."

Here’s how this can be broken down and analyzed:
1. **Identify the Argument:**
   - The first part of the statement: "You tell me it's unpatriotic to cheat on federal income tax reports."
   - The rebuttal: "Well, you should know. You've never once listed your huge bonuses."

2. **Determine the Defective Argument Type:**
   - The rebuttal diverts from the argument about the patriotism of cheating on tax reports to an ad hominem attack, focusing on the accused behavior of the individual making the initial statement (the alleged failure to list bonuses).

3. **Categorize the Defective Argument:**
   - This argument can be classified under the category of <IR>, Inconclusive Reason. The fact that someone did not list their bonuses on their tax report does not conclusively address whether it is unpatriotic to cheat on tax reports. Instead, it distracts from the validity of the initial claim by launching an attack on the individual's own actions.

Therefore, applying <IDAA>:

The defective argument type in "You tell me it's unpatriotic to cheat on federal income tax reports. Well, you should know. You've never once listed your huge bonuses." is <IR> Inconclusive Reason. The original claim about patriotism remains unaddressed and the response fails to provide a valid reason to counter it.
