To properly apply the labeling of defective argument types from the given definitions to the statement "They are dangerous militants out to destroy our peaceful way of life," we need to analyze it and determine which of the specified defective argument types, if any, apply.

1. **Generalization (G):** This argument might be making an overgeneralized assertion about a group of people being "dangerous militants." It's painting with a broad brush, implying all members of a certain group are militants and have malicious intentions.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** If the statement fails to account for non-militant members of the same group, it could be seen as an instance of incomplete enumeration. However, this appears less obviously applicable compared to generalization.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The claim that the group is out to destroy a "peaceful way of life" may be an example of inconclusive reasoning, as it does not provide evidence to substantiate such a strong assertion.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** If "destroy our peaceful way of life" is predicated on insufficient evidence or a weak causal linkage, it could fall under this category, but this is not immediately clear from the statement alone.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** If the statement was part of a larger argument where the same unfounded or unsupported assertion was repeated, it would fall here. As a standalone statement, this seems less applicable.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** If the statement assumes that everyone agrees on the categorization of the group as "dangerous militants," without basis, this could be relevant. This doesn't seem immediately clear from the statement either.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The terms "militants" and "peaceful way of life" could be considered ambiguous or loaded language designed to provoke a strong emotional response.

Given these points, the most immediately applicable defective argument types to the statement "They are dangerous militants out to destroy our peaceful way of life" would be <G> (Generalization) and <DEP> (Ambiguous Language). 

We could label the statement as follows:

**<IDAA G, DEP>** They are dangerous militants out to destroy our peaceful way of life.
