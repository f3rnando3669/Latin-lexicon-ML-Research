Sure, let's analyze the argument provided using the defined defective argument types:

**Argument Provided:**
"Student: Hey, Professor Moore, we shouldn't have to read this book by Freud. Everyone knows he used cocaine."

Applying <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Types):

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The student's argument generalizes that because Freud used cocaine, his work or ideas should be dismissed entirely without proper consideration of the content. This is a generalization about the value of his work based on a single characteristic of his personal life.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The student implies that "everyone knows" Freud used cocaine, which suggests an incomplete enumeration of reasons why Freud's work might be valuable or not valuable. The student fails to consider other factors that might support the reading of the book.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The reason given is inconclusive because the use of cocaine by Freud does not logically lead to the conclusion that his book should not be read. It doesn't provide a strong enough basis to dismiss his work on those grounds alone.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The argument lacks a sufficient causal basis to connect Freud's personal use of cocaine to the academic value of his work. There is no direct causative link established in the argument that invalidates Freud's contributions to psychology.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - Not applicable in this context, as there isnâ€™t a repeated proposition or redundancy in the student's statement.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - The student presumes a consensus ("Everyone knows") without providing evidence of such a consensus. This is problematic because it assumes agreement without substantiation.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - There is some ambiguity in "Everyone knows he used cocaine" because it is not clear how this universally impacts the worthiness of reading his book. The statement might rely on a presumption of the implications of cocaine use that are not explicitly clarified.

In summary, the student's argument exhibits multiple defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and possibly <DEP>. These fallacies weaken the overall argument made by the student.
