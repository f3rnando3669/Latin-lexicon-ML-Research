It appears there’s a typo with “<IDAA>” which hasn’t been defined in your list of defective argument types. Assuming you intend to identify and apply the appropriate defective argument types from your list, the given argument can be analyzed as follows:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The statement "There is definitely a link between autism and the vaccines given to toddlers" is a generalization that may not be supported by comprehensive and robust evidence. Using a single source or a limited number of studies to make a broad claim about all vaccines and autism illustrates this fallacy.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - By relying on "a Wikipedia entry" and stating "numerous studies," the argument fails to consider the full range of scientific literature available on this topic, particularly the wealth of studies that have shown no link between vaccines and autism. The use of an incomplete set of references leads to an unsupported conclusion.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The argument assumes a definitive link between vaccines and autism based on unspecified studies mentioned in a Wikipedia entry. The reasoning is inconclusive as it lacks detail about the quality, scope, and findings of these studies.

4. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - The speaker presumes that the studies mentioned in Wikipedia represent a consensus or authoritative position, without verifying the credibility and broader acceptance of these studies within the scientific community.

Considering the identified defective argument types, the original statement can be seen as flawed due to issues of generalization, incomplete enumeration, inconclusive reasoning, and presumptuous consensus.
