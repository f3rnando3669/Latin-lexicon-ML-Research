To analyze the argument presented using the provided definitions for defective arguments, let's break down Lisa's statement: "We must raise tuition to cover the cost of new books. Otherwise, the school library will close!"

Here’s the full breakdown:
- Lisa is asserting that the only way to cover the cost of new books is by raising tuition, implying a dire consequence if this is not done, which is the closure of the school library.

Given the definitions provided:

1. **Generalization (G):** This does not seem to be a case of generalization, as Lisa isn’t making a broad generalization from a few instances.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This argument might fit this category as Lisa is not considering all possible options to cover the cost of new books. For example, she could explore other fundraising options, grants, or budget adjustments.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This doesn’t seem to apply, as Lisa's argument does have a conclusion, albeit under the stress of a potentially false dichotomy.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This appears applicable because Lisa isn’t providing enough evidence to support the causal relationship between not raising tuition and the library closing.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Lisa’s argument doesn’t seem to repeat the same proposition in a faulty manner.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Lisa doesn’t appear to be assuming a consensus on the solution.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The language doesn’t appear to be ambiguous; her statement is quite direct.

Given these analyses, the most fitting defective argument type is:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Lisa fails to consider alternative ways to raise funds, implying that raising tuition is the only possible solution.

And,

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Lisa doesn’t provide enough evidence to sufficiently support her claim that the only outcome of not raising tuition is the closure of the library.

Thus, this argument is an example of both **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
