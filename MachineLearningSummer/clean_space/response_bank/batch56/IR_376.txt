For 
<IDAA> stands for Identify Defective Argument Applied.

Let's apply IDAA to the statement: "There's no point listening to you. Everybody knows you're just a little do-gooder."

1. **Identify the Argument Type:**
   - **Generalization (G):** This defective argument makes a broad statement based on limited evidence.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This defective argument leaves out critical examples or evidence.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This defective argument presents reasoning that doesn't logically follow.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This defective argument claims a causal relationship without sufficient evidence.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This defective argument repeats a proposition as if it's an argument without providing new evidence.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This defective argument relies on assumed unanimous agreement without evidence.
   - **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** This defective argument uses vague or ambiguous language that obscures the meaning. 

2. **Analyze the Given Statement:**
   - "There's no point listening to you.": This statement flatly rejects the value of the interlocutorâ€™s perspective without providing a valid reason.
   - "Everybody knows you're just a little do-gooder.": This statement appeals to a supposed consensus (that "everybody knows"), and uses a potentially derogatory label ("little do-gooder") without clarifying why this label would make the person's arguments invalid.

3. **Identify the Defective Argument:**
   The given statement primarily displays components of:
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The phrase "everybody knows" implies a consensus without providing evidence that such a consensus exists.
   - **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The term "little do-gooder" is somewhat ambiguous and derogatory, failing to provide a clear reason why this attribute would make the person's arguments invalid.

Therefore, the primary defective arguments present in the statement are **<FU>** (Presumptuous Consensus) and **<DEP>** (Ambiguous Language).
