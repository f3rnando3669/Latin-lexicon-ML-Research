For 
The argument "TikTok is popular among teens because so many of them use it" can be analyzed using the defective argument types you've defined.

In this case, the argument appears to exhibit the defect of Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), since it essentially restates the proposition that TikTok is popular among teens by referencing the fact that many teens use it, which is a circular reasoning pattern.

So we can apply <RR>:
- TikTok is popular among teens. (<RR>)
- Reason: Because so many of them use it. (<RR>)

The argument is using the phenomenon of teens using TikTok to justify its popularity among teens, which simply repeats the proposition in different words without providing new, independent evidence.
