For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Types Applied to an Argument.

Let's apply <IDAA> to the argument: "Because 90% of college students polled had no debt, education costs are not a problem."

### Breakdown:
1. **Generalization (G):**
   - This argument may be overgeneralizing the situation of all college students based on the subset of students polled. It's possible the poll does not represent the entire population of college students.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - The argument only considers one statistic (90% of students polled had no debt) without considering other factors or data points such as the variation in school costs, scholarships, financial aid, and who the poll respondents were.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - The conclusion drawn (education costs are not a problem) is not logically required by the premise (90% of students polled had no debt). There could be various reasons those students have no debt that do not apply to the general population.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - There's a lack of causal link established between the statistic and the conclusion. The fact that 90% of polled students had no debt does not necessarily mean that education costs are not problematic, as it does not account for how costs and debts are managed or mitigated by different supports or individual circumstances.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - This does not seem to apply directly here as there's not a repetition of the proposition in the argument.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - The argument presumes a consensus from the statistic without verifying broader agreement or considering the complexity of the issue. It presumes that the 90% figure is definitive proof and skips over any need for further validation.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - "Education costs are not a problem" is an ambiguous statement. What does "not a problem" mean? For whom? In what contexts? The argument doesn't clearly define these terms.

### Conclusion:
The argument "Because 90% of college students polled had no debt, education costs are not a problem" can be identified as containing the following defective argument types: 
- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)** 

By applying <IDAA>, it's evident that multiple deficiencies exist in the structure and logic of this argument.
