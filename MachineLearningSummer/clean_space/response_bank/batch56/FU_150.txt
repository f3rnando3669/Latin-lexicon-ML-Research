Applying the <IDAA> (Identify, Define, Apply, and Assess) approach to the phrase "Vietnam War—America, love it or leave it," we would proceed as follows:

**1. Identify the defective argument:**

The phrase "Vietnam War—America, love it or leave it" can be identified as containing a defective argument type. To determine which type(s), we need to analyze the statement closely.

**2. Define the relevant defective arguments:**

Here are the definitions of the defective argument types provided:

- <G> Generalization: Drawing a broad conclusion from a small or unrepresentative sample.
- <FE> Incomplete Enumeration: Failing to consider all relevant possibilities or options.
- <IR> Inconclusive Reason: Providing an argument that does not adequately support the conclusion.
- <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis: Claiming a causal relationship without adequate evidence.
- <RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition: Repeating a proposition with insufficient evidence to make it sound convincing.
- <FU> Presumptuous Consensus: Assuming that a consensus exists without proper validation.
- <DEP> Ambiguous Language: Using vague or unclear terms.

**3. Apply the definitions:**

The phrase "America, love it or leave it" suggests a dichotomy—either one must fully support the country (and by implication its involvement in the Vietnam War) or leave it. This does not allow for nuanced positions such as loving the country but opposing its policies, or advocating for change from within.

- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: This argument fails to consider all the relevant possibilities. It only presents two extreme options without acknowledging other valid positions one might hold.
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**: The phrase "love it" is ambiguous and can be interpreted in various ways. What constitutes "loving" one's country is not clearly defined and can be subject to different interpretations.

**4. Assess the argument:**

This argument is flawed mainly because it forces a false dichotomy (<FE>) and utilizes ambiguous language (<DEP>). By presenting only two choices, it oversimplifies a complex issue and excludes viable middle-ground perspectives. Additionally, the term "love it" is not clearly defined, which can lead to misunderstanding and misrepresentation of people's true stance on the matter.

In summary, the argument "Vietnam War—America, love it or leave it" is defective due to **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration** and **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**.
