For 
The argument "Alley ate a slice of pizza for dinner and a few hours later she had a fever. Therefore, pizza causes fevers." can be identified and analyzed using the following defective argument types (IDAA):

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The conclusion that pizza causes fevers is drawn based on a single incident without sufficient evidence. Correlation doesnâ€™t imply causation, and there could be many other factors that caused the fever.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument fails to consider other possible causes of the fever. There is no exhaustive examination of alternatives (e.g., a virus, another food item, environmental factors).

Together, these defective argument types highlight the weaknesses in the causal claim made by the argument.
