In the context provided, `<IDAA>` doesn't have a definition yet. Thus, I'm unable to specifically apply <IDAA> directly to the argument. However, I can analyze the argument using the provided defective argument types and point out which ones apply.

The argument in question is: "Harmful atheists favor cloning, so cloning is wrong."

Let's break this down:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument makes sweeping generalizations about atheists and cloning without sufficient evidence. It implies that because harmful atheists favor cloning, cloning is inherently wrong, but it doesn't consider the views of other groups or provide specific reasons why cloning is wrong.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument doesn't consider other relevant factors or groups who might support or oppose cloning. It only focuses on 'harmful atheists' without a full enumeration of all possible viewpoints or evidence.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided ('harmful atheists favor cloning') is not conclusive enough to establish that cloning is morally wrong. Just because a particular group supports something doesnâ€™t necessarily make it right or wrong; the reasoning is insufficient to conclude the moral status of cloning.

4. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The term "harmful atheists" is ambiguous and subjective. It's unclear what makes someone a "harmful atheist," and this vague language undermines the argument's clarity and impact.

If we were to define <IDAA> as, say, "Identification of Defective Argument Application," we could use it as a method to classify this argument as having multiple defects from the above categories: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, and <DEP>. Applying this to the given argument:

**<IDAA>: "Harmful atheists favor cloning, so cloning is wrong" is defectively constructed due to being a Generalization (G), exhibiting Incomplete Enumeration (FE), presenting an Inconclusive Reason (IR), and employing Ambiguous Language (DEP).**
