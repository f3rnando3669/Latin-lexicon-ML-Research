For 
<IDAA> refers to Identifying Defective Argument Attributes. Let's identify which defective argument types apply to the statement, "Eating five candy bars and drinking two sodas before a test helps me get better grades. I did that and got an A on my last test in history."

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - This statement is making a broad conclusion based on a single instance. Just because the person did well on one test after eating candy bars and drinking sodas doesn't mean that this will always be effective.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The argument does not consider other factors that could have contributed to the good grade, such as prior studying, familiarity with the test material, or natural aptitude for the subject.

3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - The statement assumes a causal relationship between eating candy bars/drinking sodas and getting better grades without enough evidence to establish a causal link. It could be that the good grade was due to other reasons.

4. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The reasoning is inconclusive because there is no conclusive evidence to prove that consuming candy bars and sodas directly leads to better grades.

Thus, the statement demonstrates defects in the argument types of Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), and Inconclusive Reason (<IR>).
