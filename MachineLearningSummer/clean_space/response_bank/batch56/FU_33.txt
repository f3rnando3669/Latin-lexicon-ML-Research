For 
A defective argument type called <IDAA>, which stands for Implicit Definition Argument Analysis, can be applied to the statement: "If you were a true American you would support the rights of people to choose whatever vehicle they want."

Analysis:
1. **Identification of Implicit Definition**: The statement implicitly defines what it means to be a "true American." The phrase "true American" is loaded with assumptions and carries connotations that aren't explicitly stated.

2. **Examination of Assumptions**: The statement assumes that being a "true American" necessarily involves supporting certain kinds of freedoms, in this case, the freedom to choose any vehicle. This is an implicit definition that conflates national identity with a specific stance on individual freedoms.

Type of Defective Argument:
- **<DEP>: Ambiguous Language**: The phrase "true American" is ambiguous and carries different meanings to different people. It provides an emotional appeal rather than a clear and reasoned argument.
- **<FU>: Presumptuous Consensus**: The argument presumes that there is a consensus on what being a "true American" entails without providing evidence or supporting rationale for this consensus. It presumes agreement on a controversial or debatable definition.

Therefore, the statement "If you were a true American you would support the rights of people to choose whatever vehicle they want," can be critiqued using <DEP> for its ambiguous use of "true American" and <FU> for assuming an unsupported consensus on what constitutes a "true American."
