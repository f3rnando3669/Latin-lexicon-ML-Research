When analyzing the statement "Within every man's heart is the desire to be free." using the defined defective argument types, we can identify potential flaws in reasoning. Here's the step-by-step identification and analysis:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument appears to commit overgeneralization by claiming that every man has the same internal desire to be free. The diversity of human beings and their hopes, desires, and psychological makeup means it's unlikely true to say every individual shares this exact same desire. 

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement does not account for possible exceptions; it presumes that there is no man who does not desire freedom. By not providing exhaustive reasoning or sufficient evidence to cover all cases, it is making an incomplete enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The assertion is broad and lacks definitive evidence. There is no proof or clear reasoning given to substantiate the claim that every man desires to be free internally, making the reason inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Without presenting enough evidence, the statement provides an insufficient causal basis for the idea that a desire for freedom is universally present in every man's heart. The causation (desire for freedom being inherent in every man) isn't supported by empirical or logical evidence in the argument.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: If the argument was attempting to prove its point by merely restating similar points repeatedly without offering new evidence or logical support, it would be committing this fallacy. However, the statement as it stands isn't repeating the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The claim may implicitly suggest that this is a widely accepted belief or a common consensus without providing justification. Just because it sounds plausible or agreeable does not make it truth by consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The phrase "within every man's heart" could be interpreted in various ways. Does it mean literally every man's heart, or is it more metaphorical? The statement's lack of clarity regarding 'heart' and 'desire to be free' introduces ambiguity, making it hard to evaluate its truth value.

Given these analyses, the application of IDAA (Identification and Diagnosis of Argumentative Aberrations) points out the multiple flawed reasoning types associated with the statement: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), and Ambiguous Language (DEP). The statement is overly broad, lacks evidence, is vague, and relies on unproven generalities.
