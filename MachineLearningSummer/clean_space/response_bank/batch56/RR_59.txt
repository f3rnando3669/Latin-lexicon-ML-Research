For 
To analyze the argument "marijuana shouldn’t be legalized because it wasn’t socially acceptable" and identify which defective argument types might be at play, I'll break it down and apply the defective argument types defined:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This would involve taking a limited set of instances and drawing a broad conclusion from them. However, the argument doesn't explicitly make a generalization based on a limited set of examples.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This refers to presenting an argument by only mentioning some supporting cases while ignoring many others. In this case, the statement offers a single reason (social acceptability) without considering other factors like medical benefits, economic impact, or individual freedoms.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This describes an argument that offers a reason which doesn't necessarily lead to the conclusion. The societal acceptability of marijuana in the past isn't a strong or necessary reason to determine its legality in the present. Values and norms change over time, making this reason inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This defective argument type points to an inadequate link between cause and effect. However, the argument in question doesn’t propose a causal relationship—it stops at social acceptability as a reason.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This involves repeating a proposition without adding new evidence or supporting logic. The argument doesn’t display this type as it's not reiterating its central claim multiple times.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This type assumes consensus without supporting evidence that such a consensus exists. The argument doesn’t explicitly state that everyone agrees marijuana was socially unacceptable, so it’s not an instance of presumptuous consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This involves using unclear or vague terms. The phrase "socially acceptable" can be ambiguous as social acceptability varies greatly among different groups and times. 

Based on this analysis, the defective argument types applied to "marijuana shouldn’t be legalized because it wasn’t socially acceptable" are:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument presents only one factor (social acceptability) without acknowledging other important considerations.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason given (past social acceptability) is not necessarily conclusive for the present-day legality argument.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The term "socially acceptable" is vague and open to interpretation.
