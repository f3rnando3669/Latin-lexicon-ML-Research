To address the task using the defined defective arguments, we can look at the given statement: "But this here research must go on. This space effort must go on," and determine which logical fallacy it might be an example of.

The statement asserts the necessity of continuing the research and space effort without providing substantial reasoning or evidence. It repetitively states that the effort "must go on" but does not offer a justification for why it should continue.

The statement uses repetition to assert a proposition without providing any supporting argument or evidence, which aligns with the definition of <RR>.
