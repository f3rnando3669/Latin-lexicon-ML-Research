It looks like you want me to apply an "Identifier for Defective Arguments and Analysis" (IDAA) to the provided persuasive technique. Here's an analysis of how this technique fits a defective argument type:

"A persuasive technique used in media messages that appeals to the 'everyone is doing it' mentality."

This persuasive technique aligns closely with the defective argument type called **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.

Given this reasoning, we can identify the persuasive technique as:

**"Everyone is doing it" mentality (FU: Presumptuous Consensus)**
