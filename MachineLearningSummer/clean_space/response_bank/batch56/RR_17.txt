For 
To identify and apply the defective argument types (IDAA = Identify Defective Argument Type(s) and Apply) to the statement "The reason everyone wants the new 'Slap Me Silly Elmo' doll is because this is the hottest toy of the season!", we need to analyze the argument for possible fallacies based on the definitions provided:

- **Generalization (<G>):** Making a broad and hasty conclusion based on limited evidence.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Ignoring alternatives or not considering all relevant options.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Providing a reason that does not fully support the conclusion.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Assuming a cause-and-effect relationship without sufficient evidence.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Repeating the claim in a different form instead of providing evidence.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Assuming that a belief is true because many people believe it.
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** Using vague or ambiguous terms that can be interpreted in multiple ways.

### Identifying and Applying Defective Argument Types:

1. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - The statement claims people want the doll because it is the hottest toy of the season. This essentially repeats the initial claim ("everyone wants the toy") without providing independent evidence. The structure is circular, and the reason provided is not an external justification but a restatement of the conclusion.
   - Example: "Everyone wants the new doll because it is the most wanted toy." The definition is inverted but essentially the same idea repeated.

2. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - The argument assumes that the toy's popularity (as the "hottest toy of the season") is sufficient justification for everyone wanting it. This presumes consensus without proving that the toy's popularity is a valid reason for its desirability.
   - Example: "This is the hottest toy of the season" is used to imply that its popularity agrees with any usefulness or quality implicitly.

### Conclusion:
The argument "The reason everyone wants the new 'Slap Me Silly Elmo' doll is because this is the hottest toy of the season!" primarily employs two defective argument types: 
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (**<RR>**)** because it restates the proposition without new evidence.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (**<FU>**)** because it relies on the popularity of the toy to justify its desirability presumptuously.
