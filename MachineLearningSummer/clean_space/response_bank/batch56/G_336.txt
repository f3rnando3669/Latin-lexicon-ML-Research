For 
Applying <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Attributes) to the statement "If we let our child out of his room, eventually he will want to leave the house, and will end up on the street. If he is walking around on the street then he will be snatched up by a stranger and sold into slavery in a remote region on the World," we can break it down to identify the defective arguments involved:

1. **Slippery Slope Fallacy (Implied by Multiple Defective Argument Types)**
    - The progression of events from letting the child out of the room to being sold into slavery is highly improbable and not sufficiently justified with evidence or logical connection. 

2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
    - The causal links between each step are weak or lacking substantial evidence. There is no concrete basis to claim that letting the child out of the room will escalate to such an extreme outcome.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
    - The fear that the child will eventually be snatched and sold into slavery is based on speculative reasoning rather than a logical, evidence-based conclusion.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**
    - The argument seems to repeatedly emphasize an exaggerated sense of danger without new evidence or reasoning, leading to a conclusion based on repetitive assertion rather than solid argumentation.

Therefore, the argument presented is approximately identified as containing the defective argument types <WCB>, <IR>, and <RR>.
