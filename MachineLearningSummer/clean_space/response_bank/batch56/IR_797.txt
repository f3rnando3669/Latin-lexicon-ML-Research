Let's break down the argument presented by the politician using the framework of defective argument types:

**Original Argument:**

"Taxes are too hard to understand. The government must be tricking us and taking our money. We need to simplify our taxes!"

**Defective Argument Types Applied:**

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - "Taxes are too hard to understand."
   - Here, the politician makes a sweeping general statement about taxes being hard to understand, without providing specifics or acknowledging that different individuals may have varying levels of understanding about taxes.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - "The government must be tricking us and taking our money."
   - This conclusion is drawn from a limited set of possibilities without considering other explanations, such as the complexity of the tax system being due to the need to address diverse financial situations.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - "The government must be tricking us."
   - The conclusion that the government is tricking us is not sufficiently supported by the premises. Complexity in taxes does not necessarily imply deceitful actions by the government.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - "The government must be tricking us and taking our money."
   - The argument implies causation (complex taxes are caused by government trickery) without adequate evidence to establish that causation.

5. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - "Taxes are too hard to understand."
   - The statement is vague and lacks specificity. What constitutes "hard to understand" can vary widely among individuals, leading to multiple interpretations.

By identifying these defective argument types, we can see that the politician's argument lacks clarity, fails to consider multiple perspectives or explanations, and does not provide sufficient evidence to support the claims being made.
