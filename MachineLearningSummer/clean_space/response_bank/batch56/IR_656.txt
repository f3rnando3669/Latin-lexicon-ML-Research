The argument form illustrated in the provided statement appears to pertain to the concept of an inexhaustible demand for answers, where an opponent continuously raises new objections despite adequate responses to previous ones. This phenomenon can be indicative of a defective argument type that could be characterized as shifting goalposts or perpetual suspicion.

To apply a term from the defined defective argument types, let's create one for this specific situation:

Define <IDAA> to be a defective argument type called Inexhaustible Demand for Answers.

Hereâ€™s how we can analyze the provided statement using the <IDAA> designation:

**Identification of Defective Argument Type:**
1. **Issue A has been raised, and adequately answered.**
2. **Issue B is then raised, and adequately answered.**
3. **.....**
4. **Issue Z is then raised, and adequately answered.**
5. **Despite all issues being adequately answered, the opponent refuses to concede or accept the argument.**

This pattern demonstrates the unwillingness of the opponent to accept satisfactory answers and continually raising new questions. This can be characterized as:

**<IDAA>:** This defective argument type describes a scenario where an opponent refuses to accept an argument no matter how many times their questions or objections are addressed adequately. Instead, they continue to raise new issues in an endless series of demands for answers, which ultimately prevents any conclusion from being reached.

Applying <IDAA>:
The opponent is engaging in <IDAA> by persistently raising new issues even though each has been adequately addressed, indicating an inexhaustible demand for answers.
