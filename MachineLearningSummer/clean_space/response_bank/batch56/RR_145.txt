For 
<IDAA> stands for "Identify Defective Argument Application."
Let's analyze the given argument: "Students should not be allowed to park in lots now reserved for faculty because those lots should be for faculty only."

To apply <IDAA> to this argument, we need to identify if any of the defined defective argument types apply:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument does not seem to be making a broad generalization based on limited evidence.
  
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not list multiple reasons or causes, it’s focused solely on one proposition.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason given—"because those lots should be for faculty only"—is essentially restating the conclusion without providing additional supportive evidence or reasoning, so this may indicate an Inconclusive Reason.
   
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is no causal relationship being drawn here that could be insufficiently supported.
   
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This seems to apply because the argument repeats the initial claim as its reason, making it circular. It states that faculty lots should be for faculty because they are for faculty.
  
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument does not presume consensus or appeal to an assumed agreement without supporting evidence.
   
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language used is clear and specific; it does not use ambiguous or vague terms.

Therefore, the defective argument types <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition) both apply to the given statement. This is because the argument’s reason is essentially a repetition of the conclusion and does not provide any new or substantive support for its claim.

### Revised Analysis:

The defective arguments identifiable in the statement "Students should not be allowed to park in lots now reserved for faculty because those lots should be for faculty only" are:
  
- <IR>: Inconclusive Reason
- <RR>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition
