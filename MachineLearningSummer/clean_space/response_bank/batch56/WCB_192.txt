Sure! The argument mentioned is:

"Giving 10% of your income to the Church will free a child’s soul from Limbo into Heaven, so give your money!"

Let's apply the defective argument types (<IDAA>) to analyze this argument:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The argument assumes that giving 10% of one's income will have the significant and specific spiritual consequence of freeing a child's soul from Limbo into Heaven. This is an overly broad generalization without sufficient specific evidence to support the claim universally.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The argument simplistically lists the action of giving money as the sole condition for the significant spiritual outcome. It does not consider or enumerate other potential factors or actions that could play a role in the spiritual process it describes.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The reasoning provided ("giving 10% of your income to the Church will free a child’s soul from Limbo into Heaven") lacks conclusive evidence and appears to be based on faith or belief rather than logical or empirical proof.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - The claim presents a causal relationship between donating money and an ethereal outcome without sufficient evidence to establish such a causal basis. There is no demonstrated link between monetary donations and the spiritual outcome described.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - The argument does not explicitly involve repetition of the same proposition in different terms. Hence, <RR> does not seem to apply directly in this instance.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - The argument might be seen as presumptuous by assuming that the audience will accept the spiritual authority's consensus without questioning, suggesting that such a belief is universally acknowledged, which might not be the case for everyone.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - The term "free a child's soul from Limbo into Heaven" can be seen as ambiguous since "Limbo" and "Heaven" can have different interpretations across various religious beliefs. It relies on specific spiritual and doctrinal concepts that may not be clearly defined or universally accepted.

In summary, the principal defective argument types that apply to this argument are Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), and Ambiguous Language (<DEP>).
