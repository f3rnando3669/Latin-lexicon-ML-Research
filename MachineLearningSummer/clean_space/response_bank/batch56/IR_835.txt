Certainly! Let's analyze the argument "What is The Texas Sharpshooter?" using each of the defective argument types defined:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - Example: "One Texan shot a bullseye multiple times by first shooting random shots and then drawing a target around the tightest cluster of hits. Hence, all Texans are excellent marksmen."
   - Analysis: This statement extends the specific case of one individual to all Texans without sufficient evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - Example: "There are many ways to explain the shooter's accuracy: luck or skill. It’s definitely skill."
   - Analysis: This statement considers only two explanations for the shooter’s accuracy, omitting other possible explanations like practice or statistical fluke.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - Example: "The shooter must be skilled because he hit the target."
   - Analysis: This statement assumes the reason for hitting the target is solely skill, without considering other factors like chance or manipulation.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - Example: "The shooter’s accuracy caused by drawing the target after shooting proves the shooter’s skill."
   - Analysis: This suggests a causal link between the drawn target and the shooter's skill that isn’t substantiated because the target was manipulated post-fact.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - Example: "The accuracy must be due to skill because he is accurate. He is accurate because of his skill."
   - Analysis: This is a circular argument that repeats the proposition without providing new evidence.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - Example: "Everyone around here agrees that the shooter is an excellent marksman."
   - Analysis: Assuming the consensus is true without evidence doesn’t provide a valid ground for the conclusion.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - Example: "The shooter's performance was extraordinary."
   - Analysis: The term "extraordinary" is subjective and vague, which can lead to different interpretations without clear evidence or definition provided.

In conclusion, the concept of the "Texas Sharpshooter" fallacy can be demonstrated using these defective argument types to show how flawed reasoning can emerge from drawing conclusions based on manipulated patterns or incomplete information.
