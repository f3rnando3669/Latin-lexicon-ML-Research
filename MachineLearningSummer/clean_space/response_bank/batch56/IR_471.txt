For 
To apply the concept of "Identifying Defective Argument Types <IDAA>" to the statement "politicians coin names to cast blame," we need to examine this assertion and determine if it falls under any of the defective argument types defined above.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This is a broad statement about politicians as a group without specific evidence for each individual case.
   - **Application**: The statement "politicians coin names to cast blame" could be seen as a generalization because it suggests that all politicians engage in this behavior without providing specific instances or evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This involves listing examples but failing to consider all pertinent cases.
   - **Application**: The statement does not list examples, so it does not fit the definition of Incomplete Enumeration outright.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This occurs when the provided reasons do not conclusively lead to the stated conclusion.
   - **Application**: The statement doesn't provide reasons, it asserts something as fact directly, so it's not an Inconclusive Reason.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This happens when causation is claimed without adequate evidence or a clear cause-and-effect relationship.
   - **Application**: The statement implies a causal relationship ("coin names" to "cast blame") without providing evidence for such a causative link, which makes it fit as Insufficient Causal Basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This is the repetition of a statement in an attempt to substantiate it without providing new evidence.
   - **Application**: The statement does not repeat itself, so it does not fit this category.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This entails assuming that a statement is true based on an alleged consensus without verifying the consensus itself.
   - **Application**: The statement does not cite any consensus, so it does not fit here either.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This occurs when the language used is vague or ambiguous, leading to multiple possible interpretations.
   - **Application**: The phrase "coin names to cast blame" could be seen as somewhat ambiguous because it could mean different things depending on interpretation. However, this ambiguity alone isn't strong enough to classify it solely under Ambiguous Language without further context.

### Conclusion
The statement "politicians coin names to cast blame" primarily fits the definition of **Generalization (<G>)** as it makes a broad claim about all politicians without specific evidence. It also fits **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** as it suggests a causative effect without providing evidence. Finally, a slight argument could be made for **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**, as the exact meaning of "coin names" could be interpreted in various ways, but this is minor compared to the other issues.
