For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application. 

To apply <IDAA> to the statement, we need to assess the argument within it and identify any defective argument types present.

Statement: "Yes, we have safety issues in our factory. But we work really hard to make a good product. They sell so well!"

Let's break this down:

1. **Generalization (G)** is not clearly applicable here as no broad generalizations are made about a group based on limited evidence.
  
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** is also not relevant because the statement does not appear to be listing items or possibilities incompletely.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** could be applicable, as the argument seems to divert from addressing the safety issue directly by stating how hard the company works and how well the products sell. This doesn't conclusively address the safety concern.
   
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** doesn't apply directly here since there is no causal relationship being improperly established or argued.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** is not relevant since the statement isn't repeating a proposition to try and establish it as true.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** does not apply here, as there is no assumption that there's a consensus without proper evidence of such consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)** might be partly relevant if "working really hard" and "selling well" are seen as ambiguous language meant to distract from the core issue of safety.

Therefore, the statement can primarily be characterized by:

<IR> - Inconclusive Reason: By bringing up how hard they work and how well their products sell, the argument shifts focus away from the core issue of safety and fails to address it in a conclusive way.

<DEP> - Ambiguous Language: The terms "work really hard" and "sell so well" could be seen as vague distractions that are irrelevant to the safety issues being discussed.
