The argument presented can be categorized under the defective argument type called "Inconclusive Reason" <IR>.

Let's break down why this is the case:

Argument: "We need to stop allowing colleges to increase tuition every year. The next thing we know, it's going to cost more to attend college for one semester than it is to buy a new home!"

This argument suggests that if tuition fees continue to increase, attending college for one semester will eventually become more expensive than purchasing a new home. However, this conclusion is not conclusively supported by the premise. It commits the slippery slope fallacy, implying that unchecked tuition increases will lead to an extreme and unlikely scenario without providing sufficient evidence or reasoning to support this progression.

Thus, it fits the definition of an Inconclusive Reason <IR> since it draws a broad and somewhat implausible conclusion without a solid causal link or sufficient supporting evidence.
