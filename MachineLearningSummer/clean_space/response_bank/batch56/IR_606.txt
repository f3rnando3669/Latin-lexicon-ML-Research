For 
To apply the defect argument analysis annotation (IDAA) to the statement "You didn't do your homework, did you?" and determine which defective argument type it falls under, let's examine the statement based on the defined defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G):** The statement does not attempt to generalize a view from a particular case.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The statement does not provide a list or enumeration of factors and then fail to be complete.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The statement does not present a reason that fails to conclusively support a conclusion.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The statement does not attempt to establish a cause-and-effect relationship with insufficient evidence.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The statement does not involve the repetition of the same proposition in a faulty manner.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The statement does not imply that there exists a consensus to support an assumption or belief.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The statement is clear in its language and not ambiguous.

Given the definitions and the nature of the statement, it aligns most closely with the defective argument type **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**. 

The statement "You didn't do your homework, did you?" implies an assumption that the homework was not done, seeking a confirmation that might pressure the respondent into agreement, presuming consensus without presenting evidence or reasons.

Thus, the defective argument type of "You didn't do your homework, did you?" is an example of **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**.
