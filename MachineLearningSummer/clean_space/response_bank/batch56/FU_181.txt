<IDAA>: Identification and Diagnosis of Argument's Defective Aspect

In the given argument, "I guess I should buy my 12-year-old daughter an iPhone. Everyone at her new school has one, and I want her to fit in with the other kids," two specific defective arguments can be identified:

**<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:**
The argument implies that because everyone at the daughter's new school has an iPhone, it is necessary for the daughter to have one as well. This presumes that the consensus or behavior of the majority is a sufficient reason to follow the same course of action without further examination of whether it's the right decision for the individual case.

**<G> Generalization:**
The argument assumes that all kids at the new school having an iPhone means that the daughter must also have one to fit in. This is a form of generalization because it may not account for individual differences and other factors that contribute to fitting in at school.

By identifying and diagnosing these aspects, it becomes clear that the argument relies on potentially faulty reasoning that could benefit from a more considered analysis of the situation, considering additional factors rather than simply following the perceived norm.
