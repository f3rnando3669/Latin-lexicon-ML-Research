For 
<IDAA> stands for Identify the Defective Argument and Annotate.

Let's analyze the statement and identify if any defective argument types defined fit the context.

Statement: "If we allow cadets to apply for encampment online, we’d save everyone lots of headaches. 
REPLY: No. We’ve always made cadets apply using a paper form."

1. The reply to the suggestion of allowing cadets to apply online simply states that they have always used paper forms without addressing the potential benefits of switching to online applications. This immediately suggests a defective argument. 

2. Defective Argument Identified:
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>): The reply essentially restates the status quo ("we’ve always made cadets apply using a paper form") without providing a reason against changing and without addressing the initial claim of saving headaches through online applications.

3. Annotations:
   - The initial suggestion: "If we allow cadets to apply for encampment online, we’d save everyone lots of headaches."
   - The reply: "No. We’ve always made cadets apply using a paper form." This dismisses the suggestion by relying on tradition and past methods rather than addressing the merits of the proposed change.

So, we apply the defective argument type <RR> to the argument:

"If we allow cadets to apply for encampment online, we’d save everyone lots of headaches. 
REPLY: No. We’ve always made cadets apply using a paper form. <RR>"

By identifying the defective argument in this context, we can see that the reply doesn't effectively counter the suggestion but rather falls into the trap of faulty repetition of the existing method without valid reasoning.
