For 
Let's identify the defective arguments in the statement "You must obey the law, because it's illegal to break the law." using the provided defective argument types.

The statement is: "You must obey the law, because it's illegal to break the law."

This is essentially a form of circular reasoning where the proposition is supported by a restatement of the proposition itself.

Applying IDAA (Identify Defective Arguments Applied Analysis):

- The statement "You must obey the law" is followed by "because it's illegal to break the law," which does not provide an independent or new reason but rather repeats the premise in a different form. This is a characteristic of circular reasoning.

- Therefore, the defective argument type that best applies here is as follows:

  <RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition: This is because the reason given ("it's illegal to break the law") merely restates the proposition ("You must obey the law") without adding new information or a genuine reason for the obligation to obey the law.

So, applying IDAA to the statement results in identifying the defective argument type as: <RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition.
