For 
The argument "Sugar is an essential component of the body...a key material in all sorts of metabolic processes," neglects the fact that it is glucose (blood sugar) not ordinary table sugar (sucrose) that is the vital nourishment. This argument can be identified as containing a defective argument type called Ambiguous Language (DEP).

Hereâ€™s how it applies:

- **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The term "sugar" is used ambiguously in the argument. It conflates glucose (a necessary substance for bodily functions) with sucrose (common table sugar), leading to confusion and potential misinformation. The term "sugar" is not specific enough and can mislead someone into thinking that consuming table sugar is essential for metabolic processes, when in fact, it is glucose that plays this crucial role.

So, the defective argument type <DEP> (Ambiguous Language) applies to this situation.
