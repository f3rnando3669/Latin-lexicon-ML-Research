It looks like you've assigned types of defective arguments, but it seems like there's a potential mismatch with the request to apply "IDAA." Since IDAA isn't defined among the defective argument types, I'm assuming you might've meant to apply one of the defective arguments listed.

Given the context, applying <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus) seems appropriate for Don's argument. Here's the reasoning:
- Don asserts that "If you drink alcohol, it will kill any virus you might have."
- When Tony asks for evidence, Don dismisses the need for it, claiming "It is common sense."

This qualifies as a Presumptuous Consensus because Don is treating a specific and possibly complex issue (the effect of drinking alcohol on viruses) as something that can be understood without evidence, relying instead on an assumed general agreement or "common sense," which might not be shared or justified.

Thus, the applied defective argument type is:
- <FU> Presumptuous Consensus

So, the full analysis would be:
- Don: If you drink alcohol, it will kill any virus you might have.
- Tony: What evidence do you have to support that? 
- Don: I donâ€™t need evidence. It is common sense.
- Analysis: <FU> - Don assumes that his claim is self-evident or widely accepted without providing supportive evidence, relying on an implied consensus instead.
