Sure, let's apply the definitions for Defective Argument Analysis (IDAA) to the statement:

"The university committee for student discipline investigated all engineering tests for the past five years, and they found no evidence of cheating. We thus declare that no cheating has taken place during those five years."

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - This argument states that because no instances of cheating were found in the tests reviewed, no cheating has occurred at all. This might be considered a generalization because the committee assumes that the tests they reviewed are fully representative of all tests taken, without considering the possibility of undetected cases or problems with the investigation methods.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The argument may exhibit incomplete enumeration if the committee did not review all possible sources of evidence for cheating (e.g., oral exams, assignments, online submissions). By only reviewing engineering tests, they could be missing other instances of cheating.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - Simply finding no evidence does not conclusively prove that no cheating has occurred. The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. The committee might have overlooked instances of cheating, or the cheating may have been conducted in such a way that it wasn't detectable by their methods. Thus, the reasoning is inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - The argument assumes a causal link between the investigation and the actuality of cheating (or the lack thereof). There may not be a sufficient causal basis to claim that the investigative methods were able to detect all instances of cheating accurately.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - This argument does not seem to fall into this category, as there is no repetitive element in the proposition reinforcement or redundancy.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - If the declaration that no cheating has taken place is assumed to be universally accepted based on the committeeâ€™s findings without further scrutiny or validation, then it assumes a consensus that may not exist.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - The language used in the statement does not appear to be ambiguous since the terms are clearly defined and direct. The ambiguity usually would derive from vague or unclear terms, which does not seem to be the case here.

Based on the application of the defective argument types to this scenario, the strongest issues appear to be Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), and Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>). These four categories highlight the primary weaknesses in the argument's claim that no cheating has taken place over the past five years.
