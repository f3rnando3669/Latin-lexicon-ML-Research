For 
Given the scenario where a shopkeeper suspects theft and immediately concludes guilt upon seeing an empty gum wrapper, the fallacy committed by the shopkeeper is an example of an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.

### Analysis:
Inconclusive Reason (IR) occurs when the evidence presented does not sufficiently support the conclusion drawn. Here:

- The shopkeeper's conclusion (You are guilty of stealing) is drawn from insufficient evidence (an empty gum wrapper).
- The empty gum wrapper does not conclusively indicate theft.

Thus, the shopkeeper's reasoning is flawed because the presented evidence (the gum wrapper) does not logically or conclusively lead to the conclusion of theft. The argument lacks depth and fails to account for alternative explanations or additional evidence that would be necessary to substantiate the claim of theft.
