For 
Applying the specified defective argument types, "IDAA" seems to be unspecified in the context provided, but assuming it stands for "Identify Defective Argument Applied", we need to identify which defective argument types apply to the statement: "He can't be a great athlete; he cheated on his wife."

1. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
   - The argument presents a personal flaw (cheating on his wife) to make a judgment about an unrelated domain (his athletic ability). Cheating on one's spouse does not logically affect or provide a reason regarding his proficiency in athletics.

2. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**
   - The term "great athlete" is vague and can be interpreted in various ways. Does it mean high performance in sports, good sportsmanship, or both? The ambiguity in the term "great athlete" can lead to different conclusions depending on the interpretation.

The statement does not seem to fit the other defective argument types listed:

- **Generalization (<G>):** This does not involve making a general statement based on insufficient evidence.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This argument does not involve neglecting possibilities or alternatives.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This isn't about providing weak evidence for a causation.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The statement is not repetitively arguing the same proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** There is no invocation of popular or collective belief without evidence.

Thus, "He can't be a great athlete; he cheated on his wife" primarily involves **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**.
