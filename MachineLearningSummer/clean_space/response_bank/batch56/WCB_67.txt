Applying your defined argument types to the statement "Right when I sneezed, the power went off. I must've caused the outage.": 

This argument can be identified as having an Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).

Explanation:
The statement "Right when I sneezed, the power went off. I must've caused the outage." is an example of a fallacy where the individual (Zohaw) attributes a causal relationship between two events based solely on their temporal proximity. This is a classic post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy, where it is assumed that since one event (the sneeze) happened right before another (the power outage), the first event must have caused the second. There is no sufficient causal evidence provided to support this claim.
