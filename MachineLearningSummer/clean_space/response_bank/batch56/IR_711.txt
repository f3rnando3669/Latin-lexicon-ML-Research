Sure! Applying what you've outlined under the abbreviation <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Application) to the statement "We're going to protest and not get in trouble because Mr. Iglesias said it's okay," we can analyze it as follows:

This argument appears to rely heavily on the authority of Mr. Iglesias, implying that his approval alone is sufficient to guarantee that they won't get into trouble. This raises potential issues regarding the completeness and conclusiveness of the reasoning. 

Relevant defective argument types could include:

- <IR> (Inconclusive Reason): The fact that Mr. Iglesias said it's okay does not necessarily mean there won't be any trouble. His statement might not take into account various consequences or the views of other authorities or governing bodies.

- <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration): The statement seems to rely on a single source of permission (Mr. Iglesias) without considering other factors that could influence whether or not they will get into trouble. There could be other relevant authorities, rules, or potential consequences that are being overlooked.

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the argument would indicate that it suffers from at least two defective argument types: <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration).
