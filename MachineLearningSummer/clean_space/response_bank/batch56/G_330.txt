For 
<IDAA>: Identify Defective Argument Attributes

Let's apply the identification of defective argument attributes (IDAA) to the statement: "First we handed out I-pads, now we use Quizizz, next we'll have robot subs!"

1. **Defective Argument Type**: 

   **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This argument appears to rely on a sequence of events without adequate evidence to support that the next event (robot subs) will logically follow from the previous ones (handing out iPads and using Quizizz). It assumes a slippery slope without concrete reasoning.

2. **Detailed Analysis**:
   
   - **Generalization (G)**: Not applicable here as it is not suggesting a broad statement extrapolated from specific instances.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This isn't about failing to consider all possibilities; rather, it follows a supposed progression without proper basis.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: While there is a reasoning presented—claiming that an escalation in technology use will lead to robot substitutes—it's more logically flawed rather than merely inconclusive.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This could also apply because it assumes a causation link between using advanced technologies and the advent of robot substitutes without sufficient evidence.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There's no sign of suggesting a consensus from others in this short argument.
   - **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language isn’t particularly ambiguous; it's the logical structure that is defective.

Given these points, the most fitting defective argument type for the provided statement would be the **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** as it relies on a sequence of events purported to lead logically to another outcome without a solid basis. Another possible consideration is **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

Hence, the statement "First we handed out I-pads, now we use Quizizz, next we'll have robot subs!" primarily exhibits **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** and can also exhibit aspects of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
