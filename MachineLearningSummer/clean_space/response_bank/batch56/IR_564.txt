For 
The argument presented is: "I can't trust that doctor's advice on how to raise my child. He has never been a mother."

To apply <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Application), let's analyze the statement to determine which, if any, defective argument types apply:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This does not seem to be a case of overgeneralizing a small sample to a wide statement.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not claim to list all possible reasons or evidence, so this does not fit.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided (the doctor's lack of personal experience as a mother) is deemed insufficient to conclusively support the claim that the doctor's advice is untrustworthy, as it ignores the possibility that the doctor might have relevant expertise or knowledge despite not being a mother.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: No causal relationship is being incorrectly drawn here.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The argument does not repeat a proposition to assert validity.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument does not claim that a consensus exists.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The language in the claim is clear and unambiguous.

The best fit for categorizing the defective argument in this case is:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The argument is flawed because it relies on an inconclusive reason to dismiss the doctor's advice. The fact that the doctor has not been a mother does not necessarily mean their advice on child-rearing is not trustworthy, as their professional training and experience can provide a valid basis for their advice.

Therefore, the defective argument type is identified as **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**.
