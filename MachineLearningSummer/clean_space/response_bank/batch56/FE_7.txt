For 
It seems there was a small typo, as <IDAA> is not defined among the defective argument types you have listed. However, based on the list you've provided, let's analyze how each of these defective argument types could relate to the phrase "This is an example of":

1. **Generalization <G>**: Assuming the phrase is used to make a broad statement based on a limited example, it would be a generalization. For instance, "This is an example of how all kids are lazy," if based on a single observation, would be a defective generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>**: If the phrase is used as part of a list that is not exhaustive, it could represent incomplete enumeration. For example, "This is an example of reasons why the project failed" without listing all the reasons.

3. **Inconclusive Reason <IR>**: If the phrase is used to support a claim without sufficient evidence, it can be an inconclusive reason. For instance, "This is an example of why we can't trust any politicians" based on isolated incidents.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>**: If the example given is used to suggest a cause without sufficient basis, it would fall under this category. For example, "This is an example of how eating rice makes people unhealthy" without considering other factors affecting health.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>**: If the phrase repeats an argument without adding new information or evidence, it would be a faulty repetition. For instance, "This is an example of why we need to do better" if it simply reiterates a previous unfounded claim.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>**: If the phrase assumes agreement without verifying that consensus actually exists, it would be presumptuous. For example, "This is an example of what we all know to be true," assuming everyone agrees without evidence.

7. **Ambiguous Language <DEP>**: If the phrase or the example used is ambiguous and leads to multiple interpretations, it would be categorized as ambiguous language. For instance, "This is an example of something interesting" without specifying what makes it interesting.

As for "Apply <IDAA> to 'This is an example of'", there's a lack of clarity due to the undefined term <IDAA>. If you meant to apply the concept of any of the listed defective argument types, affirm which one or provide additional context.
