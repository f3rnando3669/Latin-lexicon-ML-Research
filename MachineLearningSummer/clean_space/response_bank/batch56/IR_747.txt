For 
<IDAA> typically stands for "Identify the Defective Argument Type". Let's go through the argument presented by Janice and attempt to classify it using the given defective argument types.

Argument: "Janice just lost her goldfish and so asks you to give her the benefit of the doubt."

This argument seems to be appealing to emotions rather than presenting a logical reason for why she should be given the benefit of the doubt.

Here are the options:
- Generalization
- Incomplete Enumeration
- Inconclusive Reason
- Insufficient Causal Basis
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition
- Presumptuous Consensus
- Ambiguous Language

However, none of these types perfectly correspond to the appeal to emotion found in Janice's argument. Given the provided defective argument types, this argument most closely resembles an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. This is because the emotional appeal of losing her goldfish is not a logically relevant reason to necessarily grant her the benefit of the doubt in other matters.

Therefore, applying <IDAA> to this argument, the fallacy committed is **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**.
