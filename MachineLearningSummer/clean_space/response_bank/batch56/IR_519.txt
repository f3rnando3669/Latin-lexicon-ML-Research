IDAA stands for "Identify Defective Argument Application." Let's go through the given argument and identify the defective arguments according to the types defined.

**Argument:**

"In a study designed by a famous academic to test the effects of pleasant imagery on motivation, employees were shown images of baby animals and beautiful nature scenes for their first five minutes at work.

Amazingly, results showed a 10 percent leap in profits in the first quarter and record earnings over the course of a year. So, showing employees pleasant images is a great way to increase their motivation and improve productivity."

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The argument makes a broad claim that showing employees pleasant images is a "great way" to increase motivation and improve productivity based on this single study. This is a type of generalization because it takes limited data from one study and applies it broadly without considering other variables and contexts.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The argument does not consider other factors that could have contributed to the increase in profits and productivity. It is incomplete because it enumerates (lists) only one factor (pleasant images) without exploring other potential influences.

3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The jump from showing pleasant images to a 10 percent increase in profits assumes a direct causal relationship without sufficient evidence to support this causation. There could be many other causal factors at play that the argument does not address.

4. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The reasoning given is inconclusive because it does not provide strong, irrefutable evidence that the pleasant images were the sole or primary cause of the increased profits and productivity. The outcome could be due to other unexamined factors.

5. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - Words like "great way" and "amazing results" are somewhat vague and subjective, leaving room for different interpretations. This may mislead readers into attributing more significance to the study's outcomes than objectively warranted.

**Application of Defective Arguments:**

- **Generalization (<G>):** The claim that pleasant images are a "great way" to increase motivation and productivity is an overgeneralization based on a single study.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument fails to enumerate or consider other potential factors contributing to the improved outcomes, such as market conditions or managerial changes.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The argument assumes causality between showing pleasant images and increased profits without presenting enough evidence to establish this causal link conclusively.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The argument's reasoning is inconclusive, as it does not prove that the pleasant images were the decisive factor in the reported business improvements.
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** The use of subjective and ambiguous terms (e.g., "great way," "amazing results") can obscure the actual effectiveness and significance of the study's findings.

In summary, the provided argument exhibits several defective argument types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), and Ambiguous Language (<DEP>). Each issue undermines the overall strength and reliability of the argument.
