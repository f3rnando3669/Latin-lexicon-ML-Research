For 
The argument given in the example is a classic instance of the defective argument type known as **Ad Hominem**. In an Ad Hominem argument, rather than addressing the issue at hand, the speaker attacks the person making the argument. 

In this particular case, instead of engaging with the claim `You should never break traffic laws`, the respondent shifts focus to the speaker's history of speeding tickets, thereby attacking the speaker's character or behavior rather than the validity of the claim itself.

So, the correct application of your defective argument notation to this example would be:

<Ad Hominem>
