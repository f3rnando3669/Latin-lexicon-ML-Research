The statement given is: "Braden, you drive a beat-up car from the 1980s. For this reason, we can never allow you to be a lifeguard at the community pool."

In this case, the argument utilizes a form of reasoning that seems to make a big leap from the condition of Braden's car to his qualifications as a lifeguard. This can be seen as a type of reasoning flaw.

Applying the IDAA (Identify Defective Argument Application), you can break this down as follows:

1. **Identify the Premise and Conclusion:**
   - Premise: Braden drives a beat-up car from the 1980s.
   - Conclusion: Because of this, he should not be allowed to be a lifeguard.

2. **Determine the Defective Argument Type:**
   - The argument assumes causation or a connection between the condition of Braden's car and his ability to perform as a lifeguard, without providing sufficient reasoning or evidence for this connection.
   
3. **Classify the Argument:**
   - This case fits into the category of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The premise (the condition of the car) does not logically support the conclusion (Braden's ability or qualification to be a lifeguard).

Therefore, the argument should be classified as <WCB>, Insufficient Causal Basis.
