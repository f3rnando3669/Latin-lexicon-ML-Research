For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Types and Analyzing Appropriateness. 

Let's apply <IDAA> to the argument "Why shouldn't I gossip about Laura Jane? You know she talks about us every chance she gets."

1. **Identifying Defective Argument Types:**
   - The argument presented suggests that it is justified to gossip about Laura Jane because she engages in gossip herself.

2. **Analyzing Appropriateness:**
   - This argument seems to rely on the principle of retaliation or reciprocal behavior. However, the validity of such justification is often questionable and can be seen as morally or logically unsound.

Upon analyzing the argument, it falls under the defective argument type called **Faulty Repetition of Proposition** (RR), also known as "two wrongs make a right." The argument is fallacious because it presumes that engaging in an unethical behavior (gossip) is justified simply because another person (Laura Jane) does the same. The repetition of the wrongdoing does not provide a sound reason and thus lacks an adequate ethical or logical basis for the behavior.

Therefore, in summary:
- **Defective Argument Type**: <RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition
- **Explanation**: The argument attempts to justify gossiping through reciprocal behavior but fails to establish legitimate ethical or logical grounds.
