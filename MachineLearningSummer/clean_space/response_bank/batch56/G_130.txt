For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Applied) to the statement "He has smoked cigarettes his entire life and he doesn't have lung cancer. Therefore smoking doesn't cause lung cancer," let's analyze it for potential defective argument types from the list you provided:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument takes one specific case and generalizes it to apply to all cases. This is a form of hasty generalization. Just because one person who smokes does not have lung cancer does not mean that smoking does not cause lung cancer in general. However, this is not explicitly defined in our defective arguments list, but it is worth noting as a logical fallacy that is closely related.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not provide a complete set of instances. By focusing on only one person who smokes and doesn't have lung cancer, it ignores the multitude of cases where people who smoke do develop lung cancer. This fits <FE>.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasoning given is inconclusive and does not logically support the conclusion. The fact that one individual does not develop lung cancer does not prove a lack of causality due to the complexity and multitude of influencing factors. This can be associated with <IR>.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument lacks a sufficient basis to establish cause. Simply observing one individual case does not provide enough evidence to dismiss the well-studied causal relationship between smoking and lung cancer. This matches <WCB>.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This argument type involves an incorrect repetition of a claim to support itself. The statement provided does not seem to repeat a proposition to argue its point. Therefore, <RR> is not applicable.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This would involve an assumption that consensus or popular belief proves the argument. The statement provided does not base its claim on presumed consensus. Therefore, <FU> is not applicable.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This argument type involves unclear or vague terminology which obscure the argument. The statement does not contain ambiguous language. Thus, <DEP> does not apply.

Based on this analysis, the primary defective argument types in this statement are:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**

Thus, identifying the defective argument types applied:

**<IDAA> <FE>, <WCB>, <IR>**
