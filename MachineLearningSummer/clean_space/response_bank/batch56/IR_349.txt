<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Amenability.

In the given argument, "We have no evidence that the Illuminati ever existed. They must have been so clever that they destroyed all the evidence," the following defective argument types can be identified:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The argument jumps to a conclusion without sufficient evidence. The absence of evidence for the existence of the Illuminati is used to suggest that they must have destroyed all evidence, which is an unfounded leap in logic.

2. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument presumes a consensus that if there is no evidence, it must be because the evidence was deliberately destroyed by the Illuminati. This establishes an unwarranted assumption based on a presupposed agreement rather than objective facts.

By applying <IDAA>, we can address the flaws in this argument by recognizing that the lack of evidence is not a definitive indicator of the Illuminati's existence or their efforts to destroy evidence. The conclusion requires more substantial reasoning and evidence.
