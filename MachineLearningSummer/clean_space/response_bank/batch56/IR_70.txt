For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application. Given the argument "I shouldn't have to pay for my parking ticket. There are far more dangerous offenses people commit. They should have to pay," let's apply <IDAA> to identify and categorize any defective arguments present.

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument suggests that because there are more dangerous offenses, a parking ticket should not be paid. This is an incomplete enumeration as it fails to recognize that laws and penalties cover a range of offenses, each with its own justification. The existence of more dangerous offenses does not negate the need for penalties for lesser offenses, such as parking violations.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The argument presents a reason that is not directly relevant to the specific case of the parking ticket. The fact that more dangerous offenses exist does not provide a solid rationale for why a parking ticket should be exempt from payment obligations. This makes the reasoning inconclusive.

3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument implies a causal relationship between the existence of more dangerous offenses and the inappropriateness of paying a parking ticket. This is insufficient because it lacks any direct causal link between the two situations.

To summarize, the argument can be identified as containing Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), and Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).
