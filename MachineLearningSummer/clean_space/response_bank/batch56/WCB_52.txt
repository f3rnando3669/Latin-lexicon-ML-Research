For 
To analyze the given argument using the provided defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, and <DEP>), let's break down and closely inspect each part of the argument:

### Argument Breakdown
- **Premise 1 (P1):** A sedentary lifestyle contributes to obesity.
- **Premise 2 (P2):** People have become more sedentary in the last few decades.
- **Conclusion (C):** Therefore, the rise in obesity can be fixed by people getting more exercise.

### Applying <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Analysis Types)
1. **Generalization (G):** 
   - This does not seem to be a problematic generalization. The statement that a sedentary lifestyle contributes to obesity is generally supported by research.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** 
   - The conclusion seems to assume that getting more exercise is the sole solution to fixing the rise in obesity. This overlooks other factors like diet, genetics, and metabolism.
   - Hence, this is an example of **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** because it does not consider all relevant factors contributing to obesity other than exercise.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - The argument does not explicitly present sufficient evidence to claim that an increase in exercise alone would entirely solve the problem of obesity. There are other variables at play.
   - Hence, this could be categorized as **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because while a sedentary lifestyle is certainly a factor, the direct causative solution (i.e., exercise alone) is not conclusively valid without dismissing other contributory factors.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - The argument may appear to have an insufficient causal basis; it implies causality without considering the complex web of causes leading to obesity.
   - This falls under **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** as it oversimplifies the problem and suggests a straightforward cause-and-effect relationship.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - There isn't a repeated proposition used to reinforce the conclusion here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - The argument does not explicitly presume an unwarranted consensus on facts. It uses generally accepted premises regarding the contribution of a sedentary lifestyle to obesity.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - The language does not seem ambiguous. Terms like "sedentary lifestyle," "obesity," and "exercise" are quite specific in this context.

### Conclusion
The argument can indeed be flagged for containing an **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** It assumes exercise is the sole fix for obesity without acknowledging other factors.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** It overstates the conclusiveness of exercise alone solving the obesity problem.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** It simplifies the complex causal links between lifestyle and obesity.

Thus, the argument is defective predominantly under these specified categories.
