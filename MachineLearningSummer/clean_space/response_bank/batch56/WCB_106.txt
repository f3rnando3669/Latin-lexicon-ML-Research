<IDAA>: Identify Defective Argument Attribution

The argument presented in the report can be subjected to a detailed analysis to identify any defective argument types from the ones listed.

### Argument Breakdown
1. **Claim:** The rise in violent offending coincides with the explosion in sales of iPods and other portable media devices.
2. **Evidence:** Violent crime fell from 1993 to 2004, then rose in 2005 and 2006, which coincides with the increased prevalence of expensive electronic devices.

### Identification of Defective Argument Types:
1. **Generalization (G):**
   - The argument implies that the correlation between the rise in iPod sales and the increase in violent crime suggests causation. This is a broad generalization without sufficient evidence.
   
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - The argument assumes a causal relationship between the increase in iPod sales and violent crime rates without providing concrete causal evidence. The rise in violent crime could be due to many other factors.

3. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - The report does not appear to repeat the same proposition without new evidence, so this defective argument type does not seem applicable here.

4. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - The argument does not present any false consensus or presumptions of universal agreement among experts or the general public.

5. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - The language of the argument, such as "more than coincidental" and the suggestive question "Is There an iCrime Wave?" can lead to ambiguity and emotional appeal rather than rational analysis.

### Conclusion:
The argument in the report can be primarily attributed to the defective argument types:
- **Generalization (G)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**

Thus, the report utilizes a combination of generalization, insufficient causal basis, and ambiguous language to imply that the rise in violent crime is linked to the increased use of iPods and portable media devices.
