For 
<IDAA> stands for "Instances of Defective Argument Analysis and Application."

Based on your definitions of defective argument types, let's analyze Walter's response to Wilma:

1. **Initial Argument from Wilma:**
   - Wilma accuses Walter of cheating on his income tax and claims it is wrong.

2. **Walter's Response:**
   - Walter deflects the accusation by pointing out that Wilma also cheated on her income tax last year.

Walter's response does not directly address whether cheating on income taxes is right or wrong. Instead, he shifts the focus back to Wilma's actions from the previous year. This is a type of argument known as "tu quoque" or "you too" fallacy, which can be categorized under **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**, since it does not provide a conclusive reason or refutation to Wilma's point but rather seeks to undermine Wilmaâ€™s stance by highlighting her similar behavior.

Therefore, the defective argument type applied in Walter's response can be identified as:

```markdown
<IR>: Walter's response does not address the ethical nature of cheating taxes but instead tries to discredit Wilma's position by calling out her past behavior.
```
