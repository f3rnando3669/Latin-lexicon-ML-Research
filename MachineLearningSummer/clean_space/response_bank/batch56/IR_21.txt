For 
The argument "Have you stopped cheating on your tests?" falls under an informal logical fallacy known as a loaded question or complex question. This type of question presupposes something that may not be true, putting the respondent in a difficult position regardless of their answer.

Using the provided notation and definitions of defective argument types, this specific case can be categorized as follows:

1. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The question assumes that the respondent has been cheating without providing any evidence or reason to support this assumption.
2. **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: The question presumes consensus or an agreed-upon reality that the respondent has been cheating, which may not be correct.

Therefore, we can apply IDAA (Identify Defective Argument Types) in this manner:

"Have you stopped cheating on your tests?" can be identified as:
- **<IR>** because it is based on an unsupported assumption that the person has been cheating.
- **<FU>** due to the presumption that there's an agreed fact of the person's past cheating which hasn't been established.

To summarize:
Apply <IDAA>:
- "Have you stopped cheating on your tests?" <IR> <FU>
