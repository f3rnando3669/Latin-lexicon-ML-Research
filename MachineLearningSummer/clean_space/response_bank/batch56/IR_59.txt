For 
<IDAA> is not defined in the list of defective argument types provided. However, based on the context of detecting defective arguments, "What drugs were you on?" seems to be an example where a different form of argument flaw might be present.

Let's analyze "What drugs were you on?" using the provided defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument does not generalize; it's a specific question.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This does not seem to be about enumerating without completeness.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The question itself does not provide a reason, so it's not a conclusion or reasoning.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The question could imply a causation (assuming drug use caused behavior), which could be considered under this type if no sufficient basis for that causation is given.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This is not repeating any proposition, so it's not applicable.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This question does make a presumption that drugs were involved, assuming a consensus or fact without evidence.
7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The language could be seen as slightly ambiguous depending on the context, but it generally has a clear though presumptive underlying question.

Given these points, the most applicable defective argument types for "What drugs were you on?" would likely be:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Assuming without sufficient basis that drugs are involved.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Presuming that involvement with drugs is a fact without evidence.

So, we could classify "What drugs were you on?" under:
<WCB> and <FU>.
