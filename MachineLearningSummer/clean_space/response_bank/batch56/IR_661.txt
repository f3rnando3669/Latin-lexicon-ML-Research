For 
Certainly! The statement "Your mom thinks you spend too much time playing video games. You bring up that she spends too much time shopping." can be analyzed to see if it fits into one of the defective argument types we have defined:

Given the list:

- <G> - Generalization
- <FE> - Incomplete Enumeration
- <IR> - Inconclusive Reason
- <WCB> - Insufficient Causal Basis
- <RR> - Faulty Repetition of Proposition
- <FU> - Presumptuous Consensus
- <DEP> - Ambiguous Language

Upon examining the argument, it appears that this statement uses a form of misdirection or deflection to avoid addressing the original concern. This kind of reasoning is typically known as a "tu quoque" argument, which means you're pointing out a supposed hypocrisy to dismiss the criticism without addressing the actual issue. This does not match any of the defined defective argument types exactly, as "tu quoque" is a specific kind of logical fallacy.

However, if we must categorize it within the provided defective argument types, it aligns most closely with:

<IR> - Inconclusive Reason

This is because the fact that your mom spends too much time shopping does not provide a conclusive reason for you to spend too much time playing video games. The reasoning offered is insufficient to properly address the original criticism and diverts from the point at issue.

Thus, applying <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Application) to the statement, the result is:

<IR> - Inconclusive Reason
