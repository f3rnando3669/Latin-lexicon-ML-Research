Applying the <IDAA> framework to the statement "If you do not submit your requirements today, you should drop your classes with Sir Lean." involves identifying and classifying the defective arguments in the statement.

Let's analyze:

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - This statement does not seem to generalize a pattern based on insufficient evidence, so it does not fall under Generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - The statement suggests that the only option if requirements are not submitted today is to drop classes with Sir Lean, without considering other alternatives or solutions (like extensions, penalties, or other arrangements). This can be classified as **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - The statement provides a causal relationship ("not submitting requirements" leading to "dropping classes"), but it lacks a solid reason to justify why not submitting today necessitates dropping the class. This could fall under **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - The statement asserts a causal connection (not submitting -> dropping classes) without sufficient evidence to support why this direct and drastic consequence is necessary. This makes it **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - There is no repetitive assertion of a proposition within this single statement, so it does not fit **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - The statement does not presume a consensus that is not justified or evident, so it does not fit **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - The language used in the statement is relatively clear and specific, hence it does not seem to utilize **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**.

Based on this analysis, the identified defective argument types in the statement are:
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
