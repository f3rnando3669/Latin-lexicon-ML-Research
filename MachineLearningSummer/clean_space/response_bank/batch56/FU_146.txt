The argument presented, "the claim, as evidence for an idea, that many people believe it, or used to believe it or do it," can be categorized as a defective argument type <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus). 

This type of argument assumes that because many people believe in something or have traditionally believed or done something, it must be true or valid. This is a logical fallacy often referred to as "appeal to popularity" or "bandwagon fallacy," where the popularity of an idea is taken as evidence of its correctness, which is not a logically sound basis for supporting an idea.
