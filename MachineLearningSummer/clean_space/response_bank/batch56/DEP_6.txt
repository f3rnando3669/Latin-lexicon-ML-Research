For 
The argument you provided can be analyzed for defective argument types. Here's the argument broken down:

"A warm beer is better than a cold beer. After all, nothing is better than a cold beer, and a warm beer is better than nothing."

1. "Nothing is better than a cold beer."
2. "A warm beer is better than nothing."

On closer inspection, the argument creates a misleading comparison by exploiting the ambiguous use of "nothing" in different contexts. 

1. In the first statement, "nothing is better than a cold beer," it uses "nothing" to mean "there is no thing that is better."
2. In the second statement, "a warm beer is better than nothing," it uses "nothing" to mean the absence of any beer, implying that having a warm beer is preferable to having no beer at all.

This exploitation of ambiguous language to draw a conclusion that does not logically follow constitutes a type of defective argument. Therefore, the primary defective argument type here is:

<DEP> Ambiguous Language

If other defective types can be fitted, they might include:

- <RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition: The argument attempts to state different propositions but ends up creating misleading repetitions due to the ambiguity.
- <IR> Inconclusive Reason: The provided reasons do not conclusively lead to the claim that a warm beer is better than a cold beer.
  
However, the most prominent defect type is <DEP> Ambiguous Language.
