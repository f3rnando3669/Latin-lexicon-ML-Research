For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identification of Defective Argument Analysis) to the statement "Sarah likes to run. All girls must like to run.", we need to identify which type of defective argument this statement represents. Let's break down the statement:

1. "Sarah likes to run."
2. "All girls must like to run."

The second statement makes a broad and sweeping conclusion based on the particular case of Sarah. This kind of reasoning is generally categorized as overgeneralization because it takes a specific instance and applies it to an entire group without sufficient justification.

Given our predefined defective argument types:

- <G> Generalization

This matches our definition of Generalization because it's drawing a broad conclusion from a single or limited data point.

Therefore, using <IDAA>, the statement "Sarah likes to run. All girls must like to run." can be categorized under the defective argument type <G>:

**Result:** <G> Generalization.
