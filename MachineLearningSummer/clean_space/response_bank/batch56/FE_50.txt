For 
<IDAA> stands for Identify and Describe Argumentative Apparatus. To apply <IDAA> to the statement "Either you love bacon, or you're wrong," we need to dissect and analyze the argumentative structure of the statement, identifying any defective argument types that might be present.

1. **Argument Structure**: 
   - The statement sets up a dichotomy (either/or) argument, suggesting that there are only two possible positions to take regarding bacon: one must either love it or be wrong.

2. **Analysis**:
   - This argument forces a binary choice, which is often a sign of a logical fallacy known as a "false dichotomy" or "false dilemma." It doesn't consider any other possible opinions or positions on bacon (neutral, dislike, indifferent, etc.).

3. **Identify Defective Argument Types**:
   - **<G> Generalization**: This argument can be seen as a generalization because it assumes that everyone's preferences must fit into two extreme categories without considering any variation.
   - **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The argument doesn't provide substantial reasoning for why someone who doesnâ€™t love bacon is wrong. It fails to establish a solid foundation for this claim.
   - **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: The argument presumes that a consensus exists about the love for bacon and that disagreeing with this presumed consensus is inherently wrong.
   - **<DEP> Ambiguous Language**: The term "wrong" is ambiguous here as it doesn't specify in what way the person is wrong (morally, factually, subjectively, etc.).

Therefore, the statement "Either you love bacon, or you're wrong" primarily exhibits the following defective argument types: <G> Generalization, <IR> Inconclusive Reason, <FU> Presumptuous Consensus, and <DEP> Ambiguous Language.
