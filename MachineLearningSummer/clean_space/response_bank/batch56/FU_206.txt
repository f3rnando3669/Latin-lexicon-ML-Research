For 
<IDAA> stands for Identify Defective Arguments and Assign Acronyms. Here’s how to apply it to the given statement:

"Trump cites (biased) poll results showing that people think he’s a strong leader to prove a point that he is a strong leader.

ABC News/Washington Post Poll (wrong big on election) said almost all stand by their vote on me & 53% said strong leader."

1. **Generalization (G)**: Trump uses the results from one poll to generalize about the broader population's opinion regarding his leadership. This is a form of hasty generalization.
   - Acronym: <G>

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The poll may not represent a complete or fair sample of the entire population, so the conclusion drawn is based on incomplete information.
   - Acronym: <FE>

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The fact that people think Trump is a strong leader in a biased poll does not definitively demonstrate that he is a strong leader. The reasoning does not conclusively establish the claim.
   - Acronym: <IR>

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Repeating the poll results to emphasize the point doesn’t add value to the argument; it merely restates the premise without strengthening the conclusion.
   - Acronym: <RR>

5. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Citing a poll to establish a consensus on his leadership assumes that the poll reflects an objective truth, whereas it could be biased, misinterpreted, or not representative.
   - Acronym: <FU>

6. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The term "strong leader" is subjective and could mean different things to different people, leading to ambiguity in what the poll results actually signify.
   - Acronym: <DEP>

Therefore, upon applying <IDAA>, the statement contains the following defective argument types:  
<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <FU>, and <DEP>.
