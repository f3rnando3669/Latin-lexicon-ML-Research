Certainly, let's break down the argument "Real Cubans understand presumption of guilt" using the defective argument types defined:

### Analysis

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument makes a sweeping assertion about "Real Cubans" without providing evidence that all or even most Cubans hold the same view about the presumption of guilt. It's an overgeneralization.
    - **Example**: "Real Cubans" is a broad category, and not all of them might understand or agree with the concept of presumption of guilt. 

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement does not consider the diversity of opinions among Cubans. It's possibly based on a limited sample or experience.
    - **Example**: The argument overlooks Cubans with differing views or a lack of awareness about the presumption of guilt.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument offers no substantial reasoning or evidence for why "real Cubans" would understand or agree with the presumption of guilt.
    - **Example**: It simply asserts the point without justification or proof.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument does not provide a causal link for why being a "real Cuban" would lead to understanding the presumption of guilt.
    - **Example**: It fails to explain why cultural or national identity would causally result in this understanding.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The statement could be seen as repetitive if similar arguments have been made without adding new evidence or insights.
    - **Example**: Merely stating that "Real Cubans understand presumption of guilt" without additional support does not strengthen the argument.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument presumes that there is a consensus among all "real Cubans" on this matter, which is a baseless assumption.
    - **Example**: It does not provide evidence of a wide-sweeping agreement among Cubans on this topic.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The term "Real Cubans" is ambiguous and can be interpreted in multiple ways, making the argument unclear.
    - **Example**: What qualifies someone as a "Real Cuban"? This ambiguity weakens the argument's validity.

### Application of <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Types):

The argument "Real Cubans understand presumption of guilt" involves several defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: It overgeneralizes the views of a diverse group of people.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: It fails to account for differing opinions among Cubans.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: It lacks substantive reasoning or evidence.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: It does not explain why being a Cuban should lead to this understanding.
5. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: It baselessly assumes a consensus among Cubans.
6. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The term "Real Cubans" is ambiguously defined.

By applying <IDAA>, we've demonstrated that the argument in question combines multiple defective argument types, rendering it logically weak and unsupported.
