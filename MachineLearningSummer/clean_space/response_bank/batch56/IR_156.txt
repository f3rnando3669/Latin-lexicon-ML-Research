For 
Let's break down the argument "Layla is a liar! She should not be trusted to be president for student council!" into the appropriate defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** 
   This might be considered a generalization because it takes one characteristic or action (Layla being a liar) and applies it broadly to her overall trustworthiness and suitability for a position.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   This argument assumes that if Layla is a liar, then she is unqualified for the position. It fails to provide a comprehensive evaluation of all relevant qualities and experiences Layla might have that are pertinent to being the student council president.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   Concluding that Layla should not be trusted to be president based solely on the claim that she is a liar is an inconclusive reason. Trustworthiness in one aspect of her character (honesty) does not necessarily determine her capability to perform her duties as president.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   The argument does not sufficiently demonstrate how Layla's status as a liar causally links to her inability to fulfill presidential responsibilities. It lacks evidence showing a direct and significant impact on her potential performance.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   This argument does not exemplify a faulty repetition of a proposition as there is no repetition involved here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   This statement does not rely on a consensus (presumptuous or otherwise) to support its claim. It is a personal assertion rather than an appeal to widely held beliefs.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   The language used in this argument is not ambiguous. The accusation and the conclusion drawn from it are quite clear.

In conclusion, the argument "Layla is a liar! She should not be trusted to be president for student council!" can be primarily identified as having elements of **Generalization (<G>)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**, **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
