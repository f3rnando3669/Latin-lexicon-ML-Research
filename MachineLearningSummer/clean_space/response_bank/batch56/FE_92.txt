For 
The statement "Live with me or live on the streets" can be examined for defective arguments using the defined types. This statement can be linked to the defective argument category known as a False Dichotomy, where a situation is presented as having only two possible outcomes when in reality, there may be other alternatives available.

However, considering the types provided, the closest match is:

- **<IDAA>**: Define the argument type you perceive as applicable to the statement.

Even though the provided list does not explicitly include False Dichotomy, the statement implies an artificially limited set of options. In the context of **<IDAA>**, I'll proceed with:
  
**<IDAA>: False Dichotomy**: The argument falsely limits the choices to two extreme options, omitting other viable alternatives that might exist. The statement "Live with me or live on the streets" oversimplifies the possible living arrangements, ignoring other possibilities such as living with someone else, renting an apartment, staying in a shelter, or any other feasible option.

Thus, "Live with me or live on the streets" can be identified as employing a False Dichotomy.
