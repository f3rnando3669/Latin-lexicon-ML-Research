It seems there's a request to identify defective argumentative reasoning in the statement given, while using defined categories such as Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, etc.

Here is an analysis that assigns the most fitting defective argument type:

**Statement:** "Justin Beiber wears Ray Bans, so you should buy a pair to wear in the sun."

1. **Generalization (G)**: The suggestion infers that because a single celebrity, Justin Beiber, wears Ray Bans, everyone should follow suit. This would be a generalization about what others should do based on one example.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This doesn't apply as there is no attempt to provide a list of options or a process missing components.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason for buying Ray Bans is not inherently related to their quality or suitability for protection from the sun but rather based on a celebrity's choice. The given premise doesn't logically lead to the conclusion.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This may also be applicable, as there is an implied cause-and-effect relationship that wearing Ray Bans like Justin Beiber will have the desired effect (suitability, style, protection), which is insufficiently supported.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This doesnâ€™t fit since the statement does not involve repetitive reasoning to support the conclusion.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This suggests that one should assume a consensus based on a celebrity's behavior, which might imply popularity equates to quality.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language is not ambiguous; it's quite clear in its suggestion.

**Most appropriate defective argument types applied:**

**<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The reasoning that one should buy a product because a celebrity wears it does not provide a conclusive or strong basis for making that purchase decision.

**<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: The implied effectiveness or suitability of the product solely based on celebrity endorsement does not provide a sound causal basis.

Therefore, you can state: "The argument 'Justin Beiber wears Ray Bans, so you should buy a pair to wear in the sun' is defective as it displays <IR> Inconclusive Reason and <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis."
