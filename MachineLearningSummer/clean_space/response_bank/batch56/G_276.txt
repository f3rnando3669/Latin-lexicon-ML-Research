To apply the defective argument types defined above to the statement "A driver with a New York license plate cuts you off in traffic. You decide that all New York drivers are terrible drivers," let's identify the relevant defective argument types and explain how they apply.

This statement can be critiqued primarily based on the type **Generalization (G)**. Here's the breakdown:

### Generalization (G)
**Definition**: "Generalization" is a defective argument that involves drawing a broad conclusion from a small sample size or limited evidence.

**Application**: In this case, the argument involves encountering a single driver with a New York license plate who cuts you off and then forming the general conclusion that all drivers from New York are terrible drivers. This is a classic example of an overgeneralization since it makes a sweeping statement about all New York drivers based on a single incident.

Therefore, the statement:
- "A driver with a New York license plate cuts you off in traffic. You decide that all New York drivers are terrible drivers."
  - would be classified as a **Generalization (G)** due to its faulty broad conclusion drawn from limited evidence.

So, the appropriate label for this defective argument is **<G>**.
