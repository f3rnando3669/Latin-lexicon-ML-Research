For 
To apply the defined defective argument types (collectively referred to as <IDAA>) to the statement "All dogs go to heaven," let's systematically analyze this statement to identify any potential use of the listed defective argument types:

<G> Generalization:
- The statement "All dogs go to heaven" is a clear example of a baseless generalization. It assumes a universal truth about all dogs without providing specific evidence or considering exceptions.

<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:
- The statement does not consider any possible exceptions or different circumstances that might prevent some dogs from going to heaven. It asserts a conclusion with an incomplete list of cases.

<IR> Inconclusive Reason:
- The reasoning behind "All dogs go to heaven" is not provided, making it an inconclusive reason. There is no supporting argument or evidence given to substantiate why all dogs would be destined for heaven.

<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:
- The statement implies a causal relationship (being a dog = going to heaven) without providing sufficient evidence or a clear causal explanation as to why all dogs would go to heaven.

<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:
- If "All dogs go to heaven" were presented multiple times as a way to make it more believable rather than providing new evidence, it would fit the <RR> criteria. However, without repetition in context, this might not fully apply here.

<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:
- The statement may imply a consensus or common belief that "All dogs go to heaven," but it does so presumptuously without showing actual evidence that a consensus exists or reasons for such a consensus.

<DEP> Ambiguous Language:
- The concept of "heaven" can be interpreted in multiple ways based on religious, spiritual, or metaphorical understandings, making the statement ambiguous and unclear without further definition of what is meant by "heaven."

In summary, the statement "All dogs go to heaven" demonstrates several defective argument types:
- <G> Generalization
- <FE> Incomplete Enumeration
- <IR> Inconclusive Reason
- <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis
- <FU> Presumptuous Consensus
- <DEP> Ambiguous Language

It mainly fails as an argument due to its reliance on broad, unsupported claims, lack of clear reasoning or evidence, and potential ambiguity in terminology.
