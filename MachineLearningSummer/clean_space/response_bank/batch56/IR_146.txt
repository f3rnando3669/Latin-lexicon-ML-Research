For 
<IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <DEP> (Ambiguous Language) can be applied to the example provided:

### Argument Breakdown:

**Initial Argument (A1)**: "We must legalize weed, it is tearing families apart."
**Response Argument (A2)**: "But look at all those druggies getting arrested, they are obviously criminals."

### Analysis:

1. **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**:
   - A2 presents an argument that assumes people who get arrested for drug use are "obviously criminals," which doesn't directly address A1's point about legalization potentially helping with family issues. The response is inconclusive in addressing the real issueâ€”whether legalization would have beneficial societal impacts, such as reducing family distress.

2. **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language)**:
   - The term "druggies" in A2 is ambiguous and carries a negative connotation, leading to a biased interpretation without clear definition. This language could be interpreted in various ways, making the response ambiguous and potentially misleading by not accurately classifying who these individuals are or the actual nature of their offenses.

### Full Explanation:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
  The response in A2 does not effectively counter the initial claim in A1. The initial argument suggests that legalizing weed could alleviate some negative societal impacts. However, the counter-response shifts focus to the criminal status of individuals arrested due to drug laws without addressing the potential benefits or harms of legalization itself. Thus, it is an inconclusive reason since it fails to engage with the core argument about the effects of legalization on families.

- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
  The term "druggies" used in A2 is an unclear and emotionally charged label. It lacks precision and can be subject to different interpretations. Is it referring to casual users, addicts, or merely those caught in the criminal justice system due to current laws? This ambiguity weakens the argument because it obfuscates who the "criminals" are and does not contribute to a clear counterargument to the legalization proposal.

In conclusion, the response to the initial argument is flawed due to the use of an inconclusive reasoning approach that fails to directly address the original claim and the use of ambiguous language that introduces emotional bias without clarity.
