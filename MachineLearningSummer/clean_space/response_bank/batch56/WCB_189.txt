To apply the defined defective argument types to the statement, we can analyze and identify which flawed reasoning patterns are demonstrated:

Statement: "I refuse to stay on the 13th floor of any hotel because it is bad luck. However, I donâ€™t mind staying on the same floor as long as we call it the 14th floor."

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement generalizes by assuming that the 13th floor of any and every hotel is bad luck without providing specific evidence to support this claim. The belief is widely held, but not universally justified.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasoning given for avoiding the 13th floor ('because it is bad luck') is not conclusively reliable. There's no substantial or logical evidence provided to definitively prove that the 13th floor causes bad luck.

3. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: There is an underlying ambiguity in the concept of 'bad luck' and its association with the number 13. Bad luck is a subjective and culturally variable concept, which lacks clear definition in this context.

The other defective argument types do not seem directly applicable to this statement, as it does not involve an incomplete enumeration, insufficient causal basis, faulty repetition of proposition, or presumptuous consensus specifically.

Thus, the most relevant defective argument types for this statement are Generalization (<G>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), and Ambiguous Language (<DEP>).
