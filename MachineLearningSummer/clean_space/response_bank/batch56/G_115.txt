For 
<IDAA> typically stands for the Identification of a Defective Argument Application. To apply <IDAA> to the statement "James, the company you work for just filed for bankruptcy! How can I trust you with our money?" we need to identify the specific type of defective argument being employed in this statement.

This statement is making an assumption that James's trustworthiness or competence in handling money is directly related to the bankruptcy of the company he works for. This could be considered a type of defective argument.

The argument can be classified as:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This is because it generalizes that anyone associated with a bankrupt company is untrustworthy with money. It criticizes James based on the companyâ€™s bankruptcy without considering his individual actions and capabilities.

Therefore, the defective argument type <G> (Generalization) is being used in the statement "James, the company you work for just filed for bankruptcy! How can I trust you with our money?"
