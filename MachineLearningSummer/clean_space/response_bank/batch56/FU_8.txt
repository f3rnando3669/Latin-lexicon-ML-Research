Sure, I'll analyze the argument in the statement: "The Royals are promoting their team for the next season by telling people to come join the team because everyone else has," to identify if it falls under any of the defined defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>).

This argument appears to be defective due to the assumption that it is true because "everyone else has." This type of argument is known as an Appeal to Popularity or Bandwagon Fallacy, which can be categorized under the defined defective argument type called <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).

Thus, the defective argument type here is <FU>: Presumptuous Consensus.
