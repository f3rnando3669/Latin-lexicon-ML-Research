It appears that you've defined various types of defective arguments but <IDAA> hasn't been specified in your list. However, based on the structure and usage pattern, it seems like this abbreviation could be intended to identify specific defects in an argument.

Given the provided statement, "In the United States, one can vote for either Democrats or Republicans," letâ€™s try to identify potential defective argument types from the list you've provided:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement implies that the only voting choices available in the United States are Democrats or Republicans. This is a defective argument because it doesn't consider third-party candidates or write-in options, which are indeed available in the U.S. electoral system. 

2. **Generalization (G)**: The statement might also fall under a broad generalization. While Democrats and Republicans are the dominant parties, it generalizes the entire U.S. voting options without taking into account regional candidates or independent parties that might have a significant presence.

Therefore, applying these definitions to the statement, the defective argument types could be identified as <FE> and <G>, since it incompletely enumerates the possible voting options and generalizes the choices as only between two parties.
