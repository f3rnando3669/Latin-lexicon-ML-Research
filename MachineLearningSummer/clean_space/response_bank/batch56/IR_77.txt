For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argumentation Attributes, and it involves categorizing an argument based on known types of defective arguments. 

The argument presented is: "Mayor Jones’ anti-DUI campaign should not be taken seriously. After all, the mayor himself was cited for driving under the influence in college."

This argument appears to fit a defective argument type related to attacking the character or past actions of a person to undermine their current stance or argument, often known as "ad hominem." However, using the defective argument types you provided:

1. The argument makes an invalid generalization about the mayor's ability to advocate for anti-DUI measures based solely on his past behavior, which may fall under the classification of **<G> Generalization**. However, <G> generally implies making a general statement based on insufficient evidence, rather than entirely dismissing an argument because of past actions.

2. The most fitting classification for this specific type of argument might fall under **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** if the argument assumes that one instance of DUI completely disqualifies someone from advocating against it without considering the possibility of learning from one's mistakes or changes over time.

3. The argument could also be seen as **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)** if it relies on repeating past allegations to undermine current credibility without engaging with the merits of the current campaign directly.

Given these definitions, the argument can best be analyzed using the following categories:

1. **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: It assumes that because the Mayor has one known instance of DUI, he is entirely unqualified to conduct an anti-DUI campaign, without considering other factors or the potential for change and rehabilitation.
2. **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: It potentially relies on reiterating a past incident (the mayor’s DUI citation) to discredit his current stance, rather than addressing the current merits or demerits of the anti-DUI campaign itself.

Therefore, by applying <IDAA>, the argument could be identified as **<FE>** due to its reliance on **Incomplete Enumeration**, or as **<RR>** due to **Faulty Repetition of Proposition**.
