1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument assumes that dark clouds will always lead to a tornado because it happened once. It does not consider other possible scenarios or outcomes that could occur with dark clouds, leading to an incomplete enumeration of all possible outcomes.

Thus, the statement primarily falls under the defective argument type of **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**.
