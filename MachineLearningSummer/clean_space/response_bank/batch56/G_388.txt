The argument presented can be analyzed and identified for any defective argument types as defined. Here's the analysis of the argument "I hope the art mural at 34th and Habersham will not be allowed. You open the gate for one, you open it for all and you'll have it all over the city. A person wanting to paint on buildings is nothing more than upscale graffiti. More than likely it will go too far.":

1. **"You open the gate for one, you open it for all and you'll have it all over the city."**
   - **Type:** Generalization <G>
   - **Explanation:** The argument suggests that allowing one mural will inevitably lead to murals being everywhere in the city, without providing sufficient evidence that such an exponential increase will happen.

2. **"A person wanting to paint on buildings is nothing more than upscale graffiti."**
   - **Type:** Inconclusive Reason <IR>
   - **Explanation:** The argument equates an art mural with graffiti without sufficient reasoning or evidence to support that they are the same or have the same impact.

3. **"More than likely it will go too far."**
   - **Type:** Incomplete Enumeration <FE>
   - **Explanation:** The argument concludes that it will go too far without considering other possibilities or outcomes, offering no robust enumeration of potential scenarios.

Overall, the argument employs several defective argument types: Generalization, Inconclusive Reason, and Incomplete Enumeration, which renders it less convincing and logically unsound.
