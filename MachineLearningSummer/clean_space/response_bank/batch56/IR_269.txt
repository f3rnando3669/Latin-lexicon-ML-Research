For 
<IDAA> stands for Identify, Define, and Analyze Argument type defects Applied. To apply <IDAA> to the given statement:

**Identify:**
"There's no point listening to your opinion on school lunches. Everybody knows you cheat on your math tests."

**Define:**
This argument appears to be deflecting or dismissing the person's opinion on school lunches based on an unrelated accusation about cheating on math tests.

**Analyze:**
The argument presented can be categorized as an **Ad Hominem** attack. This specific variation of the ad hominem fallacy is when someone attacks the person rather than addressing the argument itself. Let's define if it falls under any of the defective argument types provided:

- **Generalization (<G>):** The argument does not generalize a rule from one specific instance.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument does not fail to consider all possibilities but rather dismisses based on personal attack.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The argument is inconclusive but more specifically dismisses for personal reasons.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** There is no causal relationship being claimed.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** No propositions are being repeated.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Although it claims "everybody knows," the main point is disregarding an argument due to an unrelated personal flaw.
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** The statement is clear in its language.

**Conclusion:**
This argument is primarily an **Ad Hominem** fallacy. While it doesn't directly fit into the predefined defective argument types (like <G>, <FE>, <IR>, etc.), it dismisses the person's argument about school lunches based on an unrelated issue. The most appropriate match from the predefined types might be **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**, though the primary issue is the ad hominem attack.
