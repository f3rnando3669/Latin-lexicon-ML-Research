Let's apply the defective argument types to the debate on whether people should let their cats go outside.

**TOPIC: Should people let their cats go outside?**

1. **Argument A**: "People should let their cats go outside. Going outside gives cats more exercise."
   - **Defective Argument Type Applied**: 
     - **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument may be an overgeneralization as it assumes that all cats and all circumstances will result in cats getting more exercise by being allowed outside, without considering other factors or potential risks.

2. **Argument B**: "But if you let cats go outside, then they'll hunt all the birds in the neighborhood. If you let them hunt all the birds, then robins will go extinct."
   - **Defective Argument Type Applied**:
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This argument assumes a direct, oversimplified causal link between letting cats go outside and the extinction of robins. It does not provide sufficient evidence to support such a strong causal relationship.
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This argument implies that the only outcome of letting cats go outside is the extinction of robins. It ignores other possible outcomes and factors that could prevent such an extreme scenario.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The argument provides an inconclusive reason by suggesting a dire consequence (robin extinction) without solid, direct evidence or consideration of intermediate steps and other possible factors that could mitigate the situation.

By identifying these defective argument types, we can better understand the weaknesses and potential biases in the debate.
