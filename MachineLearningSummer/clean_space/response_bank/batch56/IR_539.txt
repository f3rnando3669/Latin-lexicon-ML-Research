For 
<IDAA> stands for "Identification and Description of Argument's Defective Aspects". 

Let's apply it to the given argument: "We shouldn’t put her in jail even if she stole billions of pesos. She is already too old to be locked up."

1. **Identify the argument**:
   - Premise: "She is already too old to be locked up."
   - Conclusion: "We shouldn’t put her in jail even if she stole billions of pesos."

2. **Describe the defective aspects**:

   - **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument may implicitly generalize that being old is a sufficient reason to avoid imprisonment, without considering the specific act committed or the consequences thereof. This type of reasoning can be overly broad and misses the details of individual cases.
   
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided (i.e., her age) may be considered insufficient by many to override the serious nature of her crime (stealing billions of pesos). It lacks a strong logical connection that thoroughly justifies the conclusion.
   
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument fails to consider other relevant factors that could influence the decision about imprisonment, such as the severity of the crime, the need for justice, and the potential deterrent effect of punishment.
   
   - **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The term "too old" is potentially ambiguous, as it does not provide a clear or universally accepted threshold for what age makes someone unfit for imprisonment. Different contexts might interpret "too old" in varying ways, leading to confusion or misinterpretation.

3. Putting it all together:

This argument that she shouldn't be put in jail because she is too old, despite having stolen billions of pesos, presents several defective aspects: it generalizes the appropriateness of avoiding jail for older people without sufficient justification (<G>), lacks a strong logical connection between the premise and conclusion (<IR>), doesn't consider the full range of relevant factors in deciding on imprisonment (<FE>), and uses potentially ambiguous language regarding what age is deemed "too old" (<DEP>).
