For 
The argument that James' mom has committed can best be described as a **slippery slope** fallacy. This is because she is assuming that a single instance of James skipping class will inevitably lead to a series of progressively worse outcomes without sufficient evidence to support such claims. This type of fallacy is characterized by suggesting that taking a minor action will lead to significant and more severe consequences.

However, considering the defined defective argument types, the fallacy committed can also be seen as having elements of:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Because the reasoning she uses to predict the catastrophic outcomes is not sufficiently supported by evidence.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Because she assumes a direct causal relationship between skipping a single class and ending up unemployed without adequate justification for each step in the causal chain.

Therefore, the most applicable defective argument type defined in your problem set would be **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, as the reasoning for the extreme conclusion is not sufficiently conclusive or supported by evidence.
