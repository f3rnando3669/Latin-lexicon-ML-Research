For 
<IDAA> stands for Ignoring Directly Addressed Argument.

Applying <IDAA> to the conversation provided:

Charlie: Fast food is filled with salt, fat, and added sugars. We need better regulation of the industry.
Bob: That may be, but youâ€™re such a hypocrite! I saw you devour a Triple-Baconator, super-sized fries, and 64 ounces of soda yesterday.

Here, Bob's response to Charlie is an example of an Ignoring Directly Addressed Argument (<IDAA>). Instead of addressing Charlie's point about the unhealthy contents of fast food and the need for better industry regulation, Bob attacks Charlie's personal habits and character. This shift in focus from the argument about regulation to an ad hominem critique is a classic <IDAA>.
