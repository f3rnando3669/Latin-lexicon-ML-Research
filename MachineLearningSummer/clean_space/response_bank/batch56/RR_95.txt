To analyze the argument "Violent video games cause teens to be violent, because violent teens play violent video games." using the predefined defective argument types, we need to identify which type(s) of defective reasoning it exemplifies. Here, a couple of types can be assigned:

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   This argument claims a causal relationship between playing violent video games and teens becoming violent but does not provide sufficient evidence to establish causation. Just because violent teens play violent video games does not mean that the games cause the violence. There could be other variables influencing both gaming habits and violent behavior.

2. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   The argument seems to repeat the proposition in different words without providing new evidence or reasoning. It states "violent video games cause teens to be violent" and then rephrases it as "violent teens play violent video games," which does not substantiate the causal claim; instead, it circles back to the initial statement.

By applying <IDAA> (Identifying the Defective Argument Analysis) to the argument, we conclude that it falls under:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causation is claimed without adequate supporting evidence.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The argument essentially repeats itself without providing any new information or valid evidence.
