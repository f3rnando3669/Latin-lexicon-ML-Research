Identification of Defective Argument Types Applied:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The argument attempts to downplay the importance of one issue (pandas going extinct) by comparing it with another (homelessness). While both issues are important, the argument presented does not provide a conclusive reason for why one should be disregarded over the other. It's a form of a false dilemma, where the existence of one problem is used to invalidate concern for another, which is not a logical basis for disregarding either issue.

2. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Repeating that homelessness is an important issue does not inherently diminish the importance of panda conservation. The argument seems to imply that effort or resources can only be allocated to one problem, but this repetition does not substantiate or logically reinforce the proposition that worrying about pandas is unwarranted.

3. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument implies a consensus or shared value that homelessness should take priority over animal conservation issues without evidence or logical support. It presumes that the consensus or societal agreement is that human issues should always take precedence, which is not a given and should be substantiated if claimed.

The argument commits these detectable argumentative defects, making it flawed as it doesn't logically justify why one important issue should be disregarded in favor of another. Each issue can be addressed on its own merits and isn't mutually exclusive from the other.
