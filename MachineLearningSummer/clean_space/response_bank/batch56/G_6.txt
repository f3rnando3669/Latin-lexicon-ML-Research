For 
The argument "The spider that bit was poison, therefore all spiders are poison." can be identified as an instance of a defective argument. Let's analyze it:

The argument takes an isolated instance (one spider being poisonous) and generalizes it to all instances (all spiders being poisonous). This is a classic example of making a <G> (Generalization) error.

Specific Analysis:
- **Generalization (G)**: This argument takes a single example (one spider being poisonous) and draws a broad conclusion about all spiders, without sufficient evidence to support such a wide-reaching claim.

Therefore, applying <IDAA> to the argument:

**<G>: The spider that bit was poison, therefore all spiders are poison.**

This effectively identifies the argument's defectiveness as originating from a generalization error.
