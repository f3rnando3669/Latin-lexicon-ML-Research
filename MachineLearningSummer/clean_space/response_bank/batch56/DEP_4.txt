In this context, <IDAA> appears to be another type of defective argument, but since its definition hasn't been provided, we'll treat it speculatively and apply the defective argument types you've already defined to analyze the conversation:

1. **Rowena**: "He must have meant it in the old sense of the word -- that your artwork inspired awe!" 

   - This could be an example of **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language)**. The word "awful" historically did mean "full of awe" or "inspiring awe," but its modern connotation is overwhelmingly negative. Rowena's argument hinges on an ambiguous interpretation of "awful," which may not be the intended meaning by the art critic.

2. **Elba**: "Yes! That makes sense now!"

   - **Elba** readily accepts Rowenaâ€™s interpretation without further evidence, which could indicate **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**. Elba accepts a conclusion based on an unverified assumption that the critic might have been using an outdated and rare interpretation of the word.

In summary, by applying defective argument types:
- **Rowena's** response likely exemplifies **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language)**.
- **Elba's** agreement could illustrate **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** due to accepting an unconfirmed interpretation without sufficient backing.

Without defining <IDAA> explicitly, it's hard to pinpoint exactly where it might fit. But based on the provided types, the analysis leans heavily on ambiguity and acceptance without proper groundwork.
