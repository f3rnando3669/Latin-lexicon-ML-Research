For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Assertion. In the provided statement, Bertrand is making a claim that there is a teapot in orbit around the Sun between the Earth and Mars and argues that because no one can prove him wrong, his claim must be considered valid.

Applying <IDAA> to this argument involves identifying which type(s) of defective argument Bertrand is using. Let's break it down:

1. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Bertrand is asserting that his claim is valid on the basis that no one can disprove it, which implies a false consensus or agreement based on the lack of disproof. This is a form of argumentum ad ignorantiam (appeal to ignorance) where a proposition is claimed to be true because it has not yet been proven false.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Bertrand's reasoning is inconclusive because the inability to disprove a claim does not provide sufficient evidence for its validity. The lack of contrary evidence does not constitute evidence in favor of the claim.

Thus, Bertrand's argument can be identified as having defects <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus) and <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
