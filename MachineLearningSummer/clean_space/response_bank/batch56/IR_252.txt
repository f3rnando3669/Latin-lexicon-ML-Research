For 
**Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: "*I can't trust that doctor's advice on how to raise my child. He has never been a mother.*"

This argument type, Inconclusive Reason, refers to cases where the reason provided does not sufficiently support the conclusion. The fact that the doctor has never been a mother does not necessarily mean their advice on child-rearing is untrustworthy. The doctor's professional training and expertise could still make their advice valuable regardless of their personal experience as a mother. Therefore, the argument is inconclusive and does not adequately address the validity of the doctor's advice.
