To analyze the argument and identify any defective argument types, let's break down the reasoning presented:

**Argument:**
"Several years ago, a group of 10 psychologists started a psychology training program. Each of those psychologists is efficient, effective, and highly-regarded. Their training program must be efficient, effective, and highly-regarded."

The argument seems to draw a conclusion about the quality of the training program based on the qualities of the individuals who started it. Each element of the argument needs close scrutiny to determine which, if any, defective argument types apply.

1. **Generalization (G)** - This is not a case of making a broad generalization based on limited evidence about a larger group or situation, so (G) does not apply here.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** - The argument does not list out all relevant factors that could affect whether the training program is efficient, effective, and highly-regarded, implying that being run by efficient and effective psychologists is sufficient by itself. Therefore, (FE) might initially seem applicable but focuses more on the surface qualities without considering the totality of circumstances.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** - There is an expectation that the qualities of the psychologists will directly transfer to the program. However, there is no concrete evidence provided to substantiate that the qualities of the individuals indeed translate to the program's success. The argument appears conclusive without justification. Hence, (IR) can be applied.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** - The argument assumes a direct cause between the psychologists' qualities and the program's success without providing sufficient causal reasoning or evidence for this connection. Thus, (WCB) is applicable.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** - The reasoning is not merely repeating a claim without justification, so (RR) is not applicable.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** - The argument does not rely on a presumed consensus of opinion, so (FU) does not apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)** - The terms used here such as "efficient," "effective," and "highly-regarded" are not particularly ambiguous and specific enough in this context, so (DEP) does not apply.

**Identified Defective Argument Types (IDAA):**

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

Therefore, the argument "Several years ago, a group of 10 psychologists started a psychology training program. Each of those psychologists is efficient, effective, and highly-regarded. Their training program must be efficient, effective, and highly-regarded." can be critiqued for containing the defective argument types of **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
