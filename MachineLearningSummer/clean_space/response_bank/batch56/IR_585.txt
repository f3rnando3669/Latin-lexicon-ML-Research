For 
Applying the principles of Identify, Define, Apply, and Assess (IDAA) to the argument "Oh, please. What would you know about labor laws? You don’t even have a job." reveals the following:

### Identify
Identify the main components and structure of the argument: 
- The statement dismisses someone's knowledge or opinion on labor laws.
- The reason given for the dismissal is that the person does not have a job.

### Define
Define relevant defective argument types that could apply to this statement:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This argument dismisses the person's opinion on labor laws based on their employment status, which does not necessarily correlate with their knowledge or expertise about labor laws.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument presupposes a consensus that a person without a job cannot know about labor laws, without providing evidence that this is a widely accepted belief.

### Apply
Apply the definitions to the argument to determine if any defective argument types are present:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The argument's foundation (the person's employment status) is not directly related to the person's potential knowledge of labor laws, making it an inconclusive reason to dismiss their point.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: By implying that understanding labor laws necessitates having a job, the statement assumes a consensus or common belief that doesn't require substantiation.

### Assess
Assess the argument, indicating which defective arguments are present and explain why:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The argument's basis is flawed because possessing knowledge about labor laws does not hinge on whether one currently has a job. People can be well-versed in labor laws through various other channels, like education or personal reading.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: There is an implicit assumption that people without jobs lack knowledge of labor laws, but no actual consensus or evidence is presented to validate this assertion.

So, the argument "Oh, please. What would you know about labor laws? You don’t even have a job." clearly exhibits elements of **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)** as defective argument types.
