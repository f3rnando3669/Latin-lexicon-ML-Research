In argumentation analysis, identifying the type of fallacies or defective arguments used can help us understand the weaknesses in the reasoning. The provided dialogue appears to contain a specific type of fallacy known as circular reasoning.

Let's apply the defective argument types to this dialogue:

**Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified.**
**Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?**
**Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so.**
**Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct?**
**Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.**
**Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?**
**Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Quran.**

This argument is circular because the claim (the Quran is correct) is supported by another claim (the Quran is the Word of God), which in turn is supported by the initial claim (the Quran says that Jesus was not crucified and that everything in the Quran is true). Therefore, the argument never steps outside its own premises.

Therefore, based on the definitions of defective argument types, the most fitting would be:

**<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: 
This is because Speaker 1 is essentially restating the same proposition in different terms without providing external or independent supporting evidence.

Thus, the IDAA (Identified Defective Argument Application) for this dialogue is: **<RR>**.
