Applying the defective argument types you've defined to the provided passage, we can identify several potential issues:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The passage suggests that arguments for the existence of God shift as scientific understanding advances, citing examples like creationism to intelligent design without providing a comprehensive list or evidence of other arguments that may exist. The claim that new arguments are usually involving "questions to which science has not definitively answered yet" is stated without a thorough enumeration of such arguments or an adequate investigation into their nature.
   
2. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The passage makes a sweeping generalization that all arguments for the existence of God move goalposts as science progresses. It states, "the 'origin of life' argument will fade away and be replaced by another," which assumes a universal behavior among all such arguments without acknowledging those that might not fit this pattern.
   
3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - The passage seems to imply a causal relationship between the advance of scientific explanations and religious arguments shifting without providing a detailed causal analysis. It suggests that as science answers more questions, new arguments for God appear, but it lacks concrete evidence or detailed reasoning to support this causal relationship.

4. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The passage asserts that arguments for God will evolve as science progresses without presenting conclusive evidence. The statement "we very well may have a scientific answer in the next decade" regarding the origin of life is speculative and not backed by conclusive reasoning or current scientific evidence.

5. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - The phrase "what appears to be ad hoc objections that follow" is vague and could be clearer. The term "moving the figurative goalposts" also requires more precise clarification to avoid ambiguity in understanding the specific logical fallacy being described.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - The passage implies a general consensus among theists that arguments for God's existence adapt in response to scientific findings. It does not provide evidence for this assumption or indicate whether this is an accepted view among all theists or merely a subset.

By identifying these defective argument types applied to the passage, we can see that it contains several weaknesses in its reasoning and presentation of information and arguments.
