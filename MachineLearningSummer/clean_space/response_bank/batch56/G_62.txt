For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Application) to the statement "Girls should not be allowed to try out as kickers for school football teams because girls are not very athletic," we need to analyze the reasoning given within the argument and determine which, if any, of the defective argument types we've named are present in the statement.

1. **Generalization (<G>):** This argument falls under Generalization because it makes a broad claim about all girls based on a stereotypical notion that girls are "not very athletic." It unfairly represents an entire group without considering individual abilities or achievements.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This is also an Incomplete Enumeration because it does not consider other relevant factors or examples of athletic girls who could potentially be successful kickers on school football teams.

3. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** Although the argument's language is not specifically ambiguous, the use of "athletic" might be considered somewhat vague since athleticism can encompass various attributes and competences, which the statement fails to clarify.

However, the most fitting defect is Generalization (<G>), given the broad and unfair stereotyping inherent in the argument.

So, in conclusion:
The defective argument type in the statement "Girls should not be allowed to try out as kickers for school football teams because girls are not very athletic" primarily falls under **Generalization (<G>)**.
