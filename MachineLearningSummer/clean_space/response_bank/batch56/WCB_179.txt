Certainly! Let's break down the argument and apply the defective argument types you've provided where appropriate:

**Argument:**
"I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick."

1. <G> **Generalization**: This argument could be considered a form of generalization if it assumes that drinking bottled water will always make someone sick based on a single instance.

2. <FE> **Incomplete Enumeration**: The argument could be an incomplete enumeration as it does not consider other possible reasons for the sickness. For instance, the illness could have been caused by something else consumed or by a virus unrelated to the water.

3. <IR> **Inconclusive Reason**: The reasoning used is inconclusive. Just because one thing happened after another (drinking bottled water followed by sickness) does not necessarily mean that the first thing caused the second.

4. <WCB> **Insufficient Causal Basis**: The argument lacks sufficient evidence to establish a causal relationship between drinking the bottled water and getting sick. There is no consideration of other factors or investigation into the quality of the bottled water.

5. <RR> **Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: There isn't an obvious repetition of the proposition within the argument as presented, so this defective argument type might not apply as directly to this specific case.

6. <FU> **Presumptuous Consensus**: There isn't an invocation of consensus or appeal to what others might think in this argument. It is a personal anecdote rather than assuming agreement from others or relying on popular opinion.

7. <DEP> **Ambiguous Language**: Without further context, the language in the argument does not seem ambiguous. It clearly states the sequence of events and the assumed connection.

Given the types, the most applicable defective argument types in this case are:
- <FE> Incomplete Enumeration
- <IR> Inconclusive Reason
- <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis

Those highlight the primary flaws in the reasoning: failure to consider other causes of the sickness, jumping to a conclusion without sufficient evidence, and lacking a solid basis to claim causation.
