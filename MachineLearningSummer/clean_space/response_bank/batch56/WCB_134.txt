For 
The acronym <IDAA> is not defined in the list you've provided. If you're asking to identify and apply relevant defective arguments from the given list to the statement, here’s how it could be analyzed:

Statement: "Yesterday, I walked under a ladder with an open umbrella indoors while spilling salt in front of a black cat. And I forgot to knock on wood with my lucky dice. That must be why I’m having such a bad day today. It’s bad luck.”

Let's break this down and identify any defective arguments:

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The statement claims that specific actions (walking under a ladder, having an open umbrella indoors, spilling salt, seeing a black cat, forgetting to knock on wood) are the causes of having a bad day without providing any logical or empirical basis for this causal connection. The notion of these events causing bad luck is based on superstition rather than evidence, making it an insufficient causal basis.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning given is not conclusive because it relies on superstitions rather than concrete evidence or logical inference. There’s no actual proof that these actions lead to bad luck or a bad day.

3. **Generalization (G)**: This might be considered if the argument implies that anyone doing these actions would inevitably have a bad day. However, this is more suggested than explicitly stated in the original argument.

4. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: While the primary focus is on the superstitions, the term "bad luck" can be considered ambiguous, as it does not specify what kind of misfortunes have occurred nor how these are directly tied to the actions mentioned.

So for this statement, the following defective argument types apply:

- <WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis
- <IR>: Inconclusive Reason
- Potentially <DEP>: Ambiguous Language (depending on interpretation)

Given that <IDAA> is not defined in your list, no conclusions can be drawn regarding it directly.
