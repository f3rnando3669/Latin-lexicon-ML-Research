For 
<IDAA> can be understood as Identifying Defective Argument Attributes. Let's analyze the given argument to identify any defective argument types:

Senator Jill: "We'll have to cut education funding this year."
Senator Bill: "Why?"
Senator Jill: "Well, either we cut the social programs or we live with a huge deficit and we can't live with the deficit."

This argument primarily presents a false dilemma, suggesting there are only two possible options (cutting social programs or living with a deficit) without considering other potential solutions. This type of reasoning can align with an **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, as it fails to account for all possible options.

Therefore, the defective argument type for Senator Jill's reasoning can be identified as:
<IDAA: FE>
