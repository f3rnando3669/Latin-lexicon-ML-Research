For 
The application of <IDAA> to "All elephants are big. Some boys are big. Therefore some boys are elephants." involves identifying the defective arguments in the given statement. Let's analyze it step by step:

1. The statement "All elephants are big" is a generalization about elephants.
2. The statement "Some boys are big" is a separate but similar generalization about boys.
3. The conclusion "Therefore some boys are elephants" attempts to link these two generalizations in an invalid way.

The defective argument types that apply here include:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Both premises make broad generalizations.
2. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. Just because some boys and all elephants share a characteristic ("big"), it doesn't mean that boys are elephants.

Therefore, applying <IDAA> to the statement results in identifying it as follows:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: "All elephants are big" and "Some boys are big."
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: "Therefore some boys are elephants."

The argument structure is defective because it incorrectly bridges a similarity in one attribute (being big) to infer an identity between categories (elephants and boys), which is not a logically valid deduction.
