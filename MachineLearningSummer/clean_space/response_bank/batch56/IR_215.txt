For 
"Morris: Oh youthful spirit, you have so much to learn. I know for a fact that there are multiple dimensions that beings occupy.
Clifton: How can you possibly *know* that for a fact?
Morris: (raises one eyebrow, stares deeply into the eyes of Clifton and says nothing)
Clifton: Wow. You convinced me!"

Let's identify the defective arguments applied here:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Morris's non-verbal response (raising an eyebrow and staring deeply) does not provide any logical or factual evidence to support his claim that there are multiple dimensions. Instead, it relies on an ambiguous gesture to imply depth or wisdom, which does not constitute a proper argumentative basis.

2. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The initial statement, "Oh youthful spirit, you have so much to learn," is ambiguous language. It implies Morris has a superior understanding or knowledge without giving a concrete basis for his claim about multiple dimensions.

3. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Clifton's sudden shift from skepticism to belief ("Wow. You convinced me!") implies a social or emotional influence rather than a logical one, which suggests the acceptance of a proposition based on perceived authority or social cues rather than substantive evidence.

Thus, the identified defective arguments are:
- **<IR>**: Morris's eyebrow raise and stare.
- **<DEP>**: Ambiguous language in the initial patronizing statement.
- **<FU>**: Cliftonâ€™s quick change in belief based on social influence rather than logical evidence.
