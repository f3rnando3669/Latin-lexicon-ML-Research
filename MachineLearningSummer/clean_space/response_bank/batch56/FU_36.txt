Certainly! Let's analyze the given statement "Fortnite is the best game ever. Everyone is playing it!" for potential defective argument types as defined:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This could be identified here if "everyone is playing it" is taken to imply that since many people play it, it must be the best game. A general statement about popularity is being used to justify an absolute claim about its quality. 
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument "Everyone is playing it!" is an incomplete enumeration if it does not consider other popular games that many might also be playing. It overlooks the possibility of other games being equally or more popular.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Here, the popularity of Fortnite (many people playing it) is used to conclude that it is the best game ever. This is an inconclusive reason because popularity does not necessarily determine the quality or superiority of the game.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: If the argument assumes that the popularity (everyone playing it) directly causes the game to be the best without establishing a causal link between popularity and game quality, it represents an insufficient causal basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This is not particularly seen here unless the statement "Everyone is playing it" is repeated in various forms without new evidence, simply reinforcing the initial claim.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The assertion that "Everyone is playing it!" implies a consensus without evidence. It's presumptuous as it claims universal agreement without substantiation.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The term "best game ever" is subjective and ambiguous. What constitutes the "best" can vary widely among different people; the language lacks precision.

Applying the IDs to the statement "Fortnite is the best game ever. Everyone is playing it!" covers several overlapping defective argument types:

- <G> for generalizing the quality based on popularity.
- <FE> for potentially ignoring other popular games.
- <IR> for an inconclusive reason that popularity equates to quality.
- <WCB> for insufficient causal basis between popularity and being the best.
- <FU> for presumptive consensus on its popularity.
- <DEP> for ambiguous language in defining "best game ever."

So, the analysis of the statement reveals multiple defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.
