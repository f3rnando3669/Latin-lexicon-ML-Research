For 
The argument present in the given situation is another defective argument type called **Irrelevant Diversion and Avoidance of the Argument (IDAA)**. This type of reasoning occurs when someone diverts attention from the issue at hand by shifting the focus to a completely different topic.

Specifically, in this scenario, when confronted with the mom about going over the phone bill limit, the subject diverts the conversation to discuss their difficulties in a math class and a recent successful test result. This shift in topic does not address the core issue (i.e., the phone bill being over the limit) and instead tries to redirect the conversation to something positive about their academic performance, hence avoiding the argument about the phone bill.

Thus, the application of **IDAA** is appropriate here for the reasoning involved:

**IDAA**: The subject is diverting attention away from the issue of the phone bill by changing the topic to their academic performance.
