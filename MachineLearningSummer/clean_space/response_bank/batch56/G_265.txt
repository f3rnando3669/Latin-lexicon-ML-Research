For 
The statement "If I raise you, I must raise everyone, and then the company goes bankrupt" demonstrates several defective argument types. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument overgeneralizes by assuming that giving a raise to one person necessitates giving raises to everyone, without considering the possibility of selective raises.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument overlooks other potential solutions or outcomes, such as granting a raise to one employee to retain talent without necessarily giving it to everyone, or implementing a performance-based raise system.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The argument fails to provide a conclusive reason why a single raise would lead to giving everyone a raise and ultimately bankrupted the company. It skips over the economic specifics and possible fiscal strategies that could be employed.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The claim presumes a direct causal relationship between giving a raise to one individual and bankrupting the company. This lacks sufficient evidence as there are numerous factors at play in a company's financial health.

By applying <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Analysis), we can discern that the statement contains multiple flawed reasoning patterns that weaken its overall validity and persuasiveness.
