In the context of analyzing defective arguments using the specified types, let's first decode the provided argument and then identify the applicable defective argument type:

**Argument:**
"Cellphones weren’t invented before I was born. Now, they are everywhere! Therefore, cellphones were created because I was born."

This argument appears to suggest that the presence of cellphones is causally related to the speaker's birth. Using the defined defective argument types, we can pinpoint the flaws in this argument.

1. **Generalization (<G>):** This type occurs when a broad claim is based on insufficient evidence. However, this argument is not claiming a generalization about cellphones; it is making a causal claim based on personal chronology.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This occurs when an argument presents an incomplete list of possibilities. Though the argument overlooks other potential causes for cellphones’ creation, it’s primarily making a direct causal claim.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This is where premises do not sufficiently support the conclusion. The argument does fit this as it suggests that the speaker's birth is reason enough to explain the creation of cellphones, which is clearly inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This type describes an argument that draws a causal connection without enough evidence. The argument certainly fits under this category since it assumes that the speaker's birth is the cause of cellphones being invented without any supporting evidence for such a claim.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This would involve repeating a proposition incorrectly as evidence or conclusion. This argument isn’t repeating a statement.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This would involve assuming something is true because people believe it is. The argument does not rest on a presumed consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** This occurs when language used is unclear or vague. The language in the argument is clear but the logical connection it tries to establish is flawed.

**Identified Defective Argument Analysis (IDAA):**

Based on the definitions provided and the nature of the argument, it appears that the argument primarily fits under **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** and **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**. These flaws are prevalent because the argument attempts to establish a causation directly from the correlation of the speaker’s birth and the invention of cellphones without any reasonable supporting evidence.

**Conclusion:**

Applying <IDAA>, the argument "Cellphones weren’t invented before I was born. Now, they are everywhere! Therefore, cellphones were created because I was born." can primarily be categorized under:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
  
Additionally, it carries elements of:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
