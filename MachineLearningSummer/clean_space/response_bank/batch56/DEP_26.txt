To apply the classification of defective arguments to the statement "The officer told me to freeze but it was too hot out to be freezing, so I was justified in running away," we need to determine which type of defective argument it represents.

In this case, the individual is using the word "freeze" ambiguously. The command to "freeze" from the officer clearly meant to stop moving, but the person interpreted "freeze" in a literal sense related to temperature, thereby justifying their action of running away based on a misunderstanding of the command.

This argument fits the type defined as <DEP> (Ambiguous Language), where the ambiguity in the word "freeze" misleads the reasoning process. 

Therefore, the argument can be classified under <DEP>.
