It seems like you're referring to a type of fallacious argument when asking to apply <IDAA> to the given statement. Let's assume you intended <IDAA> to signify "Invalid Argument through Ad Hominem Attack."

Ad Hominem is a logical fallacy that occurs when someone attacks the character or traits of a person instead of addressing the arguments or positions they are presenting. This is often used to undermine the opponent without actually engaging with the substance of their argument.

To complete this thought, we could say:

"Personally attacking someone to shift attention away from your views is an example of <IDAA> (Invalid Argument through Ad Hominem Attack). This kind of approach fails to address the actual points being discussed and instead redirects the focus to irrelevant personal issues."

Here, we have clearly identified the fallacy being referred to (Ad Hominem Attack) and labeled it using the suggested identifier <IDAA>. This helps categorize and understand the nature of the argumentative defect in question.
