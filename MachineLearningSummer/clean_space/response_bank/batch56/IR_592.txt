Given that <IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application, let's analyze the argument presented:

"That lady had a rough day today. She woke up late, she was not able to eat breakfast, she missed the train and was late for work. My heart aches for this poor lady."

Let's identify if any defective argument types (from Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Presumptuous Consensus, or Ambiguous Language) are present in this argument.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Making broad claims based on limited evidence. This does not seem to be the case here, as the argument is focusing on a specific individual's experience.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Claiming comprehensive coverage without considering all possibilities. The argument lists several specific negative events but doesn't claim to cover all aspects of her rough day, so this doesn't apply.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Giving reasons that do not sufficiently support the conclusion. The examples given (waking up late, missing breakfast, train, and being late for work) do make it reasonable to infer she had a rough day, so this is not inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Claiming causal relationships without sufficient evidence. The statement doesn't imply any causal relationship aside from the sequence of misfortunes, so this isn't applicable here.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Repeatedly stating a proposition without additional support. The argument doesn't repetitively assert anything beyond the initial description.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Assuming agreement without basis. The statement does appeal to the reader's empathy but doesn't assume consensus on any broader point.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: Using language that is unclear or open to multiple interpretations. The language used is quite straightforward and specific, describing particular events.

Based on the analysis above, none of the listed defective argument types precisely fit this argument. However, if one were to stretch, one **might** argue that describing the negative events and then concluding with "My heart aches for this poor lady," is a type of emotional appeal, which is not a defective argument type listed but could be a fallacy of appeal to emotion.

Thus, since none of the specific defective argument types (Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Presumptuous Consensus, or Ambiguous Language) apply directly, this argument might not fit under the defined defective argument types (IDAA) described.
