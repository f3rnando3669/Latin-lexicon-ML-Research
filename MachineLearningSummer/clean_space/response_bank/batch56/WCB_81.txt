To apply the classification system of defective argument types to the statement "It’s cold on a summer day. Global warming is a hoax," we need to identify the logical flaws present in the argument. Here's how it applies:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This argument suggests that because it is cold on a summer day, global warming is not occurring. It doesn't take into account the full range of data and evidence required to evaluate global warming. One cold day is an incomplete and selective observation.

2. **Generalization (G)**: The argument takes a single instance of cold weather and generalizes it to refute global warming entirely, which is scientifically invalid. Global warming refers to long-term trends and averages in climate, not short-term weather variations.

3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument lacks a sufficient causal basis, as it falsely implies that global warming would mean there could never be a cold day in summer, which is incorrect. Local weather events do not directly disprove long-term climate trends.

By applying the defined defective argument types, the statement "It’s cold on a summer day. Global warming is a hoax." can be classified as follows:

1. **FE (Incomplete Enumeration)**
2. **G (Generalization)**
3. **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**

These classifications help highlight the logical deficiencies in the argument presented.
