For 
<IDAA> is a defective argument type known as **Inconsistent Application of a Principle or Standard**.

When someone is "using a double standard or arguing for an unjustified exception," they are applying an **Inconsistent Application of a Principle or Standard (IDAA)**. This occurs when a principle or standard is applied in one case but not in another similar case without a valid reason, thereby creating inconsistency and unfairness in the argument.

For example, if someone argues that one person should face severe consequences for a minor mistake but then argues that another person should be forgiven for a similar or worse mistake without providing a justifiable reason for the disparity, they are engaging in <IDAA>.
