For 
The fallacy in Hannah's argument pertains to discrediting a proposition based solely on someone's belief system acquired under questionable circumstances. 

This is a variation of the genetic fallacy, where the origin of the belief (friend being brainwashed) is used to discredit the belief itself (people being generally good), rather than addressing the evidence for or against the belief.

Therefore, this argument can be identified as:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**

Adding the defective argument definition:
Hannah argues that because her friend was brainwashed as a child into thinking that people are generally good, people are not generally good. <IR>
