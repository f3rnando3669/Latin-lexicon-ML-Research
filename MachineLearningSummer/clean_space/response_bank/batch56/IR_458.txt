For 
In the context you're providing, I understand that <IDAA> is a shorthand for identifying and annotating a defective argument. Let's apply <IDAA> to the phrase ", rather than considering the content of what the person is saying?":

If the phrase ", rather than considering the content of what the person is saying?" is used to highlight that the argument is being dismissed based on the source rather than the actual content, this could be indicative of an ad hominem fallacy, where the focus is shifted from the argument itself to the person making the argument. 

However, if we strictly stick to the defective argument types you've defined, let's analyze whether it fits any of them:

1. **Generalization (G):** This does not generalize a group based on an insufficient sample.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** It does not list options or possibilities incompletely.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The phrase doesn’t provide inconclusive reasoning for a conclusion.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** There is no causal relationship being insufficiently supported.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The argument isn’t being repeated erroneously.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** No consensus is being presumed without sufficient evidence.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The language here is relatively clear and unambiguous.

Since the phrase indicates dismissal based on speaker rather than content, it doesn’t fit neatly into one of the defined defective arguments. The most analogous choice among common logical fallacies would be an ad hominem attack. Given the categories defined, none perfectly encapsulates this specific fallacy.

Therefore, if creating a new category was permissible, ad hominem would categorize this. But since we are constrained to your given definitions, we would note that this doesn't fit any of the pre-defined defective arguments explicitly.
