The argument presented can be evaluated in terms of defective argument types as defined:

"We cannot listen to John’s opinion on global warming because he is a tree hugger.
No podemos escuchar la opinión de John sobre el calentamiento global porque es un abrazador de árboles."

This argument attacks John's character or identity instead of addressing the content of his opinion on global warming. This is an example of an **Ad Hominem** fallacy, where the argument is rejected based on an irrelevant personal characteristic.

Since "Ad Hominem" is not one of the defective argument types defined by <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP>, it doesn't specifically fit those categories, but it is worth noting as another common type of defective argument.

However, if reinterpreted to fit the defined defective arguments, one could loosely categorize this under <IR> (Inconclusive Reason). The reasoning provided (John is a tree hugger) is not logically conclusive in demonstrating why John’s opinion should be disregarded in discussions about global warming.

So, applying <IDAA> to this argument, one might output:

<IR>: The argument is inconclusive because it fails to logically connect John's characteristic ("tree hugger") with the validity of his opinion on global warming.
