It looks like you're defining various types of defective arguments and then asking to apply some kind of identifier to a specific reasoning provided. Based on your defined argument types, the example "ghosts must exist, because nobody has been able to prove that they don't" seems to be illustrating a specific kind of logical fallacy. 

This kind of reasoning is commonly known as an argument from ignorance (argumentum ad ignorantiam), where it asserts that something is true because it has not been proven false, or vice versa.

Given your defined argument types, the closest that fits this specific example is:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This is used for reasoning that fails to conclusively support the conclusion.

Thus, applying your format:

"ghosts must exist, because nobody has been able to prove that they don't" is an example of <IR>.
