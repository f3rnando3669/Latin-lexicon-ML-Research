To apply the defined defective argument types to the argument "Everyone who likes pizza likes pepperoni," let's analyze the nature of the defect:

- **Generalization (<G>):** This statement takes a specific preference (liking pepperoni) and generalizes it to everyone who likes pizza. Not all people who like pizza necessarily like pepperoni, so making such a broad generalization without sufficient evidence is flawed.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument fails to consider the variety of other preferences that pizza lovers might have. By suggesting that liking pepperoni is universal among pizza lovers, it leaves out those who might prefer other toppings like mushrooms, olives, or no meat at all.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reasoning behind linking a liking for pizza directly to a liking for pepperoni is inconclusive. There is no concrete evidence provided to support this specific correlation.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The statement implies a causal relationship, but it lacks sufficient evidence to establish why liking pizza should necessarily lead to liking pepperoni.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** If this argument is presented multiple times without additional evidence or reasoning, it becomes a faulty repetition. However, this context does not show a repetition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The statement assumes that there is a consensus among pizza lovers about liking pepperoni without any poll or study backing this assumption.

- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** The term "everyone" is ambiguous and too broad. It fails to specify exactly who is included, leading to an overgeneralization that weakens the argument.

Using <IDAA> (identifying defective argument application):
"Everyone who likes pizza likes pepperoni" is an example of:
- Generalization (<G>)
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
- Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)

These defective argument types highlight various weaknesses in the assertion, showing how it is overgeneralized, lacks evidence, and makes unwarranted assumptions about the preferences of all pizza lovers.
