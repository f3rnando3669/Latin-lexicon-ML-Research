To apply the identification and diagnosis of defective argument types (<IDAA>) to the statement provided, let's break down each part of the argument and identify any potential flaws:

1. **. If you don't pass this quiz, you will get a low grade.**
   - This part seems to imply a direct consequence without considering other factors that might influence a low grade. This could be an <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), as it oversimplifies the relationship between not passing a quiz and getting a low grade.

2. **. This will affect your score in the gradebook, you will fail Eng II.**
   - Here, the argument assumes that one low grade on a single quiz will directly lead to failing an entire course. This is a form of <G> (Generalization), as it makes a broad conclusion based on limited evidence.

3. **. You will not graduate Highschool.**
   - This claim is highly speculative, as it assumes that failing Eng II will inevitably prevent graduation. This could be an <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) because it lacks a sufficiently robust causal link and fails to account for other potential remedies or pathways to graduation, thereby making it also a <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).

4. **. You will not get a good job.**
   - This is a large leap from the initial premise of not passing a quiz. It assumes a direct linear impact from not passing a single quiz to career outcomes, which is an extreme case of <G> (Generalization) and also reflects <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis). Additionally, it may demonstrate <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus) as it presumes a universal consequence without considering individual variability.

Identified defective arguments in the statement:
- **Inconclusive Reason** (<IR>):
  1. If you don't pass this quiz, you will get a low grade.
  2. You will not graduate Highschool.

- **Generalization** (<G>):
  1. This will affect your score in the gradebook, you will fail Eng II.
  2. You will not get a good job.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis** (<WCB>):
  1. You will not graduate Highschool.
  2. You will not get a good job.

- **Presumptuous Consensus** (<FU>):
  1. You will not get a good job.

This breakdown uncovers a series of logical flaws and oversimplifications, demonstrating that the argument is replete with defective reasoning elements.
