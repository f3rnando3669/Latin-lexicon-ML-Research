It appears you want to identify defective arguments within the given statement:

Statement: "He’s not a great athlete; he’s a fraud, a cheat and a liar. That’s why not everybody is ‘happy for Lance.'"

Let's analyze this:

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - This defective argument type might claim that because Lance is a fraud, cheat, and liar, he cannot be a great athlete. While these characteristics are negative, they do not inherently define his athletic abilities. So, there’s an implied overgeneralization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - This type is not explicitly present here, since the argument doesn't attempt to list all possible characteristics of Lance or doesn’t provide an incomplete list to support the conclusion. 

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - The statement implies that being a fraud, cheat, and liar are reasons enough to judge his athletic capacity or why not everyone is happy for him. However, these reasons alone might not provide a complete or conclusive basis for these judgments.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - The statement links Lance being a fraud, cheat, and liar to the conclusion that not everyone is happy for him. While these traits may affect public opinion, the argument does not establish a specific causal relationship explaining why these traits directly cause a lack of support.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - This type involves repetition of a claim as a proof of itself. The statement does not seem to repeat its propositions to substantiate its argument, so this defect is not prominent here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - This argument assumes a consensus or agreement that people react negatively to Lance due to his fraud, cheating, and lying, without providing evidence of such a majority consensus. 

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - The terms "fraud," "cheat," and "liar" are quite clear and not ambiguous. The statement does not appear to use language that is specifically ambiguous so this defective argument type does not apply strongly here.

Based on this analysis, the most relevant defective argument types in this statement are:

- <G> Generalization
- <IR> Inconclusive Reason
- <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis
- <FU> Presumptuous Consensus
