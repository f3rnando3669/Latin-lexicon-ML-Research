For 
The statement "Preys on people’s emotions and sensitivities, can turn into a slippery slope" seems to describe a defective argument that often leverages emotional manipulation and slippery slope fallacies. Applying the provided defective argument types to this statement:

1. **Preys on people’s emotions and sensitivities**:
   - This part of the statement suggests an attempt to manipulate the audience emotionally rather than providing a logical or factual basis. This could imply a defective argument type under <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), as it relies on emotional appeal rather than solid reasoning.

2. **Can turn into a slippery slope**:
   - The term "slippery slope" describes a fallacy where it's assumed that a relatively small first step leads to a chain of related events culminating in some significant impact. This is a form of defective reasoning that implies adverse outcomes without sufficient evidence or causal link.

However, the specific defective argument types provided don’t explicitly include a classic slippery slope fallacy, but we can align it to the closest types based on the context:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The slippery slope element suggests insufficient evidence for the claimed chain of events, making this applicable.

Taking both parts into account:

- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** for the emotional manipulation aspect.
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)** for the slippery slope component.

Thus, the application of defective argument types to the statement "Preys on people’s emotions and sensitivities, can turn into a slippery slope" would fall under <IR> and <WCB>.
