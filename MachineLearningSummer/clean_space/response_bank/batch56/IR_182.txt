For 
<IDAA> refers to "Identify Defective Argument Application."

Let's apply <IDAA> to the statement: 

"My opponent raises a good point, but can we really trust him? I mean, he moved to this town only two years ago and everyone knows that his wife left him."

This statement seems to be employing a logical fallacy known as **ad hominem**, where instead of addressing the opponent's argument, the speaker attacks the opponent's character or personal history. 

The specific defective argument types from your list that might apply are:
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The statements about the opponent's recent move and marital issues do not provide valid reasons to dismiss his argument.
   - **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** There may be vague implications about the opponent's character (e.g., "everyone knows that his wife left him"), but it's not clear how this relates to his trustworthiness in the context of the argument.

Thus, the defective argument types that we can identify in this statement are primarily <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) with a potential element of <DEP> (Ambiguous Language) if we consider the indirect assumptions being made.
