For 
<IDAA>, or Identifying Defective Arguments Applied, involves pinpointing the use of flawed reasoning in a given statement. Let’s analyze the argument:

"The level of mercury in seafood may be unsafe, but what will fishers do to support their families?"

This argument attempts to divert attention from the issue of mercury levels in seafood by shifting focus to the economic impact on fishers. This type of reasoning is generally known as a **red herring** fallacy—a distraction from the initial issue by bringing in an irrelevant point.

However, given the list of specific defective arguments defined, we should identify which one best captures the problem with this argument. None of the defined types perfectly fits this specific red herring fallacy, but we can look for the closest match.

1. **Generalization (G)**: Involves making broad claims with insufficient evidence.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Fails to consider all possible options.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Draws a conclusion from premises that don’t sufficiently support it.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Claims a causal relationship without enough evidence.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Repeats a claim without adequate support.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assumes agreement or consensus without basis.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Uses unclear or vague language.

The argument seems to fall under **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**. It implies that the only consequence of addressing mercury levels in seafood is the economic plight of fishers, ignoring other potential solutions or compensatory actions that can be taken to support fishers while ensuring food safety.

Thus, applying <IDAA>:

"The level of mercury in seafood may be unsafe, but what will fishers do to support their families?" showcases an <FE> argument by failing to consider alternative approaches to support fishers apart from ignoring the mercury issue. This incomplete consideration diverts the discussion from finding a balanced solution that ensures both public health and economic stability for fishers.
