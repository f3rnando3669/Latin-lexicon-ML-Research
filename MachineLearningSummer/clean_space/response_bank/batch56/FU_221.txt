For 
To analyze the statement "Rush to shop at Super-Mart this weekend, everyone is doing it!" using the defined defective argument types, we need to break down the components of the argument and see which predefined defective argument type(s) it fits.

1. **Generalization (G):** Making broad statements based on limited evidence.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Failing to consider all relevant alternatives or aspects.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Using a reason that does not adequately support the conclusion.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Claiming a causal relationship without sufficient evidence.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Repeating a proposition regardless of its validity.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Assuming something is true because many people believe it.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** Using language that is unclear or misleading.

Applying these to the statement:

"Rush to shop at Super-Mart this weekend, everyone is doing it!"

This advertisement seems to rely on the notion that because a lot of people are supposedly shopping at Super-Mart, you should too. This fits the following defective argument type:

1. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument assumes that because "everyone" is shopping at Super-Mart, it must be the correct or desirable action for you to take as well. This is an appeal to popularity, where the consensus is presumed to be a valid reason without further supporting evidence.

Thus, the statement "Rush to shop at Super-Mart this weekend, everyone is doing it!" is an example of a defective argument due to **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.
