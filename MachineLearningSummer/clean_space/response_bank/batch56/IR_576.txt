For 
<IDAA>, or Identifying Defective Argument Application, categorizes the described argument type in the given scenario.

The provided description, "attaching an argument to a person of false or appeared authority in order to give credence to their argument," falls into a specific form of defective argument known as **Appeal to False Authority**.

Appeal to False Authority occurs when an argument is deemed credible not because of the merits of the argument itself, but rather because it is associated with someone who lacks genuine authority or expertise in the relevant field.

Since "attaching an argument to a person of false or appeared authority" is the essence of an Appeal to False Authority, it should be considered a defective argument.

Therefore, the application of <IDAA> identifies this as appealing to a fallacious form of authority. We can define a new term for this defective argument type:

**Define <FA> to be a defective argument type called False Authority.**

Applying <IDAA>:

- **Analysis**: "Attaching an argument to a person of false or appeared authority in order to give credence to their argument."
- **Defective Argument Type Identified**: False Authority (<FA>).

Using <FA>:

The scenario described fits the definition of False Authority (<FA>), thus it is categorized under this defective argument type.
