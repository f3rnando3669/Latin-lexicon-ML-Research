For 
It seems there might be a misunderstanding or typo around "<IDAA>" as it hasn't been defined in your provided list of defective argument types. I'll focus on the argument you provided:

"If you don't turn in your homework, you will be getting a call home."

This argument can be analyzed based on the defective argument types you've defined:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument does not appear to be a generalization as it makes a specific claim about a specific scenario.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This might apply if there are other possible consequences of not turning in the homework that aren't mentioned.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This could apply if the reason given (a call home) does not necessarily follow from the premise (not turning in homework). However, context from school policies might make the reason conclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This might apply if there is no clear causal link between not turning in homework and receiving a call home.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This doesn't seem to apply, as the argument isn't repeating itself.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This argument does not seem to rely on presumed consensus or opinions of others.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The language in this case seems quite straightforward and unambiguous.

Based on the available types and the given argument, the most suitable defective argument types that might apply are:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument doesn't consider other possible outcomes of not turning in homework.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: There may not be a strong causal link presented between not turning in homework and getting a call home.

To fully apply **<IDAA>** more documentation would be needed to define its criteria.
