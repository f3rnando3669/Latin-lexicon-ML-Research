For 
"X is popular; therefore, X is right." 

Here is how the defective argument types apply:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument could be seen as overgeneralizing the idea that popularity equates to correctness. Just because something is popular does not mean it is right in all cases.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument fails to consider other possibilities or factors that might contribute to something being right or wrong beyond its popularity. It does not enumerate all the necessary aspects required to determine correctness.

3. **Inconclusive Reasons (<IR>)**: The claim "X is popular" does not provide a conclusive reason for the claim "X is right." Popularity is not a sufficient basis to determine correctness.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This argument lacks a sufficient causal connection. The fact that something is popular does not establish a causal link to its correctness.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This does not seem to apply directly to the argument as there is no repetition of the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument assumes that consensus (popularity) directly equates to correctness without any additional evidence or justification, which is a presumptuous leap.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The term "popular" can be vague and context-dependent. What does popular mean in this context? Is it widespread acceptance, the number of people who agree, or how frequently it is discussed? Ambiguity in the term "popular" can undermine the argument's clarity.

Overall, this argument primarily suffers from **Generalization (<G>)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**, **Inconclusive Reasons (<IR>)**, **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**, **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**, and potentially **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**, making it quite a defective argument.
