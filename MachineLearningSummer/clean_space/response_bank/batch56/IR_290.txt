For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application. To apply the identification of defective argument types to the statement "Nobody in their right mind would trust that guy. I mean, look at him!" let's break it down and match it with the defined defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This statement makes a sweeping generalization that nobody would trust the person in question. It provides no specific evidence or reasoning beyond the speaker's personal impression and appearance of the person.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement does not list or consider any specific reasons that might account for why someone might or might not trust the person, other than their appearance.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument that one should not trust the person based solely on looking at them ("look at him!") is an inconclusive reason. Appearance alone is not sufficient evidence to determine trustworthiness.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The statement implies a causal relationship between the person's appearance and their trustworthiness, but this causal basis is insufficiently supported.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This type does not seem directly applicable here because there isn't a repetition of a proposition in the statement.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The statement presumes unanimous agreement ("nobody in their right mind") without providing evidence that others share this opinion, making it presumptuously consensus-based.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: There isn't necessarily ambiguous language in this statement, as the message is relatively clear. However, terms like "in their right mind" could be considered vaguely defined, but this is less prominent than the other defects identified.

So, the applicable defective argument types for the statement "Nobody in their right mind would trust that guy. I mean, look at him!" are:

- <G> Generalization
- <FE> Incomplete Enumeration
- <IR> Inconclusive Reason
- <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis
- <FU> Presumptuous Consensus
