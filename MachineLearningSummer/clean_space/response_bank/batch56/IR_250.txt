For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying and Diagnosing a Defective Argument. Let's apply it to the given statement:

"Since Dwayne Johnson (aka The Rock) endorsed this protein powder, it must work wonders."

To identify and diagnose the defective argument in this statement, we'll analyze it for the types of defective argument forms defined:

1. **Generalization (G)**: The argument doesn't seem to broadly generalize from a limited sample, so this argument form does not apply.
  
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument doesn't list a selective subset of factors or evidence, so this argument form does not apply.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument relies on the endorsement of a celebrity without providing objective evidence for the effectiveness of the protein powder, which is inconclusive. The status of Dwayne Johnson as a celebrity doesn't logically guarantee the effectiveness of the product.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument presumes a causal relationship (endorsement implies effectiveness) without sufficient evidence for a causal link.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The argument doesn't repeat a proposition, so this argument form does not apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument doesn't assume a consensus, rather it assumes effectiveness based on a single personâ€™s endorsement, so this argument form does not apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language used in the argument is not ambiguous; it is quite specific, so this argument form does not apply.

Based on the analysis, the main defective argument forms present in the statement are:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Because it relies on celebrity endorsement rather than objective evidence.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Because it presumes a causal relationship without providing proof.

Identified and Diagnosed Defective Argument Types: 
- <IR>
- <WCB>

Thus, the statement "Since Dwayne Johnson (aka The Rock) endorsed this protein powder, it must work wonders." is faulty because it contains Inconclusive Reason (<IR>) and Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).
