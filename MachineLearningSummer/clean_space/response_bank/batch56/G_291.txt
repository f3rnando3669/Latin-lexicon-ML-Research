For 
<IDAA> stands for identifying defective argument types. Let's apply it to the given statement:

"I know three redheads who have terrible tempers, and since Annabel has red hair, I’ll bet she has a terrible temper, too."

This statement contains a couple of possible defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: The argument assumes that because three redheads the subject knows have terrible tempers, all redheads must have terrible tempers. This is a hasty generalization based on a very small and non-representative sample.

2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument implies a causal relationship between having red hair and having a terrible temper without sufficient evidence to support this causal connection. It presumes that red hair causes or is strongly linked to having a terrible temper, but there is no evidence provided for such a causal relationship.

So, the statement "I know three redheads who have terrible tempers, and since Annabel has red hair, I’ll bet she has a terrible temper, too." contains defective arguments of type <G> Generalization and <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis.
