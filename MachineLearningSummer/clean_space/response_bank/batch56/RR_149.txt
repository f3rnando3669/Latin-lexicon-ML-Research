For 
To apply the process of Identifying Defective Argumentation Attributes (IDAA) to the statement "Fast food is bad for you because it is junk," let's analyze which defective argument types are present in this argument.

1. **Generalization (G)**: This involves making a broad statement based on limited evidence. By saying "fast food is bad for you" without specifying in what way or providing evidence, the argument might be seen as a generalization. However, it combines this with a more specific label (junk), so this is a borderline case.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This involves presenting a limited set of possibilities but suggesting that they cover the full spectrum. The argument does not provide specific reasons why fast food is bad, but simply labels it as "junk" without enumerating any particular harmful effects.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This occurs when the reason given does not conclusively support the conclusion. Saying that fast food is bad because it is junk does not provide a clear or logical link. The term "junk" is vague and subjective, failing to offer conclusive reasoning as to why fast food is harmful.
   
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This arises when a causal claim is made without sufficient evidence. The argument fails to provide evidence or mechanisms showing why fast food, labeled as "junk," is necessarily bad for health. The causal connection is implied but not substantiated.
   
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This involves repeating a claim without adding new evidence or reasoning. In this case, the term "junk" does not carry new informational content or a clear basis for why fast food is undesirable health-wise, so it could be seen as a form of faulty repetition.
   
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This happens when an argument assumes a consensus without evidence. The statement does not seem to assume a consensus; it rather makes a claim that could be open to subjective interpretation.
   
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This involves using unclear or vague terminology that can be interpreted differently. The term "junk" is indeed ambiguous and does not specify what aspects of fast food are problematic.

**Summary of Defective Argument Types Involved:**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not list specific reasons why fast food is harmful, simply calling it "junk."
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning "it is junk" does not substantiate why fast food is harmful.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is no evidence provided to support the causal claim that fast food is bad for health because it is labeled as "junk."
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The term "junk" is vague and does not clearly indicate why fast food is harmful.

Thus, the primary defective argument types identified in the statement "Fast food is bad for you because it is junk" are <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, and <DEP>.
