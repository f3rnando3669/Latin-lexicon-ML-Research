To apply the Identification of Defective Argument Applications (IDAA) to the statement “Yeah, I think everyone's opinion counts on moral matters like that, but that Lila sleeps around with anything. I know of at least one marriage she's broken up, so why should her opinion count on anything, much less morality?”, we need to identify the specific types of defective arguments present in the statement.

Let’s break down the argument:

1. **Initial Claim:**
   "Yeah, I think everyone's opinion counts on moral matters like that..."
   This is a general statement asserting that everyone's opinion is valid on moral issues.

2. **Contradictory Statement:**
   "...but that Lila sleeps around with anything. I know of at least one marriage she's broken up, so why should her opinion count on anything, much less morality?"
   Here, the speaker is making an exception to their initial claim based on Lila's actions.

Let's analyze the defects in this argument:

1. **Generalization (G):**
   The speaker initially makes a broad generalization that everyone’s opinion counts on moral matters but then contradicts this by excluding Lila, which may not be justified within the context of the initial claim.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   The reasoning provided for discounting Lila’s opinion (“I know of at least one marriage she's broken up”) does not conclusively show that her opinion on moral matters is inherently invalid. The argument fails to establish a strong causal link between Lila's actions and the validity of her opinions on morality.

3. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   The phrase "sleeps around with anything" is vague and potentially biased or loaded with judgment. This ambiguous language can distort the argument by appealing more to emotional response than logical analysis.

4. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   The initial claim "everyone's opinion counts on moral matters" presumes a consensus that might not be fully justified or explored. This reliance on presumed agreement falls short in supporting the argument's validity.

Therefore, the statement contains multiple defective argument types: <G> Generalization, <IR> Inconclusive Reason, <DEP> Ambiguous Language, and <FU> Presumptuous Consensus. We can represent this in shorthand as:

<IDAA> <G>, <IR>, <DEP>, <FU>

This accurately captures the specific defective argument types present in the original statement.
