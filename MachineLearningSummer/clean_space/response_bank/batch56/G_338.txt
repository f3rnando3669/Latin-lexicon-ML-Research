Applying the classification of defective argument types to the statement: 

"The last Democrat winner of the New Hampshire primary won the general election. This year, the winner of the New Hampshire primary will win the general election."

Let's break it down:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument appears to attempt to generalize from a single instance (the last Democrat winner) to all future elections. Generalizations are usually formed based on one or a limited number of observations. This argument assumes a pattern without sufficient supporting evidence.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not consider all relevant cases or details, such as other winners of the New Hampshire primary who did not go on to win the general election. This makes the argument an incomplete enumeration, as it's based on selective evidence.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning provided does not conclusively lead to the conclusion. The fact that one winner of the New Hampshire primary won the general election is not strong enough to conclude that another will definitely win. 

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument seems to imply a causal relationship between winning the New Hampshire primary and winning the general election without sufficient evidence to establish that causality.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: There is no repetition of the proposition in this argument, so this does not apply here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument does not invoke any consensus or widespread agreement that is unjustified, so this does not apply here.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The argument does not use ambiguous language or terms that would create confusion about its meaning, so this does not apply here.

In summary, the defective argument types that apply to this statement are:

**Generalization (G)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
