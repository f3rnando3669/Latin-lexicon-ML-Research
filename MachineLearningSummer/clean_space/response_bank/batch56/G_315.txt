For 
The argument "Three congressional representatives have had affairs. Therefore, members of Congress are adulterers." can be evaluated using the defective argument types defined. 

The most applicable defective argument type for this argument is:

*Generalization (G)*

This is because the argument takes a small number of cases (three congressional representatives) and generalizes that all members of Congress are adulterers. This is a classic example of overgeneralization based on insufficient evidence. 

Therefore, applying the defective argument type:

"Three congressional representatives have had affairs. Therefore, members of Congress are adulterers." is an instance of *Generalization (G)*.
