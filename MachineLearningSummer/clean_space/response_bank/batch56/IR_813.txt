For 
The argument in question is: "We should move to the midwest because the Wall Street Journal says the cost of living is cheaper there."

To identify whether this argument falls under any of the defined defective argument types, let's break it down:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This type of defect occurs when a conclusion about a group is drawn from an unrepresentative or insufficient sample. 
   - Example: "All people in the midwest are friendly because my one friend from Ohio is nice."

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This type occurs when the argument lists incomplete or insufficient cases to support a conclusion.
   - Example: "You must be careful when driving in the midwest because I know three people who had accidents there."

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This type happens when the reason given does not sufficiently support the conclusion.
   - Example: "We should buy this car because it's blue."

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This type occurs when the cause given does not logically lead to the effect.
   - Example: "Eating carrots will give you excellent vision because rabbits eat carrots."

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This defect occurs when the argument simply repeats the proposition instead of providing justification.
   - Example: "We should move to the midwest because it's a good idea to move to the midwest."

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This occurs when the argument assumes consensus or agreement without sufficient basis.
   - Example: "Everyone agrees that moving to the midwest is the best choice."

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This type happens when the argument relies on vague or ambiguous terms.
   - Example: "Living in the midwest is more wholesome."

For the given argument: "We should move to the midwest because the Wall Street Journal says the cost of living is cheaper there."

- The argument hinges on the assertion from the Wall Street Journal about the cost of living. The potential defect seems to be on whether this reason alone sufficiently supports the conclusion.

Applying <IDAA>:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument relies solely on the cost of living being cheaper, without considering other important factors (e.g., employment opportunities, climate, quality of life). It depends on a single point of data, making it an incomplete enumeration of the reasons one might consider when deciding to move.

Thus, the argument can be identified as having the defect type **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** because it relies on a single factor (cost of living) to support a significant decision (moving to the midwest), without considering a comprehensive list of relevant factors.
