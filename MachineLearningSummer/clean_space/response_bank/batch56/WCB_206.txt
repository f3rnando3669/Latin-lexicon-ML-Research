The argument "Every time that rooster crows, the sun comes up. The rooster must control the sun." can be identified as defective using the following types:

**Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This argument assumes a causal relationship between the rooster crowing and the sun rising without sufficient evidence to support that claim. Just because two events occur together does not mean one causes the other.

**Generalization (G)**: The argument might also be considered a form of hasty generalization, as it draws a broad conclusion based on a limited observation (i.e., every observed instance of the rooster crowing is followed by the sun rising).

By applying <IDAA> (Identification of Defective Argument Analysis), we see the argument relies on an incorrect assumption of causation and a potentially overreaching generalization.
