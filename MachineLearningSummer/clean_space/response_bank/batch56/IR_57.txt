For 
Identifying Defective Argument Types Applied (IDAA) for the given argument:

"My philosophy professor believes in ghosts and goes to séances. She’s an intelligent, educated person, so ghosts must be real, and spiritualism must be true."

1. **Generalization (G)**: The argument takes the specific instance of a philosophy professor's beliefs and generalizes them to make a broader claim about the reality of ghosts and the truth of spiritualism. Just because one educated person believes in something doesn't make it generally true.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument fails to consider the wide range of educated and intelligent people who might not believe in ghosts or spiritualism. It presents the professor's belief as if it were a comprehensive representation of educated opinion.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument uses the professor's intelligence and education as the primary reason to conclude that ghosts are real and spiritualism is true, which is a non-sequitur. The fact that an intelligent and educated person believes in something does not provide conclusive evidence for its truth.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is an implied causation that because the professor is intelligent and believes in ghosts, her intelligence somehow validates the existence of ghosts. This is an insufficient causal basis since intelligence alone does not determine the truth of supernatural claims.

5. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument presumes that because an intelligent person believes in ghosts, there is an implicit consensus or validation of this belief among educated people, which is presumptuous and not supported by evidence. It assumes a consensus where none necessarily exists.

By applying IDAA, we can see that the argument is riddled with multiple defective arguments that undermine its validity.
