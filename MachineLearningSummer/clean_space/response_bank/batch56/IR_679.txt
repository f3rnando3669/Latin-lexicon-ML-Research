For 
The argument "I've never been hit by lightning when standing under a tree so we'll be perfectly safe to shelter by this oak now" can be identified as containing a defective argument type known as Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>).

Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>): This type of defective argument occurs when an argument makes a conclusion based on an incomplete set of evidence or instances, ignoring other important situations or relevant examples.

In this case, the speaker is using the fact that they have never been hit by lightning when standing under a tree as the sole basis for concluding that it is safe to shelter by the oak tree during a storm. This ignores the general danger of lightning strikes to those standing under trees, as well as statistical evidence and recommendations from experts on the subject, making the argument incomplete and potentially misleading.

Therefore, the argument applies to the <FE> classification.
