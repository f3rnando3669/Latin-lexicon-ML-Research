For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application.

Let's apply <IDAA> to the statement: "or group in order to discredit an idea with which the person or group is associated; distracts the reader from the real issue."

First, we need to determine which defective argument type is being used in the statement:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This involves making a broad generalization based on limited evidence.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This occurs when the argument lists some possibilities but omits others that could be relevant.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This type of argument presents reasons that do not sufficiently support the conclusion.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This happens when a causal relationship is established on inadequate grounds.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This involves repeating the proposition without providing new evidence or reasoning.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This assumes that a consensus exists without proper justification.
7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This employs language that is vague or unclear, leading to confusion or misunderstanding.

Now, let's dissect the statement:

- "or group in order to discredit an idea with which the person or group is associated; distracts the reader from the real issue"

This statement suggests discrediting a person or group to divert attention from the main issue. This is a technique often referred to as an *ad hominem* attack, where the focus is shifted from the argument to the people associated with the argument.

Based on the definitions of the defective argument types, this statement seems to align most closely with **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**. The phrasing is vague and does not clearly articulate how the distraction occurs or what the real issue is. It leaves key details unspecified, leading to potential confusion.

Therefore, applying <IDAA> identifies "Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)" as the defective argument type present in the statement.
