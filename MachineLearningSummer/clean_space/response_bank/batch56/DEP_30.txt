Applying "Identify Defective Argument Types" (IDAA) to the statement: "He said a lovely lady like me doesn't have to worry about his bear because this is a man-eating bear."

1. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The term "man-eating bear" could lead to ambiguity. While it clearly means the bear eats humans, "man" could be interpreted in a gender-specific way, which is likely irrelevant here but adds a layer of ambiguity. However, the phrase "lovely lady like me" adds a more direct level of ambiguity by using language that could be interpreted subjectively and distracts from the logical structure of the argument.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument presumes that the only factor determining the bear's behavior is its designation as a "man-eating" bear, without considering other factors like the bear being domesticated, trained, or any mitigating circumstances that could affect whether the lady is safe.

3. **Generalization (G)**: The statement generalizes that because the bear is a "man-eating bear" (without providing evidence of its selective behavior towards different humans), it inherently won't pose a threat to women. This ignores individual behavior of the bear and assumes broad characteristics about its actions.

Multiple defective arguments are at play, most notably **DEP (Ambiguous Language)** with the unclear use of "lovely lady" and the intent behind "man-eating bear", as well as **FE (Incomplete Enumeration)** and **G (Generalization)** due to the undue simplicity of the argument.
