For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application. Let's analyze the argument:

"I used to have that haircut. Then my mom got a job."

Here's how the various defective argument types may apply:

- **Generalization (G)**: There is no clear generalization being made about a broader group based on limited examples.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not attempt to list possibilities or items incompletely.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: There seems to be an implication or assumption that the two events are connected, but it does not provide sufficient reasoning to support a conclusion about that connection. This would fit the type <IR> as it does not conclusively establish a relevant relationship between the two events.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument suggests a temporal sequence (first, a haircut, then the mom getting a job) but fails to establish a causal connection. This would be best characterized as <WCB>.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: There is no repetition of propositions here.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There is no appeal to a presumed consensus in this argument.

- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: There is no language here that seems significantly ambiguous or open to multiple interpretations relevant to the argumentâ€™s point.

Thus, the defective argument classifications that apply here are primarily:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
