Applying the Identification of Defective Argument Types Analysis (IDAA) to the statement: 

“Eating five candy bars and drinking two sodas before a test helps me get better grades. I did that and got an A on my last test in history.”

Let's break down the argument and identify the fallacies:

1. **Generalization (G):** The individual makes a broad claim that eating candy bars and drinking sodas before tests helps improve grades, based on a single instance rather than reliable evidence.

2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The argument assumes a cause-and-effect relationship between eating and drinking sugary products and getting better grades without sufficient evidence. There is no proof that these actions directly led to the A on the history test.

The primary defective argument types here are:
- **Generalization (G)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

The statement is an example of both a **Generalization** fallacy and an **Insufficient Causal Basis** fallacy.
