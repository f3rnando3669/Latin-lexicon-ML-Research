For 
To analyze the argument "I'm gonna get an iPhone because everybody else has an iPhone and they're cool." using the defective argument types defined as <IDAA> (Identify, Describe, Analyze, and Assess), we can proceed as follows:

**Identify:**
1. **Type of Defective Argument:** Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)

**Describe:**
1. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This type of defective argument assumes that a proposition is true or good simply because many people believe it or do it. It tends to rely on the notion of social proof rather than logical evidence or sound reasoning.

**Analyze:**
1. The argument states that the reason for getting an iPhone is that "everybody else has an iPhone" and that they are "cool."
2. This reasoning presumes that the majority's choice validates the value or correctness of the decision (getting an iPhone), regardless of individual needs, preferences, or objective evaluation of the product's features and benefits.

**Assess:**
1. **Flaw 1: Lack of Individual Evaluation**
   - The argument does not consider whether an iPhone is the best choice for the individual's specific needs. Just because many people have an iPhone does not necessarily mean it is the best option for everyone.

2. **Flaw 2: Appeal to Popularity (Bandwagon Fallacy)**
   - Reliance on the fact that "everybody else" has an iPhone falls into the bandwagon fallacy. Popularity alone is not a robust or reliable criterion for making decisions.

3. **Flaw 3: Vague Criteria ("Cool")**
   - The term "cool" is subjective and ambiguous (<DEP>). What is cool for one person may not be cool for another. This lack of precise criteria weakens the argument as it fails to provide concrete, objective reasons.

In conclusion, using the defective argument type Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>) and considering the ambiguity in the term "cool" (<DEP>), the argument "I'm gonna get an iPhone because everybody else has an iPhone and they're cool" is deficient and does not provide a solid, logical basis for making the decision to purchase an iPhone.
