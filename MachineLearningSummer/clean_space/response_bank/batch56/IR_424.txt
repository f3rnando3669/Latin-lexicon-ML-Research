Let's break down the application of the defective argument types to the argument you have provided:

**Argument:**
"In our psychology department, half of the faculty believe that a behavioral approach is the only valid approach; the other half believe that the only valid approach is psychodynamic. Obviously the most valid approach must be one that incorporates both behavioral and psychodynamic elements."

**Defective Argument Analysis (<IDAA>):**

1. **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** The argument concludes that the most valid approach must incorporate both behavioral and psychodynamic elements based solely on the fact that the faculty is divided. This does not inherently make the combined approach the most valid; it merely highlights differing opinions without sufficient evidence to determine the best approach.

2. **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language):** The phrase "most valid approach" is ambiguous. It is not clearly defined what criteria are being used to determine validity, and the argument does not explain why incorporating both elements would fulfill those criteria better than other potential approaches.

3. **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The argument assumes a causal relationship between the division of faculty opinion and the validity of a combined approach without providing adequate evidence. Just because both approaches are valued by equal numbers does not mean a combination is scientifically or practically superior.

4. **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):** The argument presents a binary choice between behavioral and psychodynamic approaches but does not consider other valid approaches in psychology that might also be effective or more so than the combination suggested.

**Conclusion:**
The argument suffers from multiple defects:
- It provides inconclusive reasons (<IR>).
- It uses ambiguous language without clear definitions (<DEP>).
- It assumes a causal basis without sufficient evidence (<WCB>).
- It relies on incomplete enumeration by ignoring other potential approaches (<FE>).

The argument needs to be strengthened by providing concrete evidence for why a combination of behavioral and psychodynamic approaches would be valid, clearly defining what "valid" means in this context, and considering other possible approaches beyond the binary presented.
