For 
<IDAA> refers to a defective argument type known as "Argumentum ad Ignorantiam" or Appeal to Ignorance. This type of argument attempts to assert a claim is true because it has not been proven false, or that it is false because it has not been proven true.

In the given statement:

"Although we have proven that the moon is not made of spare ribs, we have not proven that its core cannot be filled with them; therefore, the moon’s core is filled with spare ribs.

X is true because you cannot prove that X is false.
X is false because you cannot prove that X is true."

This clearly demonstrates the <IDAA>, Appeal to Ignorance, because it bases the assertion that the moon’s core is filled with spare ribs on the lack of evidence to the contrary. The statement claims the truth of a proposition merely because it hasn’t been disproven, which is a textbook example of Argumentum ad Ignorantiam.
