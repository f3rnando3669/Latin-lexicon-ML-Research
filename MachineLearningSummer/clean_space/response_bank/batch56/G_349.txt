In order to apply <IDAA> to this argument, we need to identify the specific types of defective arguments that the statement might be illustrating. The argument provided is:

"It is warmer this year in Las Vegas as compared to last year; therefore, global warming is rapidly accelerating."

Let's dissect the argument step by step and identify the relevant defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   The argument takes a specific local observation (Las Vegas being warmer this year compared to last year) and generalizes it to make a broad claim about global warming.
   
   **Application:**
   - This argument fits the Generalization defect because it extrapolates a short-term, localized weather pattern to make a sweeping conclusion about a long-term global climate phenomenon.
  
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   The argument does not consider other years or other locations, providing an incomplete enumeration of data points required for a robust conclusion.
   
   **Application:**
   - Incomplete Enumeration is relevant here since the argument fails to account for more extensive data, such as temperature trends over a longer period or in multiple regions.

3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   The argument assumes that the observed warmth in Las Vegas is directly caused by rapidly accelerating global warming without providing sufficient causal links or eliminating other possible causes (e.g., natural variability, localized effects).
   
   **Application:**
   - This argument displays an Insufficient Causal Basis because it jumps to a causal relationship without demonstrating the necessary evidence.

4. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   The premises given (warmer year in Las Vegas) do not conclusively support the claim (rapid acceleration of global warming).
   
   **Application:**
   - The Inconclusive Reason defect is present as there is a weak logical connection between the localized observation and the broad conclusion.

Considering these points, the argument provided appears to exhibit multiple defective argument types, specifically Generalization <G>, Incomplete Enumeration <FE>, Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>, and Inconclusive Reason <IR>.

Thus, the defective arguments identified in this statement are:

**<G> Generalization**
**<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**
**<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**
**<IR> Inconclusive Reason**
