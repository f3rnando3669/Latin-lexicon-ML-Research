Applying the defective argument types to the conversation between Jojo and Charli:

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - Jojo begins with a sweeping generalization: "All New Yorkers are tough."
   - This statement is too broad and does not account for individual variation.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - When Charli contests this point by providing a counterexample with personal experience ("I get shoved in a locker every day and cry when I see bunnies"), Jojo dismisses it by shifting the criteria ("Well, REAL New Yorkers are tough").
   - This reasoning does not conclusively address the counterexample presented by Charli.

3. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - Jojo's response, "Well, REAL New Yorkers are tough," is ambiguous. The term "REAL New Yorkers" is not clearly defined.
   - The criteria for considering someone a "REAL" New Yorker remain vague and open to subjective interpretation.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - Jojo's assertion that being tough is inherently linked to being a New Yorker lacks sufficient causal basis.
   - There isn’t compelling evidence presented to substantiate the causal link between geographic location and the trait of toughness.

5. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - Jojo’s assertion implies a presumed consensus that toughness is a universally accepted characteristic of New Yorkers ("Todos los neoyorquinos son duros"). 
   - This assumption presumes universal agreement without sufficient backing.

6. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - Jojo repeats the same proposition, first in English and then in Spanish ("Todos los neoyorquinos son duros"), without addressing Charli's queries or counterexamples.
   - Simply repeating the claim does not strengthen the argument.

7. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - Jojo does not consider or enumerate the existence of New Yorkers who may not fit the general characteristic of toughness.
   - This incomplete enumeration fails to recognize the diversity of individuals in New York.

Applying these defective arguments analyses, the conversation has multiple logical flaws, with Jojo failing to robustly support their claims and dismissing Charli's valid counterexamples without proper justification.
