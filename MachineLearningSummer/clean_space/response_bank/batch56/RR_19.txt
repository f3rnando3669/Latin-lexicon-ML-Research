For 
The argument "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there." can be analyzed for defective argument types using the definitions provided:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This might suggest a generalization if the statement implies that just because the restaurant is popular among some people, it is exceptional in quality or service.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This is not applicable here, as the argument is not listing exhaustively or partially.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This is not a fit, as the reasoning is not presented as weak or inconclusive in the traditional sense.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument states a cause-effect relationship (popularity is because everyone goes there), but it doesn't provide sufficient evidence to justify why this causality existsâ€”it could be circular reasoning implying a possible insufficient causal basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: There is no repetition in the given argument.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This argument assumes consensus ("everyone in town goes there") as the basis of its claim (popularity), which can be flawed reasoning due to the unsupported general assumption of universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This is not applicable, as the language here is direct and not ambiguous.

Therefore, the identified defect in this argument would be <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus) because it presumes a consensus (that everyone in town goes there) to justify its claim of popularity without sufficient support. The argument also touches upon <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) due to the weak justification for the causal relationship implied.
