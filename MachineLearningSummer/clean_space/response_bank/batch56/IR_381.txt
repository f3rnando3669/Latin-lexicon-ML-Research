For 
<IDAA (Identify and Dissect Argument's Author)>:  
The statement "I don't think we need to talk to the people in the Justice Department about the practicality of enforcing this bill. The Justice Department is full of Democrats, and they are already biased against it." contains elements that can be categorized under a specific defective argument type. Below is the analysis:

**Identify the Argumentâ€™s Author**:  
The speaker is expressing an opinion about the Justice Department and its ability to provide a fair assessment of the bill's practicality due to an alleged political bias.

**Dissect the Argument**:

1. **Claim**: The speaker claims that it is unnecessary to consult the Justice Department regarding the enforcement of the bill.
   
2. **Reasoning**: The justification for this claim is that the Justice Department is "full of Democrats" who are allegedly "already biased against it."

3. **Defective Argument Type**:  
   - **<G> - Generalization**: The argument generalizes the entire Justice Department based on the political affiliation of its members without any concrete evidence that every individual within the department shares the same bias.
   - **<FU> - Presumptuous Consensus**: The argument improperly presumes that the entire group (Justice Department) holds a consensus viewpoint that is uniformly biased against the bill.
   - **<DEP> - Ambiguous Language**: The term "biased against it" is vague and does not elaborate on specific reasons or evidence, leading to ambiguity about the nature and extent of the supposed bias.

Based on the analysis, the primary defective argument types applicable here are **Generalization (G)**, **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**, and **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**.
