For 
To evaluate the statement "Our colleague, Doctor Χ, is too young and inexperienced; we could do without his advice," we will apply the <IDAA> (Identification of Defective Argument Application) framework to identify the type of defective argument(s) present.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The statement makes a sweeping claim about Doctor X's abilities based solely on his age and presumed inexperience. This is an overgeneralization as it doesn't take into account his specific expertise, qualifications, or individual performance.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The argument does not consider other relevant factors such as Doctor X's education, specialty, or unique insights he may bring. It lists only age and inexperience without evaluating the full range of his capabilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The reasoning that age and inexperience alone should disqualify Doctor X from providing advice is inconclusive. It fails to substantiate why these factors necessarily undermine his ability to contribute valuable advice.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - The argument attributes a lack of useful advice directly to age and inexperience without showing a sufficient causal link. Age and inexperience do not inherently cause someone to be unqualified to give advice, especially in a professional setting where other attributes can play significant roles.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - This statement does not seem to fall into the category of repeating the proposition faultily, as it is presented as a single argument rather than repetitively asserting the same point without offering new evidence.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - The argument does not explicitly presume a consensus; it states an opinion without claiming it is widely held by the group or universally accepted.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - There is no ambiguous language in the argument. Terms like "too young" and "inexperienced" are clear, though subjective.

Given the evaluation, the defective argument types that apply to this statement are primarily:

- **Generalization (<G>)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**

The statement "Our colleague, Doctor Χ, is too young and inexperienced; we could do without his advice" primarily falls under these defective argument types.
