For 
To apply the classification and identification of defective argument types to the given argument "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses.", we need to analyze the reasoning and structure of the argument to identify if any of the defined defective argument types are applicable. In this case, we will use the tags <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, and <DEP> to classify any potential weaknesses.

1. **Generalization (<G>):** 
   The argument does not seem to involve an unwarranted generalization from a small set of cases. Therefore, <G> is not applicable.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   The argument does not appear to rest on an incomplete list of cases or scenarios. Hence, <FE> is not applicable.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   This type of defect refers to reasons that do not reasonably lead to the conclusion. In this case, the major premise “It is immoral to kill an innocent human being” does not necessarily imply the conclusion “Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses.” The term "human being" could be contested regarding whether a fetus fits the definition in all contexts, thus making the argument inconclusive. This application could be seen as:
   - Premise: It is immoral to kill an innocent human being.
   - Premise: Fetuses are innocent human beings.
   - Conclusion: Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses.
   - <IR> Inconclusive Reason. The transition from the premises to the conclusion may lack sufficient justification for those who do not agree that a fetus falls within the same ethical consideration as other human beings.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   The argument is not based on a causal relationship, so <WCB> is not applicable.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   There is no repetition of the proposition without advancing the argument, so <RR> is not applicable.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   The argument does not appear to rest on an assumed consensus. Therefore, <FU> is not applicable.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   The terms "innocent human being" and "fetuses" could be open to interpretation and debate, leading to potential misunderstandings. Specifically, the term "human being" and whether fetuses are categorized within this term without further clarification creates an ambiguity. Thus, the improper or ambiguous use of terms could be highlighted as:
   - <DEP> Ambiguous Language. The argument relies on potentially ambiguous terms that require precise definition for clear understanding.

Therefore, the defective argument types that can be applied to the given argument are:
- <IR> Inconclusive Reason
- <DEP> Ambiguous Language
