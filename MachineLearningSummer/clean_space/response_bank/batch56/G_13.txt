Let's analyze the argument provided using the defective argument types defined:

The statement includes multiple parts that each fall into one or more defective argument categories. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The argument suggests that accepting the figurative nature of the Adam and Eve story will necessarily lead to accepting most of the Old Testament stories as figurative and then to various other conclusions. This is a sweeping generalization that oversimplifies complex theological interpretations.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The argument implies a series of conclusions without considering alternative outcomes or possibilities. It assumes that there are only two paths: literal belief or descent into atheism and immoral behavior.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The reasoning given for the subsequent conclusions lacks concrete evidence and clear logical connections. The leap from figurative interpretation to atheism and moral decay is not supported with compelling arguments.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - The claim that accepting the Adam and Eve story as figurative would cause an individual to become an atheist and lose morals is not backed by sufficient causal evidence. The causation implied here is weak and unsubstantiated.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - The argument repeatedly asserts a cause-and-effect relationship without new supporting reasons, merely reiterating the chain of consequences stated initially.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - The argument assumes that if one interprets the Adam and Eve story figuratively, everyone will agree on the subsequent steps described. This presumption of consensus oversteps the complexity and variety of individual beliefs and interpretations.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - The use of “believe,” “spiritual,” and “morals” can be seen as ambiguous, given that they can have varied interpretations. Additionally, the phrase "start having sex with animals of a barnyard nature" employs hyperbole and ambiguity to provoke fear rather than clarify a logical point.

Clearly, the argument is rife with multiple defective argument types, making it fundamentally flawed and unconvincing.
