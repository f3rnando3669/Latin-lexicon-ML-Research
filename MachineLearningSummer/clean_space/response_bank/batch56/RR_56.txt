It looks like you have a set of identifiers for different types of defective arguments, but it seems there is a typo with the identifier "<IDAA>". Based on the provided list, none of the defective arguments directly match "<IDAA>". However, let's proceed by analyzing the given statement "Taco is the best because it tastes better" to determine which types of defective arguments might apply:

- **Generalization (G):** This argument does not involve a generalization based on limited evidence.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This doesn't apply, as the argument does not attempt to cover all possible cases.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Arguably, the reasoning given ("because it tastes better") is subjective and inconclusive as it lacks objective criteria.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** There is no claimed causation beyond personal taste here.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The argument is somewhat circular, stating that tacos are the best because they taste better, which is restating the proposition in different terms without providing new information.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument does not imply that others agree without evidence.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The language used is not particularly ambiguous.

Given these considerations, the argument fits best with these defective argument types:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** because it relies on a subjective and inconclusive criterion ("tastes better").
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** because it restates the proposition without additional supporting evidence.

So a more appropriate identifier would be either <IR>, <RR>, or a combination of both.
