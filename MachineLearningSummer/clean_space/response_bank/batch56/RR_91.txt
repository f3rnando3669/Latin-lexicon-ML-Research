For 
The argument provided is an example of circular reasoning, which is a logical fallacy where the conclusion is supported by premises that assume the conclusion. Here's how <IDAA>---Identify Defective Argument Application---can be applied to this statement:

**Argument**: "Smoking pot is against the law because it's wrong; I know it's wrong because it is against the law."

### Analysis Using Defective Arguments:

1. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - This argument falls under **<RR>** because it essentially repeats the same proposition in different words to support itself. The idea that "it is wrong" and "it is against the law" are used interchangeably without independent justification.

Therefore, the defective argument in this case is:

**<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**.

By identifying <RR> in this argument, we highlight its circular nature and lack of independent reasoning to establish either point.
