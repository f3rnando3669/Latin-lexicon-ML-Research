Based on the argument presented:

* **Person 1:** If you are a Marvel fan then you love Avengers: Endgame.
* **Person 2:** I am a Marvel fan and I did not love Avengers: Endgame.
* **Person 1:** Well, you aren’t a TRUE Marvel fan.

Let's analyze the argument using the defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - Person 1 makes a generalization that all Marvel fans love Avengers: Endgame. This is a hasty generalization since it does not account for variations in opinions among Marvel fans.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - Person 1’s statement could be seen as an incomplete enumeration because it implies the only definition of a Marvel fan is someone who loves Avengers: Endgame, ignoring other criteria that could qualify someone as a Marvel fan.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The reason given by Person 1 (loving Avengers: Endgame as a condition for being a Marvel fan) is inconclusive. There is no definitive link proving that loving one movie is a necessary condition for being a fan of an entire franchise.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - Person 1's assertion that not loving Avengers: Endgame disqualifies someone from being a true Marvel fan lacks sufficient causal basis. The love for one movie does not causally determine fandom status.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - Person 1 repeats the initial assertion (true Marvel fans love Avengers: Endgame) but fails to address Person 2’s counterexample. Instead, Person 1 reasserts their original proposition without providing a new argument.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - Person 1 assumes a consensus among Marvel fans that they all love Avengers: Endgame, which is presumptuous and not necessarily true.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - The term “TRUE Marvel fan” is ambiguous as it can have multiple interpretations. Person 1 uses it to exclude Person 2 based on subjective criteria without a clear, agreed-upon definition.

In summary, Person 1's argument exhibits several forms of defective reasoning, including Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), and Ambiguous Language (DEP).
