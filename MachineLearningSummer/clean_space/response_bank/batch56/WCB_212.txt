In the statement "The economy continues to grow as the number of 'likes' on my Instagram account continue to increase. Clearly, the two are linked.", we are dealing with a defective argument type that can be categorized as:

**<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**

This argument asserts a causal relationship between two variables—economic growth and the number of "likes" on an Instagram account—without providing sufficient evidence to substantiate that one causes the other. Just because two events occur simultaneously or correlate in some way does not mean that one causes the other. This leap from correlation to causation without adequate justification is a hallmark of an insufficient causal basis argument.
