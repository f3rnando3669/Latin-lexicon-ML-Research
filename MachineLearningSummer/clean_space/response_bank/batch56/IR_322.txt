For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Attribution. 

For the statement: "My opponent raises a good point, but can we really trust him? I mean he moved to this town only two years ago and everyone knows that his wife left him."

The defective argument type being used here is an **ad hominem** attack, but given the definitions from earlier, none of the specified categories (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP) directly align with this type of personal attack.

However, if we need to choose the closest fit from the given categories, it might fall under *Ambiguous Language (DEP)* or *Presumptuous Consensus (FU)*. The statement makes presumptuous claims about the opponent's personal life to undermine his credibility, which is closer to **Presumptuous Consensus** since it attempts to leverage assumed public opinion against the opponent.

Therefore, the attribution using <IDAA> would be:

"My opponent raises a good point, but can we really trust him? I mean he moved to this town only two years ago and everyone knows that his wife left him." <FU>
