For 
<We, the people, are going to work together to achieve justice, unity, and integrity.> applies to the defective argument type called **Inconclusive Dealings with Abstract Arguments (<IDAA>)**.

This argument is <IDAA> because it employs abstract and hopeful terminology like "justice," "unity," and "integrity" without providing specific, tangible plans or evidence to explain how these goals will be achieved. Such language might inspire or rally support, but it doesn't provide a concrete argument or address how the stated goals will be specifically realized, making it an inconclusive dealing with abstract concepts.
