For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application.

In the statement "President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up. Jones is responsible for the rise in crime," the argument appears to be attributing a cause-and-effect relationship between two events merely because they occurred sequentially. This is a classic example of the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy, which assumes that because one event followed another, the first event caused the second.

Let's analyze this argument according to the defined defective argument types:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The argument assumes a causal relationship without sufficient evidence. The fact that violent crime increased after taxes were raised does not necessarily mean that the tax increase caused the rise in crime. Other factors could be responsible for the increase in crime rates. Therefore, this argument type is applicable here.

Therefore, applying <IDAA> to the argument presented:

"President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up. Jones is responsible for the rise in crime." is a defective argument due to:
- Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).

This classification highlights the lack of sufficient evidence to definitively link the two events causally. Thus, the argument is flawed.
