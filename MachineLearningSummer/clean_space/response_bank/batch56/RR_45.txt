For 
To apply the Defective Argument Analysis (IDAA) to the statement "My phone charger is broken because it doesn't work," we need to identify which, if any, defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP) apply.

Here’s the breakdown:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This type involves making a general statement based on insufficient evidence. This doesn’t seem to apply here as the statement is about a specific instance.
  
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This involves listing some possibilities but not all or most relevant ones. This does not directly apply as there is no listing of causes or alternatives.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This applies when the provided reason does not conclusively support the conclusion. "It doesn't work" is an observation, but it doesn’t conclusively provide an explanation for being "broken" since there could be other reasons the charger isn't working (like the outlet, the cord, or the phone port). Therefore, this is an example of IR.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This involves drawing a causal relationship without sufficient evidence. Saying the charger is broken solely because it doesn’t work implies a cause (broken) without exploring other potential reasons (like it not being plugged in correctly). This also fits WCB.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This involves repeating a proposition without adding new information or insight. The statement does not exhibit this.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This involves assuming a conclusion is valid because others believe it is. This does not apply to the given statement.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This involves using language that is unclear or ambiguous. The language "broken" might be somewhat vague, but it’s not significantly ambiguous in this context.

Thus, the defective argument types that apply to "My phone charger is broken because it doesn't work" are:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

So, to apply <IDAA> to the given statement, you could note it as:

```
<IR>, <WCB>: "My phone charger is broken because it doesn't work."
```
