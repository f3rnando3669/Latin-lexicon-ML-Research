For 
Certainly! To apply the Identifying Defective Argument Analysis (<IDAA>) to the statement "Why should you feel guilty for seeking your own happiness when that's what everyone else is doing, too?" we need to break down the argument and identify any defective reasoning types that apply.

### Analysis:

1. **Statement**: "Why should you feel guilty for seeking your own happiness when that's what everyone else is doing, too?"

2. **Argument Breakdown**:
   - The statement implicitly argues that seeking one's own happiness should not cause guilt because it is a common behavior ("everyone else is doing, too").

3. **Identifying Defective Arguments**:

   - **<G> Generalization**: The argument assumes that because many people are behaving in a certain way, this behavior is justified or acceptable.

   - **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: The argument does not account for other factors that might affect whether one should feel guilty, such as the consequences of one's actions or the moral frameworks involved.

   - **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: The argument presumes that the fact everyone else is doing it creates a consensus that makes it acceptable, which is a faulty assumption. Just because a behavior is common does not inherently make it morally right or wrong.

### Conclusion:
The statement "Why should you feel guilty for seeking your own happiness when that's what everyone else is doing, too?" is primarily defective due to ***Generalization (<G>)***, ***Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)***, and potentially ***Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)***.

- **Generalization (<G>)** because it assumes what is true for many must be appropriate or justified.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)** because it implies widespread behavior equates to moral acceptability without considering ethical nuances.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** since it overlooks other relevant factors that could contribute to feelings of guilt.

Therefore, the <IDAA> of this statement reveals that it primarily suffers from defective reasoning through generalization, presumptuous consensus, and an incomplete account of relevant considerations.
