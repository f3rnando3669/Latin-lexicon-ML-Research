For 
To analyze the given argument using <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Types and Analyze), let's break down the structure and identify any defective arguments:

**Argument:**
"If we ban Hummers because they are bad for the environment eventually the government will ban all cars, so we should not ban Hummers."

1. **Generalization (<G>):** This doesn't appear to be a generalization since the argument is not drawing a broad conclusion based on a few instances.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument doesn't seem to enumerate or list options incompletely, so this may not apply.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reasoning given (that banning Hummers will eventually lead to banning all cars) is speculative and does not conclusively support the claim. The causal link between banning Hummers and banning all cars is not convincingly established.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This argument is precisely an example of insufficient causal basis. The leap from banning one type of car to banning all cars lacks a solid causal link and necessary evidence to support the progression.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The argument doesn’t seem to repeat a proposition faultily, so this may not apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The argument doesn't rely on a consensus to substantiate its claim, so this doesn’t apply here.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** The language used in the argument isn't particularly ambiguous or vague; it makes a clear (albeit flawed) causal claim.

### Analysis:
The defective argument type that most closely matches the given argument is **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**. The argument assumes a slippery slope from banning Hummers to banning all cars without adequately supporting the causal connection between these events. Such reasoning is poorly substantiated and speculative at best.

Therefore, the primary defective argument type in this case is:
**<WCB> - Insufficient Causal Basis.**
