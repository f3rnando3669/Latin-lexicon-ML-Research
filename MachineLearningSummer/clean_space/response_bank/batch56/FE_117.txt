Given your list of defective argument types and definitions, let's apply the identified defective argument type annotation (<IDAA>) to the phrase ", when in fact more possibilities exist."

Generalization (G)
Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
Inconclusive Reason (IR)
Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
Ambiguous Language (DEP)

When someone makes an argument and then includes the phrase ", when in fact more possibilities exist," they are often implying that the argument presented is ignoring a wider range of possibilities. This can most directly be linked with:

**Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**

This is because the argument is suggesting that only a limited set of options are being considered, failing to enumerate all the possibilities.

Thus, the annotated phrase would be:

Incomplete Enumeration: ", when in fact more possibilities exist." (FE)

So the application would look like this:

", when in fact more possibilities exist." (FE)
