The argument given is: "The economy continues to grow as the number of likes on my Instagram account continue to increase. Clearly, the two are linked."

Given the defined defective argument types, the appropriate classification for this argument would be:

<WCB> - Insufficient Causal Basis.

Explanation: The argument suggests a causal relationship between the growth of the economy and the increase in the number of likes on an Instagram account without providing a sufficient basis to establish such a causal link. The two phenomena may be coincidental or could be influenced by a myriad of other factors, but the argument fails to demonstrate a credible and direct causal connection between them.
