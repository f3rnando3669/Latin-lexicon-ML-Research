**Defective Arguments Applied Analysis (IDAA):**

Statement: "Up until the late 16th century, most people believed that the earth was the center of the universe. This was seen as enough of a reason back then to accept this as true."

**Analysis:**

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The statement suggests that because most people believed the earth was the center of the universe, this belief was considered sufficient evidence for its truth. This argument commits an incomplete enumeration fallacy because it does not account for the limitations of knowledge and information available at the time. Just because a majority held a belief, it does not provide a comprehensive enumeration of all possible evidence or lack thereof.

2. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The assertion that the belief was general among most people, and thus seen as true, relies on a presumptuous consensus fallacy. This type of defective argument assumes that popular belief or the consensus of the time necessarily correlates with truth, which is not logically justified.

3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The argument implicitly claims a causal relationship between wide acceptance and the truth of the belief. However, there is insufficient causal basis to link the number of believers directly to the veracity of the claim that the earth was the center of the universe. This causal connection is not sufficiently supported.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The historical repetition that "most people believed" is used to reinforce the proposition that the belief was accepted as true. This is especially defective if there is no new evidence presented other than the repetition of what most people believed at the time.

**Conclusion:**

The provided statement primarily suffers from the defects of **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** and **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**, with possible elements of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** and **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**. These defective arguments undermine the logical solidity of the proposition that the earth was the center of the universe simply because it was a widely held belief.
