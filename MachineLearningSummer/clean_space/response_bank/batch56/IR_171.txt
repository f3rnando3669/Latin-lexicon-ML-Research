For 
The statement "Let's look instead at what my opponent proposes to do with your hard earned money!" is an example of a **Red Herring** fallacy. This type of fallacy occurs when someone introduces an irrelevant point or piece of information to divert attention from the topic at hand. In this instance, the speaker is attempting to shift the focus from their own proposal or point to what the opponent suggests, rather than addressing the current argument or issue directly. This is a diversion tactic meant to distract from the original topic by redirecting the audience's attention.
