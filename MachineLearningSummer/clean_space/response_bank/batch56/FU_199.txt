To analyze the statement "Verizon advertising the newest Samsung Galaxy phone that they claim everyone else who has bought it loves the new product," we will apply the defect types defined above.

1. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The claim that "everyone else who has bought it loves the new product" assumes a consensual agreement without providing concrete evidence. It presumes unanimous positive feedback, which is unlikely and unverified.

2. **Generalization (G)**: The statement uses the phrase "everyone else who has bought it," which is a sweeping generalization. Without specific data or a representative sample, this assertion cannot be held as universally true.

Analyzing the statement reveals a combination of defective argument types:
- **(FU)**: The claim presumes a universal consensus without evidence.
- **(G)**: The claim generalizes the sentiment of all previous buyers.

Thus, you can label the statement as having defects of **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** and **Generalization (G)**.
