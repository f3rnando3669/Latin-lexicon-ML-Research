It appears you are using a specific notation for categorizing types of defective arguments. However, the acronym <IDAA> is not defined in the provided list. Based on the example argument given, I will infer potential meanings.

If we consider the IDAA acronym to stand for Identifying Defective Argument Assignment, it could involve identifying and assigning the defective argument types mentioned.

Let's break down the argument:

"Senator Jones wants a strong national defense, but I will not vote for him because he moved to Canada to avoid being drafted for war when he was in college."

This argument seems to use an attack on the person (Senator Jones) rather than the proposition itself:

- This personal history is being used to undermine his current political stance on national defense, which might not be relevant to his current position.

To categorize this:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided (moving to Canada to avoid a draft) does not conclusively undermine his policy intentions on national defense now.

2. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: There's a potential ambiguity involved in interpreting the connection between past actions and current policy positions. However, this is a weaker application here.

However, if the additional set of acronyms can be clarified so that <IDAA> specifies another sort of reasoning missing from the defined defective arguments, a more refined categorization might be possible.

Given only the provided definitions:

The argument might be best categorized solely under **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** since the past actions do not provide a strong or conclusive reason against his current policies.
