For 
<IDAA> is presumably the task of Identifying, Defining, Analyzing, and Applying the defective argument types to the given statement. Let's break down the statement "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding." and see which defective argument types apply.

### Identify and Define Defective Argument Types
1. **Generalization (G)**: Making broad statements based on limited evidence.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Listing possibilities but failing to account for all relevant options.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Using a reason that does not fully justify the conclusion.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Claiming a cause without enough evidence to support it.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Repeating a statement in different words without adding new evidence.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assuming that because many people agree with something, it must be true.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Using language that is not clear or has multiple interpretations.

### Analyzing the Statement
"**Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding.**"

1. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The statement "I was only driving as fast as everyone around me" does not conclusively prove that the speaker was not speeding. Just because others are driving at the same speed does not mean it is within the legal limits.
2. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument assumes that because "everyone around me" is driving at the same speed, it must be acceptable or legal. This is an appeal to a perceived consensus rather than a valid defense.
3. **Generalization (G)**: The speaker's generalization that everyone around them was driving fast does not provide any specific evidence or data; it might be based on a small, subjective observation.
4. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The speaker considers only the speed of others as the measure for what is permissible, completely ignoring other significant factors like the posted speed limit, road conditions, etc.

### Applying the Defective Argument Types to the Statement
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided (everyone was driving as fast) does not necessarily mean the speaker was not speeding.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The speaker assumes a consensus among drivers ("everyone around me") as being right or legal, which is not necessarily the case.
- **Generalization (G)**: The assumption that everyone was driving fast might be based on limited evidence and does not justify that it's legal.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument fails to consider other factors such as speed limits and road signs.

### Conclusion
The statement "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding." demonstrates multiple defective argument types, namely:

- **IR**: The reasoning provided is not conclusive.
- **FU**: Presumes consensus to validate behavior.
- **G**: Uses a generalization without sufficient proof.
- **FE**: Omits important factors and considerations.

Hence, the statement employs these defective argument types and is effectively critiqued using the <IDAA> approach.
