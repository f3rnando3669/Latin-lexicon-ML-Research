For 
The term <IDAA> has not been defined in the context provided. However, based on common defective argument types, it seems you might be looking for an evaluation of the argument or question. The statement "Where did you hide the marijuana you were smoking?" is an example of a complex question fallacy, often referred to as a loaded question. 

A loaded question assumes something that has not been confirmed or accepted by all parties involved. In this case, the question assumes that the person was smoking marijuana and that it has been hidden, without any evidence or admission to support these assumptions.

Given the list of defined defective arguments, the provided question does not directly match any; however, it closely aligns with the idea of being presumptuous, making <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus) a potential categorization. It presumes a consensus on a fact that may not be true.

If <IDAA> (assuming it stands for something like "Identify Defective Argument Applied") were to be applied here, the closest match would be:

"Where did you hide the marijuana you were smoking?" is an example of <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus), as it presumes that the accused has been smoking marijuana and has hidden it, without providing evidence or gaining consensus on these claims.
