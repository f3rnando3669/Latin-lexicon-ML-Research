For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application. Let's break down the argument:

1. Premise: "French people are great at kissing."
2. Premise: "Julie is French."
3. Conclusion: "Get me a date!"

To apply <IDAA>, we need to identify which, if any, of the defective argument types this argument falls under:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument may be seen as a flawed generalization. It assumes that because some French people might be good at kissing, all French people are, without sufficient evidence to support such a broad claim.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This does not seem to apply directly here, as there is no list or set being incompletely enumerated.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasons given are not logically sufficient to reach the conclusion. Just because Julie is French doesn’t mean she meets the assumed criteria based on an unsupported generalization.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument lacks a causal basis linking nationality with proficiency in kissing skills. There’s an implied but unproven cause-effect relationship.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: There is no repeated proposition here that is used fallaciously.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument does not rely on consensus; it’s a direct, unsupported assertion rather than an appeal to what people generally believe.
7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: There isn't ambiguous language in the usual sense, but there may be some vagueness in how the qualities of "French" people are described without qualification.

Thus, the argument predominantly suffers from two major defects:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: Generalizing all French people based on an unsupported stereotype.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The conclusion "Get me a date!" lacks a solid logical basis connected to the premises provided.

So, the argument could be tagged with <G> and <IR> as the identified defective argument types.
