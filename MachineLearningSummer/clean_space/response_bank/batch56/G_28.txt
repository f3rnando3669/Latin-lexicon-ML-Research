Applying the concepts of defective argument types to the statement provided:

"Most of my testimony about the defendant was the opposite of what I actually believe, but I'll bet there's no expert witness who has always told the truth from the time they were old enough to talk, so I'm no less honest than they are."

This statement exhibits several defective argument types. Here's the analysis:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement assumes that because expert witnesses have likely lied at some point in their lives, it is normal or acceptable to lie in formal testimony. This is a form of overgeneralization based on an assumed behavior of a broad group (expert witnesses).

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not account for the various contexts in which honesty might be assessed differently. It inadequately compares the possible childhood lies of expert witnesses with lying under oath in testimony, which are not equivalent contexts.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasoning provided is inconclusive and does not sufficiently establish why the speaker is justified in their dishonesty. The fact that others might have lied at some point does not conclusively support the idea that the speakerâ€™s dishonesty is excusable.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This is not as apparent here. The statement does not explicitly repeat the same proposition multiple times in a faulty way.

5. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The speaker presumes a consensus by claiming that no expert witness has always been truthful since they were young. This presumption is used to justify their own dishonesty without any evidence to support the claim.

6. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: There is some ambiguity in the language with phrases like "no less honest," which could be interpreted in various ways. The argument does not clearly define what "honesty" entails in this context, leaving it open to interpretation.

Thus, this statement primarily involves defective argument types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), and Presumptuous Consensus (FU).
