For 
The argument presented by your uncle can be evaluated under the defective argument types defined. However, applying the direct assignment of labels as <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Applied):

The statement "Both sides are just as bad" tends to oversimplify or ignore important distinctions between the actions or motivations of people on different sides of an issue. This may be seen as applying a false equivalence, leading to the question of which specific defective argument types may be relevant.

Here's an evaluation:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This could be applicable if your uncle is making an unjustifiably broad statement about the behavior of both sides based on limited evidence.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: If the uncle is ignoring certain facts or evidence that might show significant differences between the sides, this label may be fitting.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This might apply if your uncle’s conclusion that "Both sides are just as bad" isn’t supported by the specific evidence or reasons given.
4. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: If the uncle's claim is based on an assumption that everyone agrees both sides are equally bad without evidence of that consensus, this label could apply.
5. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The phrase "just as bad" is ambiguous and open to interpretation, particularly if what constitutes "bad" is not clearly defined or specified.

Thus, the most appropriate defective argument types for your uncle’s statement might include **Generalization (<G>)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**, **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, and **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**, as each of these might play a role in the faulty reasoning in identifying the fallacy.

However, the primary fallacy here appears to be an **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** due to the statement’s reliance on a questionable equivalence without proper justification.
