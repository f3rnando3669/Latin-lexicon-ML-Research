The argument "We think that Malltime will be a success because all little girls like shopping" can be analyzed using the defective argument types. Here's how:

1. **Generalization (G)**: The argument makes a sweeping generalization by assuming that all little girls like shopping. This is a classic example of overgeneralizing from a possibly small sample or stereotype to an entire group.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not consider the possibility that various factors might influence whether Malltime will be a success. It incompletely enumerates the factors affecting the outcome.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning provided ("all little girls like shopping") is not conclusive evidence that Malltime will be a success. There are many other factors such as location, pricing, and product variety that can affect the success of a shopping center.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument assumes a causal relationship between little girls liking shopping and the success of Malltime, which is insufficient without more evidence. The success of a shopping center typically depends on a wide range of variables including foot traffic, marketing, and the overall shopping experience.

By applying these defective argument types, we can see that the argument is flawed because it overgeneralizes, fails to consider all necessary factors, provides inconclusive reasons, and assumes an unsupported causal link.
