For 
<IDAA> stands for Identification of Defective Argument Attributes. To apply it to the statement "Donâ€™t believe what Alex says about global warming. Alex dropped out of college!" we need to identify which of the defined defective argument types are exhibited in the statement.

Upon analysis, the statement commits the following defective argument type:

1. **Generalization (G)**: The argument makes a broad generalization that because Alex dropped out of college, their views on global warming are not credible. This is an example of a defective generalization because educational background does not necessarily determine the credibility of someone's stance on a complex issue like global warming.

In this context, the argument is not directly related to the others defined defective argument types, such as Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), and Ambiguous Language (DEP). The identified flaw relies primarily on the assumption that Alex's academic history undermines their credibility on the subject of global warming, which aligns most closely with a defective generalization.
