Applying the concept of Identifying Defective Argument Attributes (<IDAA>) to the statement:

"The is zero doubt that she has the condition. She scored high on two separate diagnostic tests for it and both tests have shown extremely high validity. That proves she has it."

Potential defective argument types:

1. **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** The statement claims that high scores on two diagnostic tests with extremely high validity prove the condition definitively. While strong evidence, the argument may be lacking conclusive reasoning if other potential diagnostic criteria or considerations are not addressed.

2. **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** Even though the tests show high validity, without details on the specific tests, their methodologies, and the condition's complexity, there's an insufficient causal basis to declare a diagnosis with 'zero doubt.'

3. **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language):** The phrase "zero doubt" is an absolute term that doesn't account for any margin of error or the possibility of false positives/negatives, which may be misleading or overly simplistic given medical diagnostics' typical complexities.

Given these points, the statement seems to primarily exhibit <IR> due to the claim of proof without addressing potential additional information or alternative explanations and <WCB> due to the lack of detailed causal analysis provided by just mentioning the tests' validity.
