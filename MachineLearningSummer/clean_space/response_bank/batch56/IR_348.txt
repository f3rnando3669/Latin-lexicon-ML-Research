Sure, I can identify defective argument types according to your definitions and apply them to the statement "Evolution cannot be true. If it were true, we’d all be smelly apes."

Here's the analysis:

1. **Generalization (G)**
   - The argument oversimplifies the theory of evolution by reducing it to an absurd and oversimplified consequence, i.e., we'd all be "smelly apes." This is a form of hasty generalization because it ignores the complexity and evidence supporting evolution.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
   - The argument doesn't consider all possible outcomes or facets of evolution. It assumes only one improbable and derogatory outcome without addressing the extensive evidence and array of consequences evolution entails.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
   - The reason given for why evolution cannot be true is inconclusive and unsubstantiated. The assertion that we'd all be "smelly apes" does not logically follow from the principles of evolution and is thus an insufficient premise to reject evolution.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
   - There is a lack of causal connection between the idea that evolution is true and the claim that we'd all be "smelly apes." Evolutionary theory does not suggest such a direct cause-effect relationship.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
   - The argument does not rely on repetitive statements or circular reasoning based on the given information, so this flawed type may not apply here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
   - The argument seems to presume consensus from an unstated source or assumed agreement that being "smelly apes" is the only possible outcome of evolution, which is misleading and unfounded.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**
   - The term "smelly apes" is vague and emotionally loaded, making the argument ambiguous. It uses derogatory language to paint a distorted and simplistic picture of evolutionary outcomes.

Applying the identified defective argument types:

"Evolution cannot be true. If it were true, we’d all be smelly apes." can be identified as containing defective arguments of type <G> Generalization, <FE> Incomplete Enumeration, <IR> Inconclusive Reason, <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis, <FU> Presumptuous Consensus, and <DEP> Ambiguous Language.

Therefore, the statement includes multiple defective argument types that undermine its validity and logical soundness.
