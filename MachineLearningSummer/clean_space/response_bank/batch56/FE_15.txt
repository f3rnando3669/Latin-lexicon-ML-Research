For 
The argument "You are either with God or against him" can be examined through the lens of a defective argument type called **False Dichotomy** or **False Dilemma**. This is where only two options are presented when, in fact, more possibilities may exist. However, since <IDAA> refers to specific defective argument types as defined above, we can explore whether any of these apply.

Let's break down "You are either with God or against him" to see which defective argument types, if any, are applicable:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument does not fit the definition of generalizing from specific instances to a broad conclusion.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This argument does align well with <FE> because it arbitrarily limits the options available to just two when more could exist.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The argument doesn't provide premises leading to a conclusion via inconclusive reasoning.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: There's no causality suggested or insufficient causal reasoning here.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The argument isn’t dependent on repeating a proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: There's no appeal to consensus or assumption that everyone agrees.
7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The language used isn’t ambiguous in a way that different interpretations arise.

Therefore, the argument "You are either with God or against him" can best be categorized under:

**Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: It presents an artificially limited set of options, suggesting a black-and-white scenario when there may be other positions or nuances.

So, applying <IDAA> to this argument results in categorizing it as <FE> due to its limited enumeration of options.
