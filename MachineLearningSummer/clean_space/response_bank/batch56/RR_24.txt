For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Attribute) to the statement "You have to invite Jenna to your party because it would not be nice not to invite Jenna," we start by analyzing the reasoning presented in this argument.

The argument can be broken down as follows:

1. Premise: It would not be nice not to invite Jenna.
2. Conclusion: You have to invite Jenna to your party.

The reasoning presented here is tautological; it essentially repeats the conclusion in a slightly altered form as the premise without providing additional support or evidence. This is a common reasoning flaw where the argument just restates the conclusion instead of giving a reason for the conclusion.

Based on the list of defective argument types provided, the most appropriate label for this reasoning would be:

<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).

This categorization fits because the argument is essentially a repetition of the same proposition in a slightly different wording, providing no new information or support for the conclusion.
