For 
In order to apply <IDAA> (Identify and Diagnose Defective Argument Application) to the argument ""My roommate said her philosophy class was hard, and the one I'm in is hard, too. All philosophy classes must be hard!‚Äù", let's break it down:

1. **Identify the Argument**:
   - The argument suggests that because two specific philosophy classes are hard, all philosophy classes must be hard.

2. **Diagnose the Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument appears to generalize the difficulty of all philosophy classes based on just two instances. This is a classic example of overgeneralization.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument fails to consider the entire range of philosophy classes. It only looks at two examples and assumes that these represent all philosophy classes, which is an incomplete enumeration of the data set.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasoning that two instances (both being hard) are sufficient to conclude that all such classes are hard is inconclusive.

Thus, the defective arguments present in this statement are <G>, <FE>, and <IR>.

**Breakdown with Tags**:
- **Generalization (<G>)**: Assuming all philosophy classes are hard based on two examples.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not considering that there could be many philosophy classes that might be easy or of varying difficulty.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The experience of two classes does not conclusively determine the nature of all philosophy classes.

Therefore, applying <IDAA> to this argument would highlight that it suffers from <G>, <FE>, and <IR> defective argument types.
