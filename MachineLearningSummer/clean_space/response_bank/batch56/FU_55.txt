It appears there is a typo or inconsistency in your request. You did not define <IDAA>, which seems to be a new category or classification not listed among the defective argument types previously defined. Based on the context, it seems like you might be referring to applying one of the defective argument types previously defined to the statement: "iPhones are the best phone because everyone has them."

Let's analyze this argument with the defective argument types provided:

The claim is: "iPhones are the best phone."
The reason provided is: "because everyone has them."

This argument could fall under the defective argument type:

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This argument presumes that the popularity of iPhones necessarily indicates their superiority, which is a faulty assumption. Just because a large number of people use iPhones does not inherently mean they are the best phone. This reasoning relies on a consensus that may not accurately reflect the quality or suitability of the product.

Thus, "iPhones are the best phone because everyone has them" is best categorized as a **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** argument.
