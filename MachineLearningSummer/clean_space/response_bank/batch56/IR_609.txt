For 
The term <IDAA> isn't one of the defective argument types you've defined. However, the question "How many times per day do you beat your wife?" can be analyzed for fallacies under the concept of a "loaded question" or "complex question," which implies guilt or wrongdoing regardless of the answer given.

While <IDAA> is not recognized, an appropriate defective argument type from the ones youâ€™ve defined to describe this question might be:

- **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language)**: This type recognizes that the language used is ambiguous or loaded. The question presumes guilt (beating one's wife) without establishing the fact of guilt. It embeds a presupposition that may not be true and traps the respondent into seeming to admit guilt.

Therefore, the question "How many times per day do you beat your wife?" is an example of <DEP>, as it uses ambiguous language to create a misleading implication.
