For 
Applying <IDAA> (which I assume stands for Identifying Defective Argument Attributes) to the given argument, we can identify several possible defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
    - The statement "You should never gamble!" generalizes that all gambling inevitably leads to severe negative outcomes for everyone, which may not be the case for all individuals.
    
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: 
    - The argument does not take into account all potential outcomes of gambling. It skips over any scenarios where a person might gamble responsibly or without becoming addicted.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
    - The claim that gambling inevitably leads to crime assumes a direct causation that may not be substantiated. There are many factors involved that this argument overlooks.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
    - There is an insufficient basis to causally claim that gambling will always result in crime. While some may experience negative outcomes, it is not a universal consequence.

5. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
    - The terms used, such as "hard to stop," "spend all your money," and "turn to crime," are ambiguous and lack precise definitions. These terms could be interpreted in various ways, leading to different understandings of the argument.

By identifying these defective argument types in the provided statement, we can see that the argument against gambling is structurally weak in several aspects.
