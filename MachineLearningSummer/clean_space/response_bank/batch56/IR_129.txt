For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application.

Let's apply <IDAA> to the phrases "Regime vs. government" and "Pro-death vs. pro-choice":

1. **Regime vs. Government**:
    - When people use the term "regime" instead of "government," they often imply something inherently negative or repressive.
    - This can be an example of <DEP> (Ambiguous Language) because the word "regime" has a pejorative connotation and is often used to sway the audience's perception negatively, whereas "government" is a more neutral term.
    - Example: "The argument that the 'regime' is oppressive lacks clarity as it relies on the ambiguous connotation of the word 'regime,' rather than providing concrete evidence."

2. **Pro-death vs. Pro-choice**:
    - Using the term "pro-death" to describe someone who supports abortion rights is a mischaracterization that provokes an emotional reaction.
    - This can also be seen as <DEP> (Ambiguous Language) because it uses language intended to mislead or evoke a strong emotional response rather than accurately describe the stance of being "pro-choice."
    - Example: "Labeling individuals as 'pro-death' misrepresents the 'pro-choice' position by using ambiguous and emotionally charged language, leading to a distorted understanding of the argument."

In summary, both phrases involve the use of ambiguous or emotionally charged language to influence perception without clear, evidence-based argumentation, thus making them defective arguments characterized by <DEP> (Ambiguous Language).
