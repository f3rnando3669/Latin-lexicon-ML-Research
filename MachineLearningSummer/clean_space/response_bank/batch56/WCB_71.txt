Certainly! Applying the defective argument type definitions to the statement:

"My brother received the COVID-19 vaccine and then had diarrhea for a week. The vaccine is the reason my brother's bowels came undone."

This statement can be analyzed as follows:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This type of argument suggests a causal relationship based on insufficient evidence or correlation. In this case, the statement infers that the vaccine caused the diarrhea solely because the events occurred sequentially. However, without additional evidence establishing a direct causal link, this claim lacks sufficient causal basis.

Therefore, the statement "My brother received the COVID-19 vaccine and then had diarrhea for a week. The vaccine is the reason my brother's bowels came undone." fits the definition of a **<WCB>** (Insufficient Causal Basis) defective argument.
