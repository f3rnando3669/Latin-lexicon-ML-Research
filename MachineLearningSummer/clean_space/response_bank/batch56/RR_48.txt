For 
The argument "The Bible is true because God exists, and God exists because the Bible says so." is an instance of circular reasoning, where the conclusion is assumed in the premises.

In the context of your provided definitions of defective argument types, none directly align with circular reasoning. However, circular reasoning tends to involve an insufficient causal basis for the claims made, because it assumes the truth of what it is trying to prove without independent support.

So, we could apply <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis), but note that the specific nature of the defect (circular reasoning) is a more precise descriptor. 

Thus:

**Argument**: "The Bible is true because God exists, and God exists because the Bible says so."

**Defective Argument Type**: WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis) / Circular Reasoning
