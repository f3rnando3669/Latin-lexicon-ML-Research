For 
<IR> Inconclusive Reason

The argument posed in the question "Are you going to do well in school, or are you going to succeed as a cadet?" builds a false dichotomy and presents an inconclusive reason. It suggests that the two outcomes are mutually exclusive and does not explore the possibility that one could do well in both school and as a cadet. This is an example of an inconclusive reason because it fails to provide sufficient logical grounds to support the conclusion that one must choose between the two options.
