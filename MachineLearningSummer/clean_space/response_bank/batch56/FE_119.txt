For 
The argument "To get better schools, we have to raise taxes. If we don't, we can't have better schools." can be analyzed using the Defective Argument Types provided. Let's see if it fits any of them:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** Drawing a conclusion about all cases based on a few examples.
    - This argument does not fit as a generalization because it does not draw from specific examples.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Listing some possible causes or solutions but not considering all relevant factors.
    - This could apply here because the argument assumes raising taxes is the only solution to improve schools without considering other alternatives (like reallocating existing funds or improving efficiency).

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Providing reasons that do not conclusively support the argument.
    - The argument does present a reason (raising taxes) but does not conclusively prove why this is the only viable solution.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Asserting a causal relationship without sufficient evidence.
    - This argument assumes high certainty that raising taxes directly causes better schools, which might not always be true or might require additional supporting evidence.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Repeating a proposition without adding new information, leading to circular reasoning.
    - This does not apply here since the argument is not simply repeating itself.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Assuming that a consensus exists without providing evidence of such a consensus.
    - The argument does not appeal to consensus but to a perceived necessity.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** Using language that is open to multiple interpretations.
    - The language in this argument is quite specific and doesn't seem ambiguous.

Given the analysis, the argument "To get better schools, we have to raise taxes. If we don't, we can't have better schools." seems to most closely match the defective argument type:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument overlooks other potential solutions for improving schools and assumes that raising taxes is the only way.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument does not provide sufficient evidence to establish a direct causal relationship between raising taxes and having better schools.

Therefore, applying **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** would be appropriate for this argument.
