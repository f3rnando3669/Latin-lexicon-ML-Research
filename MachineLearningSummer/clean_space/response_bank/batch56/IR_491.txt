For 
<IDAA>, which stands for Identifying Defective Argument Assignments, involves pinpointing which types of defective arguments are present in a given statement. Let's apply this to the given statement:

"We should give the other applicant the job because he has a poor family and he needs to provide for them. It looks like he suffers a lot!"

1. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason given for hiring the applicant (his need to provide for a poor family and his suffering) is not directly related to his qualifications or ability to perform the job. This reason is inconclusive because it does not provide sufficient grounds for the decision at hand, which ideally should be based on merit or capability.

2. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The statement includes a presumptive consensus that hiring decisions should be based on the applicant's personal hardships. This is making an assumption about what criteria are generally accepted without substantiating that such criteria are appropriate or endorsed by others involved in the hiring process.

So, the defective arguments identified in the given statement are <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).
