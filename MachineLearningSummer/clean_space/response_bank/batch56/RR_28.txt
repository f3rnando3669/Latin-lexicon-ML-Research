For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Attribute) to the statement "I view any discussion concerning the limiting of therapy as morally wrong, that is why I do not accept it," we need to identify which defective argument type, if any, the statement exemplifies.

The statement essentially expresses a personal moral objection as the reason for not accepting discussions about limiting therapy. Here, the individual is asserting that their personal belief is sufficient to dismiss the discussion outright.

Upon analysis, we can classify this argument as follows:

- **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: The argument essentially reiterates the proposition without providing additional support or reasoning. The statement states "I view it as morally wrong" and bases the rejection on the same moral standpoint without further justification.

Thus, the defective argument type identified for the statement is:
- **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**
