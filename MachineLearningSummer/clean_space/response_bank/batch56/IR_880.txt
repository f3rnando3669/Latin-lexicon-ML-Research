In the context of "IDAA" (Identifying Defective Argument Application), let's dissect the argument between Peter and Bill for any defective argument types. 

Peter makes a moral claim: "Based on the arguments I have presented, it is evident that it is morally wrong to use animals for food or clothing."
Bill responds by pointing out an apparent contradiction in Peter's behavior: "But you are wearing a leather jacket and you have a roast beef sandwich in your hand! How can you say that using animals for food and clothing is wrong!"

Bill's response does not directly address the moral argument Peter presents but instead aims to undermine Peter's credibility by pointing out a perceived hypocrisy.

This type of argumentation by Bill can be seen as exhibiting the defective argument type:

1. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** - Bill repeats the proposition by pointing out an inconsistency in Peter's actions rather than challenging the premises of the argument presented by Peter. Bill's rebuttal doesn't actually counter the reasons Peter provided but instead attacks the consistency in Peter's behavior.

2. **Irrelevant Reason (IR)** - Bill's argument might be seen as inconclusive because it addresses Peter’s personal actions rather than the logical validity or soundness of Peter’s moral argument.

In summary, Bill's response might be categorized as an instance of Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR) and Irrelevant Reason (IR) because instead of addressing the argument itself, it focuses on Peter's personal conduct.
