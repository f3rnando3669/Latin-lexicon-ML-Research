For 
<IDAA> stands for Informal Defective Argument Analysis Application. 

To analyze the argument "I thought you cared about other people, but I didn't see you at the fundraiser for the Children's Hospital ...", we can consider several potential defective argument types. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** The speaker is making a sweeping generalization by implying that caring about other people can only be demonstrated by attending this specific fundraiser. There could be many other ways to show care and concern.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument assumes that the only way to show care for others is to attend this particular event, without considering other possible actions or evidence of caring behavior.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The absence of seeing someone at a single event is not a conclusive reason to determine their level of care for other people. There could be countless reasons why someone might not attend a particular event.

4. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** The phrase "I thought you cared about other people" is somewhat vague and could be interpreted in different ways. Moreover, not specifying why attending this particular fundraiser is the sole indicator leaves room for ambiguity.

Based on this analysis, here is the application of the defective argument types:

<IDAA> The statement "I thought you cared about other people, but I didn’t see you at the fundraiser for the Children’s Hospital …" is an example of **Generalization (<G>)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**, **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, and **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**. The argument makes an unwarranted generalization by implying that caring is shown only through attendance at the fundraiser, fails to consider other forms of caring, uses an inconclusive reason to judge someone's character, and employs ambiguous language in defining what it means to care.
