According to the defective argument classification you've defined, we need to identify which type or types of defective arguments apply to the statement, "Aliens must exist because most people believe in them."

The statement "Aliens must exist because most people believe in them" fits the following defective argument type:

- **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>**: This argument assumes that the belief of the majority is sufficient proof of the existence of aliens. The fact that most people believe in something does not necessarily make it true.

Therefore, applying <IDAA> to "Aliens must exist because most people believe in them," we find that it is an instance of the defective argument type **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.
