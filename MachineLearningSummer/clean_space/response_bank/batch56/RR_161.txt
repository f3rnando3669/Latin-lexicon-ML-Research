For 
The example "Has your psychology department stopped teaching that ineffective approach to therapy yet?" exemplifies a type of defective argument known as a **Loaded Question** or **Complex Question**.

Unfortunately, <IDAA> is not defined within the provided instruction, making it difficult to apply it accurately. However, observing the given defective argument types, this example doesn't match them clearly. I'd recommend establishing a new category for such loaded questions or complex questions. 

For clarity, here’s an explanation aligning with known logical fallacies:

### Loaded Question (Complex Question)
A **Loaded Question** is a question that contains a presupposition built into it, which implies something unproven or controversial by its mere asking. It tries to limit direct responses to the questioner’s preferred framing.

Example Analysis:
- Question: "Has your psychology department stopped teaching that ineffective approach to therapy yet?"
- Implication: The question presupposes that the psychology department was teaching an ineffective approach to therapy and forces the respondent to accept that presupposition by merely answering.

Restating to align with the listed defective argument types:
- The example provided doesn't neatly fit into **Generalization** (<G>), **Incomplete Enumeration** (<FE>), **Inconclusive Reason** (<IR>), **Insufficient Causal Basis** (<WCB>), **Faulty Repetition of Proposition** (<RR>), **Presumptuous Consensus** (<FU>), or **Ambiguous Language** (<DEP>).

For the current classifications, consider defining a new defective argument type:
- **<LQ> for Loaded Question** or **<CQ> for Complex Question**

Until a definition for <IDAA> is provided or more context is established, applying the Loaded Question/Complex Question being type **<LQ>** would be the closest match:

**Example Analysis with <LQ>:**
- Example: "Has your psychology department stopped teaching that ineffective approach to therapy yet?"
- Defective Argument Type: <LQ> for Loaded Question.

Or alternatively:

**<CQ> for Complex Question:**
- Example: "Has your psychology department stopped teaching that ineffective approach to therapy yet?"
- Defective Argument Type: <CQ> for Complex Question.

Including <LQ> or <CQ> as a new category would make your classifications of defective argument types more comprehensive.
