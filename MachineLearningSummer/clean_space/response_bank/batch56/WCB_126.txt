Certainly! Let's analyze the defective argument in the given statement:

"Our house was burglarized right after that new family moved in next door. Therefore, that new family must have been involved."

This statement seems to fall into the defective argument type known as **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. This is because the conclusion that "the new family must have been involved in the burglary" is based solely on the temporal proximity of the new family moving in and the burglary occurring. The argument lacks sufficient evidence to establish a causal relationship between the two events.

**Argument Analysis using <IDAA>:**
1. **Identify the Argument:** The argument claims that the new family must have been involved in the house being burglarized, based on the fact that the burglary occurred right after they moved in.
   
2. **Define the Argument Type:** This is an instance of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

3. **Assess the Evidence:** The evidence given is the temporal occurrence (the burglary happened right after the new family moved in).

4. **Apply the Defective Argument Analysis (IDAA):**
   - **Argument Type:** WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)
   - **Defect Explanation:** Correlation does not imply causation. The argument incorrectly infers causation from a mere temporal sequence without additional supporting evidence.

Thus, the analysis shows that the argument is defective due to insufficient causal basis.
