For 
<IDAA> stands for Identification of Defective Argument Application.

To analyze the given statement, "There you are cheating on your husband, how could you ever tell us anything meaningful about ethics?" we can break it down and identify which types of defective arguments it fits from the provided definitions.

1. **Generalization (G)** - This argument is generalizing that because one aspect of a person's actions (cheating) is unethical, they cannot contribute anything meaningful to the ethics discussion in its entirety. This is a form of overgeneralizing based on a single example.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** - This argument does not encompass all possible scenarios or consider that individuals might still have valid insights on ethics even if they have acted unethically in one regard. It incompletely enumerates the person's capacity for ethical understanding.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** - The argument assumes a conclusive reason (that a person who cheats cannot speak on ethics), but this connection is not definitively warranted. Just because someone has acted unethically does not necessarily mean they have nothing meaningful to contribute to ethics discussions overall.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** - This argument implies a causality—cheating means you lack authority to speak on ethics—without sufficient basis. It does not sufficiently establish why personal misconduct in one area necessarily invalidates ethical insights broadly.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** - This form is not directly applicable here as there is no repetitive pattern in the argument presented.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** - This argument leans on a presumed consensus that someone who cheats is disqualified from discussing ethics meaningfully, without evidence that this consensus exists or is valid.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)** - The statement isn’t particularly ambiguous in its language; rather, it makes a direct but flawed ad hominem attack.

Thus, applying <IDAA>, the defective arguments identified in the statement could primarily be categorized as follows:

- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**

Each of these defective arguments contributes to the overall flawed nature of the statement.
