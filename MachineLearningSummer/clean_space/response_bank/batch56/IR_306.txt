For 
Applying <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Attributes) to the statement "It's important for you to take this psychology course. Sign up today. Don't wait.", we can analyze it for any potential defective argument types. 

1. **Generalization (G):** 
   - This statement does not seem to generalize about a group in a way that would lead to an overgeneralized conclusion. Each individual's need to take the course would vary. Therefore, this is not a Generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - The statement does not provide a comprehensive list of reasons or considerations for why it is important to take the course. Simply stating its importance without discussing specific benefits or alternative actions might make it an Incomplete Enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - The reasoning provided ("It's important") is taken as a given without any supporting evidence or arguments. Hence, it is inconclusive, and doesn't substantiate why it's important.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - The statement does not explicitly establish a causal relationship that would need investigation for sufficiency. Therefore, it does not fall into this category.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - There is no repetitive statement occurring to reinforce a proposition. Thus, it does not apply here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - The statement assumes the course is important but doesn't suggest that everyone agrees on its importance. Therefore, this argument type is not applicable here.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - The term "important" can be seen as ambiguous because it is not clearly defined what "important" entails in this context. It could mean important for career, personal growth, curriculum requirement, etc. Therefore, this could be an example of Ambiguous Language.

In conclusion:
**Applicable Defective Argument Types:**

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**

Each of these helps to highlight the weaknesses in the argument as given, suggesting that more detail and clarity are needed to make it compelling.
