It appears that you need to apply an identification or analysis based on defective argument types you defined to the statement: "Unfair judgement of people based on looks, belief, or ethnic background."

Let's break down the statement and see which of these defective argument types might apply:

1. **Generalization (G):** This could occur if the statement assumes that all judgments based on looks, belief, or ethnic background are unfair without considering any specific contexts or details. If presented as an absolute truth without exception, this would be a generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** If the statement suggests that the only factors leading to unfair judgment are looks, belief, or ethnic background, it might be an incomplete enumeration. There could be other factors that also result in unfair judgment that are not accounted for.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** If the statement attempts to provide a reason why judgments based on looks, belief, or ethnic background are inherently unfair without sufficient justification or evidence, it would be a case of inconclusive reason.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This could apply if the statement implies a causal relationship (e.g., that judging people based on looks, belief, or ethnic background directly leads to unfairness) without sufficient evidence to support that particular causal connection.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This wouldn’t directly apply to the statement because it doesn’t involve repetition of a proposition to prove its validity.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This could be relevant if it's assumed that everybody agrees that such judgments are unfair without acknowledging any dissenting opinions or without evidence of widespread agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** If the terms "unfair judgment," "looks," "belief," and "ethnic background" are not clearly defined or are used in a way that could be interpreted ambiguously, this argument could be seen as using ambiguous language.

Given this analysis, the statement "Unfair judgement of people based on looks, belief, or ethnic background" seems to primarily exhibit elements of **Generalization (G)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, and potentially **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. It broadly labels judgments based on looks, belief, or ethnic background as unfair without considering exceptions, additional factors, or providing sufficient reasoning or evidence for the causal claim.
