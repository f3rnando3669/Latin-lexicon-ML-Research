The defective argument type that seems to apply to the statement "We admit that this measure is popular, but we also urge you to recognize that there are so many other bond issues on this ballot it is getting ridiculous." appears to be <IR>, which stands for Inconclusive Reason.

Here's the reasoning:
- The statement acknowledges the popularity of a measure, which is an important aspect.
- It then shifts focus to the number of bond issues on the ballot, suggesting that their sheer quantity is a reason to question or disregard the measure, without providing a direct causal link or valid reason why the number of bond issues should impact the validity or importance of this particular measure.

By bringing up the number of bond issues as a reason to be skeptical about the popular measure without explaining why it should matter, the argument does not provide a directly relevant or conclusive reason for the audience to reconsider their perspective on the specific measure in question. Thus, the argument is inconclusive and shifts away from directly addressing the measure's merit or consequences, fitting the definition of an Inconclusive Reason (<IR>).
