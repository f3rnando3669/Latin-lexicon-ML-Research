The argument presented appears to fall under the category of a defective argument type, specifically a Generalization, <G>. Here's the breakdown:

**Generalization <G>:** This argument makes a broad conclusion based on a limited set of evidence (an individual case). It assumes that because one person smoked heavily and lived until age sixty-nine, smoking must not be harmful in general. This disregards the extensive scientific evidence showing that smoking is harmful to health and significantly increases the risk of various diseases.

### Application of <G>:

1. **Scenario:** My father smoked four packs of cigarettes a day since age fourteen and lived until age sixty-nine.
2. **Generalization:** Therefore, smoking really canâ€™t be that bad for you.

**Analysis:**
- The argument generalizes from one individual's experience to the entire population.
- It overlooks the possibility of individual variances and ignores a vast amount of research data showing the adverse health effects of smoking on the wider population.

By classifying this argument under <G> (Generalization), we can identify its defective nature in attempting to draw a broad and unsupported conclusion from an isolated instance.
