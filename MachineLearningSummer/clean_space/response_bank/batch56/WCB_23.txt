The argument "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick" can be evaluated as follows based on the defined defective argument types:

- <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis: The conclusion that the water must have caused the sickness is made without sufficient evidence. There could be many other factors that might have caused the illness, such as a virus, food poisoning, or an unrelated medical condition. Simply having drunk bottled water before getting sick does not provide a sufficient basis for establishing a causal link between the two events.

Thus, the argument "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick" demonstrates a defective argument type <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis.
