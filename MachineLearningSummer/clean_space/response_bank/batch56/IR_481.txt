For 
<IDAA> stands for Identify Defective Argument Analysis. Let's apply this to the given argument:

Argument: "You should eat more green leafy vegetables, because Ms. Lord says so, and she is an expert on grammar and vocabulary."

**Step 1: Identify the Argument**
- Claim: You should eat more green leafy vegetables.
- Reason: Ms. Lord says so, and she is an expert on grammar and vocabulary.

**Step 2: Identify Defective Components**
1. **Reason and Expertise Mismatch**: The expertise of Ms. Lord in grammar and vocabulary does not directly correlate to nutritional health advice. This suggests an application of expertise in one area (grammar and vocabulary) as justification for claims in an unrelated area (nutrition).

2. **Type of Defective Argument(s)**:
   - **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The reason provided (Ms. Lord's expertise in grammar and vocabulary) is inconclusive for the claim about nutrition. Her expertise does not substantiate the advice on diet.
   - **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: There is an insufficient causal basis to accept the advice on dietary habits purely based on Ms. Lord's credentials in a different field.

**Step 3: Detailed Explanation**
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: Just because someone is an expert in one field (grammar and vocabulary) does not mean their opinions on an unrelated field (diet) are valid or should be trusted without further evidence.
  
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: The causal link between Ms. Lord's expertise and the recommendation to eat more vegetables is weak or non-existent. There should be a valid causal connection to support health-related advice, typically from someone with relevant qualifications in nutrition or health science.

**Conclusion**
The argument "You should eat more green leafy vegetables, because Ms. Lord says so, and she is an expert on grammar and vocabulary" is defective due to:

- **<IR>**: The reason provided is inconclusive since her expertise does not relate to diet.
- **<WCB>**: There is insufficient causal basis to trust her dietary advice based solely on her expertise in a different field.
