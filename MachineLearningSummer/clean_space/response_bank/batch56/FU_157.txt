For 
Let's apply the <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Attribute) procedure to the statement "A fallacy which assumes that because something is popular, it is therefore good, correct, or desirable."

This statement describes a common logical fallacy known as the "bandwagon fallacy" or "appeal to popularity." Given the defective argument types listed, we can analyze the specific attributes of this fallacy:
  
1. **The assumption made here is that popularity equates to truth or desirability**. This type of reasoning does not provide sufficient evidence or causal basis to justify the conclusion that something is indeed good, correct, or desirable merely because it is widely accepted or popular.

Examining each defective argument type that could apply:

- <G> Generalization: Not specifically a generalization because it does not fit under the category of making broad statements from specific instances.
- <FE> Incomplete Enumeration: It does not seem to be based on an incomplete listing of options or elements.
- <IR> Inconclusive Reason: While the reasoning is indeed flawed or inconclusive, it's not the most precise fit in this case.
- <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis: This is relevant because the argument does not sufficiently establish a causal relationship between popularity and quality/desirability.
- <RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition: Not applicable here.
- <FU> Presumptuous Consensus: This is also applicable because the argument presumes that consensus or widespread acceptance equates to correctness or desirability.
- <DEP> Ambiguous Language: The fallacy described does not primarily hinge on the use of ambiguous language.

So, the statement "A fallacy which assumes that because something is popular, it is therefore good, correct, or desirable" can be identified with the following defective argument attributes:

- <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis
- <FU> Presumptuous Consensus
