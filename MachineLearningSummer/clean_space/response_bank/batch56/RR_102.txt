Certainly! Let's first break down the argument provided:

**Argument**: "My way of responding to difficult patients is by far the most ethical because no other way is so ethical and it is the only way that is completely ethical."

**Identifying Defective Argument Types (IDAA)**:

1. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The argument states "my way is the most ethical" and reinforces this claim by merely asserting it again with "no other way is so ethical" and "it is the only way that is completely ethical." This repetition does not provide any additional reason or evidence, only restates the same proposition in slightly different words.

2. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument presumes a consensus by making the absolute claim "no other way is so ethical" without providing any evidence or acknowledging other perspectives. It assumes agreement without substantiation.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The conclusion that "my way is the most ethical" is drawn without sufficient reason. Simply stating that no other way is as ethical and that it is the only completely ethical way does not sufficiently demonstrate or provide conclusive evidence for this claim.

By applying the identified defective argument types, it can be concluded that the argument presented is deficient in multiple respects, making it unconvincing and poorly supported.
