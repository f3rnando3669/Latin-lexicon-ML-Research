It seems like you're looking to classify the argument about believing that "runs" occur to statistically independent phenomena, such as roulette wheel spins, using types of defective arguments that you've defined.

Let's apply the defective argument types to this situation:

**IDAA (Identifying Defective Argument Application):**

1. **Generalization (G):** This would suggest making a broad claim based on limited instances, but here we're dealing with statistical independence, so it's not primarily about making a generalization from specific cases.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This would involve considering only a subset of relevant cases. In this context, it might be argued if someone's discussing only their own experiences with roulette while ignoring the larger body of statistical theory, but that's not the essence of the defective argument here.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This might involve using premises that do not sufficiently support the conclusion. Saying that "runs" occur in roulette games without accounting for their statistical independence might fall into this. However, this is not the strongest classification here.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This would be assuming a cause-and-effect relationship where there is none. Believing that "runs" occur in statistically independent phenomena like roulette spins hinges on a misunderstanding of causation in independent events. This classification fits well because it attributes causality where it doesn't exist.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This involves repeating a proposition rather than providing new evidence. This situation doesn't focus on repetition so this classification doesn't apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This would be assuming something is true because a majority believes it. This might come into play if the belief in "runs" is said to be true because many gamblers believe it, but it's not the core issue here.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** This pertains to using language that is unclear or has multiple meanings. The term "runs" might be ambiguous, but the key issue here is the misunderstanding of statistical independence.

Therefore, the most appropriate defective argument type to apply here is:

**<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The belief that "runs" occur to statistically independent phenomena such as roulette wheel spins erroneously implies a causal relationship where there is none. The belief overlooks the principle that each spin of the roulette wheel is independent of the previous spins, and thus no causal linkage (or "run") can be statistically inferred.

So, it can be stated as:

Applying <IDAA> to "Believing that 'runs' occur to statistically independent phenomena such as roulette wheel spins" results in classification as: <WCB> - Insufficient Causal Basis.
