For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identify and Define Argumentative and Defective Attributes) to the statement "Confession is good for the soul," we need to evaluate the argument in terms of the previously defined defective argument types. Here's the analysis:

1. **Generalization (G)**: "Confession is good for the soul" is making a broad general statement that may not hold true in all contexts or for all people. It is implying that confession always has a positive impact without considering individual differences or circumstances.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement doesn't provide a comprehensive list or any enumeration of the potential reasons or contexts in which confession might be good or bad for the soul. It lacks detail and completeness, offering a conclusion without detailing any premises.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning behind why confession is good for the soul is not provided. The statement lacks evidence or explanation, making the conclusion inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: If the statement is arguing that confession causes well-being for the soul, this causal relationship is not substantiated with any evidence. There is no explanation or proof that directly links confession to an improved condition of the soul.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The statement does not suffer from this defect, as it does not repeat a faulty proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The statement might be assuming that there is a consensus on the idea that confession is good for the soul. However, this consensus is not established within the statement itself. It presumes agreement without validating that such consensus exists.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The term "good for the soul" is ambiguous and subjective. What does "good" mean in this context? How do you measure the wellness of a soul? The language used is not clear and can be interpreted in various ways.

In conclusion, the statement "Confession is good for the soul" is defective in several ways:
- It is a **Generalization (G)**.
- It suffers from **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**.
- It is based on an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
- It has an **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
- It uses **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**.

These defects collectively undermine the strength and validity of the argument, making it a weak and unsupported assertion.
