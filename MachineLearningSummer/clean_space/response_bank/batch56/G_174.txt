The argument presented is as follows:
1. "Everyone who gets a college degree is better off."
2. "All people who are better off as a result of getting a degree are good to have conversations with."
3. "Therefore, everyone who gets a college degree is a good person to have a conversation with."

Upon examining the structure of this argument, we can identify several possible defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The premises make broad generalizations without considering individual differences or circumstances. For example, not all college graduates are necessarily better off in every respect, and not all are good to have conversations with.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The argument does not consider all possible cases or exceptions. There might be people who are better off without a college degree or those who are not good conversationalists despite being better off.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The connection between the premises and the conclusion is weak or not sufficiently demonstrated. The premises do not conclusively prove that a college degree universally results in being a good conversationalist.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - The causal relationship implied (i.e., that being better off due to a degree makes one a good conversationalist) lacks a robust causal foundation. It oversimplifies the factors that contribute to someone's conversational skills.

5. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - The phrase "better off" and "good to have conversations with" are ambiguous and subjective. Being "better off" can mean different things to different people, and what makes someone "good to have conversations with" can vary widely depending on personal preferences and context.

Given these analyses, the argument can be classified primarily under the following defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
4. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**

Overall, the argument makes broad unsupported claims, overlooks exceptions, lacks a firm causal link, and uses vague terms, leading to a defective reasoning structure.
