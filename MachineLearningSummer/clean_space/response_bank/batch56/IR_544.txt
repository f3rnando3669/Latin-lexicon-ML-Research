For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Application) to the given statement, we first need to determine if it aligns with one of the types of defective arguments you defined.

Let's break down the statement:
"A fallacy of relevance where someone rejects or criticizes another person’s view on the basis of personal characteristics, background, physical appearance, or other features irrelevant to the argument."

This seems to describe an ad hominem fallacy, where an attack is made on the person rather than addressing the argument itself. Now, let’s see if it matches any defined defective argument types:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: This does not seem to involve overgeneralizing based on limited data.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This doesn’t involve listing insufficient or incomplete reasons.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This is not really about reasons supporting a conclusion but about attacking someone personally.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This doesn't deal with causation.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This isn't about repeating a claim to make it seem valid.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This isn't about assuming agreement without proof.
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This isn't about ambiguous or unclear language.

Since the described fallacy specifically involves rejecting or attacking a person's view based on irrelevant personal characteristics and not any of the defective argument types listed, it doesn’t exactly match with any one of them.

However, if we must apply one of the defective argument types, the closest might potentially be:

### Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
Since the ad hominem attack doesn’t provide conclusive reasons relevant to the argument, but instead distracts with irrelevant personal criticisms, it could be loosely classified here.

Therefore, we apply **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason) to this statement because the irrelevant personal characteristics used in the argument don't contribute to the actual debate or reasoning about the topic. But note this is somewhat subjective and doesn't perfectly match the traditional defective argument types defined.
