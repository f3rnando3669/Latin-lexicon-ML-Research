For 
The defective argument type <IDAA> is not specifically defined in the context you've provided. However, we can analyze the argument "My teacher says the Earth is flat, so it definitely is flat" to identify any applicable defective argument types from those listed. 

Let's break down the argument:

1. **Generalization** (<G>):
   - This argument is not making a generalization from specific cases to a broader claim.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration** (<FE>):
   - This argument does not involve listing insufficient instances to support a broader claim.

3. **Inconclusive Reason** (<IR>):
   - This does not necessarily apply as it usually involves reasons that do not adequately support the conclusion, but the type of authority could be considered here.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis** (<WCB>):
   - This involves asserting causation without sufficient basis, which doesn't apply here.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition** (<RR>):
   - This would involve repeating a proposition without valid reasoning or evidence.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus** (<FU>):
   - This involves assuming that a consensus exists when it does not.

7. **Ambiguous Language** (<DEP>):
   - The argument does not involve ambiguity in language.

Upon reviewing the defective argument types defined, the best fit for the argument "My teacher says the Earth is flat, so it definitely is flat" would be **Inconclusive Reason** (<IR>). The argument relies on the authority of the teacher alone without providing sufficient evidence. The teacher's claim is not incontrovertible proof and fails to take into account the overwhelming scientific evidence that contradicts the claim.

Thus, the argument employs <IR>: Inconclusive Reason.
