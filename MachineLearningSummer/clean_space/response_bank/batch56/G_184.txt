The argument "I asked my five closest friends and they all agree that the new Underwater Basketweaving Team Coach is a jerk, therefore I'm not trying out for the team" can be analyzed using the defined defective argument types. 

The argument appears to fall under the category of <FE> Incomplete Enumeration. This defective argument type occurs when the conclusion is based on an examination of only a subset of the total relevant group without adequate justification for the selection of that subset. The speaker's conclusion is derived from the opinions of only a small, potentially biased group (their five closest friends), rather than a comprehensive or representative sample.

Thus, the given argument "I asked my five closest friends and they all agree that the new Underwater Basketweaving Team Coach is a jerk, therefore I'm not trying out for the team" IS an example of <FE> Incomplete Enumeration.
