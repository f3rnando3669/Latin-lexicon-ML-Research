To apply the <IDAA> evaluation to the argument "The majority of people believe advertisers should spend more money on billboards, so billboards are objectively the best form of advertisement," we need to identify any defective argument types present. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This argument assumes that because a majority of people believe something, it must be true. This is an appeal to popularity or consensus, which does not necessarily reflect objective truth or quality. Just because many people believe advertisers should spend more money on billboards, it does not objectively make billboards the best form of advertisement.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument draws a conclusion that billboards are the best form of advertisement from the premise that the majority believe more money should be spent on them. This reasoning is inconclusive because the opinion of the majority doesn't directly connect to the objective quality of billboards as an advertising medium. There could be many factors influencing the majority's belief that are not objectively related to the effectiveness of billboards.

By identifying these two defective argument types, we can see the flaws in the reasoning presented. While public opinion can be informative, it does not inherently provide objective evaluation or justification. Thus, for a robust assessment of the effectiveness of billboards, more solid evidence and reasoning would be required beyond just majority opinion.
