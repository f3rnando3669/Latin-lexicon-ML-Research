It looks like you're trying to identify defective argument types in a given statement using predefined acronyms. The statement in question is: "I don't see how you can say you're an ethical person. It's so hard to get you to do anything; your work ethic is so bad."

Here are potential defective argument types (identified by the codes you provided) that could apply to this statement:

1. **Generalization (G)**: The statement implies a broad generalization about someone's ethical character based on their work ethic or productivity. However, ethical behavior encompasses a wide range of actions and principles beyond just work performance.

2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The statement assumes a causal relationship between a person's work ethic and their ethical character without providing a sufficient basis for this causality. Just because someone might struggle with productivity doesn't necessarily mean they are unethical.

3. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The terms "ethical person" and "work ethic" are used without clear definitions, which makes the argument ambiguous. Ethics can refer to a variety of moral principles and behaviors, while work ethic can relate specifically to diligence and productivity.

By recognizing these defective argument types, we can better understand the weaknesses in the statement and refrain from drawing unfair or unfounded conclusions about someone's character based on incomplete or misinterpreted information.
