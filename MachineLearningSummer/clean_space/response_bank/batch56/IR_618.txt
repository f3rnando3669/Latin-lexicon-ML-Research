It looks like you are asking how to apply defective argument classifications to a scenario involving Billy and Bobby. In the given dialogue:

- **Billy** says: "An apple is a vegetable."
- **Bobby** responds: "Don't listen to Billy; he failed Spanish class last year."

The defective argument type in Bobby's response can be classified as an **Ad Hominem** fallacy, where Bobby attacks Billy’s character instead of addressing the argument about whether an apple is a vegetable.

Using the notation you've provided:

**Billy's Statement** does not inherently exhibit any of the defective argument types. However, if we were to analyze this under the assumption that it might reflect a lack of understanding, it could loosely be linked to **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason) since Billy provides a classification without explanation or support.

**Bobby's Response** can be classified as:

- **IDAA**: This denotes an "Ad Hominem" fallacy where Bobby dismisses Billy's statement by attacking Billy's character or past behavior rather than the argument itself.

In summary:
- Billy’s statement does not clearly fall under the defective argument types provided unless we consider it lacking support, which could make it **<IR>**.
- Bobby’s statement is clearly **IDAA** (Ad Hominem).

If there's any specific defective argument type analogous to **Ad Hominem** within your classifications, please specify, and it would better address Bobby’s response. Otherwise, **IDAA** is the most appropriate designation for Bobby's fallacy here.
