For 
Given the defective arguments provided, the argument in the statement ""We can't allow students to be paid for their grade because next thing you know they'll expect to be paid just for waking up in the morning."" is flawed. Now I will identify the defective argument type that applies here (denoted as <IDAA>):

1. **Generalization (<G>)** - This argument does not appear to generalize from a small or unrepresentative sample.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** - This argument does not seem to leave out possible alternatives or explanations.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** - The given reason might be considered inconclusive as it leaps to an extreme scenario without offering evidence for the progression.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** - The argument assumes a causal relationship between paying students for grades and them expecting payment for waking up. The causal connection seems speculative and insufficiently substantiated.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)** - This argument doesn't simply repeat a proposition in a flawed manner.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)** - There is no claim here that consensus or shared beliefs among people form the basis of the argument.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)** - The language in the argument does not seem to be ambiguous.

**Applying the identified defective argument types (<IDAA>):**

We can see that the argument primarily suffers from an **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**. The leap from paying students for grades to them expecting payment for waking up isn't supported by a sufficient logical or causal connection. The premise lacks adequate justification to lead to such a conclusion.
