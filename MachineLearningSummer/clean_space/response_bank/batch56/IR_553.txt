For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying the Defective Argument(s) and their Application.

Let's apply <IDAA> to the given statement:

"You should marry me. I know we’re not compatible, but I only have a year to live, and you’re my last chance."

1. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
    - The statement hinges on a claim of limited time left to live, which is an emotional appeal rather than a logical reason related to compatibility or a successful marriage. There’s no substantial reason provided to overlook incompatibility.

2. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
    - The argument relies on repeating the notion of being the "last chance" without supporting it with any logical reasons why this should necessitate marriage despite lack of compatibility.

3. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
    - The argument makes an appeal as if there is a common consensus that one should marry someone who is incompatible due to their short lifespan, which is a presumption rather than a universally accepted reason.

By examining the statement via <IDAA>, it reveals that it employs faulty argumentative techniques such as Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), and Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), making the argument defective.
