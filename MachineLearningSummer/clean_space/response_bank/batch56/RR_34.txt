To identify and analyze defective argument types (IDAA) in the given statement from Plato's "Timaeus," let's break down the argument and apply the types of defective arguments defined:

“We must accept the traditions of the men of old time who affirm themselves to be the offspring of the gods - that is what they say - and they must surely have known their own ancestors. How can we doubt the word of the children of the gods?” - Plato, Timaeus

1. **Generalization (G)**: The argument makes a broad assumption about the credibility of ancient traditions based solely on the claim that these traditions were upheld by the offspring of the gods. This generalization is not necessarily backed by sufficient evidence or context.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement assumes that all men of old time unanimously affirm themselves to be the offspring of the gods without considering exceptions or other historical perspectives.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning provided ("they must surely have known their own ancestors") is not sufficient to conclusively support the premise that we must accept these traditions. It relies on an assumption without providing adequate evidence.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is an assumption that because these men claim their divine ancestry, we should accept these traditions as truth without establishing a sufficient causal link between divine ancestry claims and the reliability of these traditions.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The argument repeats the claim that we must believe these traditions because they are said by those who consider themselves offspring of gods, without providing new supporting evidence.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument presumes a consensus among the "men of old time" regarding their divine origin and uses this presumed consensus as a basis to accept the traditions, without questioning the validity or the formation of such a consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The phrase "children of the gods" is somewhat ambiguous and can be interpreted in various ways. It may not necessarily mean literal offspring, and this ambiguity weakens the argument's clarity and strength.

In summary, the statement can be analyzed to contain Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Presumptuous Consensus, and Ambiguous Language. These defective argument types together illustrate why the statement's reasoning might not be robustly valid.
