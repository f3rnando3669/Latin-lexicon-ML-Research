It looks like you've defined several types of defective arguments but did not provide a definition for <IDAA>. As a result, I can't directly apply <IDAA> without knowing what it stands for. However, I can analyze the given statement for the defective argument types you’ve listed:

"Last year I wanted to quit school because my friends treated me like an outcast and talked about me to my friends. I felt betrayed and sad all of the time but now I think I have a place at my new middle school."

- **Generalization (G):** There may be a hasty generalization based on the actions of a few friends which led to the decision to quit school. This claim could be seen as overgeneralizing the behavior of all friends based on a limited number of experiences.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The statement does not explore other potential reasons for wanting to quit school; it only mentions the behavior of friends. There might be other factors involved which are not discussed.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reasons given for wanting to quit school (feeling treated like an outcast and talked about) may indeed be valid, but they might not be the only factors. Moreover, the transition to a new middle school and finding a place there may not entirely resolve the underlying feelings or experiences from the previous school.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal relationship between wanting to quit school and the treatment by friends might not be sufficiently substantiated. It's not necessarily clear that the treatment by friends is the direct and sole cause of wanting to quit school.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The statement does not seem to involve any repetition of propositions to illustrate a point, hence this type of argument doesn’t seem applicable here.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The statement does not imply or assume any consensus among others regarding the experience described, so this type of argument doesn't apply.

- **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The terms "treated me like an outcast" and "talked about me to my friends" may be somewhat subjective and open to interpretation. Moreover, "having a place" at the new school could mean different things to different people.

To fully apply <IDAA>, I need its definition. If you provide that, I can incorporate it into the analysis.
