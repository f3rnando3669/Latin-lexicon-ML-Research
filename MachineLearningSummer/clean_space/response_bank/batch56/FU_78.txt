It appears you want to identify a defective argument type from a given list, denoted by codes, for the statement "An increasing number of people are keeping ferrets as pets, so they must make wonderful companion animals."

Let's analyze this statement:

"An increasing number of people are keeping ferrets as pets" is used to support the conclusion "they must make wonderful companion animals."

Based on the defective argument types listed, the statement seems to represent <FU> - Presumptuous Consensus. 

Hereâ€™s why: The argument assumes that because a growing number of people are adopting ferrets as pets, this must mean ferrets are indeed wonderful companion animals. However, just because many people might engage in a particular behavior doesn't necessarily mean their underlying assumption (that ferrets make great pets) is correct. There could be various reasons for this trend that have nothing to do with the actual quality of companionship provided by ferrets, such as popularity due to social trends, media influence, or other reasons not related to the inherent traits of ferrets as companion animals.

Thus, the appropriate code applied to the given argument is:

<**FU**>
