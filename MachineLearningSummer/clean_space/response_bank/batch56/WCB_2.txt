The argument presented by Joe can be analyzed for defects as outlined:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - Joe states, "he has won half his races in the past two years," but this generalization doesn't necessarily apply to the current trend or specific circumstances of the upcoming race. Past performance does not guarantee future results, particularly when recent trends have not been favorable.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - Joe does not consider all the factors that could influence the horse's chances in this specific race. He focuses solely on past performance, disregarding other critical factors such as the horse's current health, the jockey, the conditions of the race, or the competition.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - Joe's reasoning that the horse "has to win this race" because it lost the last three out of four races is inconclusive. There's no logical basis that losing past races increases the probability of winning the next one. This is a misunderstanding of statistical independence in probabilities.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - Joe assumes a causal relationship between the horse's past losses and a guaranteed future win without sufficient basis. The idea that the horse is "due" is a form of the gambler's fallacy, where one wrongly believes that past random events affect the likelihood of future random events.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - Joe repeatedly asserts his belief that the horse is "due" and will win this race without providing new evidence or reasoning. His arguments circle back to the same flawed premise.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - Joe’s certainty ("Of course I'm sure.") assumes that his belief is evidently correct without acknowledging Sam's valid concerns. Joe presumes that his view should be accepted without question.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - The term "due" is used ambiguously. Joe uses it to imply an inevitability of winning due to past losses, but in racing terms, "due" has no substantial or calculable meaning.

Here’s the applied summary:
- <G>: Generalization present in Joe’s argument.
- <FE>: Joe fails to enumerate all important variables.
- <IR>: Inconclusive reasoning regarding statistical independence.
- <WCB>: Insufficient causal basis in assuming trend reversal.
- <RR>: Repetition of the unfounded belief that the horse is “due.”
- <FU>: Implies consensus without supporting argument.
- <DEP>: Misleading use of “due” without clear definition.

Joe's argument is profoundly flawed on multiple levels based on these identified defective argument types.
