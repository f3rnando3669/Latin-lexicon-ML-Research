Certainly! Let's identify it using the Defective Arguments Analysis Approach (IDAA).

The provided statement is: 
“Andrea Dworkin has written several books arguing that pornography harms women. But Dworkin is just ugly and bitter, so why should we listen to her?”

This type of argument is commonly known as an **Ad Hominem** attack, where the argument attacks the person rather than addressing the substance of their argument. Since "Andrea Dworkin is just ugly and bitter" is a personal attack rather than a logical rebuttal to her argument, it qualifies as this form of fallacy.

However, within the context of the defect categories provided, this specific type of fallacy, an Ad Hominem, doesn't directly match any of the listed defective argument types like Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language (<DEP>).

Therefore, it seems that the provided list of defect categories does not cover the Ad Hominem fallacy. It's important to recognize this discrepancy in categorization to ensure comprehensive analysis of logical fallacies.
