For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Types Applied. In the given dialogue:

**Nicholas:** "An apple is a vegetable."  
**Alexis:** "Don't listen to Nicholas; he is failing AP Language."

To apply <IDAA>:

1. **Nicholas's Statement:**
   - **Nicholas:** "An apple is a vegetable."
     - This statement is factually incorrect. However, if we analyze the structure and approach of this argument rather than its factual accuracy, it appears to be a simple assertion without any reasoning or evidence. 

2. **Alexis's Response:**
   - **Alexis:** "Don't listen to Nicholas; he is failing AP Language."
     - This is an example of an **ad hominem** argument, where the response attacks the person making the claim rather than addressing the claim itself. Alexis discredits Nicholas by mentioning his academic performance rather than providing evidence or reasoning as to why Nicholas's statement is incorrect.

   While <IDAA> looks for specific defective argument types defined earlier, let’s analyze if Alexis’s argument fits any of them:

   - **Generalization (<G>):** No, Alexis doesn’t make a broad generalization.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** No, Alexis doesn’t provide an incomplete list to argue.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This could fit because Alexis's reason for discounting Nicholas's statement (Nicholas failing a class) is not necessarily conclusive evidence that Nicholas's claim is incorrect.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** No, Alexis doesn’t argue causation.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** No, Alexis doesn’t repeat the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** No, Alexis doesn’t presume consensus.
   - **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):** No, Alexis’s language is not ambiguous.

So, applying <IDAA> to Alexis's argument, the defective type is:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Alexis's reasoning (failing AP Language) is insufficient to conclude that Nicholas's statement about apples is incorrect.

Thus, Alexis’s response can be categorized as:

<IDAA>[<IR>] - Alexis uses an inconclusive reason by attacking Nicholas's academic performance rather than addressing the factual accuracy of his statement.
