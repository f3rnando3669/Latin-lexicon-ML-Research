In the given statement, "You should run right out and purchase the newest iPhone 22 because you will literally be the only one who doesn't own one!", we can identify persuasive techniques using the provided defective argument types (IDAA - Identify Defective Argument And Apply).

The statement seems to suggest that one will be isolated or different if they do not purchase the new iPhone, implying a broad consensus or overwhelming popularity that is not supported by solid evidence. Therefore, this could be considered an example of **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**. 

**<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: This argument type occurs when a claim is made based upon the assumption that there is widespread agreement or consensus, without providing evidence for such a consensus.

Thus, the argument "You should run right out and purchase the newest iPhone 22 because you will literally be the only one who doesn't own one!" is an example of **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**.
