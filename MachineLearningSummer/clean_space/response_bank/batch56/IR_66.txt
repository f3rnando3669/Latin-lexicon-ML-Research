For 
Let's apply the identified defective argument types to the statement "4 percent of Americans believe that lizard people control politics." by identifying which types, if any, are relevant.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - **Definition**: Drawing a universal conclusion based on a small or skewed sample.
   - **Application**: This does not seem to be making a generalization about all Americans, so it doesn't fall under Generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - **Definition**: Listing some instances and suggesting they are the complete set.
   - **Application**: This statement does not appear to list subsets incompletely; it provides a specific statistic.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - **Definition**: Providing a reason that doesn't directly support the conclusion or is not convincing.
   - **Application**: The statement does not provide a reason or conclusion; it merely states a statistic.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - **Definition**: Asserting causation without sufficient evidence.
   - **Application**: This statement does not propose any causational relationship.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - **Definition**: Repeating a proposition to make it seem true without further support.
   - **Application**: The statement does not involve repetitive assertion.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - **Definition**: Assuming a general agreement without substantiating it.
   - **Application**: The statement mentions a specific percentage and does not assume general consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**:
   - **Definition**: Using language that is unclear or can be interpreted in multiple ways.
   - **Application**: The language in the statement is quite clear and specific.

Therefore, none of the defined defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>) directly apply to the statement "4 percent of Americans believe that lizard people control politics." The statement is simply presenting a statistical figure with no indication of  faulty argumentation based on the specified types.
