For 
Using IDAA (Identify Defective Argument Application) on the statement "Arguing based on whether something is popular":

This type of argument is known as an Argumentum ad Populum, or an appeal to popularity. It suggests that because something is widely believed or popular, it must be true or valid.

The defective argument type in this case can be categorized under <FU> - Presumptuous Consensus. This is because the argument relies on the assumption that the consensus of a group (popularity) is sufficient evidence for the validity of a proposition, which is often not the case.

Thus, the IDAA application results in:<FU>
