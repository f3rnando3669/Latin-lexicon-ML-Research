For 
Applying <IDAA> to the statement "Our gang will beat up anyone who doesn’t vote our way," let me identify and classify the defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
    - The statement implies a generalization by suggesting that force or violence is used universally by the gang towards all individuals who do not conform to their voting choice, without providing specific evidence or context.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
    - The argument presents an incomplete enumeration as it fails to specify the actual extent or situations where this violence is applied, making it less credible.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
    - The reasoning provided for why people should vote a particular way (to avoid being beaten up) is inconclusive and does not logically connect to the political or moral validity of the voting choice itself.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
    - There is an insufficient causal basis because no real evidence is given that getting beaten up is a direct and consistent consequence of not voting a certain way. The argument assumes causality without substantiating it.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
    - The statement does not directly demonstrate faulty repetition of a proposition. This type might not apply here unless there is context suggesting repetitive unfounded threats.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
    - Depending on the additional context, this may imply presumptuous consensus if it’s assuming agreement through intimidation rather than genuine consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
    - The language used is not ambiguous but rather explicit in its threat. However, the lack of detail could lead to some ambiguity in how threats are interpreted or acted upon.

Given these analyses, the primary classifications for this particular statement would be:

- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

These types most accurately reflect the defective reasoning in the argument presented.
