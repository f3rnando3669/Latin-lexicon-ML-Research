For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application. 

To analyze the statement "Teacher: If I let you go to the bathroom pretty soon everybody will want to go to the bathroom." using <IDAA> for potential defective argument types, let’s examine it against each defined type:

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - This argument does not seem to be a generalization. It doesn’t make a broad claim based on limited evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - The statement doesn’t list multiple possibilities or outcomes, so it isn't an incomplete enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - The statement could be considered inconclusive because it assumes a chain reaction without providing adequate evidence. The reasoning remains unsupported—it assumes everyone will want to go, but it doesn't consider that individuals have different needs and timings.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - This might be fitting. The teacher claims that letting one student go will cause everyone to want to go without establishing a sufficient causal basis. There's an assumption of causation without evidence.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - This argument does not involve repeating a proposition, so it doesn’t fit.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - The statement doesn’t presume a consensus or imply that a belief is widely held without evidence.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - The language used is quite specific and not ambiguous.

Given this analysis, the statement "Teacher: If I let you go to the bathroom pretty soon everybody will want to go to the bathroom." most closely fits:

- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason** because it draws a conclusion without sufficient supportive reasoning.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis** because it suggests a cause-effect relationship with no established causal evidence.

Therefore, the defective argument types applied here would be **<IR>** and **<WCB>**.
