For 
The given argument can be analyzed using the defective argument types (DAAs) you have defined. Let's break it down:

"America has to act now to reduce illegal immigration. Recent studies show that the vast majority of Americans think that illegal immigration is a problem."

This argument can be critiqued for its defective reasoning in the following ways:

1. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: 
   - This argument appeals to the idea that because a majority of people believe something, it must be acted upon. This is an appeal to consensus without considering whether the underlying reasoning is valid.
   
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - The argument implies that because a majority of Americans think illegal immigration is a problem, immediate action is required. However, it does not provide a sufficient causal basis for why immediate action specifically would be an effective or necessary solution to the problem.

3. **Incomplete Enumeration (IE)**:
   - The argument states that "recent studies show that the vast majority of Americans think that illegal immigration is a problem.‚Äù It does not enumerate what specific actions should be taken or consider other perspectives or solutions to the issue.

So, the given argument is an example of <FU> and <WCB> and <IE>. Let's label it with the identified defective argument types to demonstrate the critique:

**<FU> <WCB> <IE> The argument, "America has to act now to reduce illegal immigration. Recent studies show that the vast majority of Americans think that illegal immigration is a problem," is based on presumptuous consensus, has an insufficient causal basis, and includes incomplete enumeration.**
