Certainly, let's analyze the argument using the defective argument types:

"The party was going great! Then Gerald showed up and little by little people started collecting their coats and heading home. Gerald ruined the party."

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The argument is suggesting that Gerald's presence caused the decline of the party without sufficient evidence. It's possible that other factors contributed to people leaving, but the argument fails to explore these alternatives.

2. **Generalization (G):** The conclusion that "Gerald ruined the party" is a broad generalization based on the evidence provided. It makes a sweeping statement about the outcome without substantial support.

In summary, the argument primarily suffers from "Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)" by not providing enough evidence to definitively link Geraldâ€™s arrival with the end of the party, and it also exhibits "Generalization (G)" by making an overarching claim based on limited information.

Thus, identifying the defective argument can be articulated as follows:

\<IDAA\> "The party was going great! Then Gerald showed up and little by little people started collecting their coats and heading home." (\<WCB\>) Gerald ruined the party. (\<G\>)
