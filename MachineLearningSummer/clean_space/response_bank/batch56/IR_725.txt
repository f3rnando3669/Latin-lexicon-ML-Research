For 
In order to apply <IDAA> (identify defective argument types applied or assumed) to the statement "She should not be voted president because she's a liar and a thief," we need to analyze the possible defective argument types present in the argument. Let's break it down:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument generally implies that being labeled a “liar and thief” is enough to conclude she should not be president. However, it might not account for specific instances or context. This might lead to over-generalizing without sufficient evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument presents only two negative attributes ("liar" and "thief") to disqualify someone from being president without considering other attributes or any positive traits. This is an incomplete enumeration because it doesn’t account for the full range of characteristics or qualifications.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Simply stating she’s a “liar and a thief” might not be sufficient reason by itself to deny her presidency. There could be more to the context of these accusations that might render the reasoning inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument makes a jump from calling her a “liar and a thief” to concluding she should not be president without establishing a concrete causal connection explaining why these specific attributes necessarily disqualify her from being a capable president.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: If the claim "she should not be voted president" is simply based on the repetition of the negative labels “liar and thief” without nuanced argumentation, then it can be seen as faulty repetition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: If the argument implicitly assumes that everyone agrees that being a "liar and thief" is universally sufficient for disqualification without addressing or acknowledging dissenting opinions, it may be presumptuous consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Terms like "liar" and "thief" can be broadly interpreted and vary in severity and context. Without specific definitions and context, these terms can lead to ambiguity.
 
Given these considerations, several defective argument types could apply to this statement. Specifically:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument focuses solely on two negative traits without considering a broader range of qualities or evidence.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning provided might be considered inconclusive without further justification or context.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument does not sufficiently establish a concrete causal link between the accusations and her disqualification from the presidency.
- **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The terms "liar" and "thief" are not clearly defined and could be interpreted in different ways, leading to ambiguity.

Thus, we can apply <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, and <DEP> to the given argument.
