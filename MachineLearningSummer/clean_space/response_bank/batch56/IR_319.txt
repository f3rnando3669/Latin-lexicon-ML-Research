For 
Certainly! Let's analyze this statement by identifying the defective argument types.

Given statement: 
"I don't know how Professor Resnick can be such a hard grader. He's always late for class."

The argument here is implying that Professor Resnick's tardiness for class somehow contradicts his ability to be a hard grader. 

1. **Generalization (\<G>)**: This could be interpreted as making an unfounded generalization that tardiness for class has a bearing on grading severity, which is not necessarily true. Being late to class does not logically affect one’s grading standards.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>)**: The reason given for doubting Professor Resnick's grading is inconclusive or irrelevant. Tardiness does not provide a valid reason to question his grading practices.

3. **Ambiguous Language (\<DEP>)**: One might argue that the phraseology is ambiguous, implying a connection between punctuality and grading that isn’t clear or justified.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR>)**: If the idea has been persistently argued without substantial evidence, it might fall under this category, though the statement given does not repetitively reinforce the proposition.

To apply the identified defective argument types, this statement can be flagged specifically with:

- Generalization (\<G>)
- Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>)

So the analysis with applied labels would look like:

> "I don't know how Professor Resnick can be such a hard grader. He's always late for class." (\<G>, \<IR>)

This indicates that the argument is making a generalization and providing an inconclusive reason for the doubt raised.

Is there anything else you’d like to explore?
