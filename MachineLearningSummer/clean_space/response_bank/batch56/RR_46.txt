For 
To apply the given defective argument types to the statement "All useless laws, such as Reform Bill 13, should be repealed," we need to analyze how these suspicious reasoning patterns might be present in the argument. Here's how each defective argument type might apply:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement "All useless laws, such as Reform Bill 13, should be repealed" might be seen as a generalization because it implies that any law deemed "useless" should be repealed without explaining what qualifies as "useless."

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument lists "Reform Bill 13" as an example of a useless law but does not provide a complete enumeration of other laws that are deemed useless, nor does it clarify whether there are specific criteria that classify a law as useless.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The claim that "useless laws should be repealed" is not backed up by substantial reasoning or evidence. There is no elaboration on why the Reform Bill 13 is considered useless or why repealing such laws would be advantageous.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument assumes a causal relationship between the label "useless" and the necessity for repeal without providing sufficient evidence that repealing Reform Bill 13 (or others like it) will yield beneficial outcomes.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The argument repeats the idea that "'useless' laws should be repealed" without adding new information or providing compelling reasons, merely reiterating the initial proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The statement presumes a consensus that everyone agrees Reform Bill 13 is useless and should be repealed without evidence that there is a common agreement on this point.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The term "useless" is ambiguous and subjective, leading to unclear criteria about what constitutes a "useless" law. This ambiguity weakens the argument because different people might have different interpretations of what is "useless."

Given these considerations, the argument "All useless laws, such as Reform Bill 13, should be repealed" can potentially be critiqued based on each of the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, and <DEP>.
