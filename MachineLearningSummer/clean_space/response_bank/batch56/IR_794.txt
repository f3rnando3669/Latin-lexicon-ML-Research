Sure, let's dissect the argument using the specified defective argument types to see which ones, if any, apply to the statement "Don’t waste food, people in Marawi are suffering because of hunger."

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: We'll check if this statement makes an unwarranted generalization.
    - The statement does not seem to generalize; it is specific to the people in Marawi.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: We'll check if it considers only a subset of relevant cases or details.
    - This argument doesn't enumerate possible other reasons or scenarios, but it isn't quite about listing cases or details.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: We'll check if the reason given is insufficient to support the conclusion.
    - The suffering from hunger in Marawi is cited as a reason not to waste food. While the logic is aimed at invoking empathy or awareness, it might be argued that this reason alone may not be entirely conclusive for not wasting food as it lacks direct causal effectiveness.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: We'll check if the causal link between the elements in the argument is weak or insufficiently supported.
    - The statement implies a causal relationship between wasting food and people suffering from hunger in Marawi. Practically, not wasting food in one’s own locale doesn't directly improve the situation in Marawi, so this argument could be seen as having an insufficient causal basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: We'll check if there's a flawed repetition of the same idea.
    - There is no repetition of the proposition here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: We'll check if the argument presumes consensus where there may be none.
    - This argument doesn't presume that everyone agrees with the baseline assumption; it is more of an admonition.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: We'll check if the language is ambiguous or open to multiple interpretations.
    - The language isn’t particularly ambiguous in this case.

Upon analysis, it seems the most applicable defective argument type to "Don’t waste food, people in Marawi are suffering because of hunger." would be:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal link between wasting food locally and the suffering of people in Marawi due to hunger is weak and not directly connected.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: While well-intentioned, the reasoning given (people suffering in Marawi) might not be entirely sufficient or directly relevant to support the conclusion of not wasting food.

Thus, we can tag this statement with <WCB> for insufficient causal basis and <IR> for inconclusive reason.
