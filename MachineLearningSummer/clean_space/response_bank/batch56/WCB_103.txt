Certainly! First, let's understand what the term <IDAA> refers to. Assuming it refers to Identifying Defective Arguments and Analyzing Appropriateness (based on your definitions of defective argument types), let's analyze the statement: “The economy has improved greatly because of the new president.”

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - This statement could be a generalization if it is based on limited data. For instance, if the state of the economy is determined by a few positive instances without considering the broader context, it would fall under this category.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - It could be an incomplete enumeration if the statement overlooks other significant factors that contributed to the economic improvement, such as global market trends, policies set by predecessors, or contributions from other branches of the government.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The reasoning might be inconclusive if the cause-and-effect relationship between the economy's improvement and the new president is not firmly established. Correlation does not necessarily imply causation.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - This argument may suffer from insufficient causal basis if there isn't enough evidence to directly link the new president's actions to the improved economy. Multiple variables contribute to economic performance, and attributing it solely to the president may lack sufficient causal backing.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - If the statement is repeated frequently without substantial proof, it may become a faulty repetition of proposition, where the claim is accepted as true merely due to repetition rather than evidence.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - If the statement assumes that everyone agrees that the economy has improved solely because of the new president without actual consensus or debate, it could be presumptuous consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - The phrase "improved greatly" can be considered ambiguous language as it is subjective and lacks specific metrics. Different people may interpret "improved" and "greatly" differently.

In summary, the statement “The economy has improved greatly because of the new president” can be analyzed and identified as containing several defective argument types: Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), and Ambiguous Language (<DEP>). There might also be elements of Generalization (<G>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), and Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>) depending on the context and supporting evidence.
