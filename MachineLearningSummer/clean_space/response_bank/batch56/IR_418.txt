For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument types and Analyze) to the statement "Cardenas roots for a British football team. Clearly he’s unfit to be a chef at the new restaurant," we need to break down the argument to identify any possible defects according to the defective argument categories defined. Here's the analysis:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - This argument could be considered a generalization if it relies on the broad and unsupported assumption that supporting a British football team has a causal impact on one's ability to be a chef. More evidence and a logical connection would be needed to justify this claim.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - The argument does not enumerate any specific qualities or experiences of Cardenas’s culinary skills or his professional background. It relies solely on one irrelevant fact (rooting for a British football team) to make a broad judgment.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The given reason (rooting for a British football team) is inconclusive. There is no logical basis provided that connects a personal hobby or interest to professional competency in an unrelated field like being a chef.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - The argument assumes an insufficient causal link between cheering for a football team and the competence of a person in their profession. No causative relationship is demonstrated or logically plausible between these two aspects.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - This argument does not specifically have repetition issues; it relies on a single assertion which is unsubstantiated rather than repetitious.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - The statement does not imply a consensus from others. It is presented as a personal assertion rather than appealing to presumed widespread agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**:
   - The language in the statement is fairly direct and not ambiguous. The main issue is the irrelevance and lack of substantive argument rather than ambiguity.

### Conclusion:
The statement "Cardenas roots for a British football team. Clearly he’s unfit to be a chef at the new restaurant" can principally be identified as having the following defects:
- **Generalization (G)**: It implies an over-general assumption without sufficient backing.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: It fails to consider other essential qualifications or factors required to judge someone's fitness to be a chef.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason given does not logically support the conclusion drawn.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is no meaningful causal relationship established between the premise and the conclusion.

Thus, the argument is largely defective under these identified categories (G, FE, IR, and WCB).
