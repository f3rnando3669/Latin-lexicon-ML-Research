For 
To apply the <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Applied) to the statement "You have a friend who claims that cats like to go to windows and watch sunsets because that is what her cat does", let's break it down:

1. **Claim**: "Cats like to go to windows and watch sunsets."
2. **Reasoning**: "because that is what her cat does."

The friend is using the behavior of her own cat to make a general claim about all cats. 

Applying the definitions of defective arguments:
- **Generalization (<G>)**: Making a broad claim based on insufficient evidence.
  
In this case, the friend is generalizing the behavior of all cats based on the behavior of her own single cat. This does not provide enough evidence to support the claim about all cats.

Therefore, the fallacy committed here is:

**<G> Generalization**.
