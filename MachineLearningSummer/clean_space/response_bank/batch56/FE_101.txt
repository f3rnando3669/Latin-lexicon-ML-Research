For 
To analyze the given statement using the provided defective argument types, we will identify which type or types can be assigned to it:

Statement: "If Mom didn't turn off the air conditioner, then clearly she must be too hot."

Upon examination, we can observe the following:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This doesn't fit as there is no overgeneralization based on a small sample.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This could apply if the statement ignores other possible reasons Mom didn’t turn off the air conditioner. For example, she could have forgotten, may not be the one responsible for it, or there might be another reason.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Yes, this could apply here because the cause of not turning off the air conditioner is not necessarily that she must be too hot; the reasoning is inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This fits as well because there is an insufficient causal basis to conclude that Mom must be too hot just because she didn’t turn off the air conditioner.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This doesn’t fit since there's no repetition of any faulty proposition in the given statement.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This doesn’t fit since there's no assumption that a consensus exists about Mom being too hot.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This doesn’t seem to include ambiguity as the language is clear about the condition and the conclusion drawn.

Based on the analysis, **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** are the most fitting defective argument types for this statement.

Therefore, the defective argument types that apply to "If Mom didn't turn off the air conditioner, then clearly she must be too hot." are:

<IDAA: FE, WCB>.
