This argument by Dana appears to represent a particular kind of fallacy. To apply the appropriate label from the provided defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This would involve making broad claims based on limited evidence. Dana's statement does not seem to fit this category.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This would be applicable if there were several options available but only some were mentioned. Dana's mention of only raising tuition or the library closing suggests it might fit here.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This would be relevant if the evidence provided doesn't adequately support the conclusion. Dana's claim that not raising tuition will directly cause the library to close might lack sufficient support.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This involves assuming a causal connection where there isn’t enough evidence to support one. There could be other ways to fund the library that haven't been considered.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This would mean simply repeating a claim as if repetition makes it more valid. Dana doesn't repeat her proposition here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This involves assuming that everyone agrees with the conclusion without evidence. Dana isn’t assuming consensus here.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: Using language that is unclear or can be interpreted in multiple ways. Dana’s language is quite specific.

Given Dana's statement, "We must raise tuition to cover the cost of new books. Otherwise the library will be forced to close," it seems to prominently feature the issue of suggesting a limited set of options when more might exist. This aligns most closely with:

\[ \boxed{FE} \]

**Incomplete Enumeration (FE).**

Therefore, the fallacy Dana's argument exemplifies is **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**.
