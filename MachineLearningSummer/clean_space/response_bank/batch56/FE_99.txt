For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Application. Let's analyze the provided statement:

**Statement:** "Look, the only way to improve social programs is to raise taxes. You have to either raise taxes, or accept that the poor and needy are going to suffer."

Upon analysis, the statement exhibits a **false dilemma** or **false dichotomy**, which is a logical fallacy that occurs when only two choices are presented while more options might be available. This could be classified under the defective argument type:

**<IR> Inconclusive Reason** - because it assumes there are only two options when other possibilities exist.

Thus, the application of <IDAA> reveals that the argument is defective, as it relies on an Inconclusive Reason (<IR>).

Here is the identification:
<IDAA>: <IR>

The statement wrongly limits the solutions to a binary choice without sufficient cause or examination of other viable alternatives.
