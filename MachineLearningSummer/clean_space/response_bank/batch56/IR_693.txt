The argument presented in the statement "There is a lot of commotion regarding saving the environment. We simply cannot make this world into the Garden of Eden. Pursuing perfection is impossible and pointless. And besides, even Adam and Eve got bored in Eden!" contains various types of defective arguments. Let's analyze it using the provided defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G):** The claim that pursuing perfection is impossible and pointless is a broad generalization without specific support or context.
   - Example: "Pursuing perfection is impossible and pointless."

2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reasoning that perfection cannot be achieved hence efforts to save the environment are pointless is inconclusive. Advocating for better environmental practices doesnâ€™t imply achieving a utopian perfection.
   - Example: "Pursuing perfection is impossible and pointless."

3. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The term "Garden of Eden" is used ambiguously to signify an ideal perfect state, which is neither clearly defined nor directly relevant to practical environmental efforts.
   - Example: "We simply cannot make this world into the Garden of Eden."

4. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Assuming that there is a general understanding or consensus about Adam and Eve being bored in Eden, without providing evidence for such a claim.
   - Example: "And besides, even Adam and Eve got bored in Eden!"

To summarize, the argument minimizes the importance of environmental efforts by using generalized, inconclusive, and ambiguous reasoning. Additionally, it presumptuously attributes an unverified consensus about Adam and Eve's experience in Eden.
