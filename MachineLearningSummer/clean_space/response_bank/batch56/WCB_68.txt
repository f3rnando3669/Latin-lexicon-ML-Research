Sure, let's analyze the given statement with respect to the defective argument types defined:


**Statement:** "It rained and we lost the game. Every time it rains, we are going to lose."

1. **<G> Generalization:** This argument seems to generalize a specific instance (the game lost in the rain) to a broader, unsupportable conclusion (losing every game whenever it rains). Not every game played in rain will necessarily be lost.

2. **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:** The statement does not consider all possible scenarios. It only takes into account the single incident where rain was a factor in losing the game and concludes that the same outcome will always occur when it rains.

3. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** The reason given (rain causing the loss) is not conclusively connected to the outcome. Losing a game can depend on numerous factors other than just the weather.

4. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** The causal relationship implied by the argument (rain causing the loss of the game) is not sufficiently supported. There is no substantial evidence provided that rain is the direct cause of losing.

5. **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** The argument repeats the idea that rain results in losing without providing additional supporting evidence or reasoning. Merely stating the correlation repeatedly does not strengthen the argument.

6. **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** The statement does not involve other people's opinions or consensus, so this type is not relevant here.

7. **<DEP> Ambiguous Language:** The language in the argument is clear and unambiguous concerning its terms. Therefore, this defective argument type is not applicable here.

Overall, the given argument employs multiple defective argument types, primarily generalization, incomplete enumeration, inconclusive reason, insufficient causal basis, and faulty repetition of proposition.
