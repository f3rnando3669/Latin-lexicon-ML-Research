For 
The argument "How do I know that Beth is the most intelligent person in our geometry class? I know because she's so smart." can be classified as the defective argument type <RR>, which stands for Faulty Repetition of Proposition. 

Here's the breakdown:

- The conclusion is that "Beth is the most intelligent person in our geometry class."
- The premise provided to support this conclusion is "she's so smart."

However, simply stating that Beth is smart does not provide sufficient evidence or additional reasoning to support the conclusion that she is the most intelligent. It essentially repeats the conclusion in different words without offering new information or substantive proof.

Therefore, the argument exemplifies <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
