For 
<IDAA: Tu Quoque> 

The argument described in the sentence "This fallacy distracts from the argument by pointing out hypocrisy in the opponent" is an example of the "Tu Quoque" fallacy. This fallacy occurs when someone attempts to discredit the opponent's argument by asserting that the opponent fails to act consistently with their own position, thereby diverting attention from the argument's merits.
