It looks like you've defined several types of defective arguments and now you want to apply a specific type (<IDAA>) to the provided statement. However, the defective argument types you've listed don't include <IDAA>. If <IDAA> were an argument type, the context suggests it might be regarding Deflection or Ambiguous Action. For the provided statement, one relevant defective argument could be <DEP> for Ambiguous Language, given how the person claims to keep the promise in one sense while breaking it in another.

Hereâ€™s how you might label the argument using <DEP>:

"**I don't understand why you're saying I broke a promise. I said I'd never speak to my ex-girlfriend again. And I didn't. I just sent her some pictures and text messages.**" <DEP> (Ambiguous Language)

The ambiguity arises from the interpretation of what constitutes "speaking." The person argues that speaking exclusively involves verbal communication and excludes other forms of communication, leading to ambiguity in the promise's interpretation.

If you meant a different type for <IDAA>, please provide more context, and I'd be happy to adjust the analysis accordingly.
