For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Types Applied Analysis. Let's apply it to the statement:

"If you eat that cookie tonight, you'll eat ten tomorrow, and by this time next year, you'll be eating 1 million cookies a day."

Firstly, we'll deconstruct the argument to identify any defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument does not make a broad generalization based on limited data, so it does not fit into this category.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This argument does not provide or rely on a partial list of scenarios to draw its conclusion, thus not fitting under this category.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The provided reasoning is not directly based on weak evidence but on a chain of escalating consequences, so it does not fit this category.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument links the act of eating one cookie to eating progressively more cookies in an exaggerated fashion, proposing an unrealistic causal chain without supporting evidence. There is no sufficient causal basis for this escalation, making it a likely candidate for this category.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The argument does not repeat the same proposition with unwarranted emphasis, so it doesn't fit here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument does not suggest a consensus or assume agreement from others, so it does not apply to this category.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The language used is clear and direct, albeit exaggerated. The terms are not ambiguous, thus it doesnâ€™t fall into this category either.

Given this analysis, the argument, "If you eat that cookie tonight, you'll eat ten tomorrow, and by this time next year, you'll be eating 1 million cookies a day," most clearly fits under the category of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because it suggests an unrealistic and unsupported cause-and-effect relationship.

Therefore, the defective argument type applied here is:
**<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**.
