It looks like you're working with various types of defective argumentation and looking to categorize a provided exchange. However, you haven't defined what "<IDAA>" stands for in your context so I will not use that but I'll interpret the exchange based on the general known fallacies and your context of defective arguments.

Here's how the provided conversation can be dissected based on common logical fallacies:

Person 1:
"I am for raising the minimum wage in our state."
   
Person 2:
"She is for raising the minimum wage, but she is not smart enough to even run a business."

In this case, Person 2 is engaging in an Ad Hominem fallacy, which is a type of defective argument. Instead of addressing the argument about raising the minimum wage, Person 2 attacks the intelligence of Person 1. This does not provide any substantial counter-argument to Person 1's stance on the minimum wage.

In your context, although "<IDAA>" is not defined, the statement can be indicative of a defective argument type that involves the assault on the character of the individual rather than the argument itself. Here's a possible mapping based on the types provided:

- None of the specific types you've defined directly correspond to Ad Hominem attacks (though Ad Hominem is a known fallacy in classical logic, it doesn't seem covered by <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP> specifically).

To categorize it correctly among the provided, I would supplement your list with Ad Hominem:

- Define <AH> to be a defective argument type called Ad Hominem.

Using this code system, the provided exchange can be assigned as follows:

**Person 2 is using <AH> (Ad Hominem) in their argument.**

If you want to stick strictly to the types you've defined:
- None of the listed defective arguments (Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Presumptuous Consensus, Ambiguous Language) apply perfectly to an Ad Hominem attack. Therefore, you might consider expanding your list. 

Would you like to define an Ad Hominem in your context or re-evaluate the argument categorization?
