Certainly! Let's identify the defective argument types in the given statement:

Statement: "Don't let your children stay up till midnight on New Year's Eve. Before you know it, they'll be demanding to stay up till midnight every night."

1. **Generalization (G)**: This statement generalizes the specific behavior of staying up late on New Year's Eve to a much broader behavior of staying up late every night. This leap lacks a credible explanation for why one instance would lead to a pervasive habit.

2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument presumes a causal relationship between allowing children to stay up one night and their future demands without sufficient evidence to support this cause and effect.

Based on these identifications, the defective argument types in the statement are Generalization (G) and Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).
