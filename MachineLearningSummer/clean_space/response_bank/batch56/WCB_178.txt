For 
The defective argument type <IDAA> you've mentioned hasn't been defined in the provided list. However, based on the given defective argument types, we can try to analyze the argument "I failed Pre-Cal because my teacher doesn’t like me." and identify the type of defective argument it represents. It appears to align with the following defective argument type:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This type implies that there is insufficient evidence to establish a causal relationship between the teacher's feelings and the student's failure. Other factors such as the student's effort, understanding of the material, or general performance may be responsible for the failure, rather than the teacher's personal feelings.

So, the appropriate defective argument type for the given statement would be:

**<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis: "I failed Pre-Cal because my teacher doesn’t like me."**
