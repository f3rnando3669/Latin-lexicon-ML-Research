The argument "Allowing gay marriage puts us on the way to polygamy and bestiality" can be analyzed using the defective argument types defined. Hereâ€™s how it applies:

1. **Faulty Generalization (G)**: The argument makes a broad generalization by suggesting that legalizing gay marriage will inevitably lead to the legalization of polygamy and bestiality. This assumes a slippery slope without providing sufficient evidence connecting these distinct issues.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning is inconclusive because it does not adequately support the claim that allowing gay marriage will lead to polygamy and bestiality. There is a lack of logical connection and empirical evidence demonstrating that one leads to the other.

3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument presumes a causal relationship between allowing gay marriage and the eventual acceptance of polygamy and bestiality without presenting an adequate causal basis. It fails to show how the legalization of one form of marriage would directly cause the acceptance of other forms.

By applying <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Aspects of an Argument), this example illustrates the following defective argument types:

- **<G> Generalization**: Makes a broad and unsupported connection between different social issues.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: Fails to provide conclusive evidence connecting the initial claim to the predicted outcomes.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: Presumes a causal link without sufficient evidence to support that such a link exists.

Therefore, the argument has been identified as flawed based on these criteria.
