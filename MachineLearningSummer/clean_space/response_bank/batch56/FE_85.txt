For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Attributes) to the statement "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today," we need to identify which, if any, of the defective argument types apply to this statement. Here is the analysis:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument could be considered a form of generalization because it assumes that being a good person inherently requires attending class without exception. It broadly categorizes someone's moral character based on a single instance.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This seems less applicable because the statement is not listing a series of possibilities or factors incompletely.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The argument may also be using an inconclusive reason. The absence from class does not provide sufficient grounds to conclude that the person is not good, as there could be many reasons for their absence unrelated to their moral character.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument makes an implied causal claim that being a good person causes one to be in class, but it does not provide sufficient evidence to support this cause-effect relationship.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Faulty repetition is not evident because the argument is not repeating a proposition to make it seem more valid.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This argument does not appeal to a presumed consensus or claim that "everyone knows good people attend class."

- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: There is no ambiguous language in this argument. The terms used are reasonably clear, even if the logic is flawed.

In summary, the statement "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today." can be primarily associated with the defective argument types of Generalization (<G>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), and Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).
