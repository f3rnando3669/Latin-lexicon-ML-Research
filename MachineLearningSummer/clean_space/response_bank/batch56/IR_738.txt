For 
<IDAA> stands for "Identify Defective Argument Application." 

To analyze the company's slogan "Expect More. Pay Less." using this approach, we should identify if it utilizes any of the defined defective argument types.

1. **Generalization (G):** This slogan makes a broad claim. It implies a generalized promise without specifying the types or instances of expectations that would be met while paying less. However, without further context, we cannot definitively classify it as an overgeneralization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The slogan does not list specific examples or details of what "more" entails and how exactly customers will "pay less." It provides an incomplete enumeration of the benefits.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The slogan does not give a reason why expecting more and paying less would logically coexist. It assumes the conclusion without offering evidence or reasoning.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The slogan suggests a causal relationship between expecting more and paying less but does not supply any basis or mechanism by which this outcome is achieved.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** There is no direct repetition of a proposition in the slogan itself.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The slogan anticipates agreement from the audience on the desirability and feasibility of expecting more and paying less, which may not necessarily be true for every customer or situation.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** "More" and "Less" are ambiguous terms. "More" what? "Less" compared to what? The language used is open to various interpretations and does not clarify the specifics.

Based on this analysis, the slogan "Expect More. Pay Less." can be classified as primarily utilizing **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** and **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**, with elements of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** possibly present, depending on the further context provided.
