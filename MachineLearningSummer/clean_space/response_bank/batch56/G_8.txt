In the given statement, "If we allow Susan to leave early, soon we'll be giving everyone Friday afternoon off," we can apply the <IDAA> (Identification of Defective Argument Type) to diagnose the type of defective argument being used. 

This statement can be categorized as a type of slippery slope argument, which often exaggerates the consequences of an action without sufficient evidence. Examining it through the lens of the defined defective argument types, it appears to best fit the <WCB> type â€” Insufficient Causal Basis.

Here's the breakdown:
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This argument implies a causal relationship between allowing Susan to leave early once and a broad policy of giving everyone Friday afternoons off, without providing sufficient evidence or reasoning to support that this will indeed happen.

Therefore, the statement "If we allow Susan to leave early, soon we'll be giving everyone Friday afternoon off" can be identified as having a defective argument of type <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
