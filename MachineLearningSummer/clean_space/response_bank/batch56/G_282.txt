<IDAA>: Identify Defective Argument Types Applied

The statement "Never be kind and generous to the poor. They’ll come to expect your help always and never learn to contribute to society." contains multiple defective argument types. Let's break it down:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The argument makes a sweeping statement about all poor people, suggesting that being kind and generous to them will lead them to always expect help and never learn to contribute to society. This is a broad generalization that does not account for individual differences and circumstances.
     - Identified <G>: "They’ll come to expect your help always and never learn to contribute to society."

2. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The reasoning provided is not conclusive. The idea that helping the poor will prevent them from learning to contribute to society is not necessarily true and lacks sufficient evidence or consideration of various factors that influence people's ability to contribute.
     - Identified <IR>: "They’ll come to expect your help always and never learn to contribute to society."

3. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - The argument assumes that there is a consensus that generosity towards the poor leads to dependency and lack of societal contribution, without providing evidence or acknowledging differing viewpoints.
     - Identified <FU>: "They’ll come to expect your help always and never learn to contribute to society."

4. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>):**
   - The terms "kind and generous," "always expect your help," and "contribute to society" can be interpreted in various ways, leading to ambiguity in what the argument precisely means.
     - Identified <DEP>: "They’ll come to expect your help always and never learn to contribute to society."

Summarizing, the argument contains the following defective argument types: Generalization (<G>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), and Ambiguous Language (<DEP>).
