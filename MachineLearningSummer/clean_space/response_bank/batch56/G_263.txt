<IDAA>: Identify Defective Argument Types Applied

1. **If I don't take this AP class, then I won't do well on the exam.**
   - **Type**: <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)
   - **Analysis**: This premise assumes that not taking the AP class is the only reason one might not do well on the exam, which is not necessarily true. The student could study independently or get tutoring and still succeed.

2. **If I don't do well on the AP exam, then I won't get into a good college.**
   - **Type**: <G> (Generalization)
   - **Analysis**: This statement generalizes that one's performance on a single AP exam will determine their college admission, ignoring the holistic nature of most college admission processes, which consider multiple factors.

3. **If I can't get into a good college, then I'll never get a good job.**
   - **Type**: <G> (Generalization)
   - **Analysis**: This statement makes a sweeping assumption that only graduates of good colleges can obtain good jobs, which disregards various pathways and opportunities that can lead to successful careers.

4. **If I can't get a good job, then I'm going to have to live in my parents' basement forever.**
   - **Type**: <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)
   - **Analysis**: This statement jumps to an extreme conclusion without considering options like improving skills, career changes, and various employment opportunities over time.

5. **Guess I'll sign up for the AP class...**
   - **Type**: <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)
   - **Analysis**: The decision to sign up for the AP class is based on the assumed consensus that the only way to avoid the dire outcomes is to take the AP class, despite the various other approaches that could be taken.
