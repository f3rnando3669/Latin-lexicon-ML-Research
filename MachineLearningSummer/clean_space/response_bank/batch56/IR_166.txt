For 
<IDAA> stands for "Identify Defective Argument Assessment." Here, we will identify the specific defect or defects in the argument presented by Maria when she approaches her boss:

**Scenario:**
"Maria has been working at her current job for more than 30 years at the same wage. She desperately wants a raise so she approaches her boss to ask for one. She says, 'You are one of the kindest people I know. You are smart and good-looking and I really love your shoes.'"

**Assessment:**

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Maria's argument doesn't provide complete and relevant reasons for why she should get a raise. Instead, she's only flattering her boss without mentioning her long tenure, dedication, or achievements.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Flattering statements about the boss being kind, smart, good-looking, and having nice shoes are not logically connected to the reason why Maria deserves a raise. The argument lacks a substantial basis for the raise request.

3. **Defective Argument - Multiple Defects:**
   - The argument primarily suffers from <FE> and <IR>. Maria fails to enumerate concrete reasons that justify a raise, and the reasons she provides (compliments) are inconclusive and irrelevant to the request. 

Thus, Maria's argument for a raise is flawed due to <FE> (incomplete enumeration of relevant reasons) and <IR> (relies on inconclusive reasons unrelated to the substantial topic).

Would you like further analysis of any other aspect of this scenario or more examples?
