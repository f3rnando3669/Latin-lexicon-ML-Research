For 
Based on the argument types defined, "<IDAA>" means identifying the type of defective argument in the given statement: "I must be telling the truth, since I’m not lying."

This argument can be classified as:

**<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:**
- The statement "I must be telling the truth, since I’m not lying" essentially repeats the same idea with different wording without providing any new evidence. It restates the proposition "I’m not lying" as the conclusion "I must be telling the truth," creating a circular argument that doesn't substantiate the claim.

So, applying <IDAA> to the statement identifies it as a **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**.
