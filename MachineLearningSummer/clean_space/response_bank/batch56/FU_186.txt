For 
Sure, let's analyze the argument "All my friends are doing a low carb diet. That must be the only way to lose weight so I will do it too." using your defined defective argument types. Applying <IDAA> stands for "Identifying Defective Argument Application."

1. **Generalization (G):** The argument generalizes from the behavior of a few individuals (friends) to a universal conclusion about the only way to lose weight.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument presents only one option (low carb diet) as the solution to losing weight, without considering other viable methods.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The fact that friends are doing a low carb diet does not conclusively prove that it's the only way to lose weight.
   
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The argument fails to provide sufficient causal evidence that a low carb diet is the only effective way to lose weight.
   
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This defective argument type might not be as applicable here since the argument doesnâ€™t seem to repeat a proposition for the sake of reinforcing it.
   
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument assumes that because friends (a social group) are in consensus, that consensus must be correct and universally applicable.
   
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):** The language about "the only way to lose weight" may be ambiguous or oversimplified, as weight loss can be achieved through various methods.

Based on the analysis, here are the identified defective argument types for "All my friends are doing a low carb diet. That must be the only way to lose weight so I will do it too.":

- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**

Each of these fallacies contributes to the overall flawed reasoning presented in the argument.
