Given the provided definitions of defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: Assuming a principle or rule applies universally based on a small number of cases.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Drawing a conclusion based on a subset of cases without considering all relevant instances.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Making a claim based on evidence or reasons that do not sufficiently support the conclusion.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Inferring a cause-and-effect relationship without sufficient evidence to justify it.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Repeating a proposition under the assumption it becomes true through repetition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assuming a certain belief or opinion is correct because many people supposedly agree with it.
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: Using language that is unclear or open to multiple interpretations in a misleading way.

Using these definitions, the statement "The building is closed. I saw 2 people standing outside the door." appears to be an instance of **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** as it draws a conclusion about the building being closed based on the limited observation of just two people standing outside, without considering other possible explanations or evidence.
