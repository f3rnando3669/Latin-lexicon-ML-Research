For 
It seems like you provided definitions for several defective argument types. However, you did not define or explain "<IDAA>." If you meant to align the argument with one of the defective argument types you've defined, I would need to understand what "<IDAA>" stands for.

Based on the example argument "Susie bought a flip-phone, so all of her friends bought flip-phones," an appropriate defective argument type could be "Generalization" (<G>), assuming that the argument is suggesting that the behavior of one individual (Susie) is indicative or representative of the behavior of an entire group (her friends), without sufficient evidence.

Would you like to clarify what "<IDAA>" stands for, or should we proceed with identifying the defective argument type based on the given definitions? If you clarify "<IDAA>", I can offer a more accurate classification.
