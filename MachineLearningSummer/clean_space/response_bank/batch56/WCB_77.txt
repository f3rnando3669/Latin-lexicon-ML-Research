The argument presented is: "Tommy went to go swimming for the afternoon and later bought a lottery ticket. He won the lottery which must mean that swimming makes you win the lottery."

To apply identifiers for defective argument types:

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The reasoning suggests a causal connection between swimming and winning the lottery without providing sufficient evidence to support such a causal link.
   
   Defective Argument Tag: **<WCB>**

2. **Generalization (G)**: Making a broad generalization based on a single instance (Tommy's experience).

   Defective Argument Tag: **<G>**

In summary, the argument falls primarily under **<WCB>** due to its failure to establish a causal link between the two events and **<G>** due to generalizing from an isolated example.
