For 
To apply <IDAA> (Identify Defective Argument Attributes) to the statement "Sarah loves to wear running shoes, all girls must like to run," let's identify which of the defective argument types defined (Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Presumptuous Consensus, Ambiguous Language) are present in this statement:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The given statement takes a specific instance (Sarah loves to wear running shoes) and generalizes it to all girls. This is a classic case of over-generalization without sufficient evidence.
   - **Defective Argument Type Identified**: <G>

So, the statement "Sarah loves to wear running shoes, all girls must like to run" primarily exhibits the defective argument type of Generalization <G>. 

It assumes that because Sarah likes wearing running shoes, this preference extends to all girls, which is not a logically sound conclusion.
