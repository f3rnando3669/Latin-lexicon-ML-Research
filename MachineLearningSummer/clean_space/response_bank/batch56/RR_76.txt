For 
It's not entirely clear what you mean by applying <IDAA> to the phrase "This is an example of....". However, I can provide an example for each of the defective argument types you defined:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This often involves making a broad statement based on a limited amount of evidence.

   Example: "All politicians are corrupt because the two I know of have been involved in scandals."

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This type of argument fails to consider all possible options or cases.

   Example: "You can either support this policy or you don't care about the environment."

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This occurs when the reasoning presented for a conclusion does not fully support the conclusion.

   Example: "The local economy hasn’t improved. Clearly, the mayor’s policies are ineffective." (There could be other factors affecting the economy that are not considered.)

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This involves claiming a causation without sufficient evidence to back it up.

   Example: "I wore my green shirt, and my team won. My green shirt must be lucky."

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This is when a proposition is repeated without valid reasoning, often implying that repetition itself proves something.

   Example: "You should believe it because I say so. Believe me, it's true."

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This involves assuming that a claim is true because many people believe it, without proper evidence.

   Example: "Everyone knows that the Earth is flat, so it must be true."

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: This occurs when unclear or vague language is used, which can lead to misunderstanding or misinterpretation.

   Example: "The food at that restaurant is just amazing." (What does "amazing" specifically mean in this context?)

Applying these to "This is an example of....," we might end up with something like:

1. **Generalization (G)**: "This is an example of why all drivers are reckless."
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: "This is an example that shows you can only be happy if you're wealthy or famous."
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: "This is an example that shows because it rained yesterday, today will be dry."
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: "This is an example that shows flipping a coin caused it to land heads-up because of my lucky technique."
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: "This is an example that proves the product works because everyone keeps saying it does."
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: "This is an example that proves climate change is a hoax because many online forums agree with it."
7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: "This is an example of why that policy is bad." (The term "bad" is not clearly defined.)

Let me know if you meant something different by applying <IDAA> to "This is an example of...." or if you need further clarification.
