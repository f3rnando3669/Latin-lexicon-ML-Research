For 
To apply the defective argument types to the statement "Every time I wash my car, it rains the next day. My car washing definitely affects the weather," we can analyze it as follows:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This argument falls into the category of insufficient causal basis because there is no substantial evidence to support that washing a car directly causes it to rain. The correlation observed (washing the car and it raining the next day) is not sufficient to establish a causal relationship.

So, the defective argument type applied to the statement is:

**WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
