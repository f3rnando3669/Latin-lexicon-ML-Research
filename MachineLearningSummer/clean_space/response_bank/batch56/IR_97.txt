For 
<IDAA> refers to the Identified Defective Argument Analysis, where we apply the appropriate defective argument type to a given statement. 

The phrase "That's what you'd expect someone like him/her to say" can be considered a defective argument due to its nature as a presumptive and dismissive comment. The statement implies that the argument or opinion of "him/her" can be disregarded simply because it fits a stereotype or preconceived notion, rather than engaging with the actual content of what is being said.

This falls under the defective argument type <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus) because it assumes a consensus on a stereotype or bias about a person's behavior or statements without substantive engagement with the argument.

Therefore, applying <IDAA> to "That's what you'd expect someone like him/her to say":

<IDAA> <FU>
