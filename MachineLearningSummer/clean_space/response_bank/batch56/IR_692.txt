Based on the provided definitions of defective argument types, let's apply them to the statement: "If we donâ€™t bail out the big automakers, the US economy will collapse. Therefore, we need to bail out the automakers."

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - This statement does not appear to overgeneralize from a small set of specific instances to a broad conclusion. There is no evident effort to generalize from insufficient data here.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - The statement assumes that there are only two options: bailing out the automakers or the economy collapsing. It fails to consider other possible solutions or factors that might prevent the collapse without a bailout.
   - **Therefore, this argument can be classified as Incomplete Enumeration (FE).**

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - The argument states a potential cause (not bailing out automakers) leading to an effect (economy collapse) but does not provide robust evidence or a necessary connection between this cause and effect.
   - **Therefore, this argument can be classified as Inconclusive Reason (IR).**

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - Here, the argument makes a causal claim but does not provide sufficient evidence to establish a robust causal relationship between not bailing out the automakers and the collapse of the entire US economy.
   - **Therefore, this argument can be classified as Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).**

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - The argument does not seem to repeatedly state the same proposition with the aim of reinforcing the original claim without providing new evidence or justifications.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - The argument does not seem to imply or assume consensus without actual evidence or support about the necessity of bailing out automakers to save the economy.

7. **Ambiguous Language (DEP):**
   - The argument does not seem to rely on ambiguous terms. The terms "bail out," "big automakers," and "US economy" are used clearly and unambiguously.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis, the argument can be identified as:
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

Therefore, it is not well-supported due to these defective argument types.
