For 
<IDAA> appears to be undefined or not clarified within the context of the given defective argument types. However, analyzing the given statement "If you believe that I am wrong, prove to me that I am," we can identify potential defective argument types from the definitions provided.

This statement appears to shift the burden of proof onto the interlocutor without providing any evidence or supporting argumentation for the original position. This could be characterized as a form of argument where one side demands proof from the opposition without substantiating their own claims.

Based on the provided definitions, a few potential defective argument types can be applied:

1. **<G> Generalization**: This may apply if the speaker is assuming that no one can prove them wrong because they believe their argument is universally valid.
  
2. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: This might fit if the speaker is using the lack of proof against them as an inconclusive reason to support their stance.

3. **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: This could apply if the argument implicit assumes that the consensus should favor their position unless proven otherwise.

Given the context, the statement "If you believe that I am wrong, prove to me that I am" most closely aligns with <IR> Inconclusive Reason because it relies on the inconclusive basis that if no one can prove them wrong, they must be right.

Thus, we can classify the argument like this:

<IDAA> <IR>
