For 
In order to apply <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Analysis) to the given statement by Kirk, we need to evaluate the nature of the argument and identify which, if any, of the previously defined defective argument types it fits into:

"Kirk drew a picture of a fish and a human and with effusive disdain asked Richard if he really thought we were stupid enough to believe that a fish somehow turned into a human through just, like, random things happening over time."

### Analysis:

1. **Generalization (G)**: Kirk's statement seems to generalize the concept of evolution in a simplistic and erroneous way, implying that evolution asserts a direct transformation from fish to humans in a short and random process, which misrepresents the complex and gradual process described by evolutionary theory.
   
   **Type**: <G>

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument omits the extensive body of evidence and myriad intermediate species that underpin evolutionary biology. Instead, it presents a false dichotomy by only considering two endpoints (a fish and a human) without acknowledging the detailed stages in between.
   
   **Type**: <FE>
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Kirkâ€™s disdainful tone and rhetorical questioning do not provide a reasoned argument or evidence against evolutionary theory. Instead, it relies on incredulity and emotional appeal to dismiss the concept.
   
   **Type**: <IR>

4. **Ambiguous Language (DEP)**: The phrase "random things happening over time" is vague and can be misleading. It fails to convey the scientifically understood mechanisms of natural selection, genetic mutation, etc., that drive evolutionary changes.
   
   **Type**: <DEP>

### Defective Argument Types Identified:

- <G>: Generalization
- <FE>: Incomplete Enumeration
- <IR>: Inconclusive Reason
- <DEP>: Ambiguous Language

Therefore, "Kirk drew a picture of a fish and a human and with effusive disdain asked Richard if he really thought we were stupid enough to believe that a fish somehow turned into a human through just, like, random things happening over time" contains the following defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, and <DEP>.
