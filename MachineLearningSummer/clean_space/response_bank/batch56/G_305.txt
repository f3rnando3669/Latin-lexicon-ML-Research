The argument presented can be evaluated using the given defective argument types:

**Argument**: "I asked six of my friends what they thought of the new spending restraints and they agreed it is a good idea. The new restraints are therefore generally popular."

This argument can be classified under the following defective argument types:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument is based on the opinions of just six friends, which is a very small and non-representative sample. It is not sufficient to conclude that the new spending restraints are generally popular.

2. **Generalization (G)**: The argument generalizes the opinion of a small, specific group to the broader population without sufficient evidence.

3. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument presumes that since the speaker's friends agree, this opinion is representative of the general consensus, which may not be the case.

By analyzing the argument with this classification, it becomes clear that the reasoning presented is flawed due to an incomplete enumeration of opinions, an overgeneralization based on a small sample, and a presumptuous assumption of consensus.
