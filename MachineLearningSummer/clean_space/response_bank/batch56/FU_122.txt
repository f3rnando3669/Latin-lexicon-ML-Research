For 
The argument presented tries to persuade the reader to do, think, or buy something because it is popular or because "everyone" is doing it. This type of argument leverages the perception of widespread approval or adoption as a reason for the reader to follow suit.

Applying the defined defective argument types, the most relevant defective argument type in this scenario is:

<FU> - Presumptuous Consensus.

This is because the argument relies on the assumption that the popularity of an action or idea is a sufficient reason for its validity or worthiness, without providing substantive rationale beyond the consensus. It presumes that if "everyone" is doing it, it must be the correct or best course of action, which is not necessarily true and can be a misleading basis for persuasion.
