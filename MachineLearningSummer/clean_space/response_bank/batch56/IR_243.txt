For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Analysis. 

Applying <IDAA> to "Mining may destroy the environment, but how about the people whose jobs will be affected? Should we ban it?" may involve identifying the type of defective argument(s) used in this statement.

Let's analyze the argument:

1. **Generalization** (G): The argument might be generalizing by implying that all mining activities are equally destructive to the environment without specifying particular types or locations which may vary in impact.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration** (FE): The argument presents a false dichotomy, discussing only two factors—the impact on the environment and job loss—without considering other possible impacts or solutions. This fails to enumerate all relevant considerations, such as possible environmental regulations that allow mining while mitigating environmental damage.

3. **Inconclusive Reason** (IR): The argument suggests that the job impact alone is a reason not to ban mining, despite the fact that protecting jobs may not outweigh the environmental concerns. The reasoning here is inconclusive because it doesn't sufficiently weigh both sides of the argument or provide clear criteria for deciding between them.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis** (WCB): The argument hints at a causal relationship between banning mining and job loss, but it lacks sufficient evidence to support this claim. It doesn't consider alternative employment opportunities or the long-term economic impacts of environmental destruction, which could also affect jobs.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition** (RR): There may not be a faulty repetition directly in this argument, as it's making new points rather than repeating the same proposition differently.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus** (FU): The argument implies that job loss is a universally agreed-upon negative consequence outweighing environmental concerns without providing evidence that this is a broadly accepted consensus. It presumes a shared value judgment without substantiating it.

7. **Ambiguous Language** (DEP): Terms like "destroy the environment" and "jobs will be affected" are quite broad and vague. "Destroy" could mean anything from minor ecological disruption to complete devastation, and "affected" could mean job relocation, job loss, or job transformation, which makes the argument ambiguous.

In summary, this argument displays instances of **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** and **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, as it provides a limited scope of considerations and doesn't offer a thorough, balanced analysis of the issue at hand. Additionally, it may exhibit **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**, and **Ambiguous Language (DEP)** due to its lack of nuanced discussion and clear definitions.
