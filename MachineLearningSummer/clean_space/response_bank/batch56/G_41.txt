For 
The argument "Itâ€™s getting late, and we still have to decide on the school budget. What do you say we just leave it as is and we can call it a night?" can be analyzed using the defined defective argument types as follows:

<IDAA> (Identify and Discuss All Applicable Aspects):

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not sufficiently consider all the alternatives. It suggests a binary choice: either to continue deciding or to leave it as is without exploring other potential options that might be more effective.

2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning provided (that it is getting late) is not adequately related to the decision-making process regarding the school budget. The lateness of the hour is not a conclusive reason to abandon the decision process.

3. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument presumes that everyone will agree with the suggestion to leave the budget as is to end the meeting. It assumes a consensus without actually gauging others' opinions or considering other perspectives.

Applying these defective argument types, the given argument shows deficiencies in completeness, conclusiveness, and presumptuousness of consensus.
