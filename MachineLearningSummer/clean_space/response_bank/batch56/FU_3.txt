The argument presented can be analyzed using the defective argument types defined. The argument is as follows:

"A 2005 Gallup Poll found that an estimated 25% of Americans over the age of 18 believe in astrology - or that the position of the stars and planets can affect peopleâ€™s lives. This is roughly 75,000,000 people. Therefore, there must be some truth to astrology!"

Breaking this down, we can identify the following issues:

1. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument assumes that because a significant number of people (75,000,000) believe in astrology, it must be true. This is an appeal to belief, or the idea that if many people believe something, it must be correct.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not consider the opinions of the remaining 75% of the population. It selectively focuses on the 25% who believe in astrology and ignores those who do not, thereby presenting an incomplete picture of public opinion.

Applying these defective argument types, the argument can be rephrased and critiqued as follows:

"The 2005 Gallup Poll result that 25% of Americans believe in astrology does not logically lead to the conclusion that astrology is true. This is a case of <FU>, as the popularity of a belief does not establish its truth. Furthermore, the argument fails to account for the fact that the majority of Americans, 75%, do not believe in astrology, making it an <FE> as it presents an incomplete enumeration of the opinions."

Therefore, the argument is defective mainly due to the fallacies of Presumptuous Consensus (FU) and Incomplete Enumeration (FE).
