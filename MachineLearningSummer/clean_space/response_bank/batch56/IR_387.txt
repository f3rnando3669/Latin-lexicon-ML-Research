For 
<IDAA>: Identify Defective Argument Application

In the given statement, "Sir, please let me take the exam. I was late because I need to cook our breakfast and wash the dishes," the defective argument most closely applicable is <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).

**Explanation**:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided for being late (cooking breakfast and washing dishes) is inconclusive in addressing whether the request to take the exam should be granted. The necessity of performing those tasks does not inherently justify an exception to exam rules or policies.

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the given statement results in identifying the use of an <IR>:
"Sir, please let me take the exam. I was late because I need to cook our breakfast and wash the dishes." <IR>
