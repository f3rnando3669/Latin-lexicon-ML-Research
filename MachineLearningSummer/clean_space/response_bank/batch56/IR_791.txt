<IDAA>: Identify Defective Argument Applications

In the dialogue provided:

**Brandon: We should have tastier lunches!**
**Jaylen: Don't listen to him! He's a terrible person! I saw him trip another student and steal his lunch money!**

The argument presented by Jaylen can be analyzed as follows:

1. **Argument from Brandon**: "We should have tastier lunches!"
   - **Proposition**: Tastier lunches are desirable.

2. **Response from Jaylen**: "Don't listen to him! He's a terrible person! I saw him trip another student and steal his lunch money!"
   - **Type of Defective Argument Involved**: <Ad Hominem> (a kind of fallacy that attacks the character or circumstances of an individual instead of addressing the argument itself).

Specific Defective Argument Type(s):

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Jaylenâ€™s response does not address the proposition about the lunches directly but focuses on Brandon's character. This might involve elements suggesting that due to Brandon's bad behavior, nothing he says should be considered, which is an incomplete evaluation of the argument itself.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Jaylen provides reasons to question Brandon's character but does not provide any reasons regarding why tastier lunches are a bad idea. The reasons given are irrelevant to the central proposition about tastier lunches.

Therefore, the response from Jaylen contains elements of <IR> because it fails to provide a conclusively relevant reason against the proposition of having tastier lunches, and potentially elements reflecting <FE> because it uses an incomplete evaluation concerning Brandon's moral character to dismiss his argument.
