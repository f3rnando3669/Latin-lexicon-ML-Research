Applying the concept of defective argument types to the statement "You need to go to the party with me, otherwise youâ€™ll just be bored at home":

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument assumes that the only two options are going to the party or being bored at home. It doesn't consider other potential alternatives, like engaging in a different enjoyable activity at home or going somewhere else.

Therefore, the statement fits the **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** defective argument type.
