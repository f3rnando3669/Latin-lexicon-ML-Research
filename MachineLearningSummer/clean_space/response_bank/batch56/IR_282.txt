The argument "We haven’t proven aliens didn’t create life on earth, so aliens created life on earth." is an example of a defective argument type.

In your list of defective argument types, this specific argument falls under the type:

- <IR> Inconclusive Reason.

This is because the argument is using the lack of disproof (absence of evidence) to claim proof (evidence of presence), which is a faulty way of reasoning. It presumes that not having disproven something is equivalent to having proven it, which is logically invalid.
