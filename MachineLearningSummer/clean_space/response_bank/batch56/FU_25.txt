For 
The argument "assumes that if many people act or believe a certain way, it must be the right way" can be identified as the defective argument type called Presumptuous Consensus. This type of reasoning erroneously presupposes that the popularity or widespread acceptance of an idea equates to its correctness or validity. 

Thus, the argument can be tagged as:

**<FU>**: **Presumptuous Consensus**

The result is:
```markdown
<FU>: assumes that if many people act or believe a certain way, it must be the right way.
```

So, '<IDAA>' for this argument is <FU>.
