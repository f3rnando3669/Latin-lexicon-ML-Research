For 
<IDAA> stands for Identification and Analysis of Defective Arguments. Given the statement, "I'd like to punch him in the face." by Donald Trump, made in February 2016 at a campaign rally and directed at a protester who was being escorted out, we can analyze whether this statement involves any of the defective argument types defined above.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This statement doesn’t seem to involve a generalization. It’s expressed as an individual instance of desire for physical action against one person.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: There’s no indication of an incomplete list or exclusive options here. The statement is focused on one specific action.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: There's no reasoning provided in the statement. It’s a direct expression of emotion or intent without a supporting argument or evidence.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: There’s no causal relationship being discussed. The statement doesn’t try to explain or justify an event based on insufficient cause.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: There is no repetitive argument or proposition being made here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The statement doesn’t claim or rely on a consensus or collective agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: The language in the statement is not ambiguous; it’s quite clear in its intention.

Therefore, it seems that the given statement by Donald Trump does not directly fall into any of the predefined defective argument types.

However, if we extend the analysis to the context in which it was said, we could examine the rhetorical implications:

- The aggressive desire expressed could be part of a broader argument that provokes or legitimizes violence (<G>), but this would require a pattern of similar statements to establish a true generalization defect.
- It could also be seen as a rhetorical flourish meant to rile up supporters (presumptuous assertion of a collective or emotional <FU>).

Strictly based on the definitions and the specific statement, <IDAA> analysis concludes that the statement does not exhibit the explicitly defined defective argument types without further context.
