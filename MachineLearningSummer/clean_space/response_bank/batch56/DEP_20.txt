For 
The process of identifying and defining argument types applied to the provided statement can be detailed as follows:

The statement to be examined is: "If I tell my teacher I have done my homework, but I have only done part of it, I am using."

Let's break it down:

1. "I have done my homework" implies completion, which does not align with the actual situation of only having done part of it.
2. The implication here is a form of misleading communication due to leaving out important details (i.e., not specifying that only part of the homework was done).

Given the provided list of defective argument types, we can categorize this situation accordingly:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument type does not fit well since the statement is not making a broad generalization.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This applies since the argument provides incomplete information. Stating that the homework is done without specifying the part that is incomplete is a form of withholding full details.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This does not directly apply as the statement is not providing an inconclusive reason for the claim.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This doesn't seem applicable here since the issue is more about the misleading nature of the statement rather than a causal link.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This is not relevant since the statement does not involve a repetition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This does not apply since thereâ€™s no assumption of consensus involved.
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: This could be relevant since the term "done my homework" is used ambiguously, implying full completion when only part of it is done.

Therefore, the statement "If I tell my teacher I have done my homework, but I have only done part of it, I am using" can best be categorized under:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: due to providing incomplete information about the homework.
- **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: since the phrase "done my homework" is used in an ambiguous manner.

So, the correct identification and application of defective argument types to the given statement would be:

"If I tell my teacher I have done my homework, but I have only done part of it, I am using <FE> and <DEP>."
