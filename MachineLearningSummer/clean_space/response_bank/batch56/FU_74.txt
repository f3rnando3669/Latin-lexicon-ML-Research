For 
<IDAA> stands for Identifying Defective Argument Types and Analyzing Arguments.

Here's an application of <IDAA> to the argument "AttP 9: everyone wearing new llama wool coats makes them warm":

1. **Identification of the Argument**:
   - **Argument Claim**: Everyone wearing new llama wool coats makes them warm.
   
2. **Analysis and Classification of Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument might fall under Generalization, as it makes a broad claim about "everyone" based on potentially limited evidence. The statement assumes that the warmth provided by llama wool coats applies universally without exceptions.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: There could be an element of Incomplete Enumeration if the argument fails to consider factors like the quality of the coat, individual variations in sensation, or environmental conditions. The argument doesn't list all possible variables and factors influencing warmth.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The argument might also be considered Inconclusive Reason because it doesn't provide sufficient evidence or reasoning to conclusively support the claim. It assumes a direct cause-and-effect relationship without presenting supporting data or variables.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Insufficient Causal Basis could be another applicable type, as the argument makes a causal claim—wearing the coat causes warmth—without exploring or substantiating how or why this causation holds universally.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This type doesn't seem directly applicable unless the statement were repeated without additional evidence merely to assert its truth.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Presumptuous Consensus might apply if the argument assumes that this view is universally accepted without evidence or consensus.
   - **Ambiguous Language (<DEP>)**: There seems to be no ambiguous language in the statement. The terms used are specific and clear.

Conclusion:
The argument "AttP 9: everyone wearing new llama wool coats makes them warm" can primarily be classified under <G> (Generalization) and <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration). It makes a broad sweeping statement based on potentially limited or unexamined evidence and doesn't account for all relevant factors influencing warmth. 

Other potentially applicable defective argument types include <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis), given the lack of detailed causal analysis and evidence.
