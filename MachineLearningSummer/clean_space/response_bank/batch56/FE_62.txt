For 
<IDAA> stands for identifying and analyzing the defective argument. So let's identify the fallacy in the statement "Either we have the full football season or we scrap it altogether and have zero football."

The fallacy here is a False Dichotomy (False Dilemma). This fallacy occurs when an argument presents two options as the only possible ones, while in reality, there could be other alternatives.

Now, since <IDAA> includes the defective argument types we've defined, let's map this to one of those types.

The statement "Either we have the full football season or we scrap it altogether and have zero football" suggests a binary choice without considering other feasible options, such as having a shortened or modified football season.

Therefore, this argument aligns most closely with:

<FE> - Incomplete Enumeration: This defective argument occurs when an argument lists some possibilities but fails to consider all relevant options.

Thus, the statement is an example of Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>).
