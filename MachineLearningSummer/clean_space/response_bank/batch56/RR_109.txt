To identify and analyze the argument's defects, we apply the defined defective argument types to the given proposition.

“She is the best candidate for president because she is better than the other candidates!”

Examining this argument, it seems repetitive without providing concrete evidence on why the candidate is better. We can consider the defective argument types:

1. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The argument essentially restates the conclusion as its own justification, without providing new or substantive support. The argument says she is the best because she is better, which is a tautology and fails to offer real evidence or reasoning.

Thus, applying <IDAA> (Identifying Defective Argument Types and Addressing Argument):

- The argument type here is primarily <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).

Therefore, we conclude:
This argument is faulty as it employs <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition). To strengthen the argument, specific qualities or achievements that make the candidate better than the others need to be enumerated.
