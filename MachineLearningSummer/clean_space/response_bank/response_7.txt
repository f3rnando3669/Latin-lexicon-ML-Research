For 
Let's apply the steps from the <Full_Sent> method to analyze the string "Although she was considered smart, she failed all her exams."

### 1. Parse and Identify Clauses (Independent and Dependent)
- **Clause 1**: "Although she was considered smart" — This is a dependent clause because it cannot stand alone as a complete sentence.
- **Clause 2**: "she failed all her exams" — This is an independent clause because it can stand alone as a complete sentence.

Since we have one independent clause and at least one dependent clause, the sentence type is **<CC>** (Complex Sentence with one independent clause and at least one dependent clause).

### 2. Identify Sentence Opener
- The sentence begins with the word "Although," which is a subordinating conjunction, indicating it is a clause opener.

So, the opener type is **<C>**.

### 3. Analyze Rhetorical Type
- The structure follows the pattern: Dependent clause + Main clause
- This fits the definition of a periodic rhetorical type where parallel dependent clauses or phrases precede the main clause.

Thus, the rhetorical type is **<P>**.

### 4. Identify Rhetorical Meter
- Segment the sentence into syllables:
  - Al-though (unstressed, stressed) — **<t>**
  - she (unstressed) — **<sp>**
  - was (stressed) — **<i>**
  - con-sid-ered (unstressed, stressed, unstressed) — **<t> + <sp>**
  - smart (stressed) — **<i>**
  - she (unstressed) — **<sp>**
  - failed (stressed) — **<i>**
  - all (stressed) — **<i>**
  - her (unstressed) — **<sp>**
  - ex-ams (unstressed, stressed) — **<t>**

  Analysis of meter components:
  - The sentence predominantly uses **<t>** (unstressed, stressed), **<sp>** (both unstressed), and **<i>** (stressed, unstressed) patterns.

### 5. Classify Rhythm and Euphony
- Utilizing the identified rhetorical meter patterns:
  - The sentence has a complex mix of stress patterns with a combination of different rhythmic units.
  - Such sentences are often seen as intricate and layered with varied rhythmic patterns.

Thus, the rhythm and euphony type is **<CV>** (Complex and varied).

### 6. Determine Sentence Function
- The nature of the sentence is declarative since it states a fact.

Therefore, the function of the sentence is a **statement (<S>)**.

### Full_Sent Analysis Result
Based on the analysis, we derive the following classifications for the sentence "Although she was considered smart, she failed all her exams":

1. **Clause and Sentence Type**: <CC> (Complex Sentence)
2. **Sentence Opener**: <C> (Clause Opener)
3. **Rhetorical Type**: <P> (Periodic)
4. **Rhetorical Meter**: Patterns primarily identified as <t>, <sp>, and <i>.
5. **Rhythm and Euphony**: <CV> (Complex and varied)
6. **Sentence Function**: <S> (Statement)

By systematically following these steps, we achieve a comprehensive analysis of the sentence.
