Sure, let's apply the steps of <IDAA> to the string "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding." and then perform a critique using <CRTQ>.

### Application of <D> to <IDA> for the string "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding."

#### Step 1: Initial Reading and Understanding
- Read the string carefully: "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding."
- Context: The speaker is justifying their driving speed by comparing it to the speed of other drivers.

#### Step 2: Identify Key Elements
- Key elements identified: The speaker is using the behavior of others (everyone else driving fast) as a justification for their own behavior (driving fast and claiming they weren't speeding).

#### Step 3: Match to Definitions
- Compare with definitions:
    - <G> (Generalization): Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
    - <FE> (False Enumeration): Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
    - <IR> (Inappropriate Reason): Provides a reason that doesnâ€™t logically support the proposition.
    - <RR> (Redundant Reason): A reason presented as new but is the same as the proposition.
    - <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis): Offers a not compelling enough causal basis.
    - <FU> (False Universals): Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
    - <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases): Uses statements open to dual interpretations.

#### Step 4: Eliminate Non-matching Types
- <G>, <FE>, <RR>, <WCB>, <DEP> do not fit because the argument is not making a broad generalization, enumerating options, being redundant, having a weak causal link, or creating a double interpretation.
- <IR> and <FU> remain as potential matches:
    - <IR>: The reason provided does not logically support the proposition (everyone else was speeding doesn't logically justify the individual's speeding).
    - <FU>: The speaker might be asserting a universally agreed-upon point without proof (everyone was driving fast as a form of validation).

#### Step 5: Confirm Matching Type
- The string "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding." fits best under <FU> (False Universals):
    - By appealing to the behavior of the collective group (everyone else driving fast), the speaker is attempting to validate their own behavior regardless of the actual speed limit or law.

#### Step 6: Classification
- Classify the string as <FU> (False Universals).

### Critique of the Choice of Words (<CRTQ>):
#### Read the Critique Brief
- Review the classification to ensure the reasoning and classification type <FU> is accurate.

#### Examine Reasoning
- The classification seems to fit as the string uses the behavior of a group to justify individual actions, aiming for validation.

#### Propose Better Alternatives (if any)
- No alternative classifications more accurately describe this fallacy than <FU>.

Based on the process applied:

1. The argument relies on an implied agreement or common behavior (everyone's speeding).
2. This is used to validate the speaker's behavior without proof of relevance to the law (speed limit).

Hence, <FU> is a valid classification for "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding."

Therefore, the application of <CRTQ> supports retaining the classification as <FU> (False Universals), as it accurately identifies the fallacy in the argument presented in the string.
