To apply the process of applying the decomposition of an advanced task (<D>) to the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types (<IDAA>), specifically to the text provided, we'll follow the step-by-step principles we've outlined. Then, we'll apply a critique of the choice of words (<CRTQ>).

### Application of <IDAA> to the Given Text

1. **Input**: "I see nobody on the road," said Alice.
   "I only wish I had such eyes," the king remarked..."To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why it's as much as I can do to see real people, by this light."

2. **Process**:

   1. **Check Generalization (<G>)**:
      - Examine if the text makes a broad claim based on a specific instance.
      - No generalization is being asserted here. It's a specific observation.

   2. **Check False Enumeration (<FE>)**:
      - Evaluate whether the text lists fewer or more options than exist.
      - The text doesn’t enumerate options.

   3. **Check Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**:
      - Determine if the text provides a reason that does not logically support the proposition.
      - There isn't a proposition being supported by an inappropriate reason.

   4. **Check Redundant Reason (<RR>)**:
      - Assess if the text presents a reason that merely rephrases the proposition.
      - No redundant reasoning is identified here.

   5. **Check Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
      - Verify if the text offers a weak or insufficient causal basis.
      - There's no causal relationship being argued here.

   6. **Check False Universals (<FU>)**:
      - Look for assertions of universally agreed points without proof.
      - This does not apply to the given text.

   7. **Check Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**:
      - Identify if the text has statements open to dual interpretations.
      - **Yes**, the statement "To be able to see Nobody!" is a double-edged phrase. It can be interpreted in two ways: seeing the absence of anyone or seeing a character named "Nobody."

3. **Output**: The classification of the text as <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases).

### Critics The Choice of Words Resulting from the Application (<CRTQ>)

Now let's critique and offer an alternative set of words that achieve the same purpose, while highlighting the dual interpretations. 

#### Critique and Rewording

Original Text:
- "I see nobody on the road," said Alice.
- "I only wish I had such eyes," the king remarked..."To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why it's as much as I can do to see real people, by this light."

#### Changes:
- Highlight the dual interpretations explicitly for clarity.

**Reworded**:
- "I see no one on the road," said Alice.
- "I only wish I could see as you do," the king remarked. "To be able to see 'no one'! And from that distance, no less! Why, it's hard enough for me to see real people, given this dim light."

By making the reworded text explicit about the dual interpretation, “no one” and “Nobody,” we've critiqued and revised the original ambiguous phrase to maintain clarity while retaining the humorous intent of the original conversation.

### Summary
**Original Classification**:
- The text was classified as a <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases).

**Critique and Reword**:
- Original ambiguous phrase "To be able to see Nobody!"
- Reworded for clarity: "To be able to see 'no one'!"

This application of <CRTQ> to the <IDAA> process ensures that the ambiguity is maintained but made clearer, enhancing understanding without losing the original essence of the dialogue.
