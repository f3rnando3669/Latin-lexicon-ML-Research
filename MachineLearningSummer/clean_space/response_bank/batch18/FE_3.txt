For 
Applying <CRTQ> to "People either like coffee or hate it." involves critiquing the choice of words to better align with the proper classification of the argument type. Let's start by applying <IDAA> to the string and then critique it:

### Applying <IDAA>:

1. **Identify the Key Proposition**: The main proposition here is "People either like coffee or hate it."

2. **Analyze Supporting Points**: The statement presents two options: liking coffee or hating it, thereby excluding any middle ground or alternative feelings about coffee.

3. **Map Supporting Points to Categories**: The statement falsely limits people's preferences to only two categories, ignoring the possibility of neutral or mixed feelings.

4. **Classify the Argument**: According to the definitions provided, this fits the definition of <FE> (False Enumeration).

### Output:
The defective argument type for the string "People either like coffee or hate it." is <FE> (False Enumeration).

---

### Applying <CRTQ>:

Now, let's critique the choice of words used in the string to identify why it's categorized as <FE> and how it can be rephrased for clarity:

- The phrase "either like coffee or hate it" is an example of a false dilemma because it simplifies a range of possible attitudes into just two extremes.

#### Critiqued Version:
"People have varied opinions about coffee; some like it, some dislike it, and others have mixed or neutral feelings."

In this revised version, the critique addresses the false enumeration by presenting a more nuanced and accurate representation of people's attitudes towards coffee, which removes the defective argument type <FE>.

### Conclusion:
The task <IDAA> classifies the string "People either like coffee or hate it." as <FE> due to the false enumeration of options. By applying <CRTQ>, we critique and refine the statement to represent the full range of possible opinions, thus eliminating the defective argument.
