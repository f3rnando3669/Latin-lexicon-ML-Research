Sure, let's go through the process step-by-step as detailed in the task decomposition:

### Step-by-step <IDAA> Execution:

1. **Reading and Understanding**:
   - Read the statement: "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!"

2. **Categorize the Statement**:
   - Does it generalize based on specific instances? Yes, it generalizes guilt from an organization to a specific individual without additional context or proof. This looks like <G> (Generalization).
   - Does it artificially limit options? No, it doesn't present a false binary or limited choice (<FE>).
   - Is the reason irrelevant to the statement’s core? No, the connection drawn is directly related to the accusation (not <IR>).
   - Does it merely repeat the proposition’s point? No, it’s not a redundant restatement (<RR>).
   - Is the causal basis weak? Yes, it implies that the mere association with the church implicates the individual without direct evidence of their involvement (<WCB>).
   - Does it assert a universal truth without evidence? Not specifically targeting a universal claim but rather an individual’s involvement (<FU>).
   - Is it open to dual interpretations? No (<DEP>).

3. **Apply Classification**:
   - The statement generalizes from a specific scandal involving an organization to indict an individual based on mere association without any substantial proof of their individual involvement. This falls under <G> (Generalization).

4. **Validate Classification**:
   - Reassessing the characteristics, it confirms that it is a generalization based on a specific instance involving an organization and wrongly applied to the individual.

Therefore, the statement "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!" is best classified as <G> (Generalization).

### Applying <CRTQ> to the Process

Applying <CRTQ> (Critique the choice of words) to refine the classification process output:

**Original Statement**:
"I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!"

**Refinement**:

1. Identify the inappropriate generalization:
   - The statement makes an inappropriate leap from an organization's actions to individual guilt without proof.

2. Critique the core assumption:
   - The core issue is the assumption that belonging to an organization taints an individual with all its actions, which is logically flawed and unfairly prejudicial.

3. Suggest a more precise rephrasing:
   - "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. However, it’s unjust and unsupported to accuse my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who merely attends Church, of guilt by association without direct evidence."

**Refined Argument Classification**:
- By correcting the generalization and honing in the flaw in the argument, we reaffirm that the original statement improperly generalizes guilt from the organization to an individual. Hence, the classification remains as <G> (Generalization).

By critiquing the wording, we ensure the focus remains clear on the logical flaw inherent in the original argument. This confirms and reinforces our classification: the original statement is indeed a <G> (Generalization).
