For 
To apply <CRTQ> to "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses":

1. **Identify Potential Fallacy**:
    - The argument uses a formal structure known as a syllogism, but we need to evaluate if the premises and conclusion are logically connected and valid.

2. **Critique the choice of words**:
    - The premises need to be scrutinized for their definitions and logical consistency.
    - Specifically, the argument hinges on the definitions of "innocent human beings" and whether fetuses fit this classification.

3. **Revised Argument with Improved Wording**:
    - Ensure the argument maintains logical consistency while clarifying terms to avoid ambiguities.

### Critique and Revised Wording:

Original Argument:
> "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."

### <CRTQ> Analysis:

- The original argument is clear but requires careful examination of the terms and logical flow.
- The term "innocent human beings" is broad and should be clarified.
- Ensure that the argument addresses potential counterpoints to strengthen its validity.

### Revised Argument:
> "The act of killing an innocent human being is generally considered immoral according to many ethical frameworks. If we classify fetuses as innocent human beings, then, within the same ethical frameworks, it would follow that killing fetuses is also considered immoral. However, this conclusion is contingent upon widely accepted definitions and the consistency of the ethical frameworks applied."

### Justification of the Revised Argument:
- This version clearly states the ethical premise and introduces a conditional statement about the classification of fetuses.
- It acknowledges the dependency on ethical frameworks and definitions, promoting a more nuanced and balanced discourse.

Through the critique and revisal process, the argument becomes clearer, avoiding absolute statements and instead framing the argument within widely accepted ethical considerations.
