For 
Let's apply the defined steps of <IDAA> to the string "Everyone else is doing it, so should you," and then we'll use <CRTQ> to critique the choice of words.

### Step-by-Step Classification of the String <s>

#### Step 1: Identify the Key Components
- **Main Claim**: You should do it.
- **Reason Provided**: Because everyone else is doing it.

#### Step 2: Match Components to Definitions
- This argument relies on the reasoning that the action is valid or should be taken because it is popular or commonly done.

#### Step 3: Evaluate Each Match
- This matches the characteristics of <FU>, False Universals, since it asserts a universal truth (that the action should be done simply because everyone else does it) without providing any substantive proof.

#### Step 4: Classify the String
- The string should be classified as <FU>.

### Application of <CRTQ>

Now, let's critique the choice of words used in this classification process to ensure clarity and precision. We'll aim to output another set of words for the same purpose with enhanced clarity.

**Original Classification Description:**
- "This argument relies on the reasoning that the action is valid or should be taken because it is popular or commonly done."

**Critiqued and Revised Classification Description:**
- "This argument suggests that you should perform an action because it is widely accepted or commonly practiced by others, without presenting any concrete evidence for its intrinsic value or validity."

**Original Classify the String Statement:**
- "The string should be classified as <FU>."

**Critiqued and Revised Classify the String Statement:**
- "Based on the evaluation, the argument fits the criteria of False Universals (<FU>), since it relies on the popularity of the action as justification, rather than on factual evidence or logical reasoning."

By applying <CRTQ>, we've refined the language to ensure that the rationale behind classifying the string as <FU> is clear and logically presented.

### Final Classification
The string "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" is classified as <FU>, False Universals. This conclusion is drawn from the argument's reliance on the popularity of the action rather than providing any substantive, logical support.
