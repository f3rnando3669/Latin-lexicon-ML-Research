For 
To apply <CRTQ> to the task of classifying the statement "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick." as per the definitions provided, follow these steps:

### Steps for Critiquing the Choice of Words (CRTQ) in Applying IDAA

1. **Understand and Review Original Task (<IDAA>)**:
   - We need to classify the statement "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick." into one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>.

2. **Identify Key Features of the Statement**:
   - The statement links drinking bottled water to getting sick without providing substantial evidence for the causality.

3. **Match Key Features to Definitions**:
   - Evaluate which defective argument type fits: Does the statement generalize? Does it provide a weak causal basis? Etc.

4. **Initial Classification**:
   - The statement appears to provide a weak causal basis, suggesting without sufficient evidence that the bottled water caused the illness.

5. **Eliminate Inapplicable Categories**:
   - Not a general truth based on a specific instance → not <G>
   - No enumeration of fewer or more options → not <FE>
   - No inappropriate reason provided → not <IR>
   - No redundancy observed → not <RR>
   - No false universals or universally agreed points without proof → not <FU>
   - No double-edged phrases → not <DEP>

6. **Select the Best Match**:
   - The best match appears to be <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis).

7. **Justify the Choice**:
   - The statement lacks sufficient evidence to definitively claim that drinking bottled water caused the sickness, fitting the description of providing a weak causal basis.

### Critique of the Classification (CRTQ)

1. **Review the Initial Classification**:
   - The initial classification identified the statement as <WCB>.

2. **Evaluate the Accuracy and Completeness**:
   - Consider if other defective argument types might also apply or if the initial reasoning is sound.

3. **Provide an Improved Justification if Necessary**:
   - Confirm if the weak causality is indeed the primary issue.

**Critiqued and Final Classification**:
   - The statement "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick." is best classified as <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis) because the statement fails to provide sufficient evidence for a definitive causal connection between drinking the bottled water and getting sick.

### Critiqued and Revised Explanation:
   - The assertion that bottled water caused the illness is made without presenting compelling evidence to substantiate the claim. This fits the definition of Weak Causal Basis because the causal link between the two events is not well-supported.

Thus, the logical fallacy used in the statement is best identified as **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
