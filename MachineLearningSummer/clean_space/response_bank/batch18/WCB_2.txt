Sure, let's first apply the step-by-step process to classify the argument given by "Farmer McDonald: Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain. I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature." Then, we will critique the choice of words.

### Step-by-Step Classification (IDAA) of the Argument

#### Step 1: Identify and Parse the Argument
- **Extracted Content**: "Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain. I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature."

#### Step 2: Determine the Basis of the Argument
- **Basis**: The argument is making a causal connection between the construction of a new power plant and the lack of rain. Additionally, it comments on human interference with nature without providing direct evidence for the causation.

#### Step 3: Match with Defective Argument Types
- **Matching**: The statement provides a weak causal basis (Weak Causal Basis, <WCB>) by linking the construction of the power plant to the lack of rain without substantial evidence.

#### Step 4: Classify the Argument
- **Classification**: <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)

#### Step 5: Report the Classification
- **Output**: "This argument is classified as <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis) because it suggests a cause-and-effect relationship between the construction of the power plant and the lack of rain without providing compelling evidence that one caused the other."

### Critique of the Choice of Words (CRTQ)

**Original Argument** (Action <a>): "Farmer McDonald: Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain. I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature."

**Critique (CRTQ)**:
- "Farmer McDonald attributes the lack of rain to the new power plant without presenting any scientific evidence. A more accurate and neutral way to articulate this concern might be: 'I've noticed that since the new power plant was constructed, we've experienced a significant dry spell. This makes me wonder if there might be an impact from human activities on our local weather patterns.' This way, the statement acknowledges an observed pattern without jumping to an unsupported causative conclusion."

By critiquing the choice of words, we make the argument more precise and less prone to misinterpretation while avoiding an unsupported cause-and-effect assertion.
