### Applying <CRTQ> to <IDAA> for the Statement:

Given Statement <s>: "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDAA> (Decomposing Task of Classifying Arguments):

1. **Read and Understand the Statement <s>**:
   - Carefully read the statement to comprehend its content and context.

2. **Identify Key Elements in the Statement**:
   - Key elements: 
     - Claim: Donald Trump got elected.
     - Reason given: Liberals took political correctness too far.

3. **Match Elements to Definitions of Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization <G>**: The statement does not make a sweeping claim based on limited examples.
   - **False Enumeration <FE>**: The statement isn't listing limited or unnecessary options.
   - **Inappropriate Reason <IR>**: This statement may fit this category since it provides a reason (liberals took political correctness too far) that doesn't necessarily logically support the conclusion (Donald Trump got elected). The reason might be considered opinion-based and not directly causally related to the election outcome.
   - **Redundant Reason <RR>**: The reasoning here is not a restatement of the proposition.
   - **Weak Causal Basis <WCB>**: This could also be possible as it suggests a causal relationship that might not be adequately supported.
   - **False Universals <FU>**: The statement does not claim something as universally true without proof. It is making a specific claim.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases <DEP>**: The statement does not appear to have ambiguous dual interpretations.

4. **Classify the Statement <s>**:
   - This falls under **Inappropriate Reason <IR>** because the reason given (liberals taking political correctness too far) does not logically or substantively support the proposition that this is why Donald Trump got elected.

5. **Verify the Classification**:
   - Double-checking confirms that **Inappropriate Reason <IR>** is the appropriate classification as the causal link is more opinionated than a logical one.

6. **Document the Classification**:
   - Final classification: <IR>
   - Explanation: The statement uses the reason of liberal excess in political correctness to explain Trump’s election, which doesn't have a clear, direct logical connection supporting the cause-and-effect relationship implied.

### Applying <CRTQ> (Critique the Choice of Words) to the Classification Task:

1. **Understand the Purpose of the Original Words**:
   - The intent is to provide a reason for Donald Trump's election.

2. **Assess the Appropriateness and Impact of the Words**:
   - The words might seem biased and overly simplistic in establishing a causal relationship.

3. **Generate Alternative Phrases**:
   - Instead of focusing on political correctness alone, it could be more impactful to consider broader contexts or multiple factors:
     - "Donald Trump's election can be attributed to a variety of factors, including but not limited to, reactions against political correctness and economic discontent."
     - "Analyzing the reasons behind Donald Trump's election involves multiple dimensions such as voters' discontent with the status quo and the political correctness debate."

4. **Output Another Set of Words for the Same Purpose**:
   - Final Output: "Analyzing the reasons behind Donald Trump’s election involves multiple dimensions, including voters' economic concerns, political correctness backlash, and broader socio-political dynamics."

By refining the statement through <CRTQ>, we provide a more nuanced, less biased, and comprehensive perspective on the reasons behind Donald Trump’s election. This approach avoids the pitfalls of <IR> by presenting a more logically structured and broad-based reasoning.
