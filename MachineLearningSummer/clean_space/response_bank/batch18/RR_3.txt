### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) for IDA on the Provided String:

1. **Understand the Argument Types:**
   - Review and fully understand the definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

2. **Identify Key Features in the String:**
   - Examine the conversation to identify characteristics or keywords that might indicate a specific argument type. 

3. **Categorize the String:**
   - Based on identified features, match the string to the relevant argument type.

4. **Cross-Verify:**
   - Double-check the classification by reviewing the definitions again and ensuring that the identified features align with the chosen argument type.

5. **Document Classification:**
   - Clearly document the identified argument type and the reasons for this classification by referencing specific parts of the conversation.

### Applying IDAA to the Provided String

1. **Understand the Argument Types:**
   - We are familiar with the definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

2. **Identify Key Features in the String:**
   - The conversation shows a circular reasoning pattern:
     - Speaker 1 asserts a proposition (Jesus was not really crucified).
     - Speaker 2 asks for proof.
     - Speaker 1 references the Quran.
     - Speaker 2 questions the validity of the Quran.
     - Speaker 1 insists the Quran is true because it is the Word of God.
     - Speaker 2 again questions the source.
     - Speaker 1 returns to the Quran as validation.

3. **Categorize the String:**
   - This fits the definition of <IR> (Inappropriate Reason) because the reason provided (the Quran says so) does not logically support the proposition without independently establishing the Quran's validity and truth.
   - It also could be seen as <RR> (Redundant Reason) since the reasoning ultimately circles back to the Quran claiming it is the truth because it says it is.

4. **Cross-Verify:**
   - Double-checking the classification:
     - Given that the conversation demonstrates a reasoning loop without external validation, it aligns more closely with <IR> (Inappropriate Reason).

5. **Document Classification:**
   - The conversation "Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified. / Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true? / Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so. / Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct? / Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true. / Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true? / Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran." is classified as <IR> because the reasons provided do not logically support the proposition without external validation.

### Applying CRTQ to the Classification Output:

**Original Classification Output:**
The conversation "Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified. / Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true? / Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so. / Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct? / Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true. / Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true? / Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran." is classified as <IR> because the reasons provided do not logically support the proposition without external validation.

**Critiqued and Improved Classification Output:**
The conversation about the crucifixion of Jesus demonstrates the Inappropriate Reason (<IR>) fallacy. The claim rests on the Quran's authority without independently validating the Quran itself, thus failing to logically support the initial proposition.

This improved wording simplifies and highlights the core issue with the argument type classification clearly and concisely.
