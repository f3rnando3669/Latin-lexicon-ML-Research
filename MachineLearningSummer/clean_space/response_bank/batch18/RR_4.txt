For 
To apply <CRTQ> to Apply <IDAA> to "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there," we'll deconstruct and critique each step of the classification process. This will allow us to ensure clarity, precision, and alignment with specific argument types.

### Steps for <IDAA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition in <s>**:
   - Proposition: "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there."
   
2. **Analyze the Structure**:
   - Structure: The argument claims that the restaurant’s popularity is justified by the fact that everyone in town visits it.

3. **Match Characteristics to Definition**:
   - Analyze whether this is a case of Generalization, False Enumeration, Inappropriate Reason, Redundant Reason, Weak Causal Basis, False Universals, or Double-Edged Phrases.

4. **Classify the Argument**:
   - The key element is the argument that the restaurant's popularity is based on the fact that "everyone in town goes there."
   - This matches the characteristics of **False Universals (FU)**, which involves asserting universally agreed points without proof and appealing to popularity.

5. **Validate with Examples**:
   - Compare with provided examples of **False Universals (FU)**.
     - Example: "Everyone else is buying it, so you should too!" aligns with the same structure of appealing to popularity to validate the argument.
   
6. **Output the Classification**:
   - The string "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there" is classified as <FU>.

### Output: <FU>

Next, we apply <CRTQ> to enhance the description of our classification:

### CRTQ: Critique the Choice of Words

**Original Classification Description**:
- **False Universals (FU)**: Asserting universally agreed points without proof.

**Critique for Clarity and Precision**:
- Ensure the explanation highlights the implicit appeal to popularity and the lack of specific supportive evidence.

### Revised Classification Description:
- **False Universals (FU)**: Asserting that something is true or valid because it is widely believed or because many people do it, without providing specific proof or evidence.

### Application of <CRTQ> to <IDAA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition in <s>**:
   - Proposition: "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there."
   
2. **Analyze the Structure**:
   - Structure: The restaurant’s popularity is justified by the fact that "everyone in town goes there."

3. **Match Characteristics to Definition**:
   - Analyze whether this is a case of Generalization, False Enumeration, Inappropriate Reason, Redundant Reason, Weak Causal Basis, False Universals, or Double-Edged Phrases.

4. **Classify the Argument**:
   - The key element is the argument that the restaurant's popularity is based on the fact that "everyone in town goes there."
   - This matches the characteristics of **False Universals (FU)**, which involves asserting universally agreed points without proof and appealing to popularity.

5. **Validate with Examples**:
   - Compare with provided examples of **False Universals (FU)**.
     - Example: "Everyone else is buying it, so you should too!" aligns with the same structure of appealing to popularity to validate the argument.
   
6. **Output the Classification**:
   - The string "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there" is classified as <FU>.

7. **Revised Definition** (after applying CRTQ):
   - **False Universals (FU)**: Asserting that something is true or valid because it is widely believed or because many people do it, without providing specific proof or evidence.

### Final Revised Output:
- **Argument type**: <FU>
- **Definition (after CRTQ)**: "False Universals (FU): Asserting that something is true or valid because it is widely believed or because many people do it, without providing specific proof or evidence."
