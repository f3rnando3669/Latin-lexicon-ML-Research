To apply the critique to the choice of words resulting from the application of IDAA to the given string, we need to first apply IDAA to classify the argument type and then use CRTQ to critique and improve the wording.

### Applying IDAA to "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."

**Step 1: Identify the Argument**
- Core Argument: "Paranormal activity is real."
- Supporting Reason: "I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."

**Step 2: Analyze the Structure of the Argument**
- Premises: "I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."
- Conclusion: "Paranormal activity is real."

**Step 3: Compare Argument to Known Types**
- The argument is using personal experience as evidence to assert a general truth.

**Step 4: Classify Based on Recognized Patterns**
- This fits the pattern of <RR> (Redundant Reason) because the reason repeats the conclusion in different words.

**Step 5: Label the Argument**
- The argument is identified and labeled as <RR>.

**Step 6: Review and Confirm**
- The classification is consistent with the definition of <RR>.

The argument "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity." is classified as <RR>.

### Applying CRTQ to Improve the Wording

Now let's critique the choice of words used in the classification and potentially suggest a more precise or clearer way to convey the same classification.

**Original Critique:**
- The core issue with the reasoning is that it redundantly uses a personal experience without additional proof or diverse examples to back up the claim.

**Improved Critique through CRTQ:**
- This argument commits the fallacy of using a redundant reason, where the premise repeats the conclusion without additional independent evidence: "Claiming 'Paranormal activity is real because I experienced paranormal activity' repeats the assertion using similar phrasing and does not provide new supporting evidence."

The improved wording addresses the redundancy directly and emphasizes the need for independent evidence or more diverse examples to support the claim.

### Resulting Improved Label and Critique:
**Improved Classification:**
- **Label:** <RR>
- **Critique:** The argument falls under <RR> (Redundant Reason) because it uses a reason that merely restates the conclusion in a different way without providing new or independent evidence. The assertion "Paranormal activity is real because I experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity" fails to add substantial support to the claim, as it repeats the assertion rather than substantiating it with diverse, objective proof.
