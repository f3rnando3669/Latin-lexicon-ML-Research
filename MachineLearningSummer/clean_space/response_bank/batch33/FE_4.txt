For 
To apply <IDAA> to the argument "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today," we'll first break down the task of classifying the argument type into specific steps. Let's proceed step by step:

### Decomposition of the advanced task (D) into specific steps (IDAA):

1. **Identify the components of the argument**:
   - Statement 1: "I thought you were a good person."
   - Statement 2: "You weren't in class today."

2. **Analyze the logical connection between the components**:
   - The speaker is implying that being a good person is directly related to attending class, and not attending class challenges the perception of being a good person.

3. **Compare the argument to each defective argument type**:
    - **Generalization (G)**: Is this claiming a general truth based on a specific instance?
        - No, it does not claim a broad truth based on a singular observation.
        
    - **False Enumeration (FE)**: Is this listing fewer or more options than actually exist?
        - No, it does not involve a list of limited options, instead it makes an assertion about the person's behavior and character.
        
    - **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**: Does the provided reason logically support the proposition?
        - **Yes, this seems to fit.** Not attending class does not logically indicate that a person is not good. The reason given (missing class) is not an appropriate or logical basis to judge someone's entire character.
        
    - **Redundant Reason (RR)**: Is it presenting the same reason in different words?
        - No, the reason provided (not attending class) is not a restatement of the proposition.
        
    - **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**: Is the causal basis not compelling enough to support the proposition?
        - This could be a possibility, but the primary concern here is the logical relevance rather than the strength of the causal link. 
        
    - **False Universals (FU)**: Does it assert universally agreed points without proof?
        - No, it does not rely on universally accepted points or popular opinion.
        
    - **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**: Are there statements open to dual interpretations?
        - No, the statements do not have an evident double meaning or interpretation.

4. **Determine the most fitting defective argument type**:
    - Given that the primary issue is that the reason provided does not logically support the proposition (judging someone's goodness based on class attendance), the argument fits best into the category of **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**.

### Conclusion
The argument "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today." is of type **<IR>**: Inappropriate Reason.
