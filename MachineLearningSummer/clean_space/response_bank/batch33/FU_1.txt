For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong," we will decompose the task of classifying the statement into specific steps and then carry out these steps to determine which defective argument type it belongs to:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA> (D):

1. **Identify the Key Elements of the Statement:**
   - Subject: Verizon
   - Supporting Evidence: "1 billion people can't be wrong"

2. **Assess Whether the Supporting Evidence Logically Supports the Proposition:**
   - The statement suggests that the fact that 1 billion people use Verizon is a reason to choose Verizon.

3. **Check Each Defective Argument Type:**
   - **<G> (Generalization):** Does the statement generalize based on specific instances?
     - No, it doesn’t generalize from a specific instance to a general truth.
   
   - **<FE> (False Enumeration):** Does the statement list fewer or more options than actually exist?
     - No, it does not present a limited or excessive enumeration of choices.

   - **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason):** Does the given reason not logically support the proposition?
     - No, the reason given (1 billion people using Verizon) is meant to support the choice of Verizon, although it may not be a strong logical reason, it is not unrelated.

   - **<RR> (Redundant Reason):** Does the statement present a reason that is the same as the proposition?
     - No, the supporting evidence is not a redundant reason.

   - **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis):** Does the statement offer a weak causal basis for its proposition?
     - No, it doesn’t attempt to establish a causal relationship but rather relies on popularity as a basis.

   - **<FU> (False Universals):** Does it assert universally agreed points without proof, appeal to popularity, or claim everyone agrees?
     - Yes, the statement is appealing to the popularity of Verizon by stating that because 1 billion people use it, it must be a good choice.

   - **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases):** Does the statement use phrases open to dual interpretations?
     - No, the statement is not open to dual interpretations.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the assessment, the statement "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong" best fits the <FU> (False Universals) defective argument type because it asserts the validity of using Verizon based on its widespread usage.

### Final Classification:

The string "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong" is classified as <FU> (False Universals).
