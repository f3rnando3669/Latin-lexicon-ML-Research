For 
Alright, let's apply <IDAA> to "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDA:

1. **Identify the components of the statement**:
   - **Premise**: Supporting Hillary Clinton for President.
   - **Conclusion**: If you don't, you don't believe in women's rights.
   
2. **Evaluate logical structure**:
   - Look for logical connectors like "either-or" that suggest a dichotomy.
   
3. **Identify potential defective argument types**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: Is it making a broad claim based on limited data?
   - **False Enumeration (FE)**: Is it listing fewer or more options than actually exist?
   - **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**: Is the reason provided logically irrelevant?
   - **Redundant Reason (RR)**: Is the reason merely a restatement?
   - **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**: Is there a weak causal connection?
   - **False Universals (FU)**: Is there an unsupported universal assertion?
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**: Is it open to dual interpretations?

### Applying IDA to the Statement:

1. **Identify Components**: 
   - The statement is structured as a dichotomy: "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."
   
2. **Evaluate Logical Structure**:
   - The logical connector here is "either-or," creating a dichotomy.
   
3. **Identify Potential Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: The statement doesn’t appear to be generalizing based on a specific instance.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**: The reasoning provided connects support for Hillary Clinton directly to belief in women's rights.
   - **Redundant Reason (RR)**: The premise and conclusion are not redundant.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is no causal basis provided linking support for Hillary to women's rights directly.
   - **False Universals (FU)**: No universal claims are being asserted.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**: Not open to dual interpretations.
   - **False Enumeration (FE)**: The statement suggests only two options—supporting Hillary Clinton or not believing in women's rights—when in reality, there are likely more nuanced positions one could take.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the statement "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" fits the criteria for **False Enumeration (FE)** because it presents only two options when, in reality, there are more possible positions one could hold.
