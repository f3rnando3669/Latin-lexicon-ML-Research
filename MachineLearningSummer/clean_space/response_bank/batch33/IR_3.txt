For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string, we follow the steps defined by <D>:

### Step 1: Identify the logical fallacy in the string.

Analyze the provided text to determine which logical fallacy is being described.

The text discusses the concept of "moving the goalposts." This is the act of changing the criteria for acceptance once initial criteria have been met. It does not seem to fit any of the defined defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>) directly.

### Step 2: Compare the descriptive elements of the text to the definitions of the faulty argument types.

Based on the given definitions:
- **Generalization (<G>)**: Generalized claim based on specific instances.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Incorrect listing of options.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Irrelevant reason provided.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Reason restating the proposition.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Insufficient causal relationship.
- **False Universals (<FU>)**: Assertion of universal truths without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Statements open to dual interpretations.

### Step 3: Establish whether the content of the string can be mapped to any of these fallacy types.

Given that none of the predefined fallacy types exactly match "moving the goalposts," consider the features:
- The text discusses changing criteria and arguments over time.
- It mentions how certain scientific understandings replace religious explanations, leading to shifting arguments from proponents of the existence of God.
- The described behavior involves ad hoc objections, leading to an evolving and elusive standard, indicative of shifting criteria as understanding increases.

### Step 4: Decision.

Since "moving the goalposts" involves evolving arguments and is not directly relevant to any of the fallacies described (itâ€™s not a Generalization, False Enumeration, Inappropriate Reason, Redundant Reason, Weak Causal Basis, False Universals, or Double-Edged Phrase as per our definitions), it doesn't fit into any of these established categories.

### Conclusion:
The fallacy described in the string ("moving the goalposts") does not match any of the predefined defective argument types defined as <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>. Thus, it remains uncategorized within the given fallacies.

Therefore, applying <IDAA> to the given text doesn't yield a classification under any predefined fallacy type listed.
