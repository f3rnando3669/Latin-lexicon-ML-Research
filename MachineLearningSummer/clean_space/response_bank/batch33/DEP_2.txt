To apply the process of IDAA (the application of the decomposition of an advanced task into specific steps) to the task of classifying the given string as one of the defective argument types, we can follow a structured approach.

**Steps to Apply IDAA:**

1. **Break Down the Task (D):**
    - Step 1: Identify the context and main propositions involved in the dialogue.
    - Step 2: Determine if there are specific instances of reasoning or argumentation issues.
    - Step 3: Identify the type of defective argument based on definitions provided.

2. **Apply the Structured Steps to the Given Dialogue (IDA):**

### Step 1: Context and Main Propositions

1. **Speaker 1's statement:**
    - Proposition: "We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change."
    - Context: Volunteerism and social awareness campaign.

2. **Speaker 2's response:**
    - Proposition: "Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."
    - Context: Ethical objection to the term 'use' in the context of people.

### Step 2: Identify Reasoning or Argumentation Issues

- **Speaker 2's response:** There is an apparent objection based on a possible misinterpretation or an inappropriate reason for not supporting the campaign.
  
### Step 3: Identify the Type of Defective Argument

We need to classify the response into one of our defined defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: Speaker 2 does not appear to make a broad generalization based on a specific instance.
2. **False Enumeration (FE)**: Speaker 2's response does not list options or limit choices.
3. **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**: The ethical objection ('wrong to use people') may not logically apply to the context of mobilizing volunteers for social causes and could be interpreted as misapplying ethics.
4. **Redundant Reason (RR)**: Speaker 2 is not restating the proposition using different words.
5. **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**: The response does not present a weak causal relationship.
6. **False Universals (FU)**: The response does not assert an unwarranted universal truth.
7. **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**: The statement does involve a potentially dual interpretation of the word 'use.'

Assessing Speaker 2's response, the most fitting categorization among the provided options appears to be:

**Inappropriate Reason (IR)**: Speaker 2's objection, "I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people," does not logically support the proposition that they cannot be a part of a campaign aimed at social justice. The term 'use' is interpreted in a way that is not congruent with the context of voluntary activism.

**Conclusion:**

Thus, applying IDAA to the given dialogue:

```plaintext
<IDAA> of "Speaker 1: We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change.
Speaker 2: Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."
```

Result:

```plaintext
<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)
```
