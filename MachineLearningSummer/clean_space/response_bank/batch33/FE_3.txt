For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "People either like coffee or hate it," we need to first decompose the task <IDA> of classifying the argument type into specific steps. Here is the decomposition <D>:

1. **Identify the proposition**: Determine the main proposition or statement being made.
2. **Analyze the reasoning**: Examine the reasoning provided in support of the proposition.
3. **Match to defective argument types**: Compare the reasoning to the definitions of the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.
4. **Classify the argument**: Assign the appropriate defective argument type based on the analysis.

Now, letâ€™s apply these steps to the string "People either like coffee or hate it."

### Step 1: Identify the proposition
The main proposition in the string is that "People either like coffee or hate it."

### Step 2: Analyze the reasoning
The statement is presenting a binary choice: it assumes that people have to fall into one of two extreme categories (liking coffee or hating it) with no middle ground or alternative options.

### Step 3: Match to defective argument types
We need to compare this reasoning to the definitions of the defective argument types:

- **<G> Generalization**: An argument claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **<FE> False Enumeration**: Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **<IR> Inappropriate Reason**: Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- **<RR> Redundant Reason**: Presenting a reason that repeats the proposition using different words.
- **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis**: Offering a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
- **<FU> False Universals**: Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
- **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases**: Using statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.

The string "People either like coffee or hate it" is an example of <FE> False Enumeration because it presents a false dichotomy by listing only two options when there are more possibilities. For example, some people might feel indifferent about coffee or have a neutral opinion.

### Step 4: Classify the argument
Based on the analysis, we classify the argument as type <FE> False Enumeration.

### Conclusion
The string "People either like coffee or hate it" represents a defective argument type called False Enumeration (<FE>).
