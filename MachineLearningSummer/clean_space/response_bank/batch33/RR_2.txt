Sure, we'll apply the steps of task decomposition (<D>) to the task of classifying a given sentence as a specific type of defective argument (<IDA>). 

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Application

1. **Identify the essence of the claim:** 
   Let's break down the statement: "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people."

2. **Determine the main proposition:**
   The main proposition is that the judicial system is broken and it needs to be fixed. The suggested solution is to elect new people.

3. **Analyze the reason given for the proposition:**
   The reason given is straightforward: electing new people will fix the broken judicial system. 

4. **Evaluate the logical connection between the proposition and the reason:**
   The statement "We need to fix our broken judicial system" might be true or false, but the proposed solution doesn't logically follow unless there's some underlying assumption that merely electing new people will fix the system. This may overlook other potential solutions or causes of the problem.

5. **Determine if the reason provides enough support or is logically appropriate:**
   In this case, the reason "by electing new people" doesn't inherently provide a logical link to the problem of a broken judicial system without additional context or evidence.

6. **Match the characteristics of the fallacy to the defined types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** The statement isn't making a broad claim based on a specific instance.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>):** It doesn’t list options falsely.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** The given reason does not logically support the proposition.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** It doesn't use redundant reasoning.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** It doesn't sufficiently establish a causal relationship.
   - **False Universals (<FU>):** It’s not relying on universally agreed points without proof.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** There’s no dual interpretation shown.

7. **Compare and conclude the fallacy type:**
   - The argument appears to lean towards **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)** because it proposes a solution (electing new people) that doesn't logically follow from the assertion about the problem (a broken judicial system) without additional linking evidence or reasoning.

### Conclusion

The statement "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people." is best classified as an example of the logical fallacy **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**.
