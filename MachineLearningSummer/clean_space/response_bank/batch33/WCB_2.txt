For 
Sure, let's apply <IDAA> to classify the string "Farmer McDonald: Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain. I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

#### Step 1: Identify the Claim
The claim in the string is that the new power plant is somehow responsible for the lack of rain and broader human interference with nature.

#### Step 2: Check for Generalization (<G>)
- **Specific instance given to generalize:** Mention of the new power plant causing no rain.
- **Claim of general truth:** "mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature."
- **Analysis:** The argument does not provide sufficient evidence to generalize that all human interference with nature causes such issues.

This contains elements of <G> based on the specific instance of the power plant affecting rainfall.

#### Step 3: Check for False Enumeration (<FE>)
- **Listing fewer or more options:** The argument does not present options.
- **Analysis:** No other options are presented for the cause of the lack of rainfall or solutions, so this type doesn't fit.

#### Step 4: Check for Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)
- **Reason provided incorrectly related to claim:** The causal link between the power plant and lack of rain is implied without evidence.
- **Analysis:** This could be seen as inappropriate reasoning, as the statement lacks a logical connection between the power plant and rain based on given information.

This part contains elements of <IR> since it suggests a reason for no rainfall without direct evidence.

#### Step 5: Check for Redundant Reason (<RR>)
- **Restating the proposition in different words:** 
- **Analysis:** There isn't a repetitive restatement; rather, it's an extension of blaming human interventions.

Does not appear redundant.

#### Step 6: Check for Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- **Weak causal link:** Implying that the new power plant caused the lack of rain.
- **Analysis:** The causal link between the power plant and the lack of rain is not supported with scientific evidence within the text.

This argument contains elements of <WCB> based on the weak causal connection provided.

#### Step 7: Check for False Universals (<FU>)
- **Universal agreement points:** The statement about mankind getting too big for its britches.
- **Analysis:** This is more an opinionated statement and doesn't appeal to universal agreement directly.

No false universals appear clearly.

#### Step 8: Check for Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)
- **Dual interpretations:** 
- **Analysis:** The statement seems straightforward, attributing lack of rain to the power plant without ambiguity that can be interpreted against the speaker.

No double-edged phrases detected.

### Conclusion:
The string "Farmer McDonald: Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain. I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature." primarily falls under the following types:

1. **<G>** - Generalization based on a specific instance.
2. **<IR>** - Inappropriate Reason providing a logically unsupported proposition.
3. **<WCB>** - Weak Causal Basis offering an unsustained causal link.

Thus, the string should be classified as a combination primarily of <G>, <IR>, and <WCB>.
