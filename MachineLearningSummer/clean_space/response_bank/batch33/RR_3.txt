For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified. Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true? Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so. Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct? Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true. Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true? Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran.", let's decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps.

**Step 1**: Break down the string into its distinct propositions.
- Proposition 1: "Jesus was not really crucified."
- Proposition 2: "Because the Quran says so."
- Proposition 3: "Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true."
- Proposition 4: "Because God tells us so, here in the Koran."

**Step 2**: Identify the logical relationships and dependencies between the propositions.
- Proposition 1 is supported by Proposition 2.
- Proposition 2 is justified by Proposition 3.
- Proposition 3 is supported by Proposition 4.

**Step 3**: Evaluate the type of argumentation used in each proposition and the overall coherence.
- The argument structure is circular: 
  - Proposition 2 depends on Proposition 3 which in turn depends on Proposition 4, which again refers back to the Quran (i.e., Proposition 2).

**Step 4**: Determine if any part of the argument fits into the defective argument types defined (i.e., <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

- **Proposition Analysis**:
  - Proposition 2: This seems to be an assertion relying solely on the authority of the Quran, which is questioned and not independently verified.
  - Proposition 3: This statement assumes the Quran's truth without independent evidence, implying a circular reasoning fallacy.
  - Proposition 4: This is a reiteration of authority without independent verification, continuing the circular logic.

- **Overall Analysis**:
  - The entire argument uses the Quran's authority to prove the Quran’s assertions (Circular Reasoning) which aligns with <IR> (Inappropriate Reason), since it provides a reason (i.e., authority of Quran and God speaking through it) that does not independently verify the initial proposition (i.e., "Jesus was not really crucified").

**Step 5**: Classify the overall argument.
- Based on the analysis, the argument primarily suffers from Circular Reasoning, an example of providing an inappropriate reason.

**Classification**: The string "Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified. Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true? Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so. Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct? Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true. Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true? Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran." is best classified as type <IR> (Inappropriate Reason).

In summary, applying <IDAA> involves decomposing the argument into distinct propositions, understanding their logical relationships, and evaluating them against defined defective argument types to classify the argument accurately.
