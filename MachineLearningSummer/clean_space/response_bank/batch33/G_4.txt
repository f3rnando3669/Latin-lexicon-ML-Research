For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess, all the other classes will all fail it, too.", we need to follow the decomposition process of <D> into specific steps for the task of classifying the fallacy. Here are the steps we can follow:

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Identify the Argument Type in the String:**
   - We need to first analyze the structure and content of the argument in the string.

2. **Compare with Defined Defective Argument Types:**
   - Compare the identified argument type with the definitions provided for <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

3. **Choose the Most Appropriate Type:**
   - Based on the comparison, determine the type of defective argument that best matches the argument in the string.

### Step 1: Identify the Argument Type in the String

The string "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess, all the other classes will all fail it, too." suggests that because three kids in a specific class failed a quiz, the speaker believes that all other classes will also fail the quiz.

### Step 2: Compare with Defined Defective Argument Types

- <G> (Generalization): Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
- <FE> (False Enumeration): Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
- <IR> (Inappropriate Reason): Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- <RR> (Redundant Reason): Presents a new reason that says the same thing as the proposition using different words.
- <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis): Offers a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
- <FU> (False Universals): Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
- <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases): Uses statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.

### Step 3: Choose the Most Appropriate Type

The argument in the string is making a broad generalization based on a very specific instance. The conclusion that "all the other classes will all fail it, too" is derived from the fact that "three kids in one class failed." This matches the defective argument type <G> (Generalization).

### Conclusion

Therefore, the string "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess, all the other classes will all fail it, too." is best classified as a **Generalization (<G>)**.
