For 
To apply \(\text{IDAA}\) to the statement "Everyone else is doing it, so should you", we need to first decompose \(\text{IDA}\) into specific steps and then apply those steps to our given string.

### Decomposition \(\left(\text{D}\right)\) of \(\text{IDA}\):
1. **Identify the structure of the argument.**
2. **Determine the nature of the claim.**
3. **Match the claim to the types of defective arguments defined (\(\text{G}\), \(\text{FE}\), \(\text{IR}\), \(\text{RR}\), \(\text{WCB}\), \(\text{FU}\), \(\text{DEP}\)).**
4. **Conclude the classification by the best fitting type.**

### Step-by-Step Application \(\left(\text{IDAA}\right)\):

#### Step 1: Identify the structure of the argument.
The argument in the string "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" follows a structure where a reason is provided for doing something based on the fact that others are doing it.

#### Step 2: Determine the nature of the claim.
The claim here is attempting to persuade the listener or reader to follow a course of action because it is claimed that others are doing the same thing.

#### Step 3: Match the claim to the types of defective arguments.
- **\(\text{G}\) Generalization**: This is not trying to generalize from a specific instance to a universal truth.
- **\(\text{FE}\) False Enumeration**: This does not involve listing options.
- **\(\text{IR}\) Inappropriate Reason**: While the reason given may be inappropriate in other contexts, it fits another more specific type.
- **\(\text{RR}\) Redundant Reason**: The reasoning does not simply restate the proposition.
- **\(\text{WCB}\) Weak Causal Basis**: There is no causal basis being suggested.
- **\(\text{FU}\) False Universals**: This matches the closest because it appeals to popularity or the fact that many people are doing something as a form of validation.
- **\(\text{DEP}\) Double-Edged Phrases**: The statement is not open to dual interpretations in the intended sense.

#### Step 4: Conclude the classification.
Given that the argument appeals to the popularity of an action to justify doing it, the statement can be classified as \(\text{FU}\) False Universals.

### Conclusion:
By following the steps of \(\text{IDAA}\), the classification of the statement "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" is of type \(\text{FU}\) False Universals.
