For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given statement "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses.", we will decompose the task of classifying this statement as either <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP> into specific steps. Here's the step-by-step decomposition (<D>):

1. **Break Down the Argument:**
   - Identify premises and conclusion.
   
2. **Analyze Each Premise:**
   - Check for generalizations.
   - Determine if the options are falsely enumerated.
   - Evaluate if the reasons given are appropriate.
   - Check for redundancy.
   - Assess the causal basis.
   - Identify if universals are asserted without proof.
   - Look for any double-edged phrases.

3. **Determine the Fallacy Type:**
   - Based on the analysis, classify the argument into one of the specified defective argument types.

### Step-by-Step Application:

1. **Break Down the Argument:**

   - Premise 1: "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being."
   - Premise 2: "Fetuses are innocent human beings."
   - Conclusion: "Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."
   
2. **Analyze Each Premise:**

   - **Premise 1 Analysis:**
     - "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being."
     - This is a moral assertion and a general statement, but there is no defective argument type here unless it's taken as an unproven universal truth.

   - **Premise 2 Analysis:**
     - "Fetuses are innocent human beings."
     - This is a definitional statement; the potential issue here could be whether this is accepted universally without sufficient justification.

   - **Conclusion Analysis:**
     - "Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."
     - This is logically derived from the premises if both premises are accepted as true, but might be classified by checking how this derivation is constituted.

3. **Determine the Fallacy Type:**

   - Looking at the premises and conclusion, we need to check if any fallacy type <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP> applies.
   - **False Universals (FU)**:
     - The first premise could be seen as asserting a universally agreed point without proof ("It is immoral to kill an innocent human being").
     - The second premise assumes a universal agreement that fetuses are classified as innocent human beings, which might also be disputed.
   
   - Given these points, the overall argumentative structure relies on premises that are treated as universally accepted truths without providing proof for these assumptions.

**Classification:**
The argument "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being.  Fetuses are innocent human beings.  Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses." exemplifies the <FU> (False Universals) defective argument type because it asserts universally agreed points without providing sufficient evidence for these universal claims.
