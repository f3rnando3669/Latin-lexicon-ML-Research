For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string ("My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you."), we will decompose the task of classifying this argument into specific steps and then perform those steps.

1. **Identify the proposition and reason**:
   - Proposition: "I’m not going to talk to you."
   - Reason: "My best friend says you’re a liar."

2. **Check for Generalization (<G>) characteristics**:
   - Is the argument claiming a general truth based on a specific instance?
   - Analysis: No, this argument is based on a statement made by a specific individual and does not generalize about all people or instances.

3. **Check for False Enumeration (<FE>) characteristics**:
   - Is the argument listing fewer or more options than actually exist?
   - Analysis: No, this argument is not about listing options but rather a direct claim supported by another individual's statement.

4. **Check for Inappropriate Reason (<IR>) characteristics**:
   - Is the provided reason logically supporting or related to the proposition?
   - Analysis: The reason given (someone else’s opinion) does not logically support the personal decision of not talking to someone. It merely reports someone else's opinion, which may be biased or unfounded.

5. **Check for Redundant Reason (<RR>) characteristics**:
   - Does the reason appear to be presented as new but essentially restates the proposition?
   - Analysis: No, the reason given ("My best friend says you’re a liar") does not merely restate the proposition but introduces an external opinion.

6. **Check for Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>) characteristics**:
   - Does the argument offer a causal basis that is not compelling enough?
   - Analysis: The causal basis (opinion of a friend) is weak, as it does not provide factual proof or a compelling reason that directly links to the decision of not talking to someone.

7. **Check for False Universals (<FU>) characteristics**:
   - Does the argument assert universally agreed points without proof?
   - Analysis: No, this argument references a specific personal opinion rather than a universally agreed point.

8. **Check for Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>) characteristics**:
   - Does the statement use phrases open to dual interpretations?
   - Analysis: No, the statement is straightforward and not open to dual interpretations.

Based on these steps, the argument "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you." most closely fits the characteristics of an **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**, as it provides a reason that does not logically support the proposition. The decision to not talk to someone is based on an opinion rather than a logical or factual basis.
