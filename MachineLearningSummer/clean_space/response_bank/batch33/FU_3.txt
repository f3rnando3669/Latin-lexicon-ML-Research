For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement “Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding.” we need to decompose the task of classifying the defective argument type into specific steps and then execute those steps one by one.

### Decomposition <D> of the Task <IDA>
1. **Identify the Argument:** Understand the statement and extract the underlying argument.
2. **Examine the Statement:** Analyze the specific components of the argument presented.
3. **Compare to Definitions:** Compare the components of the argument to the definitions of defective argument types provided.
4. **Classify the Argument:** Determine which defective argument type the statement best fits.

### Application of <D> to <IDA>

1. **Identify the Argument:**
   - The person's argument can be paraphrased as: "I was driving as fast as everyone else, so therefore I was not speeding."

2. **Examine the Statement:**
   - The main focus is the reason given for not being guilty of speeding, which is that everyone else was driving at that speed.

3. **Compare to Definitions:**
   - **Generalization (G):** Not applicable as it's not making a broad claim based on a single instance.
   - **False Enumeration (FE):** Not listing options, so not applicable.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (IR):** Potentially relevant as the reason given does not necessarily support the claim of not speeding (just because others are speeding does not mean it is legal).
   - **Redundant Reason (RR):** Not redundant, as it does provide a new perspective.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (WCB):** Doesn't fit as there is no causal relationship discussed.
   - **False Universals (FU):** Could be relevant since it relies on a commonly accepted behavior (everyone else is doing it).
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP):** Not ambiguous or dual in nature.

4. **Classify the Argument:**
   - The most fitting defective argument type for this statement is **False Universals (FU)**. This is because the argument relies on the idea that if everyone is doing something, it must be an acceptable or valid behavior, which isn't logically sound. The appeal to the common action of others is used as a validation for the speeding behavior.

Therefore, the statement “Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding.” is classified as <FU>.
