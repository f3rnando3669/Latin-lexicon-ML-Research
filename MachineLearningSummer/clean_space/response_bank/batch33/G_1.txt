For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up.  Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!" we will decompose the <IDA> task into specific steps and execute them:

1. **Step 1: Identify the Proposition and Reasoning.**
    - Proposition: "My 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well."
    - Reasoning: "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up."

2. **Step 2: Determine the Argument Type Criteria.**
    - **Generalization (G):** Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
    - **False Enumeration (FE):** Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
    - **Inappropriate Reason (IR):** Provides a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition.
    - **Redundant Reason (RR):** Restates the proposition using different words.
    - **Weak Causal Basis (WCB):** Offers a causal basis not compelling enough to support the proposition.
    - **False Universals (FU):** Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
    - **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP):** Uses statements open to dual interpretations.

3. **Step 3: Match the Argument against Each Type.**

    - **Generalization (G):** The argument makes a general claim about guilt based on a specific instance (the Catholic Church scandal). It applies this general claim to a specific individual (the 102-year-old neighbor). This suggests the argument is trying to assert a general truth (that all Catholics or attendees are guilty) based on the actions of the broader institution, which matches the criteria for Generalization.

4. **Step 4: Evaluate the Appropriateness of Each Type.**

    - **False Enumeration (FE):** No listing of limited or excessive options.
    - **Inappropriate Reason (IR):** The reasoning provided doesn’t logically support the proposition, but it’s more specifically a type of generalization.
    - **Redundant Reason (RR):** No redundancy in the reasoning.
    - **Weak Causal Basis (WCB):** The argument doesn’t primarily rely on a weak causal basis but rather on generalization.
    - **False Universals (FU):** No universally agreed points without proof are asserted.
    - **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP):** No dual interpretations present.

5. **Step 5: Conclude and Classify.**

    - The most appropriate classification for the statement is **Generalization (G)**, as it claims a general truth about an individual based on specific instances associated with the larger group (the Catholic Church scandal).

**Result:** The statement "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!" is of type **<G> (Generalization)**.
