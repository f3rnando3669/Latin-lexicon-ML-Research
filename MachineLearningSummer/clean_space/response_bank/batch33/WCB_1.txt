For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task into specific steps) to classify the argument "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far," we need to classify this statement according to the defined defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

Here’s the step-by-step decomposition of the task:

### Step 1: Parse the Argument
Parse the statement and identify the structure and elements.
- Proposition: "The reason Donald Trump got elected"
- Reason provided: "because liberals took political correctness too far"

### Step 2: Analyze the Causal Relation
Examine whether the provided reason logically supports the proposition.
- The statement claims a cause-and-effect relationship between "liberals taking political correctness too far" and "Donald Trump getting elected."

### Step 3: Match to Defective Argument Types
Compare the argument structure and reasoning against defective argument definitions.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Does this claim a general truth based on a specific instance?
   - No, it doesn't make a broad generalization based on a specific instance.

2. **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Does this list fewer or more options than exist?
   - No, it isn’t an enumeration of options.

3. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Is the provided reason irrelevant to the proposition?
   - Partially matches. Political correctness relates to political climates, but it's debatable whether this is a direct or sole reason for the election's outcome.

4. **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Does the reason restate the proposition using different words?
   - No, the reason provided is not a restatement of the proposition.

5. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Is the causal basis not compelling enough to support the proposition?
   - Yes, this matches. The argument tries to attribute Donald Trump's election solely to the liberals’ stance on political correctness, which is a weak and overly simplistic causal explanation.

6. **False Universals (<FU>)**: Does this assert universally agreed points without proof?
   - No, it doesn't make any universally agreed points without proof.

7. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Is the statement open to dual interpretations?
   - No, the statement does not have dual interpretations that could potentially be against the speaker.

### Step 4: Conclusion
Based on the assessment, the argument "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far" most closely matches the defect type:

**<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**
- The causal basis provided is not compelling enough to support the proposition that Donald Trump got elected because liberals took political correctness too far.

Thus, the classification of the argument is: **<WCB>**.
