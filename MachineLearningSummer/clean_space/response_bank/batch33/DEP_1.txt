For 
To apply <IDAA> to "When the judge asked the defendant why he hadn't paid his parking fines, he said that he shouldn't have to pay them because the sign said 'Fine for parking here' and so he naturally presumed that it would be fine to park there.", we need to first decompose the task of classifying the argument type <s> into specific steps and then apply those steps systematically. Here’s how to do it:

### Step 1: Understand the Statement
- The statement tells us that the defendant's justification for not paying parking fines was based on the interpretation of the word "fine" in a parking sign.

### Step 2: Identify the Core Argument
- The defendant is arguing that he shouldn't have to pay parking fines because he believed the sign meant it was acceptable ("fine") to park there, rather than referring to a penalty ("fine") for parking there.

### Step 3: Match with Known Defective Argument Types
We now compare this argument with the predefined types to determine the best match:
1. **Generalization (<G>)** - Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
2. **False Enumeration (<FE>)** - Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
3. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)** - Provides a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition.
4. **Redundant Reason (<RR>)** - New reason that simply rephrases the proposition.
5. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)** - Offers an unconvincing causal basis.
6. **False Universals (<FU>)** - Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
7. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)** - Uses statements open to dual interpretations.

### Step 4: Analyze the Argument
- The defendant’s argument hinges on a misinterpretation of the wording on the sign. This misinterpretation is presented as a logical explanation for an action (not paying the fines).

### Step 5: Determine the Defective Argument Type
- The argument doesn't fit into <G> as it’s not claiming a general truth.
- It is not an example of <FE> since it’s not about listing options.
- It does appear to provide a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition—the sign saying "Fine for parking here" clearly means a penalty, not an endorsement.
- It's not <RR> as it doesn't redundantly rephrase the proposition.
- It doesn’t suggest a causal basis, so it’s not <WCB>.
- It doesn’t assert a universally agreed point, so it’s not <FU>.
- The argument does hinge on interpreting the word "fine" in two ways, making it a potential case of a double-edged phrase.

### Final Conclusion
Given the options, the argument is best classified under <DEP> because it uses a phrase ("Fine for parking here") that can be interpreted in two distinct ways, leading to different conclusions.

Thus, the classification <s> = "When the judge asked the defendant why he hadn't paid his parking fines, he said that he shouldn't have to pay them because the sign said 'Fine for parking here' and so he naturally presumed that it would be fine to park there." is of type <DEP>.
