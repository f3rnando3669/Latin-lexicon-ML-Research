For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposing the task of classifying a defective argument into specific steps) to the statement "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there," we'll follow a systematic approach to reach the classification.

Here is the decomposition into specific steps (D) we will follow:

1. **Identify the Argument**: Understand what the argument claims and what reasoning is provided.
2. **Analyze the Components**: Break down the argument into its proposition and supporting reason.
3. **Match the Reasoning**: Compare the type of reasoning used in the argument against the definitions of defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).
4. **Classify the Argument**: Assign the argument the appropriate type based on the comparison.

Let's apply these steps to the given statement:

1. **Identify the Argument**: 
   - **Proposition**: "That restaurant is popular."
   - **Reason Provided**: "because everyone in town goes there."

2. **Analyze the Components**:
   - The **proposition** states that the restaurant is popular.
   - The **reason** given is that "everyone in town goes there."

3. **Match the Reasoning**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: This would mean making a general truth based on a specific instance. It's not applicable since the reasoning doesn't fit this type.
   - **False Enumeration (FE)**: Limiting or extending options, not applicable here.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**: Providing a reason that doesnâ€™t logically support the proposition. This reasoning supports the proposition but could fit another category better.
   - **Redundant Reason (RR)**: Reiterating the same thing in different words. Not the case here.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**: Offering a weak causal argument. Not a strong match here.
   - **False Universals (FU)**: Asserting universally agreed points without proof. The argument here directly fits this category because it appeals to popularity to validate the restaurant's popularity.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**: Open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker. Not applicable.

4. **Classify the Argument**:
   - Given our analysis, the best classification for the statement "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there" is **False Universals (FU)**.

So, we conclude that "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there" represents a False Universals (FU) logical fallacy.
