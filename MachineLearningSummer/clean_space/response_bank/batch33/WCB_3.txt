To apply the IDAA to the statement "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick," we need to deconstruct the process of classifying this statement into its specific steps. Let's break it down:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDAA for IDA

**Step 1:** Identify and understand the argument presented in the statement.

- **Argument:** The speaker claims that because they drank bottled water and subsequently became sick, the bottled water must have caused their illness.

**Step 2:** Understand the definitions of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

**Step 3:** Analyze the argument and identify the main logical structure and the potential fallacy.

**Step 4:** Compare the identified logical structure against the definitions of the defective argument types to find the best match.

### Application of Decomposed Steps:

#### Step 1: Identify and understand the argument
- **Claim:** The bottled water caused the illness.
- **Reasoning:** The speaker drank bottled water and then became sick.

#### Step 2: Understand the definitions
- <G>: Generalization based on a specific instance.
- <FE>: Fewer or more options than exist.
- <IR>: Inappropriate reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- <RR>: Redundant reason saying the same thing differently.
- <WCB>: Weak causal basis, not compelling enough.
- <FU>: False universals, asserting universally agreed points without proof.
- <DEP>: Double-edged phrases, dual interpretations.

#### Step 3: Analyze the argument
- The argument posits a direct cause-effect relationship between drinking bottled water and becoming ill. This implies a causal relationship without sufficient evidence.

#### Step 4: Compare and classify
- Considering the argument's reliance on a single instance to establish causality, it seems the argument's main flaw is a weak causal basis. The argument assumes without compelling proof that the bottled water is the cause of illness purely based on temporal correlation. 

### Conclusion
- The logical fallacy used in the statement "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick" best matches **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**.

Thus, the statement exemplifies the **Weak Causal Basis** fallacy.
