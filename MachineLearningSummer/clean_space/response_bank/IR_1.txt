### Applying <IDAA> to "Don't listen to Mr. Fingers when he says walk in the hallways. How can you trust someone who wears bow ties?"

Let's break down the task into specific steps as per the guidelines established for <IDAA>:

#### Step 1: Initial Analysis
- **Step 1.1:** Extract and understand the proposition and the supporting argument from the string.
  - **Proposition:** "Don't listen to Mr. Fingers when he says walk in the hallways."
  - **Supporting Argument:** "How can you trust someone who wears bow ties?"

- **Step 1.2:** Identify the main claim and any reason provided to support this claim.
  - **Main Claim:** We should not listen to Mr. Fingers.
  - **Reason Provided:** Mr. Fingers wears bow ties, implying this is a reason not to trust him.

#### Step 2: Classification Based on Argument Evaluation
- **Step 2.1:** Compare the argument against common defective argument types:
    - **<G>:** Not applicable—does not claim a general truth based on a specific instance.
    - **<FE>:** Not applicable—does not list fewer or more options than actually exist.
    - **<IR>:** Applicable—the reason provided (wearing bow ties) does not logically support the proposition (not listening to walking advice).
    - **<RR>:** Not applicable—does not restate the proposition in other words.
    - **<WCB>:** Somewhat applicable—wearing bow ties is not a compelling reason to distrust advice, but this is secondary to its irrelevance.
    - **<FU>:** Not applicable—does not assert universally agreed points without proof.
    - **<DEP>:** Not applicable—does not provide a statement open to dual interpretations.

#### Step 3: Verification and Final Identification
- **Step 3.1:** Verify the identified defective argument type by re-examining the structure and content of the string.
  - The reason given (wearing bow ties) indeed does not logically support the proposition that we should not listen to hallway advice. The logical connection is missing.

- **Step 3.2:** Cross-check with examples of each argument type to ensure accuracy:
  - **<IR> Example:** "We should not recycle because recycling trucks emit CO2."
  - **String in question:** "Don't listen to Mr. Fingers when he says walk in the hallways. How can you trust someone who wears bow ties?"—fits the pattern that the reason provided does not logically support the proposition.

### Conclusion:
The identified defective argument type for the string is **<IR>** (Irrelevant Reason). The reason that Mr. Fingers wears bow ties does not logically support the claim that we should not listen to his advice about walking in the hallways.
