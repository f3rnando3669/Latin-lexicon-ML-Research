For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "All bachelors are unmarried males," we will systematically decompose the task of classifying the argument as one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>. Let's follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Components of the Argument
- Proposition: "All bachelors are unmarried males."
- Reasoning: The statement provides a definition rather than an argument with separate reasoning.

### Step 2: Examine the Nature of the Statement
- The statement is a definitional one, essentially stating the dictionary definition of "bachelor."

### Step 3: Compare to Defined Defective Argument Types
Let's consider each defective argument type based on the nature of the statement:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - Not applicable. The statement is not generalizing from specific instances; it defines a term.

2. **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - Not applicable. No list or choice is being presented.

3. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
   - Not applicable. No reasoning or causal relationship is being provided.

4. **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: The reason is essentially the same as the proposition in different words.
   - This could be applicable if an implicit argument was present. For example, if the statement were trying to argue something circularly ("All bachelors are unmarried males because bachelors are unmarried males"), it would clearly be redundant.

5. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Offers a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
   - Not applicable. The statement doesn't offer a causal basis.

6. **False Universals (<FU>)**: Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
   - Not applicable. It is a simple definitional statement and doesn’t rely on universal agreement for validation.

7. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Uses statements open to dual interpretations.
   - Not applicable. The statement is straightforward without ambiguity.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
Given the analysis, the statement appears definitional rather than argumentative. However, if we consider the possibility of redundancy, the closest equivalent defect would be:

- **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: This fits if the statement were arguing in a redundant manner.

### Conclusion
The statement "All bachelors are unmarried males" is primarily definitional. However, if interpreted as an argument, it could be classified under **<RR>** (Redundant Reason) for restating the definition without offering additional reasoning.

Since the statement is merely a definition and not an argument per se, it actually does not strictly fall under any of the defective argument types defined above. It is simply a tautology, a statement true by definition that doesn’t argue something debatable or fallaciously. In typical logical analysis scenarios, it would generally be excluded from being classified as a defective argument because it lacks the structure of reasoning and proposition found in typical arguments.
