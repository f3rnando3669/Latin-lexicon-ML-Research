For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "All my friends are doing a low carb diet. That must be the only way to lose weight so I will do it too.", we will decompose the task of classifying this argument into specific steps. Here’s the step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition and Reasoning
- **Proposition:** "That must be the only way to lose weight so I will do it too."
- **Reasoning:** "All my friends are doing a low carb diet."

### Step 2: Evaluate Against Each Defective Argument Type
We need to compare the proposition and reasoning against each of the defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - The argument is not just claiming a general truth from one instance but suggesting a specific action based on peer behavior.

2. **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - This argument doesn't enumerate options but implies a single method ("the only way to lose weight").

3. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
   - While this could be argued, it is more about the inference being weak than the reason being entirely inappropriate.

4. **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Presents what appears to be a new reason but says the same thing as the proposition using different words.
   - This is not applicable here. The reasoning and proposition are distinct in terms of content.

5. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Offers a causal basis that isn’t compelling enough to support the proposition.
   - This argument suggests a weak basis; however, it is inherently an appeal to popularity which is more fittingly classified under False Universals.

6. **False Universals (<FU>)**: Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
   - Yes, the argument appeals to popularity by assuming that because "all my friends" are doing it, it must be the best or only way to lose weight. This fits the definition of falsely assuming a universally accepted notion.

7. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Uses statements open to dual interpretations.
   - This argument does not involve dual interpretations.

### Step 3: Classify the Argument
- The statement "All my friends are doing a low carb diet. That must be the only way to lose weight so I will do it too." fits best under **False Universals (<FU>)**.

### Conclusion
The statement "All my friends are doing a low carb diet. That must be the only way to lose weight so I will do it too." is classified as <FU> (False Universals).

Apply <IDAA> to 'All my friends are doing a low carb diet. That must be the only way to lose weight so I will do it too.': <FU>
