For 
To apply the decomposition of the task of classifying the defective argument type into specific steps (<IDAA>), we will follow a systematic approach to classify the string "All of those who hate the Duterte administration are CPP-NPA supporters." Here’s the process step-by-step:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) for IDA

1. **Identify the Argument or Proposition**:
   - The main proposition here is that all people who hate the Duterte administration are supporters of CPP-NPA.

2. **Analyze the Logic of the Argument**:
   - The statement makes an assertion that connects two groups of people: those who dislike the Duterte administration and those who support CPP-NPA.

3. **Compare the Argument Against Defined Defective Argument Types**:
   - Generalization (G): This involves claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - False Enumeration (FE): This involves listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - Inappropriate Reason (IR): This involves providing a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition.
   - Redundant Reason (RR): This involves presenting a reason that is essentially the same as the proposition.
   - Weak Causal Basis (WCB): This involves offering a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
   - False Universals (FU): This involves asserting universally agreed points without proof.
   - Double-Edged Phrases (DEP): This involves using statements open to dual interpretations.

4. **Match the Argument with the Best Suited Defective Argument Type**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: The argument appears to generalize that everyone who hates the Duterte administration is a CPP-NPA supporter without considering other possibilities or evidence to support such a broad claim.
   - **False Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not list options, so it doesn’t fit this type.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**: The statement doesn’t provide a reason for the connection it claims.
   - **Redundant Reason (RR)**: The statement doesn’t restate the proposition.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is no causal basis provided for the connection.
   - **False Universals (FU)**: The statement doesn’t assert universally agreed points without proof; it makes a broad claim, but not one that is universally agreed upon.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**: This doesn’t involve dual interpretations.

### Conclusion:
The statement "All of those who hate the Duterte administration are CPP-NPA supporters." makes a broad generalization about people who dislike the Duterte administration by labeling them all as supporters of CPP-NPA. This fits the definition of **Generalization (G)** because it claims a general truth based on an unspecified and unverified instance or subset of instances.

### Classification:
The defective argument type for the statement "All of those who hate the Duterte administration are CPP-NPA supporters." is **<G> (Generalization)**.
