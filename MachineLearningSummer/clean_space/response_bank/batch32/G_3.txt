For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task IDA into specific steps) to the statement "If we allow Susan to leave early, soon we'll be giving everyone Friday afternoon off," we will break down the classification task into a systematic process:

### Step 1: Understand the Argument

**Argument:** "If we allow Susan to leave early, soon we'll be giving everyone Friday afternoon off."

### Step 2: Identify the Components of the Argument

Main Proposition: 
- "Soon we'll be giving everyone Friday afternoon off."

Supporting Reason: 
- "If we allow Susan to leave early."

### Step 3: Evaluate Each Defective Argument Type Against the Statement

- **<G> (Generalization):** Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
  - Not directly fitting; the argument doesn't make a general truth claim based on a specific instance.

- **<FE> (False Enumeration):** Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
  - Non-applicable; the statement does not involve enumerating options.

- **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason):** Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
  - The reason given can be seen as indirectly related but not completely devoid of logic.

- **<RR> (Redundant Reason):** Presents a reason that is essentially a reiteration of the proposition.
  - The statement does not restate the proposition in different words.

- **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis):** Offers a weak causal basis for the proposition.
  - The connection between allowing Susan to leave early and the policy change affecting "everyone" might be seen as weak due to the lack of a compelling causal link.

- **<FU> (False Universals):** Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
  - Doesn't fit the structure of making universally agreed points.

- **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases):** Uses statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.
  - The statement is not open to dual interpretations.

### Step 4: Identify the Best Matching Type

Predominantly, the statement "If we allow Susan to leave early, soon we'll be giving everyone Friday afternoon off," makes a slippery slope argument by claiming a minor decision (allowing Susan to leave early) will lead to a significant policy change (giving everyone Friday afternoon off). This can be seen as a type of weak causal relationship:

- **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis):** Because the reasoning implies an insufficient causal relationship between a single action and a sweeping policy change.

### Conclusion

Hence, the statement "If we allow Susan to leave early, soon we'll be giving everyone Friday afternoon off." is classified under:

- **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**

Type of Defective Argument for "If we allow Susan to leave early, soon we'll be giving everyone Friday afternoon off": **<WCB>**
