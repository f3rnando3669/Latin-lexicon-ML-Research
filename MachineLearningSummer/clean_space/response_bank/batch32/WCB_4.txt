For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument type into specific steps) to the task of determining which defective argument type supports the opposition to the motion “Cell phones give off an unsafe radiation and should not be used,” let's break down the task into specific steps and analyze the given statement.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D):

1. **Understand the Statement**:
   - Proposition: "Cell phones give off an unsafe radiation and should not be used."
   - We need to determine the reasoning or opposition against this proposition.

2. **Identify Potential Reasoning for the Opposition**:
   - Identify different possible arguments that can be used to oppose this proposition.
   - Example opposition argument: "Cell phones are widely used and there are no conclusive studies proving that the radiation is unsafe."

3. **Analyze Potential Defective Argument Types**:
   - Determine if the reasons supporting the opposition fall into any of the predefined categories:
     - <G> (Generalization)
     - <FE> (False Enumeration)
     - <IR> (Inappropriate Reason)
     - <RR> (Redundant Reason)
     - <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)
     - <FU> (False Universals)
     - <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)

4. **Match to Defective Argument Types**:
   - Compare the opposition arguments against the definition of each defective argument type to find the best fit.

### Application:

1. **Understand the Statement**:
   - The proposition is that cell phones emit unsafe radiation, hence they should not be used.

2. **Identify Potential Reasoning for the Opposition**:
   - Suppose an opposition argument is: “Cell phones are widely used and there are no conclusive studies proving that the radiation is unsafe.”

3. **Analyze Potential Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: Does not apply. No broad generalization based on a specific instance is being made.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Does not apply. The statement doesn't present a limited set of options.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Yes, this fits. The reason provided (cell phones are widely used) doesn’t logically support the argument that radiation from cell phones is safe. The popularity or widespread usage of cell phones does not address the safety of the radiation emitted.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Does not apply. The reason is not a redundant restatement.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Does not apply. The reason doesn't imply a weak causal link.
   - **False Universals (<FU>)**: Does not apply. It doesn’t claim universal agreement without proof.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Does not apply. The statement isn’t open to dual interpretations.

4. **Classification**:
   - The opposition to the proposition "Cell phones give off an unsafe radiation and should not be used" is likely to be classified as **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)** because the reason "cell phones are widely used" does not provide a logical basis to support that the radiation is safe and unrelated to their widespread use.

### Conclusion
The most likely defective argument type supporting the opposition to the motion "Cell phones give off an unsafe radiation and should not be used." is **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**.

Type of Defective Argument for the opposition to the motion "Cell phones give off an unsafe radiation and should not be used.": <IR> (Inappropriate Reason).
