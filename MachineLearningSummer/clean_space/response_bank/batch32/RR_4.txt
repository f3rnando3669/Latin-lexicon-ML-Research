### Step-by-Step Analysis Using <IDAA>

To classify the statement "Shakira is the best singer in the world because she is the most talented singer there is," we will apply a step-by-step approach as outlined in <IDAA>.

### Step 1: Identify the Components of the Argument

1. **Proposition**:
   - "Shakira is the best singer in the world."
   
2. **Supporting Reason**:
   - "because she is the most talented singer there is."

### Step 2: Examine the Logical Relationship Between Proposition and Reason

The statement asserts that the reason Shakira is the best singer in the world is because she is the most talented singer. To assess whether the reason logically supports the proposition:

- **Best singer** implies qualities such as widespread acclaim, excellence in performance, and perhaps commercial success.
- **Most talented singer** suggests unparalleled skill or natural ability.

In this case, the supporting reason (being the most talented) is essentially rephrasing the proposition (being the best) without providing additional evidence or logical progression.

### Step 3: Compare to Defined Defective Argument Types

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The statement is not making a broad claim based on a specific instance.

2. **False Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The statement does not list options incorrectly.

3. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**:
   - While the statement might be critiqued for using circular logic, the reason is not exactly irrelevant but rather redundant.

4. **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**:
   - Yes, the reason "she is the most talented singer there is" essentially restates the proposition "Shakira is the best singer in the world." It presents no new argument or evidence and simply repeats the claim with synonymous or nearly synonymous terms.

5. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - The statement does not imply a weak causal link but rather an equivalence of terms.

6. **False Universals (<FU>)**:
   - The statement does not appeal to universally agreed notions without evidence.

7. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**:
   - The statement is clear-cut and not open to multiple interpretations.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument

Based on the analysis, the statement "Shakira is the best singer in the world because she is the most talented singer there is" fits the definition of **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**. The reason given simply restates the proposition in different words without providing new evidence or support.

### Conclusion

The classification of the statement "Shakira is the best singer in the world because she is the most talented singer there is" is:

- **<RR> (Redundant Reason)**

This fits because the argument makes the same point in both the proposition and its supposed justification, using slightly different wording.
