For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying the argument type) to the statement "Science shows us that improved quality of life comes through research and invention", we will follow a systematic step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition and Reasoning
- **Proposition:** Improved quality of life comes through research and invention.
- **Reasoning**: Science shows us this.

### Step 2: Evaluate the Reasoning Against Known Defective Argument Types

We need to determine if the reasoning provided falls into any of the following categories:

1. **<G> (Generalization):** Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - This does not seem to apply as the statement refers to a general observation through science, not a specific instance generalized to a broader truth.

2. **<FE> (False Enumeration):** Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - The statement does not list limited or exaggerated options but makes a singular claim.

3. **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason):** Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
   - The reason provided relies on the credibility of science to support the assertion, which seems appropriate if we consider science as a legitimate source of knowledge.

4. **<RR> (Redundant Reason):** Presenting a reason that essentially reiterates the proposition.
   - The reason "Science shows us" does not appear to be redundant with the proposition.

5. **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis):** Offering a causal basis that is not compelling enough.
   - The statement implies that science provides evidence, thereby suggesting a relationship between research, invention, and improved quality of life. If science does indeed provide empirical evidence, this causal basis might not be considered weak.

6. **<FU> (False Universals):** Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
   - The statement claims that science has shown a particular truth, which can be seen as an assertion based on the universal acceptance of science without presenting specific proof within the statement itself. This implies reliance on the perceived authority of science as universally valid.

7. **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases):** Using statements open to dual interpretations.
   - The statement does not appear to have dual interpretations or ambiguity; it is straightforward.

### Step 3: Conclusion on Defective Argument Type

Analyzing the reasoning, the statement "Science shows us that improved quality of life comes through research and invention" seems to have some traits that might fit **False Universals (<FU>)** since it relies on the authority of science without providing clear proof within the argument itself.

Therefore, the statement "Science shows us that improved quality of life comes through research and invention" is best classified as **<FU> (False Universals)**.

**Final Classification:**
Type of Defective Argument for 'Science shows us that improved quality of life comes through research and invention.': **<FU>**
