For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument type into specific steps) to the statement "We should give the other applicant the job because he has a poor family and he needs to provide for them. It looks like he suffers a lot!", we will break down the task methodically.

### Step 1: Understand and Parse the Statement
- **Main Proposition:** "We should give the other applicant the job."
- **Supporting Reasons:** 
  - "because he has a poor family and he needs to provide for them." 
  - "It looks like he suffers a lot."

### Step 2: Analyze the Reasoning
Determine if the reasoning logically supports the main proposition.

### Step 3: Compare to Known Defective Argument Types
Compare the statement against each defective argument type to determine the best fit:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - The statement doesn't make a generalization from a specific instance.

2. **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - The statement does not enumerate any options.

3. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
   - The reasoning provided (the applicant’s poor family and suffering) does not logically support the proposition that the applicant is the best choice for the job based on their qualifications or fit. 

4. **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: The reason is essentially the same as the proposition, in different words.
   - The reasons given do not merely restate the proposition.

5. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Offers a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
   - The argument doesn’t present a causal relationship. It's emphasizing the applicant’s needs rather than suitability.

6. **False Universals (<FU>)**: Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
   - It doesn’t assert a universal truth. Instead, it provides specific reasons related to the applicant’s personal circumstances.

7. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Uses statements open to dual interpretations.
   - The statements provided are not open to dual interpretations.

### Step 4: Determine the Classification
Based on the analysis, the statement "We should give the other applicant the job because he has a poor family and he needs to provide for them. It looks like he suffers a lot!" fits the category of **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)** best.

### Conclusion
The statement "We should give the other applicant the job because he has a poor family and he needs to provide for them. It looks like he suffers a lot!" is classified as **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)** because the reasons provided do not logically support the main proposition regarding the suitability of the applicant for the job based on qualifications or merit.

Type of Defective Argument: **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**
