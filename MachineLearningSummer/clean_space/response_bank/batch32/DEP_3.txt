For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument type into specific steps) to the statement "The police said they suspect several people of setting the fire. Therefore, I can't be under suspicion because I was alone all night," we will break down the classification task into a systematic process. Here are the steps:

### Step-by-Step Analysis and Classification

1. **Identify the Proposition and Reasoning:**
   - **Proposition:** "I can't be under suspicion."
   - **Reasoning:** "The police suspect several people of setting the fire" and "I was alone all night."

2. **Analyze the Logical Structure:**
   - Determine the logical connection between the reasoning and the proposition.
   - The statement suggests that because the police suspect "several people," they cannot suspect a single person who was alone.

3. **Compare to Defective Argument Types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>):**
   We will now consider each defective argument type to see which best fits:

   - **Generalization (<G>):** The statement does not make a generalization from a specific instance to a broad truth.
   
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>):** This involves providing fewer or more options than actually exist. The statement does not fit this category.
   
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** The logic of the statement suggests that the reason provided (police suspect several people) doesn't adequately support the conclusion (I can't be under suspicion). The reasoning is flawed because just because several people are suspected does not eliminate the possibility that a lone person could also be suspected.
   
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** This involves restating the proposition in different words. The statement does not do this.
   
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This looks at whether the causal link is weak. This category doesn't fit perfectly as the argument isn't explicitly causal but relies on flawed reasoning.
   
   - **False Universals (<FU>):** The statement doesn't assert universally agreed points without proof.
   
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** The statement is not open to dual interpretations.

4. **Classify Based on Closest Match:**
   - Given the analysis, the defective reasoning here lies in the logical connection between the fact that several people are suspected and the conclusion that a lone individual cannot be. This falls under **<IR> Inappropriate Reason** because the reason provided does not logically support the proposition.

### Conclusion:
The defective argument type for "The police said they suspect several people of setting the fire. Therefore, I can't be under suspicion because I was alone all night." is:

**<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**

This classification is because the provided reasoning (police suspect several people) does not necessarily exclude the possibility that an individual who was alone could also be under suspicion.
