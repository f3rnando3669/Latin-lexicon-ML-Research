For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task IDA into specific steps) to the statement "You are either with God or against him," we need to break down the classification task into specific steps and systematically analyze the argument. Here are the steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition:**
   - Extract the main claim or statement in the argument.
   - **Proposition:** "You are either with God or against him."

2. **Identify the Reasoning Provided:**
   - Determine the rationale or justification for the proposition.
   - In this case, the justification is implied by the structure of the statement rather than explicitly stated separately.

3. **Compare the Reasoning with the Defined Defective Argument Types:**
   - Check each of the defined types against the argument to find the best match:
     - **<G> (Generalization):** Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
     - **<FE> (False Enumeration):** Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
     - **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason):** Provides a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition.
     - **<RR> (Redundant Reason):** Says the same thing as the proposition using different words.
     - **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis):** Offers a causal basis that isn’t compelling enough.
     - **<FU> (False Universals):** Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
     - **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases):** Uses statements open to dual interpretations.

4. **Determine the Best Fit:**
   - Based on the analysis, decide which defective argument type is the best fit for the given statement.

### Applying the Steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition:**
   - The proposition is: "You are either with God or against him."

2. **Identify the Reasoning Provided:**
   - The reasoning is structured around presenting a dichotomy or binary choice: either with God or against Him.

3. **Compare the Reasoning with the Defined Defective Argument Types:**
   - **<G> (Generalization):** Does it claim a broad truth based on a specific instance?
     - No, it doesn’t derive a general truth from a particular instance.
   - **<FE> (False Enumeration):** Does it list fewer or more options than actually exist?
     - Yes, this is a classic example of a false dichotomy, where only two extreme choices are presented ("with God" or "against Him") without considering other possibilities or nuances.
   - **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason):** Does the reason provided not logically support the proposition?
     - It might seem inappropriate, but this is secondary to the false dichotomy.
   - **<RR> (Redundant Reason):** Does it restate the proposition in different words?
     - No, it doesn’t restate the proposition.
   - **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis):** Does it offer a weak causal basis?
     - The statement doesn’t imply a causal relationship.
   - **<FU> (False Universals):** Does it appeal to widespread agreement without proof?
     - No, this is not prominently about universal agreement.
   - **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases):** Are statements open to dual interpretations?
     - No, it has a singular interpretation.

### Conclusion:

The analysis clearly shows that the defective argument type that fits the best is:
- **<FE> (False Enumeration or False Dichotomy)**

The statement "You are either with God or against him." fits the **<FE>** classification because it presents a limited set of two options, a false dichotomy, ignoring any other possible positions or perspectives.

### Final Classification:
**Type of Defective Argument for 'You are either with God or against him.': <FE>**
