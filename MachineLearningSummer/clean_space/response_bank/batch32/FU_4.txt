For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "If everyone believes it, you should too!", we'll follow the steps for decomposing the task of classifying the argument type. Hereâ€™s how we can systematically approach this:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify the Proposition and Reasoning:**
   - **Proposition:** You should believe it.
   - **Reasoning:** Because everyone else does.

2. **Analyze the Defective Argument Types:**

   - **<G> (Generalization):** 
     - This involves claiming a general truth based on a specific instance, which doesn't fit here as there's no specific instance being generalized.
   
   - **<FE> (False Enumeration):**
     - This involves listing fewer or more options than actually exist. The statement doesn't seem to fit this pattern as it doesn't provide a limited set of options.

   - **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason):**
     - This involves providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition. The reason given here (everyone believes it) is not directly inappropriate but could be considered another type of fallacy.

   - **<RR> (Redundant Reason):**
     - This involves presenting a reason that is essentially just a rephrasing of the proposition. The statement does not merely restate itself using different words.

   - **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis):**
     - This involves offering a weak causal link that is not compelling enough. The statement does not argue causality.

   - **<FU> (False Universals):**
     - This involves asserting universally agreed points without proof. The statement definitely fits well here as it appeals to the fact that everyone believes it without providing actual evidence, suggesting that you should believe it too due to this implied universal consensus.

   - **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases):**
     - This involves using phrases open to dual interpretations. The statement does not fit this since it's clear and unambiguous.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The statement "If everyone believes it, you should too!" is best classified under **<FU> (False Universals)** because it relies on the appeal to popularity or the consensus of others as the basis for accepting the belief without providing proof.

### Final Classification
The defective argument type for the statement "If everyone believes it, you should too!" is **<FU>** (False Universals).
