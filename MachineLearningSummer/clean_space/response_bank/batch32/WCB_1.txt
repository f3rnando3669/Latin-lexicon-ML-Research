For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "Every girl I've dated has been a nurse. I must only be compatible with nurses!", we need to decompose the task of classifying this statement step-by-step:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition and Reasoning:**
   - Extract the main proposition and the supporting reason from the statement.
   - **Main Proposition:** "I must only be compatible with nurses."
   - **Supporting Reason:** "Every girl I've dated has been a nurse."

2. **Determine the Defective Argument Type:**
   - Analyze the nature of the reasoning to see if it falls into any of the predefined categories:
     - <G> (Generalization)
     - <FE> (False Enumeration)
     - <IR> (Inappropriate Reason)
     - <RR> (Redundant Reason)
     - <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)
     - <FU> (False Universals)
     - <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)

3. **Match the Reasoning to a Type:**
   - Compare the extracted proposition and reasoning method against the definitions of each argument type to find the best fit.

### Application:
1. **Identification of Proposition and Reasoning:**
   - **Main Proposition:** "I must only be compatible with nurses."
   - **Supporting Reason:** "Every girl I've dated has been a nurse."

2. **Examination of Reasoning:**
   - The argument makes a broad claim based on a personal experience with a limited set of individuals (the girls dated so far). This suggests a leap from specific instances to a general rule about compatibility.

3. **Type Matching:**
   - **<G> Generalization:** This argument claims a general truth ("I must only be compatible with nurses") based on specific instances (the fact that past girlfriends have been nurses). It incorrectly concludes that the pattern observed in a limited context applies universally to compatibility.

   - **<FE> (False Enumeration):** The argument doesn't list limited or exaggerated choices.
   - **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason):** The reason given (dating experience) applies to a broader context but could be seen as inappropriate reasoning due to lack of other evidence.
   - **<RR> (Redundant Reason):** The supporting reason isn't merely a restatement of the proposition.
   - **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis):** It's not presenting a causal link but rather a reasoning flaw.
   - **<FU> (False Universals):** Doesn't assert universally agreed points without proof.
   - **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases):** No dual interpretations present.

### Classification:
The statement "Every girl I've dated has been a nurse. I must only be compatible with nurses!" falls under the defective argument type **<G> (Generalization)** because it makes a broad generalization based on specific instances (the limited dating experiences with nurses).

### Conclusion:
The statement "Every girl I've dated has been a nurse. I must only be compatible with nurses!" is classified as **<G> (Generalization)**.

**Final Result:**
Type of Defective Argument for "Every girl I've dated has been a nurse. I must only be compatible with nurses!": **<G> (Generalization)**.
