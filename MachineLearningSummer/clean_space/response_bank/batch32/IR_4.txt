To classify the string "What can our new math teacher know? Have you seen how fat she is?" using the IDAA method (the decomposition of IDA into specific steps), we will follow the outlined process step-by-step:

### Step 1: Identify the Argument
- **Proposition:** The implication is that the new math teacher's knowledge or competence is being questioned.
- **Reason Given:** The implied reason for questioning the teacher's competence is her weight ("Have you seen how fat she is?").

### Step 2: Assess the Logical Relationship
Analyze if the reason given logically supports the proposition.

### Step 3: Match the Argument Type
Compare the statement against each defective argument type:
1. **Generalization (<G>):** Does not fit, as itâ€™s not claiming a universal truth based on a specific instance.
2. **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Does not fit, as no options are being limited or expanded.
3. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** This involves providing a reason that does not logically support the proposition. The teacher's weight does not logically relate to her knowledge or competence in math.
4. **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Does not fit, as the statement does not restate the proposition.
5. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Does not fit, as there is no causal relationship implied.
6. **False Universals (<FU>):** Does not fit, as it does not assert universally agreed points without proof.
7. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Does not fit, as there is no dual interpretation presented.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type
Based on the analysis, the statement most clearly fits the **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)** type, as the reason (the teacher's weight) is irrelevant to the argument (questioning her competence in math).

### Conclusion
The statement "What can our new math teacher know? Have you seen how fat she is?" should be classified as **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)** because the reason given does not logically support the proposition.

### Summary
**Type of Defective Argument for "What can our new math teacher know? Have you seen how fat she is?": <IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**.
