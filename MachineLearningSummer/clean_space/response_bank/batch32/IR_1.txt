For 
To apply **IDAA** (the decomposition of the task IDA into specific steps) to classify the statement by the radio talk show host, we'll follow a systematic approach:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Application:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition
Identify what the main argument or proposition is in the given string.

**Proposition**: The criticism by the association of critical thinking professors suggesting the radio talk show is a source of fallacious reasoning is invalid.

### Step 2: Identify the Reasoning
Identify the reason or reasons provided to support the proposition.

**Reasoning**:
- "Who are these people? They talk to maybe 30 people at a time. I talk to 5 million people every day."
- "They could not begin to do what I do."
- "They are just gnats flying around getting in the way."

### Step 3: Evaluate Each Defective Argument Type
Compare the identified reasoning to predefined defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**
   - Does the argument claim a broad truth based on a specific instance? 
   - **No**, it doesn't generalize based on a specific instance; it dismisses the credibility of critics based on audience size.

2. **False Enumeration (FE)**
   - Does the reasoning list fewer or more options than actually exist? 
   - **No**, this argument does not involve listing options.

3. **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**
   - Does the argument provide a reason that does not logically support the proposition?
   - **Yes**, the reasoning that the show talks to more people than the professors do does not logically support the validity or invalidity of the critique about fallacious reasoning.
    
4. **Redundant Reason (RR)**
   - Does the argument's reason simply restate the proposition in different words?
   - **No**, the argument introduces new points about audience size and inability to critique.

5. **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**
   - Does the argument offer a weak causal link to support the proposition?
   - **No**, it's not based on causality but rather dismisses validity based on alternative metrics.

6. **False Universals (FU)**
   - Does the argument assert universally agreed points without proof?
   - **No**, it does not claim universal truths but critiques based on subjective metrics like audience size.

7. **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**
   - Does the argument use statements open to dual interpretations?
   - **No**, it does not offer dual interpretations in making its point.

### Step 4: Conclude Classification

Based on the evaluation:

- The reasons given (about audience size and dismissing credibility) do not logically support the proposition that the talk show is not a source of fallacious reasoning. These reasons are **irrelevant** to the validity of the critique itself, which focuses on the content of the reasoning, not the size of the audience.

- Hence, the argument primarily suffers from **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**.

**Final Classification:** The statement "Radio talk show host, on learning that an association of critical thinking professors had suggested his show as a source of fallacious reasoning: 'Who are these people? They talk to maybe 30 people at a time. I talk to 5 million people every day. They could not begin to do what I do. They are just gnats flying around getting in the way.'" falls under **<IR>** (Inappropriate Reason).
