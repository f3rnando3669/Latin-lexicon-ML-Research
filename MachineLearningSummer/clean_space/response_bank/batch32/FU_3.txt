For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying the argument into specific steps) to the statement "See the movie that everybody's talking about," let's break down the task into specific steps and classify the argument accurately:

### Step 1: Understand and Parse the Statement

**Statement:** "See the movie that everybody's talking about."

### Step 2: Identify the Key Components of the Statement

- **Trigger phrase:** "everybody's talking about"
- **Core proposition:** Implying that one should see the movie.

### Step 3: Evaluate Each Defective Argument Type Against the Statement

- **Generalization (<G>):** Does the statement claim a general truth based on a specific instance?
  - No, the statement does not make a broad generalization based on a specific instance. Instead, it refers to a general perception or behavior ("everybody's talking about").

- **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Does the statement list fewer or more options than actually exist?
  - No, the statement does not present limited or exaggerated choices.

- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Does the statement provide a reason that does not logically support the proposition?
  - No, it does not present any reason that is logically inappropriate for the proposition.

- **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Does the statement use different words to say the same thing as the proposition?
  - No, the statement does not repeat the same idea using different words.

- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Does the statement offer a weak causal basis for the proposition?
  - No, the statement does not offer a causal basis. It suggests an action based on a perceived social consensus.

- **False Universals (<FU>):** Does the statement assert universally agreed points without proof?
  - Yes, the statement implies that because "everybody" is talking about the movie, it is a compelling reason to see it. This fits the definition of False Universals as it appeals to popularity or the fact that many people are talking about it to validate the proposition without providing actual evidence.

- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Does the statement use phrases open to dual interpretations?
  - No, the statement is not open to dual interpretations.

### Step 4: Final Classification

Based on the evaluation in Step 3, the statement "See the movie that everybody's talking about" fits best under the defective argument type:

- **<FU> (False Universals)**

The statement uses an appeal to popularity to validate the proposition without providing actual evidence that seeing the movie is inherently valuable.

### Conclusion

The argument "See the movie that everybody's talking about" is classified as <FU> (False Universals).
