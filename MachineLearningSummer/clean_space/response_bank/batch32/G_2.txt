For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument type into specific steps) to the statement "It is warmer this year in Las Vegas as compared to last year; therefore, global warming is rapidly accelerating," we need to break down the classification task into a systematic process. Here are the steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDAA:

1. **Identify the Proposition and Reasoning:**
   - **Proposition:** "Global warming is rapidly accelerating."
   - **Supporting Reason:** "It is warmer this year in Las Vegas as compared to last year."

2. **Analyze Specific Components of Each Defective Argument Type**:
   - Compare the reasoning with each of the known defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>.

### Analysis:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - **Definition:** Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - **Evaluation:** The statement generalizes about global warming based on a specific instance (temperature in Las Vegas). This fits the <G> definition.
   
2. **False Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - **Definition:** Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - **Evaluation:** The statement does not present limited or exaggerated choices; it focuses on one evidential claim.

3. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):**
   - **Definition:** Providing a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition.
   - **Evaluation:** The reason given (warmer this year in Las Vegas) could be seen as insufficient to conclude global warming, but it is more specifically making a broad generalization rather than providing an inappropriate reason.

4. **Redundant Reason (<RR>):**
   - **Definition:** Presenting what appears to be a new reason that says the same thing as the proposition.
   - **Evaluation:** This is not a redundant rephrasing but an unrelated inadequate link.

5. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - **Definition:** Offering a weak causal basis for the proposition.
   - **Evaluation:** The statement attempts to use a weak causal link—local temperature change to rapid global warming acceleration—fitting <WCB>.

6. **False Universals (<FU>):**
   - **Definition:** Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
   - **Evaluation:** The statement does not assert universally agreed points.

7. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):**
   - **Definition:** Using statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.
   - **Evaluation:** The statement does not have dual interpretations.

### Conclusion:

The most fitting defective argument types for the statement "It is warmer this year in Las Vegas as compared to last year; therefore, global warming is rapidly accelerating" are <G> (Generalization) and <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis). However, the core flaw lies in drawing a broad conclusion about global warming based on a specific instance without adequate evidence.

Thus, the best classification of the defective argument type is:

**<G> Generalization**

The statement generalizes about global warming based on a specific instance in Las Vegas.

**Final Result:**
Type of Defective Argument for 'It is warmer this year in Las Vegas as compared to last year; therefore, global warming is rapidly accelerating.': **<G> (Generalization)**
