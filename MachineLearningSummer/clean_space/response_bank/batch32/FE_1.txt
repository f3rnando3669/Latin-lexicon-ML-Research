For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "America: Love it or leave it," we will break the task into specific steps and execute those steps to classify the argument type. Here are the steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDAA> for <IDA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition and Reasoning:**
   - **Proposition:** You must either love America or leave it.
   
2. **Analyze the Nature of the Argument:**
   - The statement suggests a dichotomy, presenting two mutually exclusive options.

### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Given Statement:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition and Reasoning
- **Proposition:** The implication is that a person must choose between loving America and leaving it.
- **Reasoning:** The underlying reasoning suggests that not loving America equates to the need to leave it.

#### Step 2: Compare Against Each Defective Argument Type

1. **Generalization (<G>):** 
   - This does not claim a general truth from a specific instance.
   
2. **False Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - **Applicable:** This argument presents a false dichotomy by listing only two options (loving America or leaving it) and ignoring any other possibilities, which is a classic example of false enumeration.

3. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):**
   - It does not provide an irrelevant reason but rather limits choices.

4. **Redundant Reason (<RR>):**
   - The statement does not redundantly restate the proposition.

5. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The argument doesn't rely on a weak causal relationship.

6. **False Universals (<FU>):**
   - The statement isn't asserting a universally agreed point without proof but rather limiting options.

7. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):**
   - This statement does not offer a dual interpretation.

#### Step 3: Classify Based on Closest Match
- The best match for the argument type of the statement is **<FE> (False Enumeration)** because it presents a false dichotomy by limiting the options to two extreme choices and ignoring others.

### Conclusion:
The defective argument type for the statement "America: Love it or leave it" is **<FE> (False Enumeration)**.

Type of Defective Argument for 'America: Love it or leave it': <FE>
