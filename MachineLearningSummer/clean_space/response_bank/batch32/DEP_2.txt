For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying arguments into steps), we will classify the argument in the given string systematically. Here’s the step-by-step analysis process:

### Step 1: Understand and Parse the Statement
First, break the statement into propositions and support:
1. **Main Proposition:** "Changing the drinking age to 18 will not make any difference."
2. **Series of Arguments/Reasons:**
   - "Why does the law state that you have to be 21 years old to drink?"
   - "Does it really make any difference if you are 20 years and 364 days old?"
   - "That is absurd."
   - "Therefore, if a single day makes no difference, then a collection of 1095 single days won’t make any difference."

### Step 2: Analyze the Argument Types
We evaluate the logical structure and the reasoning for potential defects by comparing with known defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument does not generalize from a specific instance to a general truth.

2. **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not list fewer or more options than actually exist.

3. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: The individual age difference reasoning does not logically support a policy change over three years. However, this may not be the clearest match for this type.

4. **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: The argument makes different points without repeating the main proposition.

5. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument implies that because each individual day does not make a significant difference, accumulated over many days (1095 days from age 18) will also not make a difference. This is a logical leap, suggesting weak causal reasoning from a minor increment to a significant policy.

6. **False Universals (<FU>)**: The argument does not attempt to assert a universal truth without proof.

7. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: The argument does not use phrases open to dual interpretation. 

### Step 3: Confirm the Argument Type
Based on the analysis, the strongest link is with **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**, as it stretches the logic that minute changes (one day) aggregated together (1095 days) won't have a significant effect, thereby weakly grounding the cause for reducing the drinking age.

### Conclusion
The argument "Changing the drinking age to 18 will not make any difference" based on the premise "a single day makes no difference, then a collection of 1095 single days won’t make any difference" is classified as:

**<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**

### Summary
Type of Defective Argument for "Why does the law state that you have to be 21 years old to drink?  Does it really make any difference if you are 20 years and 364 days old?  That is absurd.  Therefore, if a single day makes no difference, then a collection of 1095 single days won’t make any difference. Therefore, changing the drinking age to 18 will not make any difference." is <WCB>.
