For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument type into specific steps) to the statement "smoking cigarettes is deadly because cigarettes can kill you," let's break down the steps as follows:

### Step 1: Understand the Argument
First, let's identify the main proposition and the supporting reason in the statement.

- **Main Proposition:** "smoking cigarettes is deadly"
- **Supporting Reason:** "because cigarettes can kill you"

### Step 2: Analyze the Reasoning
Next, we will determine if the reasoning logically supports the proposition or if it fits into any of the known defective argument types:

- **Generalization (<G>):** Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
  - This argument does not generalize from a specific instance but rather makes a broad claim about smoking.

- **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
  - This argument does not enumerate options.

- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
  - The reason given does logically support the proposition, in that both refer to the lethal nature of cigarettes, but it does so in an uneffective manner.

- **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** The reason is essentially the same as the proposition, in different words.
  - Yes, the reason "cigarettes can kill you" effectively restates the proposition "smoking cigarettes is deadly." Both phrases are saying essentially the same thing using different words.

- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Offers a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
  - This argument makes a direct statement instead of providing a causal relationship.

- **False Universals (<FU>):** Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
  - The argument does claim a universally accepted point (cigarettes being deadly), but it does not assert it without the logical structure.

- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Uses statements open to dual interpretations.
  - There is no ambiguity or dual interpretation here.

### Step 3: Match to Defective Argument Type
Based on the above determinations, the most suitable category for this argument is:

**Redundant Reason (<RR>):**
The reason given for the proposition is essentially just restating the same proposition in a slightly different way, without adding any new information or logical support.

### Conclusion
The classification of the statement "smoking cigarettes is deadly because cigarettes can kill you" is:

Type of Defective Argument: **<RR> (Redundant Reason)**
