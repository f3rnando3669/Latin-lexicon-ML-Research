For 
To apply **IDAA** (the decomposition of the task of classifying the argument type) to the statement "Everybody else is doing it, why don't you?", we need to follow a systematic process. Here are the steps for decompressing and analyzing the argument according to the predefined defective argument types:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify the Basic Structure of the Argument**:
   - The statement suggests that the reason for engaging in an action is simply because others are doing it.
   - **Proposition:** "You should do it [engage in the action]."
   - **Reasoning provided:** "Everybody else is doing it."

2. **Examine the Reasoning Logic**:
   - Determine if the reasoning logically supports the proposition.
   - In this case, the reasoning relies on the appeal to the fact that others are doing something as a justification for why you should also do it.

3. **Check Against Each Defective Argument Type**:
   - **<G> (Generalization):** Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
     - The statement does not generalize based on a specific instance. Instead, it appeals to social behavior.
   - **<FE> (False Enumeration):** Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
     - The statement does not list options; it implies an imperative based on social behavior.
   - **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason):** Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
     - While the reason ("everybody else is doing it") is not logically robust, this falls more under another specific type.
   - **<RR> (Redundant Reason):** Presenting a reason that redundantly restates the proposition.
     - The statement does not redundantly restate itself.
   - **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis):** Offering a weak causal basis for the proposition.
     - There is no causal relationship implied in the action.
   - **<FU> (False Universals):** Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
     - **Potential Match:** The statement asserts that because "everybody else is doing it," you should too, without any substantial proof or logical reasoning. This fits the pattern of appealing to popularity or a universal social action as validation.
   - **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases):** Using statements open to dual interpretations.
     - The statement is clear and not open to dual interpretations.

4. **Determine the Best Fit**:
   - The statement "Everybody else is doing it, why don't you?" fits best under **<FU> (False Universals)** because it uses the appeal to popularity (also known as the bandwagon fallacy) as the justification without providing any substantial evidence that engaging in the action is beneficial or logical.

### Conclusion

The argument "Everybody else is doing it, why don't you?" is best classified under **<FU> (False Universals)** due to its reliance on popularity as an attempted form of validation without substantial reasoning.

**Type of Defective Argument for 'Everybody else is doing it, why don't you?': [<FU>]**
