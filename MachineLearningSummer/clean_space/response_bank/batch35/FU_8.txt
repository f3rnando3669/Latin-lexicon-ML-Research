Sure! To apply the process of <IDAA> (which involves decomposing the task, <IDA>, of classifying the argument it into specific steps, and then applying those steps), we can proceed as follows:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Application:

1. **Identify Key Elements in the Statement:**
    - Statement: "If everyone believes it, you should too!"
    - Key Elements: "everyone believes it", "you should too"

2. **Understand and Define Context:**
    - The statement seems to rely on the premise that because a belief is widely held, it is correct or should be adopted.

3. **Classify Based on Definitions Provided:**
    - <G> - Generalization: Not applicable, as it's not making a general truth from a specific instance.
    - <FE> - False Enumeration: Not relevant, as it's not enumerating options.
    - <IR> - Inappropriate Reason: Potentially could be, but not a perfect fit as this isn't a clear misalignment of reason but rather an appeal to majority.
    - <RR> - Redundant Reason: Not applicable, as it's not reiterating the same reason.
    - <WCB> - Weak Causal Basis: Not applicable, as no causal basis is being offered.
    - <FU> - False Universals: This involves asserting universally agreed points without proof.
    - <DEP> - Double-Edged Phrases: Not applicable, as there is no dual interpretation likely against the speaker.

4. **Match to the Most Appropriate Type:**
    - The key element "everyone believes it" aligns with an appeal to popularity, implying that a belief held by many is a valid form of validation without proof.
    - This matches the description of <FU> (False Universals): "You appealed to popularity or the fact that many people do something as an attempted form of validation."

5. **Conclusion:**
    - Based on the analysis and classification, the statement "If everyone believes it, you should too!" is best classified as **<FU> (False Universals)**.

By decomposing the task <IDA> into specific steps and applying those steps sequentially, we accomplish the task effectively.
