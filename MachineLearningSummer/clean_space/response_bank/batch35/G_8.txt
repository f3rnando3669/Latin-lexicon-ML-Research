For 
To apply the process of IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying the given string as one of the defective argument types), we will break down the steps of the decomposition as follows:

1. **Understanding the Argument Types**: Review and understand the definitions and characteristics of each defective argument type: Generalization (<G>), False Enumeration (<FE>), Inappropriate Reason (<IR>), Redundant Reason (<RR>), Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>), False Universals (<FU>), and Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>).

2. **Analyze the Given String**: Carefully examine the given string in question.
   - String: "All of those who hate the Duterte administration are CPP-NPA supporters."

3. **Identify Potential Defective Argument Types**: Determine which of the defective argument types could potentially apply to the given string based on its structure and content.

4. **Evaluate Each Argument Type**: Compare the string against the characteristics of each defective argument type to identify the most appropriate category.

5. **Classify the String**: Assign the string to the defective argument type that best matches its logical structure and content.

### Step-by-Step Application:

#### Step 1: Understand the Argument Types
- **<G> Generalization**: Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **<FE> False Enumeration**: Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **<IR> Inappropriate Reason**: Providing a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition.
- **<RR> Redundant Reason**: Repeatedly saying the same thing using different words.
- **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis**: Offering a causal basis that isn’t compelling enough.
- **<FU> False Universals**: Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
- **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases**: Using statements open to dual interpretations.

#### Step 2: Analyze the Given String
The given string is: "All of those who hate the Duterte administration are CPP-NPA supporters."

#### Step 3: Identify Potential Defective Argument Types
Consider how the string could fit into each of the defective argument types.

#### Step 4: Evaluate Each Argument Type
1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The statement "All of those who hate the Duterte administration are CPP-NPA supporters" makes a broad claim about a group based on an unspecified subset, generalizing from a specific context.

2. **False Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The string does not enumerate options, so this does not seem applicable.

3. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The string is not providing a reason to support a proposition; it's making an assertion about a group.

4. **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**:
   - The statement does not seem to be repeating the same idea using different words; thus, this does not apply.

5. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - The string does not present a causal argument, so this is not applicable.

6. **False Universals (<FU>)**:
   - The statement makes a sweeping claim without proof, suggesting that all individuals who dislike the administration belong to another definitive group (CPP-NPA supporters), fitting the description of asserting universally agreed points without evidence.

7. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**:
   - The statement does not seem to use phrases with dual interpretations, so this does not apply.

#### Step 5: Classify the String
The string "All of those who hate the Duterte administration are CPP-NPA supporters." fits both <G> (Generalization) and <FU> (False Universals).

It makes a sweeping generalization about individuals who hate the Duterte administration by attributing to them uniform and specific characteristics without clear evidence.

### Conclusion
- The given string "All of those who hate the Duterte administration are CPP-NPA supporters." is best classified under both **<G> (Generalization)** and **<FU> (False Universals)**.
