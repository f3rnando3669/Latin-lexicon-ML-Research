For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of <D> to <IDA>), we'll break down the advanced task of classifying the string "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people." as one of the specified defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>) step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the components of the statement.
- Proposition: "We need to fix our broken judicial system."
- Justification: "by electing new people."

### Step 2: Analyze whether the justification logically supports the proposition.
- Examine if "electing new people" logically supports "fix our broken judicial system."

### Step 3: Compare against the defined defective argument types.

#### <G> Generalization
- Generalization claims a general truth from a specific instance.
- This statement does not claim a general truth based on a specific instance. It's proposing a solution rather than generalizing.

#### <FE> False Enumeration
- False Enumeration lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
- This statement does not list exclusive options or improper enumeration of choices.

#### <IR> Inappropriate Reason
- Inappropriate Reason provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- Consider if "electing new people" logically and directly addresses or guarantees the fixing of the judicial system.
- This appears to be unsuitable reasoning as there is no direct link evident between merely electing new people and fixing the judicial system which is a complex issue.

#### <RR> Redundant Reason
- Redundant Reason presents the same reason as the proposition in different words.
- Here, the reason "by electing new people" does not restate the proposition "fix our broken judicial system."

#### <WCB> Weak Causal Basis
- Weak Causal Basis offers a weak causal link to support the proposition.
- "Electing new people" might be considered a weak basis because it's not necessarily compelling enough to enact systemic change in the judicial system.

#### <FU> False Universals
- False Universals assert universal points without proof or by appealing to popularity.
- This statement does not conform to asserting universal agreement or appeal to popularity.

#### <DEP> Double-Edged Phrases
- Double-Edged Phrases use statements open to dual interpretations.
- This statement does not seem to have dual interpretations.

### Step 4: Determine the most suitable defective argument type.
- The most suitable classifications seem to be between <IR> and <WCB>.

### Final Classification:
- Given the analysis, the statement "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people." provides reasoning that doesn't logically support the proposition in a compelling, direct manner. Thus, the most fitting classification is <IR> (Inappropriate Reason).

### Conclusion:
"We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people." This logical fallacy is called <IR> (Inappropriate Reason).
