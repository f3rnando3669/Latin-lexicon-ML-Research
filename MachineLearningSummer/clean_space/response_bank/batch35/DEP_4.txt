For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of decomposing the task of classifying the given argument into specific steps), here is how we can proceed step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the Decomposition (<D>) for Classifying Arguments (<IDA>)

**Decomposition Steps:**
1. Read and understand the argument carefully.
2. Identify the main proposition or conclusion.
3. Identify the premises or supporting statements.
4. Analyze the logical connection between the premises and the conclusion.
5. Check for any known defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Step 2: Applying the Decomposition (<IDAA>)

**Step 1: Read and Understand the Argument**
- Argument: "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being.  Fetuses are innocent human beings.  Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."
  
**Step 2: Identify the Main Proposition or Conclusion**
- Conclusion: "Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."
  
**Step 3: Identify the Premises or Supporting Statements**
- Premises:
  1. "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being."
  2. "Fetuses are innocent human beings."
  
**Step 4: Analyze the Logical Connection Between the Premises and the Conclusion**
- The argument claims that since it is immoral to kill innocent human beings and fetuses are innocent human beings, therefore it follows that it is immoral to kill fetuses.

**Step 5: Check for Any Known Defective Argument Types**
- **<G> (Generalization)**: This is not present as the argument does not claim a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **<FE> (False Enumeration)**: This is not present as there is no listing of fewer or more options.
- **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**: This is not present as the reasons given (premises) are relevant to the conclusion.
- **<RR> (Redundant Reason)**: This is not present as the premises do provide new information leading to the conclusion.
- **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**: This is not present as it doesnâ€™t offer a causal basis.
- **<FU> (False Universals)**: This might be relevant as it assumes universally agreed points without proof (e.g., categorical assertions about morality and the status of fetuses).
- **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)**: This is not present as there is no potential dual interpretation in the statement.

### Conclusion

The classified logical fallacy is:
- **<FU> (False Universals)**: The argument makes assumptions about universally agreed moral positions and the status of fetuses as innocent human beings without providing proof or acknowledgment of any contrary views.

Hence, the statement:
"It is immoral to kill an innocent human being.  Fetuses are innocent human  beings.  Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."
is classified under <FU> (False Universals).
