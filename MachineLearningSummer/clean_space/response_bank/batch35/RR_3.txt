For 
To apply <IDAA> to "Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified. Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true? Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so. Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct? Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true. Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true? Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran.", we need to decompose the task into specific steps for classifying this string.

### Step 1: Identify the Argument Structure
- Determine the main proposition and the supporting reasons.
- Check for any dialogue that repeats or cycles back to initial points without providing new information.

### Step 2: Evaluate the Logical Strength of the Reasons
- Determine if the reasons are logically supporting the proposition.
- Look for any patterns that match the defective argument types provided.

### Step 3: Classify According to Defective Argument Types
- Compare the identified patterns in the argument with the definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

### Step 1: Identify the Argument Structure
- **Proposition**: Jesus was not really crucified.
- **Support Reason 1**: Because the Quran says so.
- **Support Reason 2**: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.
- **Support Reason 3**: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran.

### Step 2: Evaluate the Logical Strength of the Reasons
- **Reason 1**: Appealing to a religious text does not necessarily validate the truth of a historical event.
- **Reason 2**: Asserts the infallibility of the Quran without external validation.
- **Reason 3**: Cycles back to the religious text to validate itself (circular reasoning).

### Step 3: Classify According to Defective Argument Types
- The argument relies heavily on the assertion that the Quran is an infallible text because it claims to be the Word of God, which leads into a circular logic pattern.

Within the defective argument types provided, especially focusing on circular or redundant reasoning:
- **<IR> Inappropriate Reason** fits here because the reasoning provided (the Quran says so because it is the Word of God because it says it is) does not logically support the proposition without external validation. 
- Additionally, elements of this argument also deal with **<RR> Redundant Reason**, where the argument repeats itself without adding independent proof.

### Conclusion
By applying <IDAA>, we determine the argument "Jesus was not really crucified. Because the Quran says so. Because the Quran is the Word of God. Because God tells us so, here in the Koran." fits primarily under <IR> (Inappropriate Reason) due to the circularity and lack of independent logical support, with aspects of <RR> (Redundant Reason) as it repetitively relies on the same source to support itself without introducing new evidence.
