For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "smoking cigarettes is deadly because cigarettes can kill you," we'll follow the steps necessary to decompose and classify the string according to the defined defective argument types.

### Step-by-step Process:

1. **Identify the Argument Proposition & Reason(s):**
   - **Proposition:** Smoking cigarettes is deadly.
   - **Reason:** Because cigarettes can kill you.

2. **Examine the Types of Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** When the reason appears new but restates the proposition in different words.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Offering a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
   - **False Universals (<FU>):** Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Using statements open to dual interpretations.

3. **Analyze the Reason in the Context of the Proposition:**
   - **Proposition-Reason Check:** "Smoking cigarettes is deadly" is essentially saying the same thing as "cigarettes can kill you."
   - **Redundancy Check:** The reason given ("because cigarettes can kill you") is a reworded version of the proposition ("smoking cigarettes is deadly").

4. **Classify Based on Identified Patterns:**
   - The statement does not fit the criteria of Generalization (<G>), False Enumeration (<FE>), Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>), False Universals (<FU>), or Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>).
   - The reason provided directly restates the proposition in different words, thus creating a Redundant Reason instance.

### Classification:

The string "smoking cigarettes is deadly because cigarettes can kill you" is an example of a Redundant Reason (<RR>).

**Final Classification: <RR>**
