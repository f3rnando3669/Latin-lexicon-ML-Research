For 
To apply the IDAA to the statement "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights", we first need to follow the decomposition steps outlined in the definition of <D>. Here is the step-by-step process:

1. **Identify the proposition within the statement:**
   The proposition here is: "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."

2. **Determine the major component parts of the proposition:**
   - Supporting Hillary Clinton for President.
   - Believing in women's rights.

3. **Analyze how these parts are connected in the argument:**
   The statement is connecting these two parts with an "either-or" construction, implying that there are only two possible options: 
   - You support Hillary Clinton for President.
   - You don't believe in women's rights.

4. **Identify any logical fallacies or defective argument types by comparing it to the defined categories (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>):**
   In this context:
   - The statement presents a False Enumeration (<FE>) by listing fewer options than actually exist. It disregards other possible stances such as supporting women's rights but preferring another candidate or having different reasons for not supporting Hillary Clinton.

5. **Classify the given string <s> based on the analysis:**
   Given the analysis and identification process, the statement clearly fits the defective argument type of False Enumeration (<FE>).

Therefore, the classification of the string "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" is:

**Classified as: <FE> (False Enumeration)**.
