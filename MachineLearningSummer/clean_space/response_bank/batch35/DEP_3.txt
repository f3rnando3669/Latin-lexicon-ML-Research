### Step 1: Understand the task <IDA>
- **<IDA>**: This is the task of classifying a given string into one of several defective argument types.

### Step 2: Understand the target and context <s>
- **<s>**: The given string for classification.

### Step 3: Read and analyze the provided string <s>
Given string:
```
"I see nobody on the road," said Alice.
"I only wish I had such eyes," the king remarked..."To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why it's as much as I can do to see real people, by this light."
```

### Step 4: Identify keywords, phrases, or patterns related to defective arguments
- Look for any specific instance of defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>.

### Step 5: Attempt to match the string to the defined defective argument types
- **Generalization (<G>)**: Not applicable; no generalization based on specific instances.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not applicable; no listing of fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Not applicable; no reason provided that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Not applicable; no reason presented that is just a rephrasing of the proposition.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Not applicable; not offering a causal basis.
- **False Universals (<FU>)**: Not applicable; no assertion of universally agreed points without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Applicable. The phrase "To be able to see Nobody!" plays on the dual interpretation of "Nobody" (a person named Nobody vs. no person at all).

### Step 6: Decide on the classification of <s>
- Classification: **<DEP>** (Double-Edged Phrases)

### Summary of <IDAA>
1. **Understand <IDA>**: Classifying a string into specific defective argument types.
2. **Understand <s>**: Analyze the provided string.
3. **Analyze <s>**: Examine the string for any clues pointing towards defective argument types.
4. **Match patterns**: Check against given defective argument types.
5. **Classify <s>**: Determine the most suitable category based on analysis.

Result: The provided string is best classified as **<DEP>** (Double-Edged Phrases) due to the dual interpretation of "Nobody".

### Final Classification: <DEP>
