For 
To apply the decomposition method <D> to the argument classification task <IDA> ("IDAA") step-by-step on the given statement, we need to break down the task into distinct steps to identify the specific defective argument type present in the statement. Here’s how we can perform <IDAA>:

1. **Restate the Problem**: 
   We need to classify the argument type of the statement: "Since Anna Camacho became vice president of the parent-teacher association, student performance has declined and teacher morale is down. We on the school board believe that Camacho bears sole responsibility for the downtrend."

2. **Analysis of the Argument**:
   - **Identifying the Proposition**: The proposition is that Anna Camacho is responsible for the decline in student performance and teacher morale.
   - **Reasoning Provided**: The argument connects the timing of Camacho becoming vice president with the observed negative trends in the school.

3. **Identifying Potential Defects**:
   - Compare the reasoning to the defined defective argument types:
     - **Generalization (<G>)**: This would apply if the statement was claiming a universal truth based on a specific instance, such as "All students are performing poorly because Camacho is vice president."
     - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: This would apply if the argument presented limited choices, but it doesn’t.
     - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: This would apply if the reasoning was not logically supporting the proposition. The reasoning provided is directly related, so it doesn’t fit here.
     - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: This would apply if the argument repeated itself in different words, which it doesn’t.
     - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This is a potential match since the argument attributes a causal relationship to Camacho without compelling evidence.
     - **False Universals (<FU>)**: Universal claims aren’t made here; this option doesn’t fit.
     - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: The argument doesn't contain statements open to dual interpretations.

4. **Evaluate the Criteria**:
   Given the analysis, the argument type <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis) appears to be the best fit. The statement suggests a causal relationship between Camacho's position and the decline in morale and student performance without strong evidence supporting this direct cause-effect relationship.

5. **Conclusion**:
   The statement classifies best under the defective argument type of a Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>).

By following the step-by-step analysis, we decompose the advanced task <t> (classifying the argument type) into steps and apply it accurately to classify the statement as <WCB>.
