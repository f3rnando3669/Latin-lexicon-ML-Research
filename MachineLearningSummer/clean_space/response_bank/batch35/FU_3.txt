Sure, let's break down the process step-by-step to classify the given statement using the defective argument types.

### Task: Classify the statement "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding."

#### Step 1: Identify the core argument
First, we need to extract the essence of the argument being made:
- **Core argument:** The speaker is justifying their driving speed by comparing it to the speed of others around them.

#### Step 2: Compare with each defective argument type
Now, we match this core argument against each defined defective argument type to find the best fit.

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - **Definition:** Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - **Example:** "All sports car drivers are too aggressive!"
   - **Comparison:** The statement doesn’t generalize from a specific instance to a broad proposition. It is specific to the speaker’s situation.

2. **False Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - **Definition:** Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - **Example:** "Vote for Smith or live through four more years of higher taxes."
   - **Comparison:** The statement doesn’t involve listing or limiting options.

3. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):**
   - **Definition:** Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
   - **Example:** "We cannot listen to John’s opinion on global warming because he is a tree hugger."
   - **Comparison:** The reason provided (driving at the same speed as others) is tangential but not strictly inappropriate in context; it reflects peer behavior as a justification albeit weak.

4. **Redundant Reason (<RR>):**
   - **Definition:** Providing a reason that merely restates the proposition.
   - **Example:** "This legislation is sinful because it is the wrong thing to do."
   - **Comparison:** The statement doesn’t simply restate itself in different words.

5. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - **Definition:** Offering a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
   - **Example:** "I had a headache, saw my doctor, and it got better. The $200 visit was worth it."
   - **Comparison:** The argument made pertains to speed relative to others, not a cause-effect relationship.

6. **False Universals (<FU>):**
   - **Definition:** Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
   - **Example:** "Everyone else is buying it, so you should too!"
   - **Comparison:** The statement closely fits this definition as it appeals to the behavior of others without proving that others' behavior is a valid justification for one's own.

7. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):**
   - **Definition:** Using statements open to dual interpretations.
   - **Example:** "...make the yuletide gay. I don't think sexual preference should have anything to do with enjoying the holiday."
   - **Comparison:** The statement does not have dual interpretations.

#### Step 3: Choose the best fit
Based on the comparisons, "<FU>" (False Universals) appears to be the most suitable classification as the argument employs a form of appeal to popularity or common practice without proper justification.

### Conclusion
Applying the classification steps, the statement "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding." falls under the defect argument type <FU> (False Universals).
