To apply the process of decomposing the task of classifying the logical fallacy in the given statement step by step, let's go through each possible classification and evaluate it against the statement "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far."

### Step 1: Understanding <IDA>

**Task**: Classify the statement as one of the defective argument types:
- Generalization (<G>)
- False Enumeration (<FE>)
- Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)
- Redundant Reason (<RR>)
- Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- False Universals (<FU>)
- Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)

### Step 2: Definitions Review
Ensure clear understanding of each defective argument type:
1. **<G>**: Generalization - Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
2. **<FE>**: False Enumeration - Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
3. **<IR>**: Inappropriate Reason - Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
4. **<RR>**: Redundant Reason - Presented as a new reason but says the same thing as the proposition using different words.
5. **<WCB>**: Weak Causal Basis - Offering a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
6. **<FU>**: False Universals - Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
7. **<DEP>**: Double-Edged Phrases - Using statements open to dual interpretations.

### Step 3: Analysis of Statement
**Statement**: "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far."

#### Evaluation against each Type:

1. **<G>**: 
   - **Evaluation**: This statement is not claiming a general truth based on a specific instance. It appears to be providing a reason for a specific event.
   - **Result**: Not <G>.

2. **<FE>**:
   - **Evaluation**: The statement is not listing fewer or more options than actually exist with regard to reasons why Donald Trump got elected.
   - **Result**: Not <FE>.

3. **<IR>**:
   - **Evaluation**: The statement is suggesting that the reason for Donald Trump's election was liberals taking political correctness too far. On the surface, this reason might appear to some to not logically support the proposition. 
   - **Result**: Possibly <IR>.

4. **<RR>**:
   - **Evaluation**: The statement does not restate its proposition in different words as a reason, so it’s not redundant.
   - **Result**: Not <RR>.

5. **<WCB>**:
   - **Evaluation**: This argument posits a cause-and-effect relationship between an abstract political stance (political correctness) and a complex electoral outcome. The causal basis provided (liberals taking political correctness too far) could be seen as insufficiently compelling to alone explain the outcome of a national election.
   - **Result**: Possibly <WCB>.

6. **<FU>**:
   - **Evaluation**: The statement does not seem to assert a universally agreed upon truth without proof.
   - **Result**: Not <FU>.

7. **<DEP>**:
   - **Evaluation**: The statement does not use language that is open to dual interpretations.
   - **Result**: Not <DEP>.

### Step 4: Final Classification
After evaluation, the statement "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far." could fit into:

- **<IR>: Inappropriate Reason** because it provides a reason (political correctness) that doesn't logically or entirely support the outcome (Trump's election), unless further detailed evidence and context are provided.
- **<WCB>: Weak Causal Basis** because the causal mechanism provided is insufficient to fully support the claim that it singularly led to Trump’s election.

### Step 5: Conclusion
For the given statement: 
- **Primary Classification**: <WCB>: Weak Causal Basis
- **Secondary Consideration**: <IR>: Inappropriate Reason

Upon review, we classify the statement primarily as **<WCB>**.
