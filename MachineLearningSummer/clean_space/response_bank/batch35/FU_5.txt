Sure, let’s apply the task of decomposing the classification of the given string into specific steps:

### Task <IDAA>: Decomposition of <IDA>

#### Step 1: Understand the Argument

The given string is: "All my friends are doing a low carb diet. That must be the only way to lose weight so I will do it too."

#### Step 2: Identify the Argument's Premises and Conclusion

- **Premise**: "All my friends are doing a low carb diet."
- **Conclusion**: "That must be the only way to lose weight so I will do it too."

#### Step 3: Analyze the Reasoning

Evaluate the relationship between the premise and the conclusion:
- The argument assumes that the behavior of friends (all doing a low carb diet) implies a universal truth (it being the only way to lose weight).

#### Step 4: Check for Logical Fallacies

Let's look at each possible defective argument type to see which one might apply:

- **Generalization <G>**: The argument does not claim a general truth based on a specific instance, but involves the behavior of friends leading to a universal claim.
- **False Enumeration <FE>**: The argument does not list fewer or more options than exist, but asserts one option as definitive.
- **Inappropriate Reason <IR>**: The reasoning leading from the premise to the conclusion is not inappropriate in the conventional sense, but it is flawed.
- **Redundant Reason <RR>**: The reason isn't redundant; it’s a faulty leap to a conclusion.
- **Weak Causal Basis <WCB>**: The causal connection is implied but the argument is more about asserting a universal truth.
- **False Universals <FU>**: The argument fits this category as it asserts a universally agreed point (the only way to lose weight) without proof, based on the popularity of a specific behavior.
- **Double-Edged Phrases <DEP>**: No double-edged phrases or dual interpretations are presented in the argument.

#### Step 5: Classify the Argument

Based on the analysis:

- The argument relies on the behavior of a group (friends) to assert a universal truth (the only way to lose weight), which is an appeal to popularity or the fact that many people do something as attempted validation without proof.

Therefore, the classification is:

### Conclusion

The given string "All my friends are doing a low carb diet. That must be the only way to lose weight so I will do it too." is of type **<FU>** (False Universals).
