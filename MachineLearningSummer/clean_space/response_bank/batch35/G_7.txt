For 
To apply <IDAA> to the sentence "If we allow Susan to leave early, soon we'll be giving everyone Friday afternoon off," we need to decompose the task of classifying the argument type into specific steps. Here are those steps:

1. **Identify the Task (IDA Definition):**
    - We need to classify the argument based on predefined defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

2. **Break Down the Sentence:**
    - Analyze the given sentence: "If we allow Susan to leave early, soon we'll be giving everyone Friday afternoon off."
    
3. **Identify Key Components:**
    - Isolate the main components of the argument:
        - Allowing Susan to leave early (cause/premise).
        - Giving everyone Friday afternoon off (consequence/outcome).
    
4. **Check for Causal Relationships:**
    - Verify if the causal relationship is strong and logically sound.

5. **Compare with Definitions of Defective Argument Types:**
    - <G> (Generalization): Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
    - <FE> (False Enumeration): Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
    - <IR> (Inappropriate Reason): Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
    - <RR> (Redundant Reason): Presents a reason that repeats the proposition in different words.
    - <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis): Offers a causal basis that is not compelling.
    - <FU> (False Universals): Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
    - <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases): Uses statements open to dual interpretations.

6. **Determine if The Argument Fits Any Specific Type:**
    - The argument seems to suggest a slippery slope without sufficient evidence that allowing Susan to leave early would necessarily lead to everyone getting Friday afternoons off. This implies a weak causal basis.

7. **Select the Appropriate Defective Argument Type:**
    - Based on the argument structure, it seems to fit into the category of <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis) as it fails to establish a compelling link between Susan leaving early and the broader consequence.

8. **Conclusion:**
    - The argument "If we allow Susan to leave early, soon we'll be giving everyone Friday afternoon off" is classified as <WCB>.

By following these steps, we decomposed the task of classifying the argument and identified it as a weak causal basis.
