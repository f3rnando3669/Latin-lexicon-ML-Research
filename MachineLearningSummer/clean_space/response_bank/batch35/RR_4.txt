For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of IDA into specific steps) to the given statement "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there.", we'll break down the classification task into clear, methodical steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition
- The proposition in the given statement is: "That restaurant is popular."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason Provided
- The reason provided to support this proposition is: "everyone in town goes there."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Reason's Connection to the Proposition
- We analyze if the reason logically supports the proposition. The reason "everyone in town goes there" is essentially saying that the restaurant is popular because it is popular, which is a circular reasoning or appeals to the fact that many people go there as a form of validation.

### Step 4: Classify Based on Definitions
- We review the provided definitions to see which one matches the identified faulty reasoning:
  - <G>: Generalization based on specific instances.
  - <FE>: False Enumeration listing fewer or more options.
  - <IR>: Inappropriate Reason not logically supporting the proposition.
  - <RR>: Redundant Reason restating the proposition.
  - <WCB>: Weak Causal Basis with an insufficient causal link.
  - <FU>: False Universals asserting universally agreed points without proof.
  - <DEP>: Double-Edged Phrases with dual interpretations.

### Step 5: Determine the Appropriate Defective Argument
- From the definitions, <FU> involves asserting universally agreed points without proof and often appeals to popularity.
- The statement "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there" fits well with the defect of appealing to the popularity as a form of validation, aligning with the characteristics of <FU> (False Universals).

Therefore, the classified defective argument type of the statement "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there." is:
  
**<FU> (False Universals)**
