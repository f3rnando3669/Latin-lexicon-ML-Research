For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way," we need to decompose the task of classifying the statement into specific steps. Hereâ€™s the breakdown:

### Step 1: Understand the Definition of Each Argument Type
Firstly, it's essential to familiarize ourselves with each defective argument type:

- **<G> Generalization:** Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **<FE> False Enumeration:** Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **<IR> Inappropriate Reason:** Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- **<RR> Redundant Reason:** Presenting a new reason that repeats the proposition in different words.
- **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis:** Offering a causal basis that is not compelling enough.
- **<FU> False Universals:** Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
- **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases:** Using statements open to dual interpretations.

### Step 2: Analyze the Statement
Analyze the given statement to understand its core reasoning and implications:
- **Statement:** "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way."

### Step 3: Compare with Definitions
Compare the statement with each defective argument type to determine the best match:
- **Generalization (G):** There is no specific instance forming a general truth here.
- **False Enumeration (FE):** The statement doesn't list options.
- **Inappropriate Reason (IR):** Not applicable since the reason (others acting the same way) does support the proposition in a context but is a different logical fallacy.
- **Redundant Reason (RR):** Not redundant as it does not repeat the same thing.
- **Weak Causal Basis (WCB):** There's no implied insufficient causal relationship.
- **False Universals (FU):** The key to this argument is encouraging action because others are doing it, implying universal agreement or trend without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP):** There are no dual interpretations presented.

### Step 4: Identify the Best Match
Based on the definitions and comparison:
- The statement "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way" best matches **False Universals (FU)**, as it relies on the assumption that because many people are doing something, it must be the correct action without providing proof.

### Conclusion:
The argument type classification for the given statement is **<FU> (False Universals)**.

Therefore, the application of <IDAA> to "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way" follows these steps and results in identifying it as being of type **<FU>**.
