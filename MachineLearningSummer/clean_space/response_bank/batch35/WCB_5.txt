For 
Sure, let's apply the decomposition process <D> to the task of classification <IDA> for the statement "Every girl I've dated has been a nurse. I must only be compatible with nurses!" step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the key components of the statement
   - Observation: "Every girl I've dated has been a nurse."
   - Conclusion: "I must only be compatible with nurses!"

### Step 2: Determine if the observation relates logically to the conclusion
   - Analyze if the conclusion follows logically from the observation.
   - The observation provides specific instances (individuals dated) and the conclusion generalizes these instances to make a broad statement about compatibility.

### Step 3: Match the observed logical structure with the definitions of defective argument types
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
     - "Every girl I've dated has been a nurse" is used to conclude a general truth "I must only be compatible with nurses."
     - This matches the structure of <G>, where a general conclusion is drawn from specific instances.

   - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
     - This statement does not present limited or exaggerated options.

   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
     - The conclusion is not about an irrelevant reason for compatibility but attempts to derive a general statement from specific experiences.

   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Reiterates the proposition using different words.
     - The statement does not simply restate the proposition.

   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Offers a causal basis that is not compelling enough.
     - The statement does not attempt to establish a causal relationship, but rather a logical generalization.

   - **False Universals (<FU>)**: Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
     - The statement does not appeal to universal agreement or popularity.

   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Uses dual-interpretation statements.
     - The statement is not ambiguous or open to multiple interpretations.

### Step 4: Assign the appropriate classification
   - Based on the breakdown above, the statement fits best with the definition of **Generalization (<G>)**.

### Conclusion
- The statement "Every girl I've dated has been a nurse. I must only be compatible with nurses!" is classified as type **<G>** (Generalization).
