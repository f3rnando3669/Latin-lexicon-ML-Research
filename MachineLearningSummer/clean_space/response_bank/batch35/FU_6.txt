For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "Everybody else is doing it, why don't you?", we will decompose the task of classifying the string into specific steps and then apply each step to achieve the classification:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>) of Classification Task (<IDA>):

1. **Understand the Argument**:
   - Identify the key assertions and the reasoning.
   - Major assertion: "You should do it."
   - Reason provided: "Everybody else is doing it."

2. **Identify the Argument Type**:
   - Compare the reasoning used in the argument with the definitions of each defective argument type: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

3. **Match Reasoning to Defective Argument Type**:
   - Look for keywords or structure that matches one of the defined defective argument types.
   - Assess whether the argument type involves generalization, limited options, inappropriate reasons, redundant reasons, weak causal basis, false universals, or double-edged phrases.

### Applying the Steps to "Everybody else is doing it, why don't you?":

1. **Understand the Argument**:
   - The phrase is encouraging someone to take an action because it is implied that everyone else is doing it.

2. **Identify the Argument Type**:
   - The reasoning given is that because others are performing the action, it is a sufficient reason for the individual to also perform it.

3. **Match Reasoning to Defective Argument Type**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: No, it does not claim a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: No, it does not list fewer or more options than exist.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: No, the reasoning isn't about dismissing an opinion based on irrelevant aspects.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: No, it does not restate the proposition using different words.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: No, it does not involve a weak causal connection.
   - **False Universals (<FU>)**: Yes, it asserts a universally accepted point without proof; it implies that because many people are doing something, it is valid or should be done by the listener. This is an appeal to popularity or bandwagon fallacy.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: No, it does not use a statement open to dual interpretations.

### Classification:
- The string "Everybody else is doing it, why don't you?" falls under the defective argument type **False Universals (<FU>)**. 

So, the final classification after applying <IDAA> is:
- **<FU>**
