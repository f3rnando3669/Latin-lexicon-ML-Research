For 
To apply the task of <IDAA> to the given statement, we need to follow the process of decomposition into specific steps for classifying the statement as one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

Step 1: Understand the context and content of the statement.
The statement is: "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick."

Step 2: Identify the argument being made.
The speaker is concluding that the bottled water they drank caused them to become sick.

Step 3: Determine if the argument is a generalization based on a specific instance.
<G> Generalization: This argument does not involve generalizing a specific instance to a broad conclusion. It’s about a specific instance affecting the individual.

Step 4: Check if the argument presents limited options.
<FE> False Enumeration: This argument does not enumerate options or choices; it states a perceived cause-and-effect relationship.

Step 5: Inspect if the reason given is irrelevant or doesn’t logically support the proposition.
<IR> Inappropriate Reason: The reason (water causing sickness) seems relevant but needs further assessment on its logical support.

Step 6: See if the reason is repeating the proposition differently.
<RR> Redundant Reason: The conclusion that the water caused the sickness is not simply a restatement but an assertion of causality.

Step 7: Evaluate the strength of the causal basis.
<WCB> Weak Causal Basis: The argument implies that because the person drank bottled water and then got sick, the water must have caused the sickness. However, this is a weak causal basis, as correlation does not necessarily mean causation.

Step 8: Verify if a universal statement is being made without proof.
<FU> False Universals: The argument doesn’t assert universally agreed points; it is a specific cause-and-effect claim.

Step 9: Assess if the statement can be dual-interpreted to contradict itself.
<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases: The statement doesn’t involve dual interpretations.

Conclusion:
Based on the steps above, the statement "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick." is best classified under <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis) since it implies causation based on a mere correlation, which is not a compelling enough basis to logically support the conclusion.

Thus, the logical fallacy used in the statement is of type <WCB>.
