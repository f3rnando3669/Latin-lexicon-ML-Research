For 
To apply <IDAA> to "If you don't say the pledge of allegiance, then you must be a traitor," we'll follow the decomposition process step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition
First, we need to clearly identify the proposition made in the statement.

**Proposition:** "If you don't say the pledge of allegiance, then you must be a traitor."

### Step 2: Analyze the Type of Argument
Next, we will analyze the type of argument present in this statement by matching it against the definitions of each defective argument type (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This involves claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
2. **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: This involves listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
3. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: This provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
4. **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: This presents a new reason that says the same thing as the proposition in different words.
5. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This offers a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
6. **False Universals (<FU>)**: This asserts universally agreed points without proof.
7. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: This uses statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.

### Step 3: Match the Statement with Argument Types
Now, we'll compare the given statement to each type of defective argument:

- **<G>**: The statement does not generalize based on a specific instance.
- **<FE>**: The statement does not list options, so it cannot be false enumeration.
- **<IR>**: The statement suggests that not saying the pledge of allegiance equates to being a traitor, which seems more like a false dichotomy than providing an irrelevant reason.
- **<RR>**: The statement does not redundantly restate the proposition using different words.
- **<WCB>**: The statement does not provide a weak causal basis but makes an absolute classification.
- **<FU>**: The statement implicitly asserts a universal truth without proof: that not saying the pledge of allegiance results in being a traitor.
- **<DEP>**: The statement is not open to dual interpretations.

### Step 4: Classify the Statement
Based on the analysis, the statement "If you don't say the pledge of allegiance, then you must be a traitor" fits best with <FU> (False Universals), as it asserts a universally agreed point without providing proof.

### Conclusion
We have classified the statement "If you don't say the pledge of allegiance, then you must be a traitor" as being of type **<FU>**.
