For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of IDA into specific steps) to classify the argument in the given string, we'll break down the task step by step. 

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDA (IDAA):

1. **Identify the Proposition**:
   - The defendant argues that he shouldn't have to pay his parking fines.

2. **Examine the Reasoning Given**:
   - The reason given is that the sign said "Fine for parking here" and he presumed it would be fine to park there.

3. **Evaluate the Type of Defective Argument**:

    - **<G> (Generalization)**:
      - It does not claim a general truth based on a specific instance.

    - **<FE> (False Enumeration)**:
      - It does not list fewer or more options than actually exist.

    - **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**:
      - The reason provided does not logically support the proposition. The statement "Fine for parking here" is being misinterpreted and does not logically follow that it would be fine to park there. This appears to align with the definition of <IR>.

    - **<RR> (Redundant Reason)**:
      - The reason provided is not simply a restatement of the proposition.

    - **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**:
      - The argument does not offer a causal basis that is not compelling enough.

    - **<FU> (False Universals)**:
      - The argument does not assert universally agreed points without proof.

    - **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)**:
      - The phrase used does have a dual interpretation ("Fine" as a penalty vs. "fine" as acceptable), which is why there is a mistake made by the defendant. This fits the definition of <DEP>.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evaluation, the argument given by the defendant that he shouldn't have to pay his parking fines because the sign said "Fine for parking here" and he presumed it would be fine to park there uses a **double-edged phrase**. This fits the definition of **<DEP>**.

Therefore, the classification of the argument in the string is:

**<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)**
