For 
Let's apply the definition of <IDAA>, the application of <D> (decomposition into specific steps) to <IDA> (classifying a string as one of the given defective argument types), step by step to the string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you."

### Step-by-step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the argument presented in the statement:**
   - The argument is: "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you."

2. **Break down the argument to find the reasoning and conclusion:**
   - Reasoning: "My best friend says you’re a liar."
   - Conclusion: "I’m not going to talk to you."

3. **Analyze if the reasoning logically supports the conclusion:**
   - The reasoning does not directly provide evidence or proof of the claim made in the conclusion. Instead, it relies on an unspecified opinion of "my best friend."

4. **Classify the type of defective argument:**
   - **Generalization (G)**: Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance is not applicable here.
   - **False Enumeration (FE)**: Listing fewer or more options than actually exist is not applicable here.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**: Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the conclusion seems to fit since the reasoning ("My best friend says you’re a liar") doesn't inherently establish the truth of the proposition nor logically support the conclusion (not talking to you).
   - **Redundant Reason (RR)**: Saying the same thing as the proposition using different words is not applicable here.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**: Offering an insubstantial causal connection isn't the central issue here.
   - **False Universals (FU)**: Asserting universally agreed points without proof doesn't apply.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**: Using dual-interpretation statements isn't relevant here.

Given the analysis, the argument in the string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you" provides an Inappropriate Reason (IR) because the reasoning (a friend's opinion) does not logically support the conclusion of not talking to the person.

### Identification:
- The statement "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you." is classified as <IR> (Inappropriate Reason).
