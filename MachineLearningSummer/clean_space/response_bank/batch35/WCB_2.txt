For 
To apply <IDAA> to "Farmer McDonald: Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain. I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature.", we need to decompose and classify the given statement step by step. Here are the decomposed steps in detail:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition and the Reason
**Proposition:** "Mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature."
**Stated Reason:** "Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain."

### Step 2: Determine if the Reason Logically Supports the Proposition
- Analyze the causal connection: The reason suggests a causal connection between the new power plant and the lack of rain.

### Step 3: Assess the Validity of the Causal Connection
- Validate the causality: Is there a scientifically plausible connection? If not, it is a weak causal basis.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument Type
- Given that the causal basis (power plant causing lack of rain) is not compelling and lacks scientific support, it fits the description of a Weak Causal Basis (WCB).

### Conclusion:
For the statement "Farmer McDonald: Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain. I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature."
- **Argument Type:** Weak Causal Basis (WCB)

Thus, the classification of the statement is:

<s> = "Farmer McDonald: Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain. I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature."
<IDA>(<s>) = <WCB>
