For 
To apply <IDAA> to "Shakira is the best singer in the world because she is the most talented singer there is.", we first need to decompose the process of classifying this sentence step-by-step. 

**Step 1: Identify the proposition and the reason given.**
- Proposition: "Shakira is the best singer in the world."
- Reason: "because she is the most talented singer there is."

**Step 2: Determine if the reason logically supports the proposition.**
- The reason given is that Shakira is the best singer because she is the most talented singer. 

**Step 3: Check for defective argument types:**

1. **Generalization (<G>):** This argument does not generalize from a specific instance to a broad statement. Therefore, it does not fit <G>.

2. **False Enumeration (<FE>):** This argument is not listing options. Therefore, it does not fit <FE>.

3. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** The reason given is related to the proposition, as talent can be a factor in determining the "best" singer. Therefore, this does not fit <IR>.

4. **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** The statement "she is the best singer because she is the most talented singer" is essentially saying the same thing in different words. The notion of being "the best" is typically associated with being "the most talented."

5. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This type of fallacy would involve a weak causal relationship, but this argument is not dealing with causality. Therefore, it does not fit <WCB>.

6. **False Universals (<FU>):** This argument does not universally assert points without proof. It is a specific statement about Shakira being the best based on her talent. Therefore, it does not fit <FU>.

7. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** The argument does not involve phrases that can be interpreted in dual, potentially contradictory ways. Therefore, it does not fit <DEP>.

**Step 4: Determine the best matching defective argument type.**
- The best fit for this argument is <RR> (Redundant Reason) because the reason provided is essentially a rephrasing of the proposition in different terms.

**Conclusion:**
Classify the argument as <RR>.

So, the classification of "Shakira is the best singer in the world because she is the most talented singer there is." is <RR>.
