For 
To apply **<IDAA>** to the task of classifying "all bachelors are unmarried males", we need to decompose this task into specific steps **<D>** and then apply these steps to the given string to identify the appropriate defective argument type.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition **<D>**:
1. **Identify the proposition in <s>**:
    - Extract the main claim being made in the string.

2. **Evaluate the logical structure of the argument**:
    - Check if the proposition generalizes from specific instances to make a sweeping generalization.
    - Determine if fewer or more options are listed than actually exist.
    - Assess if the reason provided does not logically support the proposition.
    - Determine if the reason given is simply a restatement of the proposition.
    - Check if the causal basis presented is weak or insufficient.
    - Determine if the proposition asserts universally agreed points without proof.
    - Check if statements made are open to dual interpretations potentially against the speaker.

3. **Match the proposition to the defective argument types** defined:
    - <G> (Generalization)
    - <FE> (False Enumeration)
    - <IR> (Inappropriate Reason)
    - <RR> (Redundant Reason)
    - <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)
    - <FU> (False Universals)
    - <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)

### Application of <D> to "all bachelors are unmarried males":

#### Step 1: Identify the proposition in <s>:
The proposition in "all bachelors are unmarried males" is: 
- "All bachelors are unmarried males."

#### Step 2: Evaluate the logical structure of the argument:
- **Generalization**: The statement defines a universal truth about all bachelors based on the definition of "bachelor".
    - This is a dictionary definition rather than a faulty generalization.
    
- **False Enumeration**: The statement does not list alternatives or options.
    - Not applicable.
    
- **Inappropriate Reason**: No reason is provided that needs logical support.
    - Not applicable.
    
- **Redundant Reason**: The statement is a definition and does not provide a reason.
    - Not applicable.
    
- **Weak Causal Basis**: No causal relationship is presented.
    - Not applicable.

- **False Universals**: The statement asserts a definition that could be universally agreed upon without proof.
    - The proposition fits here as it asserts a universally accepted definition.
    
- **Double-Edged Phrases**: The statement does not have dual interpretations or ambiguity.
    - Not applicable.

#### Step 3: Match the proposition to the defective argument types:
Based on the steps:
- The statement "all bachelors are unmarried males" best fits the category of **<FU> (False Universals)** since it asserts a universally agreed definition without requiring further proof, which aligns with the example pattern provided for False Universals.

### Result:
The classification of "all bachelors are unmarried males" is **<FU>**.
