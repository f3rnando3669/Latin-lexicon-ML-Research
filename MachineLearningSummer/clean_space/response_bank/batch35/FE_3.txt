For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "People either like coffee or hate it," we will follow these steps:

**Step 1: Understand the <IDA> task.**
- The <IDA> task involves classifying the given string as one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

**Step 2: Interpret and analyze the string.**
- The string "People either like coffee or hate it." makes an assertion about a binary preference regarding coffee.

**Step 3: Match the string against definitions of defective argument types.**
- **<G>: Generalization** - "All sports car drivers are too aggressive!" is a broad statement based on a specific instance. Our string is not quite making a generalization based on a specific instance but an all-encompassing binary claim.
- **<FE>: False Enumeration** - "Vote for Smith or live through four more years of higher taxes." lists fewer options than exist (the fallacy hinges on limited options). Our string "People either like coffee or hate it." also limits the options to two, ignoring any neutral or indifferent positions.
- **<IR>: Inappropriate Reason** - "We cannot listen to John’s opinion on global warming because he is a tree hugger." Here the reasoning is irrelevant to the argument being made. Our string doesn't provide reasoning.
- **<RR>: Redundant Reason** - "This legislation is sinful because it is the wrong thing to do." This is tautological and not applicable to our string.
- **<WCB>: Weak Causal Basis** - "I had a real bad headache, then saw my doctor. Just by talking with him, my headache started to subside, and I was all better the next day. It was well worth the $200 visit fee." Here a causal connection is weakly established. Our string isn't making a causal claim.
- **<FU>: False Universals** - These claim universal agreement without proof, as in "Everyone else is buying it, so you should too!" Our string doesn’t appeal to popularity but suggests a binary occurrence.
- **<DEP>: Double-Edged Phrases** - These phrases have dual interpretations. Our string doesn't fit this pattern either.

**Step 4: Deduce the most fitting classification.**
- Given the analysis, the defective argument type that best fits is <FE> (False Enumeration). The string "People either like coffee or hate it." falsely limits the options to only two, while ignoring neutral or alternative positions.

**Conclusion:**
The string "People either like coffee or hate it." can be classified as <FE>, False Enumeration.
