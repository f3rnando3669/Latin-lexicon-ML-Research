For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as type <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>), we will break down the process into specific steps and execute them one by one. 

### Step-by-Step Application of <IDAA>

**Step 1:** Decompose the task into specific steps to analyze the argument provided in the string.

1. **Step 1.1:** Identify the proposition or claim made in the string.
2. **Step 1.2:** Examine the evidence or reasons provided to support the claim.
3. **Step 1.3:** Determine the relationship between the evidence and the claim.
4. **Step 1.4:** Identify any characteristics that match our defined defective argument types.

**Step 1.1:** Identify the proposition or claim.

- The proposition is: "This therapy is worthwhile and I am exceptionally ethical for providing it."

**Step 1.2:** Examine the evidence or reasons provided to support the claim.

- Evidence 1: "Not one person has proved it is worthless."
- Evidence 2: "Not one person has proved that I am unethical for providing it."

**Step 1.3:** Determine the relationship between the evidence and the claim.

- The argument suggests that because no one has disproven the worth of the therapy or the ethical nature of providing it, the therapy must be of significant value and the provider must be ethical.

**Step 1.4:** Identify any characteristics that match our defined defective argument types.

- **Generalization (<G>):** The argument does not seem to rely on a specific instance to make a sweeping generalization about all cases.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument doesn't present a limited set of options excluding other possible scenarios.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** The argument's reasons (nobody has disproven it) do not logically support the conclusion (that it is worthwhile and ethical). This suggests a logical disconnect between the evidence provided and the claim.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** The claim and the argument are not merely restating the same thing.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The reasons provided (absence of disproof) are weak causal bases for the claim.
- **False Universals (<FU>):** Although the claim borders on universality in its assertion, it doesn't appeal directly to universally agreed points without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** The argument does not present statements open to dual interpretations.

---

**Conclusion:**
After analyzing each part:

- The primary logical issue lies in the nature of the reasons provided. The reasons (no one has disproven it) do not logically support the conclusion that the therapy is valuable and ethical. This aligns with the <IR> type (Inappropriate Reason).

- Additionally, the absence of robust causal basis for asserting the worth and ethical nature of the therapy points towards <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis).

Thus, the string can be classified as containing defective arguments of both:

1. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**
2. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)** 

Final Classification: **<IR>, <WCB>**
