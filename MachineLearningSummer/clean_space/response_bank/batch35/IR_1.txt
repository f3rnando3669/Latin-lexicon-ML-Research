For 
To apply <IDAA> to "Don't you want the best for your baby?", let's proceed step by step. We need to decompose the advanced task <IDA> (classifying the string as one of the defective argument types) into specific steps.

Here's the decomposition (<D>) of the task <IDA>:
1. **Identify the proposition**: Understand the primary claim or question being made in the string.
2. **Analyze the reasoning**: Determine what kind of reasoning, if any, is given to support the claim or question.
3. **Evaluate the logic**: Assess if the reasoning provides logical support for the proposition.
4. **Classify the defect**: Based on the evaluation, classify the identified defect according to the predefined argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

Now, we'll apply this decomposition to the task <IDA> with the string "Don't you want the best for your baby?"

**Step 1: Identify the proposition**
- The primary claim here is an indirect suggestion or assertion that implicitly assumes that whatever is being discussed is the best for the baby.

**Step 2: Analyze the reasoning**
- The string is phrased as a rhetorical question which suggests that any reasonable parent would naturally want the best for their baby. It relies on the assumption that wanting the best for one's baby is universally agreed upon.

**Step 3: Evaluate the logic**
- While the statement implies a universally accepted notion that parents want the best for their children, it does not provide any logical support for what specifically is the "best" in this context. Therefore, it assumes agreement without substantiating the specifics.

**Step 4: Classify the defect**
- This type of reasoning aligns most closely with <FU> (False Universals), as it asserts a universally agreed point (wanting the best for oneâ€™s baby) without proof and relies on assumed agreement.

Thus, after applying <IDAA> step by step to the string, we classify "Don't you want the best for your baby?" as of type **<FU> (False Universals)**.
