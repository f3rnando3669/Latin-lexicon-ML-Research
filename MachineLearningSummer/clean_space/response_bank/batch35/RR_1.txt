For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity," we need to first break down the task <IDA> of classifying the statement into specific steps. Here is a step-by-step decomposition:

### Step 1: Understand the Argument Structure
- Identify the main claim (conclusion).
- Identify the supporting reason(s) provided for the claim.

### Step 2: Evaluate the Reason Given
- Assess whether the reason logically supports the claim.
- Determine if the reason fits any of the defined defective argument types.

### Step 3: Match with Defective Argument Types
- Compare the argument with definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
- Determine the most appropriate defective argument type based on the analysis.

Now, applying these steps to the provided statement:

### Step 1: Understand the Argument Structure
- **Main Claim:** Paranormal activity is real.
- **Supporting Reason:** I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity.

### Step 2: Evaluate the Reason Given
- **Assessment:** The reason given is a personal anecdote. The individual is using a specific instance (their own experience) to make a general claim about the existence of paranormal activity.

### Step 3: Match with Defective Argument Types
- **<G> Generalization:** The statement takes a specific instance (personal experience) to claim a general truth (existence of paranormal activity). This matches the pattern of generalizing from a specific instance.
- **<FE> False Enumeration:** The argument does not involve a false dichotomy or limited options.
- **<IR> Inappropriate Reason:** The reason provided is related to the claim but is based on anecdotal evidence rather than logical proof, which fits the idea of an inappropriate reason but not exactly.
- **<RR> Redundant Reason:** The reason given isn't just a rephrasing of the claim.
- **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis:** Though the causal link is not strong, this isn't primarily a causal argument.
- **<FU> False Universals:** The statement doesn’t discuss universally agreed points without proof.
- **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases:** The statement isn’t open to dual interpretations.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
- Given the specific instance to generalization pattern, the statement "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity" is best classified as:

**<G> Generalization.**

Therefore, the classification of the statement is <G>.
