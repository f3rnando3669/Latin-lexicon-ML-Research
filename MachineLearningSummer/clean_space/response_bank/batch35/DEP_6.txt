For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition applied to the task of classifying the given string), we will break down the process step by step to classify the argument in "Why does the law state that you have to be 21 years old to drink?  Does it really make any difference if you are 20 years and 364 days old?  That is absurd.  Therefore, if a single day makes no difference, then a collection of 1095 single days won’t make any difference. Therefore, changing the drinking age to 18 will not make any difference." 

### Step 1: Identify the Structure of the Argument
Let's break down the argument into its components:

1. The law states you have to be 21 years old to drink.
2. Questioning if being 20 years and 364 days old makes any difference compared to being 21 years old.
3. Declaring that it is absurd.
4. Concluding that if a single day does not make a difference, then multiple days (3 years) won't make a difference either.
5. Concluding that changing the drinking age to 18 won't make a difference.

### Step 2: Assess Each Component for Defective Argument Types
We shall evaluate each part of the argument to determine if any of them fall into the types we have defined - Generalization (G), False Enumeration (FE), Inappropriate Reason (IR), Redundant Reason (RR), Weak Causal Basis (WCB), False Universals (FU), and Double-Edged Phrases (DEP).

1. **Law States Age Requirement**: A factual statement, not an argument.
2. **Question if near-age matters**: This challenges the rationale behind the law but doesn’t conclude anything yet.
3. **Declaring Absurdity**: This begins to take a stance but needs analysis.
4. **Argument on Single Day's Insignificance Scaling to 3 Years**: This part states if a single day doesn’t matter, then many days summed also shouldn't matter.
5. **Conclusion on Changing the Drinking Age**: This conclusion is based on the previously stated argument.

### Step 3: Evaluate the Central Argument
The core argument lies in the transition from "one day difference doesn’t matter" to "therefore, a large collection of such days over a few years doesn’t matter" concerning the legal drinking age.

### Step 4: Identify Defective Argument Types
- **False Enumeration (FE)**: This argument creates a binary where either you reach 21, or individual days don't matter. It ignores the possibility of cumulative, significant change over time or introduces a false dichotomy.
- **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument creates a causal link between a single day's irrelevance and a multi-year policy change which is not compelling enough. Laws often involve cutoffs that are somewhat arbitrary but have reasoning behind them (developmental psychology, social norms, etc.).

### Step 5: Assign the Defective Argument Type
The more compelling classification seems to be **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**, because the argument's logic—that if one day makes no difference, then 1095 days make no difference—is weak for justifying changing the drinking age. It doesn't sufficiently support the proposition as legal drinking ages are typically based on broader social and health considerations, not the triviality of a single day.

Therefore, the argument: "Why does the law state that you have to be 21 years old to drink?  Does it really make any difference if you are 20 years and 364 days old?  That is absurd.  Therefore, if a single day makes no difference, then a collection of 1095 single days won’t make any difference. Therefore, changing the drinking age to 18 will not make any difference." is classified under **<WCB>**.
