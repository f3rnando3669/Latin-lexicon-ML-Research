For 
Sure, let's apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the string "See the movie that everybody's talking about" as one of the provided defective argument types.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>) of <IDA> Task:
1. **Identify the main proposition or claim in the string.**
2. **Look at the context and manner in which the proposition is presented.**
3. **Determine if the argument is trying to generalize from a specific instance.**
4. **Check if the argument is listing fewer or more options than actually exist.**
5. **See if the reason provided is inappropriate or logically irrelevant.**
6. **Assess if the reason is redundant.**
7. **Evaluate whether the causal basis is weak.**
8. **Check if the argument is asserting universally agreed points without proof.**
9. **Determine if the phrase uses double-edged language open to dual interpretations.**
10. **Classify the argument based on the above assessments.**

### Applying <D> to Classify the String:
1. **Identify the main proposition or claim in the string:**
   - The main proposition is that one should see the movie.

2. **Look at the context and manner in which the proposition is presented:**
   - The reason given for seeing the movie is that "everybody's talking about" it.

3. **Determine if the argument is trying to generalize from a specific instance (<G>):**
   - No, the claim is not generalizing based on a specific instance.

4. **Check if the argument is listing fewer or more options than actually exist (<FE>):**
   - No, the argument does not involve enumeration of options.

5. **See if the reason provided is inappropriate or logically irrelevant (<IR>):**
   - The reason seems to imply social proof (popularity) rather than a logical, relevant reason.

6. **Assess if the reason is redundant (<RR>):**
   - No, the reason is not just restating the proposition in different words.

7. **Evaluate whether the causal basis is weak (<WCB>):**
   - No causal relationship is suggested directly; it is more about popularity.

8. **Check if the argument is asserting universally agreed points without proof (<FU>):**
   - Yes, the argument is relying on the idea that because "everybody" is talking about the movie, one should see it, appealing to popularity without actual proof of the movieâ€™s quality.

9. **Determine if the phrase uses double-edged language open to dual interpretations (<DEP>):**
   - No, there is no ambiguous language with dual interpretations.

10. **Classify the argument based on the above assessments:**
    - Based on the evaluation, the argument fits the category of **False Universals (<FU>)** because it appeals to popularity as a form of validation without offering concrete evidence or proof.

Therefore, the string "See the movie that everybody's talking about" is classified as <FU> (False Universals).
