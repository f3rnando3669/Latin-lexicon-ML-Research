Sure, let's break down the task of classifying the given statement step by step according to the framework we've established.

**Step 1: Understanding the Task (IDA)**
- The task is to classify the statement "Everyone else is doing it, so should you." as one of the specified defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

**Step 2: Break Down and Analyze the Statement**
- Read the statement carefully: "Everyone else is doing it, so should you."
- Identify the logical structure and any implied reasoning.

**Step 3: Recall the Definitions**
- <G>: Generalization - Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
- <FE>: False Enumeration - Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
- <IR>: Inappropriate Reason - Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- <RR>: Redundant Reason - Appears as a new reason but says the same thing as the proposition using different words.
- <WCB>: Weak Causal Basis - Offering a causal basis not compelling enough.
- <FU>: False Universals - Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
- <DEP>: Double-Edged Phrases - Using statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.

**Step 4: Match the Statement Against Each Argument Type**
- "Everyone else is doing it, so should you."
  - <G>: The statement does not claim a general truth based on a specific instance.
  - <FE>: It does not list options.
  - <IR>: The reason given (everyone else is doing it) is not inappropriate per the provided definitions.
  - <RR>: It is not restating the same idea with different words.
  - <WCB>: There is no causal relationship being offered.
  - <FU>: The statement appeals to popularity or the fact that many people do something as an attempted form of validation. It asserts that because everyone else is doing something, it is a valid reason for doing it without further proof.

**Step 5: Conclusion**
- The statement "Everyone else is doing it, so should you." fits the definition of <FU>: False Universals.

Thus, applying <IDAA> to "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" results in the classification as <FU>.
