For 
To apply <IDAA> to "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong," we need to decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps and then execute those steps. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Understand the Argument**: Identify the core proposition and the supporting reason.
   - Proposition: "Get Verizon."
   - Supporting Reason: "1 billion people can't be wrong."

2. **Identify the Nature of the Claim and the Reasoning**:
   - The argument attempts to persuade the audience to choose Verizon based on the popularity among 1 billion people.

3. **Match the Argument to Defined Defective Argument Types**:
   - <G>: The argument does not generalize from a specific instance to make a universal claim.
   - <FE>: The argument is not listing limited or excessive options.
   - <IR>: The reasoning is not inappropriate in the sense that it is not irrelevant to the proposition.
   - <RR>: The argument is not redundant in restating the same claim for support.
   - <WCB>: The reasoning is not providing a weak causal link.
   - <FU>: The argument heavily relies on the appeal to popularity without proving the inherent worth of Verizon.
   - <DEP>: The argument does not contain double-edged phrases open to dual interpretations.

4. **Classify the Argument Based on Analysis**:
   - Based on step 3, the argument fits the definition of <FU> (False Universals), as it appeals to the popularity of Verizon ("1 billion people can't be wrong") to validate the choice without providing substantive proof or reasoning about Verizon's specific benefits.

Therefore, the argument "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong" can be classified as of type <FU> (False Universals).
