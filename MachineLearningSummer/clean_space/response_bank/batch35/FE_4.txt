Sure, let's decompose the task of classifying the statement "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today." using the approach defined by IDAA.

**Step 1: Understand the meaning of the provided string.**
- The statement "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today."

**Step 2: Identify the key components or structure of the argument presented.**
- The statement seems to provide an expression of a preconceived notion about someone's character based on attendance in class.

**Step 3: Analyze the logical relationship between the components.**
- The two components of the statement are: 
  1. "I thought you were a good person"
  2. "but you weren’t in class today."
- The use of "but" suggests that the second part is being used to challenge or contradict the first part.

**Step 4: Determine if the reason provided appropriately supports the conclusion or point being made.**
- Here, the point being made is that the person's good character is being questioned because they did not attend class.

**Step 5: Compare the structure and logical relationship with the definitions of defective argument types.**
- Type <G>: This doesn't fit since it’s not a generalization based on a specific instance but a specific instance being used to challenge a personal attribute.
- Type <FE>: This doesn’t involve enumerating options.
- Type <IR>: This seems to fit because the reason ("you weren’t in class today") does not logically support the proposition ("I thought you were a good person").
- Type <RR>: This doesn't fit as there is no redundancy in the reasoning.
- Type <WCB>: This isn't about weak causal basis.
- Type <FU>: This isn't claiming any universal truth.
- Type <DEP>: This doesn’t involve double-edged phrases.

**Step 6: Classify the statement based on the closest fitting defective argument type.**
- The statement "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today." is classified as <IR> (Inappropriate Reason).

By following these steps, we decomposed the advanced task <t> of classifying the argument <s> into specific steps, leading us to determine that the statement falls under the defective argument type <IR>.
