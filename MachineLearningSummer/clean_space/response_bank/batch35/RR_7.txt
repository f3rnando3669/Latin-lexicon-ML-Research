For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given interaction, we will decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps and then execute those steps. Here are the steps we will follow:

1. **Identify the argument and its components**: Determine the main proposition and the supporting reason.
2. **Check each defective argument type**: Evaluate whether the argument fits into any of the predefined defective argument types.
3. **Conclude the classification**: Based on the evaluation, class the argument into the appropriate defective argument type.

Step-by-step decomposition of <IDA>:

1. **Identify the argument and its components**:
   - Main proposition: The Bible should be trusted.
   - Supporting reason: Because itâ€™s the Word of God.
   - Evidence for the reason: God tells us it is.
   - Source of evidence: The Bible itself.

2. **Check each defective argument type**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: This type claims a general truth based on a specific instance. This doesn't apply here.
   - **False Enumeration (FE)**: This type involves listing fewer or more options than actually exist. This doesn't apply here.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**: This type involves providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition. This might partly apply because simply stating the authority of the Bible as God's Word without external validation could be seen as inappropriate.
   - **Redundant Reason (RR)**: This type involves redundancy in reasoning. This might apply because the speaker uses the Bible to prove the Bible, effectively saying the same thing in different words.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**: This type involves offering a causal basis that is not compelling enough. This may not be the strongest fit here since the argument isn't about causality.
   - **False Universals (FU)**: This type involves asserting universally agreed points without proof. This doesn't exactly apply here.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**: This type refers to statements open to dual interpretations. This doesn't apply here.

3. **Conclude the classification**:
   - The argument fits best under **Redundant Reason (RR)** because Speaker 1 is using the Bible to prove the Bible, which is essentially restating the proposition in different words.

So, after applying <IDAA>, we classify the given argument as <RR>.
