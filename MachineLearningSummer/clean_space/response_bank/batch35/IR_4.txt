For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string, we first need to decompose the task of classifying the string as of type <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP> into specific steps. Here are the steps:

### Steps for Decomposing the Task (<D>):

1. **Understand the Definition of Each Type**: Review the definitions of each defective argument type to ensure clear understanding.
2. **Identify Key Elements**: Extract key elements or phrases in the string that may indicate specific defective argument types.
3. **Match Elements to Definitions**: Compare the key elements with the characteristics of each defined defective argument type.
4. **Classify the Argument**: Determine which defective argument type best fits the characteristics identified in the string.

### Applying the Steps (<IDAA>):

#### Step 1: Understand the Definition of Each Type
- **Generalization (<G>)**: Broad general truths based on specific instances.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Listing fewer or more options than exist.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Reasons that donâ€™t logically support the proposition.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Reasons that restate the proposition in different words.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Causal basis not strong enough to support the proposition.
- **False Universals (<FU>)**: Universally agreed points without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Statements open to dual interpretations.

#### Step 2: Identify Key Elements
Extracting key portions of the given text:
- "argument for the existence of God"
- "Due to the understanding of nature through science"
- "arguments that used to be used for God (or gods) were abandoned"
- "replaced with new ones"
- "origin of life"
- "classic argument from ignorance"
- "may have a scientific answer"
- "origin of life argument will fade away"

#### Step 3: Match Elements to Definitions
- **Key Elements**: The argument shifts as understanding increases, implying that arguments are abandoned as new information becomes available, with new arguments taking their place.
- **False Universals (<FU>)**: This type asserts universally agreed points without proof.
- **Potential <FU> Clues**: The text suggests that arguments for God's existence shift and change as scientific understanding progresses.

#### Step 4: Classify the Argument
- **Potential Classification**: 
  - This passage seems to describe how arguments for the existence of God change over time due to increased scientific knowledge, potentially replacing one weak argument with another as new information becomes available.
  
Even though it describes a logical fallacy in the context of shifting arguments (moving the goalposts), this text does not neatly fit into the predefined categories of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>. It instead provides an analysis of the ongoing changes in arguments about God's existence without making a specific defective argument itself.

Since there's no direct claim fitting the previously defined defective argument types, we could consider if this prose is engaging in any kind of generalization or misrepresentation.
- **No Defective Argument Detected**: The text does not present a defective argument type as defined by <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>, but instead provides an explanation of a broader concept (moving the goalposts).

### Conclusion
The string provided is an explanation of the moving the goalposts fallacy rather than an example fitting into any of the specified defective argument types. It analyzes the nature of shifting arguments rather than making a specific claim identified by <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>. 

Thus, there is no classification under <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP> for this specific string.
