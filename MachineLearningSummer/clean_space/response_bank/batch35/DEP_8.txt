For 
To begin with <IDAA>, the application of <D> (the decomposition of an advanced task) to <IDA> (the task of classifying a string as one of the specified defective argument types), we follow these steps:

1. **Identify the components of the task (IDA):**
   - **Understand the given string:** We need to comprehend what the string is saying.
   - **Recognize potential fallacies:** Determine if the string demonstrates characteristics of any defined faulty argument types.
   - **Compare with fallacy definitions:** Match the identified characteristics of the string with the definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

2. **Break down the string:**
   - The string is: "Science shows us that improved quality of life comes through research and invention."

3. **Analyze the components of the string:**
   - **Subject:** "Science"
   - **Claim:** "improved quality of life comes through research and invention."

4. **Determine if there is a faulty argument type:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** Does the string claim a general truth based on a specific instance?
     - It does not seem to generalize from a specific instance.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Does it list fewer or more options than actually exist?
     - It does not enumerate options.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Does the reason provided logically support the proposition?
     - The reason (science shows us) somewhat supports the conclusion (improved quality of life through research and invention), and seems logically relevant.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Is a reason presented as new but just restates the proposition differently?
     - There is no redundant reasoning in the statement.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Is there a compelling causal basis for the proposition?
     - The causal basis (research and invention leading to an improved quality of life) appears relatively strong and widely accepted, not weak.
   - **False Universals (<FU>):** Does the string assert universals without proof?
     - The string states "Science shows us," which implies empirical support, not an unproven universal claim.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Are statements open to dual interpretations potentially against the speaker?
     - There do not appear to be statements with dual interpretations.

5. **Match the analysis with the fallacy types:**
   - **No defective argument type identified:** As none of the definitions for <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP> match the string.

**Conclusion:**
- The string "Science shows us that improved quality of life comes through research and invention." does not seem to fit any of the specified defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

Therefore, based on the defined task <IDA> and using decomposition <D>, this string does not fall under any of the listed defective arguments. The result is that it does not classify as <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.
