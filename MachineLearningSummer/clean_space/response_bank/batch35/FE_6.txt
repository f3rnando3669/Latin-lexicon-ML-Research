For 
To apply the process of IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying the defective argument type into specific steps) to the statement "You are either with God or against him," we follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Given Argument
- The statement "You are either with God or against him" presents two extreme positions; it implies that there are no other alternatives.

### Step 2: Identify Potential Defective Argument Types
- Review the definitions of defective argument types to see which might apply:
  - **Generalization (<G>)**: Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
  - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
  - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
  - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Appears to present a new reason but says the same thing as the proposition using different words.
  - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Offers a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
  - **False Universals (<FU>)**: Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
  - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Uses statements open to dual interpretations.

### Step 3: Evaluate the Argument Against the Definitions
- **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement is not an instance of generalization based on a specific case.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement "You are either with God or against him" clearly limits the options to two, implying there are no alternative positions. This fits the definition of False Enumeration, as it lists fewer options than actually exist.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: The statement does not provide a reason, so it doesnâ€™t fit this category.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: The statement is not redundant as it does not restate the same proposition in different words.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: There is no cause-and-effect relationship that needs evaluation.
- **False Universals (<FU>)**: The statement does not assert a universally agreed point without proof; rather, it presents a binary choice.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: There are no dual interpretations presented in this statement.

### Step 4: Conclusion
Given the evaluation, the defective argument type best represented by the statement "You are either with God or against him" is:

**<FE> False Enumeration**

The statement falsely limits the options available, presenting a situation as having only two mutually exclusive choices when, in reality, there may be other alternatives.
