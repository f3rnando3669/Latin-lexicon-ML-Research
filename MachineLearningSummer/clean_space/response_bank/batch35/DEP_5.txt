To classify the given string "The officer told me to freeze but it was too hot out to be freezing, so I was justified in running away." according to the specified defective argument types, we will apply the process of decomposition <D> to the classification task <IDA>, creating <IDAA>. Here’s the structured approach:

### Step 1: Understand the Argument
Break down the argument to identify its structure and key components.

**Argument Breakdown:**
- The officer issued a command: to freeze.
- The responder interpreted "freeze" literally in the context of temperature.
- The responder’s action: running away.
- The justification: the literal interpretation of the word "freeze" due to the hot weather.

### Step 2: Identify the Core Proposition
Determine the main proposition or claim in the argument.

**Core Proposition:**
- "I was justified in running away."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Supporting Reason
Analyze the reason provided to support the proposition.

**Supporting Reason:**
- "The officer told me to freeze but it was too hot out to be freezing."

### Step 4: Check for Logical Consistency
Assess whether the reason logically supports the proposition.

### Step 5: Compare with Defined Defective Argument Types
Match the argument's structure to the definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>:

- **Generalization (<G>):** No general rule is being created from a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>):** No limited listing of options.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** The reason doesn't logically support "running away is justified" based on the officer's command to "freeze", which is meant as to stop moving, not to do with temperature.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Not repeating the proposition in different words.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The reason given involves a flawed interpretation of the command, not necessarily an argument of weak causality.
- **False Universals (<FU>):** No universal truths asserted without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** The interpretation of "freeze" in two ways (literal temperature vs. command to stop movement) signifies a dual interpretation used to justify inappropriate behavior.

### Step 6: Make the Final Classification 
Based on the above analysis, classify the argument:

**Classification:**
- The given argument falls under **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)** because it uses a statement ("freeze") open to dual interpretations (literal temperature vs. command to stop movement), misinterpreting the command in context to justify an action.

**Correct Classification: <DEP>**

This step-by-step decomposition and analysis demonstrate the application of <IDAA> to the given string.
