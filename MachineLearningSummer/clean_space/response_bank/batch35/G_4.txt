For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposing the task of identifying logical fallacies into specific steps) to the given statement, we'll follow a structured approach to classify the logical fallacy present.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition to Classify the Fallacy:

**Step 1: Understand the Statement**
- Statement: "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess, all the other classes will all fail it, too."
- Break it down: The speaker is making a claim about all classes based on the performance of three kids in one class.

**Step 2: Identify Key Components of the Logical Fallacy**
- Specific Instance: Three kids failing the quiz in one class.
- Generalization: All other classes will fail the quiz.

**Step 3: Match the Components to Defined Fallacies**
- Check if it fits the criteria for each defined fallacy:
  - **<G> (Generalization):** Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
    - The speaker generalizes the failure of three kids in one class to all the other classes.
  - **<FE> (False Enumeration):** Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
    - Not applicable here as no options are being listed.
  - **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason):** Providing a reason that doesnâ€™t logically support the proposition.
    - The given reason (three kids failing) is used to support a broader conclusion, but it directly supports a generalized claim rather than a logically disconnected one.
  - **<RR> (Redundant Reason):** Presenting a new reason but saying the same thing as the proposition using different words.
    - Not applicable as it does not restate the proposition.
  - **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis):** Offering a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
    - There is no causal relationship given here.
  - **<FU> (False Universals):** Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
    - Not applicable as no universal agreement is being asserted.
  - **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases):** Using statements open to dual interpretations.
    - Not applicable as there is no dual interpretation present.

**Step 4: Confirm the Best Fit**
- The best fit here is **<G> (Generalization)**, because the speaker draws a broad conclusion about all classes based on the specific instance of three kids failing in one class.

### Conclusion:
Applying IDAA, the statement "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess, all the other classes will all fail it, too." is classified as having the logical fallacy type **<G> (Generalization)**.
