For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "Your honor, while my son may have made a bad decision that night while under the influence of alcohol, it shouldn't affect the rest of his life. It was just one mistake. He's on the varsity swim team.", we need to take the following steps:

### Step 1: Identify the statement's argument.
The statement presents an argument that the son's bad decision under the influence of alcohol should not have lasting consequences on his life. The reasons provided include:

1. It was just one mistake.
2. He's on the varsity swim team.

### Step 2: Analyze each reason provided.
Let's break down the argument and assess the logical coherence of each reason:

- **Reason 1: "It was just one mistake."**
    - This reason argues that because the action was singular, it should not have a long-term impact.
  
- **Reason 2: "He's on the varsity swim team."**
    - This reason implies that his athletic achievements should mitigate the consequences of his mistake.

### Step 3: Determine the logical connection between the reasons and the argument.
We need to evaluate whether the reasons logically support the conclusion that the son's mistake should not have lasting consequences.

- **Reason 1 Analysis:**
    - The claim that it was just one mistake attempts to minimize the severity by focusing on its singularity. This could be seen as an attempt to generalize the leniency for a specific instance.
  
- **Reason 2 Analysis:**
    - The achievement of being on the varsity swim team is used as a reason why the decision should not have long-term consequences. However, being on a swim team does not logically absolve someone from the consequences of their actions.

### Step 4: Classify the argument type.
Based on our analysis, we observe:

- **Reason 1** fall under <G> (Generalization). It generalizes that a single mistake should not have lasting consequences.
- **Reason 2** fall under <IR> (Inappropriate Reason). Athletic achievements do not logically relate to the appropriateness of consequences for a mistake.

### Step 5: Conclusion
Given that the argument uses both types <G> and <IR>, but we should classify it primarily based on the prominence of the reasoning.

The dominant defective argument type in this case appears to be <IR> (Inappropriate Reason), as it clearly and directly presents a reason (varsity swim team membership) that does not logically support the proposition (minimizing the consequence of the mistake).

### Final Classification
**<IR> - Inappropriate Reason**
