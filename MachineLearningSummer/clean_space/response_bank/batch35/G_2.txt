To apply <IDAA> to the string "The teenagers were rude and disrespectful therefore all teenagers are rude and disrespectful," we will decompose the classification task into specific steps. Here's the step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Understand the Argument in the String
- Examine the structure of the argument.
- Identify the specific instance and the generalization being made.

### Step 2: Identify the Types of Defective Argument
- List all the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).
- Compare the structure identified in Step 1 to the definitions provided for each defective argument type.

### Step 3: Match the Argument to Its Defective Type
- Determine which defective argument type best fits the identified structure.

### Step 1: Understand the Argument in the String
The string provided is: "The teenagers were rude and disrespectful therefore all teenagers are rude and disrespectful."
- Specific instance: "The teenagers were rude and disrespectful."
- Generalization: "All teenagers are rude and disrespectful."

### Step 2: Identify the Types of Defective Argument
Here are the defined defective argument types and their definitions:
- <G>: Generalization - claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
- <FE>: False Enumeration - listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
- <IR>: Inappropriate Reason - providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- <RR>: Redundant Reason - presenting a reason that is actually saying the same thing as the proposition.
- <WCB>: Weak Causal Basis - offering a weak causal basis that doesn't sufficiently support the proposition.
- <FU>: False Universals - asserting universally agreed points without proof.
- <DEP>: Double-Edged Phrases - using statements open to dual interpretations.

### Step 3: Match the Argument to Its Defective Type
- The argument in the string fits the definition of <G> (Generalization) because it claims a general truth ("All teenagers are rude and disrespectful") based on a specific instance ("The teenagers were rude and disrespectful").

### Conclusion
The string "The teenagers were rude and disrespectful therefore all teenagers are rude and disrespectful" is classified as <G> (Generalization).

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the string leads us to classify it as type <G>.
