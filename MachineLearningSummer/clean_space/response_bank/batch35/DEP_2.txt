For 
To apply the <IDAA> (the task of decomposing the task of classifying argument types into specific steps) to the given string, we'll break down the process into steps and execute them methodically.

### Step 1: Understand the scenario and dialogue
#### Given:
- **Speaker 1:** We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change.
- **Speaker 2:** Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people.

### Step 2: Identify the elements of the conversation
- **Speaker 1's Proposition:** Using thousands of people to help spread the word about social injustice is a positive action.
- **Speaker 2's Proposition:** Rejecting participation because it’s wrong to “use” people.

### Step 3: Determine whether the argument provided by Speaker 2 logically supports or opposes Speaker 1's proposition
#### Analysis:
- **Speaker 2's Argument:** "I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people" does not logically oppose the activism Speaker 1 is suggesting. The implication suggests misuse of the term "use" in an incorrect or misleading way that does not align with the common understanding of the context given by Speaker 1.

### Step 4: Classify the argument type of Speaker 2
#### Possible classifications (based on provided definitions):
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
  - The belief that it’s wrong to “use” people doesn't logically address the argument that these people are volunteers participating in spreading social awareness.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Using statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.
  - The term "use" in this context is interpreted in a different, morally incorrect way by Speaker 2.

### Step 5: Determine the most fitting classification
The argument type most fitting:
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Speaker 2's argument misinterprets the context of "using" people in a manner that does not logically address the intent of Speaker 1. Speaker 1 refers to organizational efforts using manpower for a cause, while Speaker 2 interprets it as exploiting people.

### Conclusion
Classify the string as:
**<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**
