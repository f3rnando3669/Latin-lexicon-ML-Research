For 
Applying <IDAA> involves decomposing the task of classifying the string as one of the defined defective argument types. Here are the specific steps:

1. **Analyze the string to understand its core proposition.**
   - The core proposition is: "My 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty."

2. **Identify the reasoning or evidence provided to support the proposition.**
   - The reasoning provided is: "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up."

3. **Assess the logical connection between the reasoning and the proposition.**
   - The claim connects a specific instance of wrongdoing by the Catholic Church to an individual who is simply a member of that Church.

4. **Compare the logical structure of the argument to the defined defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>).**
   - <G> (Generalization): Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - <FE> (False Enumeration): Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - <IR> (Inappropriate Reason): Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
   - <RR> (Redundant Reason): Presents a new reason but says the same thing as the proposition using different words.
   - <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis): Offers a weak causal basis for the proposition.
   - <FU> (False Universals): Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
   - <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases): Uses statements open to dual interpretations.

5. **Determine which defective argument type best fits the logical structure.**
   - The argument essentially claims a general truth (guilt by association) about a specific individual based on a reported wrongdoing by an organization they are associated with.

6. **Classify the string.**
   - The argument is best classified as a <G> (Generalization) because it generalizes the guilt from a specific instance of wrongdoing (by the Catholic Church) to an individual member of that Church without direct evidence of this individual's involvement.

So, the classification of the string "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!" is <G> (Generalization).
