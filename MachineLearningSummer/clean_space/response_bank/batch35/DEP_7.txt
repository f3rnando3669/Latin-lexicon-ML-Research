For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given argument "The police said they suspect several people of setting the fire. Therefore, I can't be under suspicion because I was alone all night.", we will decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps. Here is the step-by-step decomposition and process:

1. **Identify the Proposition and Reasoning:**
   - Proposition: "I can't be under suspicion."
   - Reasoning: "The police said they suspect several people of setting the fire" and "I was alone all night."

2. **Evaluate the Reasoning for Logical Consistency:**
   - Analyze whether the reasoning logically supports the proposition.

3. **Compare with Defined Defective Argument Types:**
   - Examine each type (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) to see which one matches the identified logical inconsistency.

4. **Determine the Best Match:**
   - Based on the analysis, determine which type best describes the logical fallacy in the argument.

Let's apply these steps:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition and Reasoning**
- **Proposition:** "I can't be under suspicion."
- **Reasoning:** "The police said they suspect several people of setting the fire" and "I was alone all night."

**Step 2: Evaluate the Reasoning for Logical Consistency**
- The reasoning here is that because the police suspect several people, the speaker believes they cannot be under suspicion themselves because they were alone.

**Step 3: Compare with Defined Defective Argument Types**

1. **Generalization (G):** Claims a general truth based on a specific instance. The reasoning isn't making a broad generalization.
2. **False Enumeration (FE):** Lists fewer or more options than actually exist. This reasoning doesn’t seem to limit the suspect pool explicitly.
3. **Inappropriate Reason (IR):** Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition. There is a clear lack of logical connection between being alone and not being a suspect when multiple people are suspected.
4. **Redundant Reason (RR):** Repeats the same thing as the proposition. This is not merely rephrasing the proposition.
5. **Weak Causal Basis (WCB):** Offers a weak causal link. While there are elements of weak reasoning, it is more of an inappropriate reason.
6. **False Universals (FU):** Asserts universally agreed points without proof. This isn't trying to assert a universally accepted principle.
7. **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP):** Uses statements open to dual interpretations. This isn’t using ambiguous statements.

**Step 4: Determine the Best Match**
- The reasoning provided ("I can't be under suspicion because I was alone all night" despite the police stating they suspect several people) doesn't logically follow. It assumes that being alone automatically excludes someone from suspicion when multiple people are suspected. This reasoning is clearly faulty.

The best match for this fallacy is **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)** because the reason given (being alone) does not logically support the proposition (not being under suspicion).

### Conclusion
The argument "The police said they suspect several people of setting the fire. Therefore, I can't be under suspicion because I was alone all night." is an instance of **<IR>**: Inappropriate Reason.
