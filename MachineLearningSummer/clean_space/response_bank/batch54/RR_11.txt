To apply the process of decomposing and classifying the statement "Filthy and polluting coal should be banned." (denoted as IDAA) into specific defective argument types (IDA), we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The Proposition is the assertion or claim that is being made. In this case, the proposition is:
- "<P>: Filthy and polluting coal should be banned."

### Step 2: Identify and Analyze the Reason (<R>)
Examine whether a reason has been offered in support of the proposition. The statement does not explicitly provide a reason, but we can infer the likely reason:
- "<R>: Coal is filthy and polluting."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
Look for corroborative evidence or arguments that support the reason. In this case, there's no explicit proof provided in the statement, but it's expected that further support or evidence might be supplied in a more detailed argument.

### Step 4: Classify <P>, <R>, and <PR> for Defective Arguments
We will now classify the components into the defective argument types.

#### Classification of <P>:
- There's no indication that the proposition is a **Generalization (G)**, as it doesn't generalize based on limited instances.

- The proposition doesn't qualify as an **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** because it makes a straightforward claim without attempting to enumerate possibilities.

#### Classification of <R>:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason given is that coal is "filthy and polluting". This reason might not conclusively justify banning coal without additional context or evidence about why these characteristics alone necessitate a ban.  
  Classification: <IR>

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The reason that coal should be banned because it's "filthy and polluting" could be deemed an insufficient causal basis. The statement doesn't address other potential factors like economic impact, alternatives, or the feasibility of a ban.  
  Classification: <WCB>

- The reason is not classified as **Repetition of Proposition (RR)** since it doesn't merely repeat the proposition.

#### Classification of <PR>:
Assuming there were more detailed arguments or evidence presented, we can anticipate the potential issues:
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: If the argument were to assume that everyone universally agrees that coal is "filthy and polluting" and should therefore be banned, this would be a presumptuous consensus.  
  Potential Classification: <FU>

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: If there are multiple interpretations of what "filthy" and "polluting" mean, this could lead to ambiguity. However, in this specific statement, it seems less likely without further context.  
  Potential Classification: <DEP>

### Step 5: Conclusion
We consolidate our classifications:

- The Proposition (<P>) does not present a Generalization or Incomplete Enumeration.
- The Reason (<R>) provided can be classified as **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
- Depending on how Proof of Reason (<PR>) would be presented, potential classifications could include **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** and **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**.

### Summary of Defective Argument Classifications:
- **<IR>**: The reason could be inconclusive.
- **<WCB>**: The reason might have an insufficient causal basis.
- Potential: **<FU>** and **<DEP>** if further details provide such indications.

By carefully analyzing the given statement, we have systematically classified its components into relevant defective argument types using the IDAA method.
