For 
To apply the process of **IDAA** to classify the argument "Starbucks is the best because it's expensive," we need to decompose the task **IDA** step by step according to our definitions. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step breakdown of the task:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The proposition **P** is the main assertion or claim being made in the argument.
- **P:** "Starbucks is the best"

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason **R** is the causal basis or rationale provided to establish the truth of **P**.
- **R:** "because it's expensive"

### Step 3: Evaluate the argument against each type of defective argument
We need to examine whether the argument fits any of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP).

**Generalization (G):**
- Does the argument make a claim based on a part and apply it to all?
- Here, there is no indication that a small part is being generalized to all.

**Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
- Is the argument making a claim that it considered all possibilities without actually doing so?
- The argument does not explicitly attempt to enumerate all possibilities.

**Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
- Does the reason provided conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
- The reason "it's expensive" does not conclusively demonstrate that "Starbucks is the best." Costliness does not inherently equate to overall quality or superiority.

**Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
- Is the causal basis compelling enough?
- The causal basis here is weak. Expense alone is not a compelling reason to establish that something is the best.

**Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
- Does the reason restate the proposition instead of providing a basis for it?
- The reason "it's expensive" does not restate the proposition "Starbucks is the best."

**Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
- Is the proof of reason based on assumed universal agreement?
- There is no indication here that the proof is relying on a universal consensus.

**Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
- Can the proof of reason be taken in another sense than intended?
- The language in this argument is not ambiguous; it is clear that the reason being provided is the expense.

### Step 4: Final Classification
Based on the evaluation, the argument "Starbucks is the best because it's expensive" appears to fit under both **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
- **IR:** The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition.
- **WCB:** The causal basis (being expensive) is not a compelling justification to establish that Starbucks is the best.

Thus, the argument "Starbucks is the best because it's expensive" is classifiable under both **IR** and **WCB** based on the definitions provided.
