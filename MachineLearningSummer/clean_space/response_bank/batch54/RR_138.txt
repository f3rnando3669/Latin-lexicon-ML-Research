For 
To apply IDAA to the dialogue provided, we need to decompose IDA into specific steps and then follow those steps to classify the string as one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Steps for IDA (Task of Classifying the Argument):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - A proposition is a statement of what the speaker intends to prove.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - A reason is the basis presented to establish the truth of the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - A proof of reason is additional evidence to support the reason.

4. **Classify the Argument:**
   - Analyze the argument to see if it matches any of the defective argument types defined as <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Applied IDA Steps to the Dialogue:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition by Speaker 1: "Jesus was not really crucified."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason provided by Speaker 1: "Because the Quran says so."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - First Proof of Reason provided by Speaker 1: "Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true."
   - Second Proof of Reason provided by Speaker 1: "Because God tells us so, here in the Koran."

4. **Classify the Argument:**
   - The initial claim ("Jesus was not really crucified") is based on the reasoning that the Quran says so.
   - When asked how we know the Quran is correct, the argument loops back to asserting the Quran's truth by stating it is the Word of God and everything it says is true.
   - This continually loops back without providing additional evidence outside of the Quran itself.

The circular nature of the reasoning suggests a specific defective argument. The Reason (<R>) that the Quran says so is mirrored by Proof of Reason (<PR>) that also points back to the Quran's inherent truth, causing an endless loop.

### Classification:
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
  - The reason given ("The Quran says so") is essentially repeated in the proof of reason ("The Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true"). This is an example of <RR>, where the reason and proof of reason do not add new information but rather restate the proposition in slightly different terms.

### Conclusion:
The dialogue provided is classified as a faulty argument based on **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**.
