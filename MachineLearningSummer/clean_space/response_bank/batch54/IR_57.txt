For 
To apply IDAA, we need to perform the decomposition (D) of the task of classifying the given string (IDA). Here’s the step-by-step process:

### Decomposition (D) of Task IDA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Determine the main claim or assertion being made.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Identify the causal basis or reasoning provided to support the Proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - Look for any additional arguments or evidence provided to support the Reason.

4. **Classify the Argument as Defective:**
   - Analyze the identified parts to determine if they suffer from any of the recognized defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP).

### Application of Decomposition (D) to "IDA":

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - "Ghosts must be real, and spiritualism must be true."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - "My philosophy professor believes in ghosts and goes to séances."
   - "She’s an intelligent, educated person."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - The PR is implied by pointing to the professor's intelligence and education as proof that her beliefs must be correct.

4. **Classify the Argument as Defective (IDA):**
   - **Identify if the argument is a type of Generalization (G):**
     - Not applicable here, since the assertion is not based on a part/majority but refers to the professor’s beliefs.
   
   - **Identify if the argument is a type of Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
     - Not applicable, no enumeration of possibilities is claimed here.

   - **Identify if the argument is a type of Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
     - Yes, the reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate that ghosts and spiritualism are real. Just because someone is intelligent and educated doesn’t mean all their beliefs are accurate.

   - **Identify if the argument is a type of Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
     - There is an insufficient basis provided; the fact someone intelligent believes in something doesn’t serve as strong evidence for its truth.

   - **Identify if the argument is a type of Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
     - Not applicable.

   - **Identify if the argument is a type of Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
     - Not applicable. There’s no claim of universal agreement.

   - **Identify if the argument is a type of Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
     - Not applicable.

Based on the analysis, the defective argument types that apply to this string are:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis (the professor's intelligence and education) provided for the Proposition is not compelling.

### Conclusion:
The argument "My philosophy professor believes in ghosts and goes to séances. She’s an intelligent, educated person, so ghosts must be real, and spiritualism must be true." is defective and falls under the categories of Inconclusive Reason (IR) and Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).
