For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to the string "The word of Zorbo the Great is flawless and perfect. We know this because it says so in The Great and Infallible Book of Zorbo’s Best and Most Truest Things that are Definitely True and Should Not Ever Be Questioned," we need to follow a structured process of decomposing the string into specific steps to classify the argument type. 

**Step-by-Step Decomposition:**

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( \text{P} \)):**
   - The proposition is the statement we intend to prove. Here, the assertion being made is:
     - "The word of Zorbo the Great is flawless and perfect."

2. **Identify the Reason (\( \text{R} \)):**
   - The reason is the basis for the proposition provided to establish its truth. In this case, the reason given is:
     - "We know this because it says so in The Great and Infallible Book of Zorbo’s Best and Most Truest Things that are Definitely True and Should Not Ever Be Questioned."

3. **Check for Defective Types:**
   - **Generalization (\( \text{G} \)):** Not applicable as it doesn't involve generalizing from a part to the whole.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (\( \text{FE} \)):** Not applicable as there is no enumeration of possibilities here.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (\( \text{IR} \)):** Not directly applicable as the reason isn't inherently inconclusive but requires further inspection.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( \text{WCB} \)):** Not primarily applicable as the causal connection between \( \text{P} \) and \( \text{R} \) needs analysis.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( \text{RR} \)):** This is applicable if \( \text{R} \) simply restates \( \text{P} \).

4. **Analyze the Reason (\( \text{R} \)) for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( \text{RR} \)):**
   - The reason ("because it says so in The Great and Infallible Book of Zorbo’s Best and Most Truest Things that are Definitely True and Should Not Ever Be Questioned") essentially states that Zorbo's words are flawless because Zorbo or a writing claimed by Zorbo says so.
   - This reason does not provide new evidence but rather reiterates the original claim made by the proposition that Zorbo’s word is perfect because Zorbo (presumably) asserts this perfection.

5. **Classify the Argument:**
   - The argument here is circular and fails to provide a new external reason apart from the initial claim. Therefore, it best fits the category of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( \text{RR} \))**.

**Conclusion:**
By decomposing the task \( \text{IDA} \) step-by-step, we classify the argument in the string as **\( \text{RR} \) (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**.
