To apply the process of IDAA (the decomposition of the classification task into specific steps) to the given string "God exists. How do you know? Because it says so in the Bible," we need to decompose the task of identifying the fallacy in the argument into specific steps. Below is the step-by-step analysis:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for IDAA

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P) and Reason (R)
- **Proposition (P)**: "God exists."
- **Reason (R)**: "Because it says so in the Bible."

#### Step 2: Analyze the Reason (R)
- Determine if the Reason provides a causal basis for the Proposition.
  
#### Step 3: Determine if the Reason is a Repetition (RR)
- Check if the Reason merely restates the Proposition without providing additional justification.

#### Step 4: Validate the Reason with Respect to General Fallacies Types
- Determine whether the Reason fits into one of the identified defective argument types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

### Application of Steps to the Example

#### Step 1: Proposition (P) and Reason (R)
- **Proposition**: "God exists."
- **Reason**: "Because it says so in the Bible."

#### Step 2: Analyze the Reason (R)
- The Reason (R) states that the proposition is true because it is mentioned in a particular text (the Bible). This needs to establish the causal basis (the Bible's authority or reliability).

#### Step 3: Determine if the Reason is a Repetition (RR)
- The Reason (R) is essentially relying on the authority of the Bible to justify the Proposition (P), without providing external validation or additional arguments that extend beyond the assertion itself.

#### Step 4: Validate the Reason with Respect to General Fallacies Types
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The Reason ("...because it says so in the Bible") does not provide new evidence or reasoning, but rather restates the assertion by deferring to a text whose authority is itself part of the question at hand. This suggests a circular reasoning or begging the question type of fallacy where the proof offered (the Bible) assumes the truth of what it is supposed to prove (God exists).

#### Conclusion
- The argument "God exists. How do you know? Because it says so in the Bible." can be classified as a **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** because the Reason offered essentially mirrors the Proposition without independent substantiating proof, thus failing to establish a compelling causal basis.

Through this step-by-step application of IDAA, we have decomposed the classification task and identified the defective argument type as RR.
