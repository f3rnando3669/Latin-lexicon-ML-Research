### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDAA

To apply the concept of IDAA to the argument string provided, we'll follow a structured decomposition approach. Here are the steps we will undertake:

1. **Identify the Propositions and Reasons**:
    - Break down the given string into potential propositions (P) and reasons (R).
    - Assess the components to determine if they fit the definitions provided.

2. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types**:
    - Using the definitions provided, classify each part of the string as one of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP).

3. **Classify the Argument**:
    - Based on the definitions and analysis, assign the appropriate defective argument type to the string.

### Step 1: Identify the Propositions and Reasons

Let's break down the string:

**String**: "In the space of a couple of days, Alastair Campbell has managed to turn an argument about the way the government presented its case for war in Iraq into an entirely different dispute about the way the BBC covered what was going on in Whitehall at the time."

- **Proposition (P)**: "Alastair Campbell has managed to turn an argument about the way the government presented its case for war in Iraq into an entirely different dispute about the way the BBC covered what was going on in Whitehall at the time."
  
- **Implicit Reason (R)**: The cause provided here is implicit â€” that there was a shift in focus instigated by actions taken by Alastair Campbell.

### Step 2: Analyze for Defective Argument Types

Now, we'll scrutinize the argument against each defective type:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This doesn't apply since the string is not asserting something about all cases from a single case.
  
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This also doesn't apply; the argument isn't about making a complete list of possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided is implicit but stated in a way that does not conclusively prove the proposition. The switch of argument could be because of other factors not discussed.
  
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal link provided between Alastair Campbell's actions and the change in dispute is weak as it doesn't compel the truth of the proposition fully.
  
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason is not simply a repetition of the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument does not claim universal agreement as a basis.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language doesn't seem ambiguous in a way that affects the understanding significantly.

### Step 3: Classify the Argument

Based on the analyses above, the following defective argument types are relevant:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Because the argument about the change in dispute doesn't conclusively demonstrate why the shift happened, only that it did.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The reason (which is implicit) for the switch in dispute isn't compellingly demonstrated. It's weak as it does not fully establish why Alastair Campbell's actions led to this new focus.

### Conclusion

Therefore, the argument string: "In the space of a couple of days, Alastair Campbell has managed to turn an argument about the way the government presented its case for war in Iraq into an entirely different dispute about the way the BBC covered what was going on in Whitehall at the time."

Can best be classified primarily as **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** with a touch of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
