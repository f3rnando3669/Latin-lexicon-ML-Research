To apply the decomposition of the task of identifying a defective argument to the given string, we will break it down into specific steps.

### Step 1: Analyze the Structure of the Statement

1. **Identify** the Proposition (\<P\>):
   - **Proposition**: "Filthy, polluting hummers should be banned." 

2. **Identify** the Reason (\<R\>) (if present):
   - There is no explicit reason (\<R\>) provided in the statement. 

### Step 2: Check for Possible Defective Argument Types

Given the possible defective argument types, we need to determine if the statement falls under any of these categories:

- **Generalization (\<G\>)**: Does the proposition make a broad assertion based on limited data?
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)**: Is there a claim of completeness that misses some possibilities?
- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**: Does the reason fail to conclusively support the proposition?
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**: Is the causal basis weak or uncompelling?
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)**: Does the reason merely repeat the proposition?
- **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)**: Is something assumed to be true because it is "universally agreed upon"?
- **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)**: Is the language used ambiguous or unclear?

### Step 3: Determine If the Statement Matches Any Defective Argument Types

- **Generalization (\<G\>)**: The statement makes a broad assertion about "hummers" being "filthy" and "polluting" without providing specific data or evidence. This can indicate a generalization based on possibly limited observation. 

- **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)**: The statement does not claim to list all possibilities, so it does not seem to fall under incomplete enumeration.

- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**: There is no explicit reason given, so inconclusive reason does not apply directly here.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**: Since no explicit causal reason is provided, we cannot evaluate the sufficiency of the causal basis.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)**: There is no reason presented that merely repeats the proposition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)**: The statement does not claim something based on universal agreement.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)**: The term "filthy" and "polluting" are somewhat subjective but not exactly ambiguous in the technical sense.

### Conclusion

The statement "Filthy, polluting hummers should be banned" most closely resembles a **Generalization (\<G\>)**. This is because it makes a broad claim about hummers being "filthy" and "polluting" without providing specific evidence or data, suggesting an overgeneralization based on possibly limited evidence.

Thus, the fallacy in the statement is most appropriately categorized as **Generalization (\<G\>)**.
