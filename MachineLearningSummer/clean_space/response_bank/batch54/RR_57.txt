For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of a task into specific steps) to IDA (the task of classifying a string as one of several defective argument types), we will follow the steps outlined below to determine which category "The Bible is the Word of God because God tells us it is... in the Bible." fits into:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P> and Reason <R>
- **Proposition (<P>):** "The Bible is the Word of God."
- **Reason (<R>):** "Because God tells us it is... in the Bible."

### Step 2: Analyze the Reason <R> in the context of the Proposition <P>
- **Reason analysis:** The reason given is that God tells us that the Bible is the Word of God, and the support for this reason is that this declaration is found within the Bible itself.

### Step 3: Determine if the Reason <R> is one of the defective argument types
#### Review the definitions of defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** Not applicable as there is no generalization based on a part or majority being applied to all.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Not applicable as there is no claim of a complete enumeration of possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Not directly applicable here as we are focusing more on the circular nature rather than whether the reason conclusively demonstrates correctness.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Partially relevant but can be discussed later if no better fit is found.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Applicable here as the reason given is essentially a restatement of the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Not applicable as there is no assertion of universal agreement.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Not applicable as ambiguity is not the critical issue here.

### Step 4: Classify the defective argument type
- Given the definitions and the analysis, the defective argument type that best matches the given string is **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**. The reason is essentially a restatement of the proposition, saying the same thing in different words but not providing any new evidence outside the initial claim.

### Conclusion
By following the decomposition steps outlined, we can classify the string "The Bible is the Word of God because God tells us it is... in the Bible." as a defective argument of type **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**.
