Applying IDAA to "America keeps telling China to be more respecting of journalism, but why don't they stop the American propaganda first?" involves decomposing the task of classifying the argument into specific steps. Here’s how we can break it down:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)

The Proposition (<P>) is the assertion or claim that the argument is making. In this case, the proposition can be interpreted as:
"America should stop its propaganda before telling China to respect journalism."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)

The Reason (<R>) is the causal basis for the Proposition, which is why the speaker believes <P> to be true. Here, the Reason (<R>) is:
"America engages in propaganda."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)

The Proof of Reason (<PR>) would be any additional support or arguments that corroborate the Reason. In this context, the statement does not provide explicit additional evidence or argument supporting the Reason. It assumes the Reason is self-evident.

### Step 4: Classify any Defective Arguments

Given the definitions of defective argument types, we need to determine if the argument falls into one of these categories. Here are the steps for classification:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**
   - The argument does not rely on a generalization from one part to the whole; it makes a comparative statement about two entities (America and China).

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
   - The argument does not claim to have enumerated all possibilities; it focuses on a comparative relationship.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
   - Consider if the Reason (<R>) really supports the Proposition (<P>). In this case, the claim that America engages in propaganda does not necessarily negate America's ability to call for press freedom in China. Hence, <R> does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of <P>.
   - This fits the definition of an inconclusive reason, as the justification (America's propaganda) does not logically prove the proposition (that America should stop telling China to respect journalism).

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**
   - The Reason does not merely repeat the Proposition; it provides a distinct assertion.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
   - The causal basis is weak because the presence of American propaganda is not a compelling reason why America cannot call for journalistic freedom elsewhere. This aligns with the argument type, as the causal link is not compelling enough.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
   - The argument does not claim universal agreement to prove its Reason.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**
   - The language used in the argument does not appear to be ambiguous.

### Step 5: Determine the Most Applicable Defective Argument Type

Both <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) seem to apply, but we need to choose the most fitting one. Given the argument states a Reason that doesn't sufficiently support the Proposition, **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** is a clearer fit in this context.

### Conclusion

Based on the above analysis, the classification of the argument "America keeps telling China to be more respecting of journalism, but why don't they stop the American propaganda first?" is of type <WCB> – Insufficient Causal Basis.
