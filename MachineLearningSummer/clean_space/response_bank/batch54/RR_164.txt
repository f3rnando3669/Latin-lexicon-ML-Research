For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "The Cardinals are the best football team because they're better than all the other teams," we need to break down the task of identifying the type of defective argument (IDA) into specific steps (D). Here's a step-by-step decomposition (D) of the task:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
First, identify the proposition or main claim (P) in the statement.
   
   - Proposition (P): "The Cardinals are the best football team."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
Next, identify the reason (R) given to support the proposition.

   - Reason (R): "because they're better than all the other teams."

### Step 3: Analyze the Reason for Completeness and Adequacy
Evaluate the reason to see if it adequately supports the proposition and whether it introduces any fallacies.

### Step 4: Classify the Reason Based on the Known Defective Argument Types
Compare the reason against the predefined types of defective arguments: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

**1. Generalization (G):** Does the reason make a sweeping generalization based on incomplete data?
**2. Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Does the reason falsely claim completeness by missing out on other factors or possibilities?
**3. Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
**4. Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the reason based on a weak or non-compelling causal relationship?
**5. Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Does the reason merely restate the proposition without adding new information?
**6. Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Does the reason rely on an assumed consensus that is actually in dispute?
**7. Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Is the reason ambiguous or open to interpretation in a way that could change its meaning?

### Step 5: Make the Classification
Evaluate the provided statement against each of the defective argument types to make the classification.

#### Application of Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Proposition (P):** "The Cardinals are the best football team."
2. **Reason (R):** "because they're better than all the other teams."

   Analyzing the reason:

   - The reason "because they're better than all the other teams" asserts a comparative superiority without providing specific arguments, evidence, or criteria for evaluation.
   - It does not introduce additional supporting facts or data that conclusively demonstrate the proposition.
   - The reason is simply a restatement of the proposition with slightly altered wording.

**Classification: Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
   
The argument falls under "Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)." The reason provided essentially repeats the proposition in different terms, without introducing any substantive evidence or causal explanation. It says the same thing as the proposition: the Cardinals are better without explaining why.
