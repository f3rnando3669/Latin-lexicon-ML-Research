For 
To apply **IDAA** (the application of the decomposition of the task of classifying an argument as of a particular defective argument type) to the statement "Murder is morally wrong. Therefore, abortion is morally wrong," we will need to follow specific steps to logically analyze and classify this argument.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Application

1. **Identify the components of the argument:**
   - **Proposition (<P>):** "Abortion is morally wrong."
   - **Reason (<R>):** "Murder is morally wrong."

2. **Assess the components:**

   - **Proposition (<P>):** We need to determine whether "Abortion is morally wrong" is based on the Reason provided.
   - **Reason (<R>):** We need to assess the relevance and strength of "Murder is morally wrong" as a reason to establish that "Abortion is morally wrong."

3. **Evaluate the logical connection between <P> and <R>:**

   - Is the Reason (<R>) sufficient to conclusively establish the Proposition (<P>)?
   - Are there potential logical fallacies or assumptions within the Reason and its application to the Proposition?

4. **Identify the defective argument type:**

   - **Generalization (<G>):** Does this argument make an unwarranted generalization from one case to another?
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Does this argument omit other possibilities that should be considered?
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Does the Reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition?
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Is the causal basis (the reason) for the Proposition not compelling enough?
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Does the Reason merely restate the Proposition without providing a new basis?
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Is there an assumption that the Reason is universally agreed upon, when it is still in dispute?
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Is the Proof of Reason ambiguous or can it be taken in another sense?

### Application to "Murder is morally wrong. Therefore, abortion is morally wrong":

1. **Identify components:**
    - **Proposition (<P>):** "Abortion is morally wrong."
    - **Reason (<R>):** "Murder is morally wrong."

2. **Assess components:**
   - **Proposition (P):** "Abortion is morally wrong" is clearly stated.
   - **Reason (R):** "Murder is morally wrong" is the given basis to support the Proposition.

3. **Evaluate the logical connection:**
   - The argument equates murder with abortion on moral grounds. Both involve taking a life, but the contexts and legal/social considerations can differ significantly.
   - The Reason does not address why abortion, specifically, fits the same moral context as murder without additional arguments.

4. **Identify the defective argument type:**

   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The Reason "Murder is morally wrong" does not conclusively demonstrate that "Abortion is morally wrong." The connection between the two premises is asserted but not substantiated with compelling evidence or reasoning. The argument assumes without further proof that abortion falls under the same moral category as murder.

### Classification:

Based on this step-by-step analysis, the given argument "Murder is morally wrong. Therefore, abortion is morally wrong" is classified as an **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**.

The Reason provided (murder being morally wrong) does not conclusively establish the Proposition (abortion being morally wrong) without further justification that specifically addresses why abortion should be treated in the same moral framework as murder.
