For 
To apply \( IDAA \) to the string "I must be telling the truth, since I’m not lying." we'll decompose the task of classifying the string into defective argument types into specific steps. This will be done by employing \( D \), the decomposition process. Here are the steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of \( IDA \):
1. **Identify the components**: Determine the \( P \) (Proposition) and \( R \) (Reason) in the given argument.
2. **Evaluate the \( P \)**: Determine if the \( P \) suffers from any of the defective argument types related to generalization or incomplete enumeration.
3. **Evaluate the \( R \)**: Analyze the \( R \) to check for any weaknesses such as inconclusive reason, insufficient causal basis, or faulty repetition of proposition.
4. **Examine the \( PR \)**: If applicable, analyze the proof of reason and check for any defects, including presumptuous consensus or ambiguous language use.
5. **Classify**: Based on the defects found in the steps above, classify the argument into one of \( G \), \( FE \), \( IR \), \( WCB \), \( RR \), \( FU \), or \( DEP \).

### Applying \( IDAA \) to "I must be telling the truth, since I’m not lying.":

#### Step 1: Identify the components
- **\( P \) (Proposition)**: "I must be telling the truth"
- **\( R \) (Reason)**: "since I’m not lying"

#### Step 2: Evaluate the \( P \)
- The \( P \) does not suffer from defects related to generalization (\( G \)) or incomplete enumeration (\( FE \)), as it does not involve those kinds of assertions.

#### Step 3: Evaluate the \( R \)
- \( R \) does not suffer from an inconclusive reason (\( IR \)), because "not lying" does, in itself, relate to "telling the truth." However, it does not add any additional substantive reasoning beyond the \( P \).
- The argument suffers from faulty repetition of proposition (\( RR \)), because the reason ("I'm not lying") restates the proposition in different words without adding new evidence or a new perspective. It essentially says the same thing twice.

#### Step 4: Examine the \( PR \)
- There is no additional \( PR \) (Proof of Reason) provided in this argument to evaluate for defects like presumptuous consensus (\( FU \)) or ambiguous language use (\( DEP \)).

#### Step 5: Classify
- Based on the analysis, the argument primarily suffers from faulty repetition of proposition (\( RR \)).

### Conclusion:
When we apply \( IDAA \) to the string "I must be telling the truth, since I’m not lying.", we classify the argument as an instance of \( RR \) (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
