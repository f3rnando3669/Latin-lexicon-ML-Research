To apply the process of <IDAA> to classify the argument as one of the defective argument types, we'll break down the task into specific steps. 

### Decomposition Steps (<D>):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine the central assertion or claim being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the justification or causal basis provided for the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Identify any additional arguments or evidence offered to support the reason.
4. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types**: Evaluate the argument based on the defined defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

### Application to the Given Argument:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - The proposition in Person 1's statement is: "I am for raising the minimum wage in our state."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Person 1 does not provide a reason in their statement, so we focus on Person 2's response.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - There is no clear proof of reason provided as the argument from Person 2 does not provide evidence; rather, it is a form of rebuttal.

4. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: Not applicable here as there is no sweeping statement made by taking a part as a whole.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not applicable as no enumeration of possibilities is presented.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This could be applicable if the reason provided by Person 2 does not suffice to counter Person 1’s proposition, but Person 2 isn’t addressing the proposition directly.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Potentially relevant, but Person 2 does not offer a weak causal basis; rather, they offer an ad hominem attack.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Not applicable as there is no repetition of the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Not applicable as Person 2’s statement does not assume consensus.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Not applicable as the language isn’t ambiguous per se, but its relevance is questionable.

Therefore, **none** of the provided defective argument types perfectly match the given argument directly. However, introducing a concept not previously classified:

5. **Ad Hominem Fallacy**: Person 2's response is an attack on Person 1's intelligence ("she is not smart enough to even run a business") rather than addressing the proposition about raising the minimum wage.

Thus, the defective nature of this argument falls outside the types provided but can be identified as an **ad hominem fallacy**.

### Conclusion:
While the predefined defective argument types do not fit perfectly, the argument demonstrates a common logical fallacy: **ad hominem**. This fallacy attacks the person making the argument rather than addressing the content of the argument itself.
