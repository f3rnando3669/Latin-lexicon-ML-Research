For 
To apply the process of IDAA to the given statement "All hunting is inhumane and should be outlawed," we need to decompose the classification task into specific steps. Here's how the decomposition (D) followed by the application (IDAA) can be performed:

### Decomposition (D) of IDA into Specific Steps:

1. **Identify Proposition (P):** Determine the main assertion or claim being made.
2. **Identify Reason (R):** Determine the causal basis or reasons provided for the proposition.
3. **Identify Proof of Reason (PR):** Determine any supporting arguments or evidence corroborating the reason.
4. **Evaluate Generalization (G):** Check if the proposition is a generalization based on an insufficient or non-representative subset.
5. **Evaluate Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Check if the proposition claims completeness but overlooks pertinent possibilities.
6. **Evaluate Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Check if the reasons presented do not conclusively support the proposition.
7. **Evaluate Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Check if the causal basis provided is not compelling.
8. **Evaluate Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Check if the reason presented merely repeats the proposition.
9. **Evaluate Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Check if a proof of reason assumes consensus on a disputed point.
10. **Evaluate Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Check if the language used in the proof of reason is ambiguous or can be misinterpreted.

### Application (IDAA) to "All hunting is inhumane and should be outlawed":

1. **Identify Proposition (P):**
   - Proposition (P): "All hunting is inhumane and should be outlawed."

2. **Identify Reason (R):**
   - The statement does not explicitly provide a reason (R).

3. **Identify Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - There is no explicit proof of reason (PR) provided in the statement.

4. **Evaluate Generalization (G):**
   - The statement uses the word "all," suggesting an assertion that may not apply to every instance of hunting. This is a generalization that may not account for cases where hunting is regulated, humane, or necessary for ecological balance.
   - **Conclusion:** This argument appears to be of type <G> (Generalization).

5. **Evaluate Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - The claim does not enumerate the specific contexts or conditions under which hunting is evaluated to be inhumane, potentially overlooking scenarios where hunting practices vary widely.
   - **Conclusion:** This argument could also be of type <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration).

6. **Evaluate Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - No reason is given within the statement itself; thus, it does not provide a basis to evaluate whether reasons are inconclusive.
   - **Conclusion:** Not applicable as no reason is stated.

7. **Evaluate Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - As no reason is provided, there is no basis to establish if the causal basis is insufficient.
   - **Conclusion:** Not applicable as no reason is stated.

8. **Evaluate Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - No reason is provided that repeats the proposition.
   - **Conclusion:** Not applicable as no reason is stated.

9. **Evaluate Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - The statement does not appeal to universal agreement as its proof.
   - **Conclusion:** Not applicable.

10. **Evaluate Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
    - The term "inhumane" can be subjective and interpreted in varying ways depending on ethical perspectives; however, without further context, it's hard to definitively classify it as ambiguous language use.
    - **Conclusion:** Possibly applicable but lacks strong indication without further context.

### Final Classification:
The argument "All hunting is inhumane and should be outlawed" primarily falls into types:

- **<G> (Generalization),** due to the sweeping assertion without accounting for individual differences.
- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration),** as it does not consider or specify the full range of hunting practices and their varying contexts.

Based on IDAA, the statement is classified as a defective argument primarily due to Generalization and Incomplete Enumeration.
