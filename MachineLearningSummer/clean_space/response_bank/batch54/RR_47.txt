To apply the process of decomposing the task of classifying the string "Honesty is defined as always being honest." into specific steps, let's carefully breakdown the advanced task (IDA) into manageable components. 

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine the main statement or assertion that is being made.
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the causal basis or the rationale provided to justify the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Determine if there are any additional arguments or evidence provided that support the reason.

4. **Evaluate for Defects**: Check if any of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP) apply. This involves:
    - Determining if the argument is a generalization (G).
    - Checking for incomplete enumeration (FE).
    - Evaluating the conclusiveness of the reason (IR).
    - Assessing the strength of the causal basis (WCB).
    - Identifying any repetition of the proposition (RR).
    - Checking for presumptuous consensus (FU).
    - Identifying ambiguous language use (DEP).

### Applying IDAA to "Honesty is defined as always being honest.":

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**
   - Proposition (<P>): "Honesty is defined as always being honest."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**
   - Reason (<R>): Here, it seems that the proposition is being used as its own reason, which does not provide any substantial causal basis or rationale.

**Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**
   - Proof of Reason (<PR>): There doesn't appear to be any additional arguments or proof provided to support the reason. It is a simple assertion without further corroboration.

**Step 4: Evaluate for Defects**

   - **Generalization (G)**: Does not apply since itâ€™s not making a general claim based on a part or majority.
   
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Does not apply as it is not attempting to list possibilities.
   
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Does not apply directly. There is no separate reason given that could be inconclusive.
   
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Could apply, but the issue is more specific than just a weak causal basis.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This definitely applies. The Reason is essentially a restatement of the Proposition. There is no additional explanation or justification being provided; the statement is just circular.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Does not apply as there is no appeal to universal agreement.
   
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Does not directly apply as there is no alternate interpretation suggested by ambiguous language in this context.

**Conclusion: The given argument "Honesty is defined as always being honest." is an example of <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).**

Thus, the classification of the string (s) using IDAA is that it falls into the category of:
<RR> - Faulty Repetition of Proposition.
