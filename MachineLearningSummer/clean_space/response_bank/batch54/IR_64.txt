To apply the process of decomposing the task of identifying a defective argument \(<IDA>\) into specific steps and then applying it to the given string, we will follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>) of <IDA>:
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Determine the main claim or assertion being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Identify any causal basis provided for the main claim.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Look for any additional arguments that corroborate the reason.
4. **Classify the Defective Argument:** Using the definitions provided (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>), classify the defective argument type.

### Application of the Decomposition to the Given Sentence:
Let's apply the decomposition steps to the given string: 

"My wife wants to talk about cleaning out the garage, so I asked her what she wants to do with our patio furniture. Now she’s shopping for new patio furniture and not asking me about the garage."

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The main assertion here appears to be "My wife wants to talk about cleaning out the garage, so I asked her what she wants to do with our patio furniture."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The causal basis given for the proposition is "My wife wants to talk about cleaning out the garage." The implicit reasoning appears to be, "if I ask her about the patio furniture, she will stop asking about the garage."

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
The additional argument that corroborates the reason is "Now she’s shopping for new patio furniture and not asking me about the garage." 

#### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument
Let's analyze if any defective argument types apply:

- **Generalization (<G>):** The argument does not generalize an assertion to all based on a part or majority. It is specific to the wife's behavior.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument does not claim a complete list of possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason provided (asking about patio furniture to avoid talking about the garage) might not conclusively demonstrate that she will stop asking about the garage; hence, it seems inconclusive.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The reason does seem weak as the causal link between asking about the patio furniture and stopping the discussion about the garage is not compelling.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason is not a repetition of the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** There is no claim of universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The language does not appear ambiguous.

The argument seems to fall under both <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis). The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition, and the causal link is weak.

Thus, the sentence "My wife wants to talk about cleaning out the garage, so I asked her what she wants to do with our patio furniture. Now she’s shopping for new patio furniture and not asking me about the garage." is classified as both <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
