For 
To apply the IDAA (application of decomposition to argument identification) to the given string "I know that what I experience is real because I can see, hear, smell, touch and taste everything,‚Äù we'll break down the task of classifying the string as one of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP) into specific steps. The steps can be framed as follows:

1. **Identify the Proposition \(P\)**:
   - Determine what is being asserted or claimed in the argument.
   
2. **Identify the Reason \(R\)**:
   - Determine the causal basis or justification provided for the Proposition.
   
3. **Analyze the Completeness and Conclusiveness of \(R\)** to \(P\)**:
   - Check if the Reason sufficiently and conclusively supports the Proposition.

4. **Classify the Argument as per Defective Argument Types**:
   - Determine if the argument fits any of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

Let's decompose and analyze the string step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The proposition in the argument is:
- "I know that what I experience is real."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason provided to support the proposition is:
- "Because I can see, hear, smell, touch, and taste everything."

### Step 3: Analyze the Completeness and Conclusiveness of \(R\) to \(P\)
- **Completeness**: The reason mentions different sensory experiences (sight, hearing, smell, touch, taste).
- **Conclusiveness**: The argument suggests that because one has sensory experiences, what is experienced is real.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument as per Defective Argument Types

#### Generalization (G)
- The argument does not generalize the claim from a subset to the whole, so it does not fit into the Generalization (G) category.

#### Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
- The argument enumerates several senses (sight, hearing, smell, touch, taste) but claims completeness ("everything").
- The argument does **not** make an explicit claim of enumerating all possibilities of how one can know something is real; it's more about senses.

#### Inconclusive Reason (IR)
- The Reason (R) provided does not conclusively establish the correctness of the Proposition (P). Sensory experience alone is argued to confirm reality without addressing potential reasons senses might be deceived or limited.
- This fits the type as the argument lacks a conclusive linkage.

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
- The Reason (R) could be seen as insufficient since it doesn't account for illusions, dreams, or other sensory errors.

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
- The Reason (R) does not simply repeat the Proposition (P); it provides sensory evidence, so it doesn't fit here.

#### Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
- There's no presumption of universal agreement; it's a personal claim.

#### Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)
- The terms don't interpret in an alternative way that could apply here.

Given this breakdown, the argument best fits:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the reason provided (senses) does not conclusively prove the Proposition (that what is experienced through senses is real).

**Final Classification**:
- **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**
