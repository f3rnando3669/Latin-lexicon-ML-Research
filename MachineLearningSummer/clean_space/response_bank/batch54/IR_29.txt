For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given statement and classify it as one of the defective argument types, we need to decompose the classification task <IDA> into specific steps. Here's the detailed decomposition and application process:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>) of the Task:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Pinpoint what the statement is trying to prove or assert.
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Determine the causal basis or the rationale provided to support the proposition.
   
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - Check for additional arguments that corroborate the Reason.
   
4. **Check for Defective Argument Types**:
   - **<G>**: Is the Proposition a generalization?
   - **<FE>**: Is there an incomplete enumeration of possibilities in the Proposition?
   - **<IR>**: Does the Reason inconclusively demonstrate the Proposition?
   - **<WCB>**: Is the Reason based on an insufficient causal basis?
   - **<RR>**: Does the Reason merely repeat the Proposition?
   - **<FU>**: Is there a presumptuous consensus presented in the Proof of Reason?
   - **<DEP>**: Is there ambiguous language in the Proof of Reason?

### Application of Decomposition to the Given Statement

#### Statement:
"There is a global recession and more people are becoming hungry and desperate. Crimes of theft and robbery have been increasing at an alarming rate lately. The only way to solve this problem is by reinstating the death penalty."

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- **Proposition**: "The only way to solve this problem is by reinstating the death penalty."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- **Reason**: "There is a global recession and more people are becoming hungry and desperate. Crimes of theft and robbery have been increasing at an alarming rate lately."

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- The statement does not explicitly provide additional arguments that corroborate the Reason; it directly jumps from Reason to Proposition.

#### Step 4: Check for Defective Argument Types

- **<G>: Generalization?**
  - The statement generalizes that the rise in crimes (due to the recession) can only be solved by reinstating the death penalty.
  
- **<FE>: Incomplete Enumeration?**
  - The statement does not enumerate other possible solutions to the problem, which suggests an incomplete enumeration of the possibilities.

- **<IR>: Inconclusive Reason?**
  - The economic situation and rise in crimes do not conclusively demonstrate that the death penalty is the only solution to the problem.
  
- **<WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis?**
  - The Reason provided (economic issues leading to crime) does not sufficiently establish that reinstating the death penalty is the necessary or sufficient means to solve the problem.
  
- **<RR>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition?**
  - The Reason and Proposition are not identical; hence, it doesn’t fall under this category.

- **<FU>: Presumptuous Consensus?**
  - There’s no indication of an assumed universal agreement presented as a Proof of Reason.

- **<DEP>: Ambiguous Use of Language?**
  - The language used does not have apparent ambiguous meanings that could be misinterpreted.

Based on the above analysis, the statement can primarily be classified under multiple defective argument types:
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The claim of reinstating the death penalty as the "only way" to solve the problem ignores potential alternative solutions.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasons given (economic hardship leading to crime) do not conclusively support the reinstatement of the death penalty as the solution.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal links provided (recession and crime) are not strong enough to justify the proposed solution (death penalty).

### Conclusion:
The given statement can be classified as having the defective argument types of **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**, **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
