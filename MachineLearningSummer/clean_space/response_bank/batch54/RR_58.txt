For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a string as a defective argument type) to the given statement, we need to break down the process into specific steps and then execute each step carefully. The statement to classify is: "Affirmative Action can never be fair or just. You cannot remedy one injustice by committing another."

### Step 1: Identify Key Components

1. **Proposition (P):**
    - "Affirmative Action can never be fair or just."
    
2. **Reason (R):**
    - "You cannot remedy one injustice by committing another."

### Step 2: Check for Defective Argument Types

Now we will check the statement against each defective argument type:

1. **Generalization (G):**
    - A Generalization occurs when a proposition is an assertion based on one part or on a majority of individuals, but not necessarily applicable to all.
    - Analysis:
        - The proposition ("Affirmative Action can never be fair or just.") makes a universal claim without specifying any particular evidence or instance.
        - Potential Classification: **G** (since it is a sweeping statement without specifics).

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
    - Incomplete Enumeration happens when a claim is made to have enumerated all possibilities but some are missed.
    - Analysis:
        - The statement doesn't enumerate possibilities; rather, it asserts a universal claim.
        - Conclusion: Not FE.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
    - Inconclusive Reason occurs when the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
    - Analysis:
        - The reason given ("You cannot remedy one injustice by committing another.") does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that Affirmative Action can never be fair or just.
        - Potential Classification: **IR** (since the causal basis provided is not conclusively supporting the proposition).

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
    - Insufficient Causal Basis is when the reason given is weak and not compelling.
    - Analysis:
        - The causal basis provided is a moral assertion that may be disputed and is not compelling enough to conclusively support the proposition.
        - Potential Classification: **WCB** (the reason lacks compelling evidence related directly to Affirmative Action's fairness or justice).

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
    - Faulty Repetition occurs when the reason repeats the proposition without effectively adding any new support.
    - Analysis:
        - The reason provides a different claim about remedying injustice and does not repeat the proposition verbatim.
        - Conclusion: Not RR.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
    - Presumptuous Consensus is assumed to be certain on the ground that "it is universally agreed upon."
    - Analysis:
        - No consensus or universal agreement is cited in the statement.
        - Conclusion: Not FU.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
    - Ambiguous Language Use occurs when the proof can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended.
    - Analysis:
        - There is no evident ambiguous language within the reason or the proposition.
        - Conclusion: Not DEP.

### Step 3: Determine Primary Classification

Based on our analysis, the most relevant defective argument types are:

1. **Generalization (G)**
2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

### Final Classification:
Given the nature of the statement, especially its broad and unsupported claims, the primary classification would be:

- **G** (Generalization)

Thus the final classification of "Affirmative Action can never be fair or just. You cannot remedy one injustice by committing another." is most appropriately **G**â€”Generalization.
