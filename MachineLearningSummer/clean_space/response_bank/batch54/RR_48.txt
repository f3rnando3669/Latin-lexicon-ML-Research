For 
To apply <IDAA> to the sentence "The Bible is true because God exists, and God exists because the Bible says so," we need to follow the decomposition of the task <IDA> of classifying the argument type into specific steps. Let's start by breaking down according to types of defective arguments.

**Step-by-Step Decomposition and Classification:**

1. **Identify the Argument Structure:**
   - **Proposition (<P>):** "The Bible is true."
   - **Reason (<R>):** "Because God exists."
   - **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** "God exists because the Bible says so."

2. **Analyze Each Component for Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Examine the Reason (<R>):**
     - The reason provided is "God exists." Does this conclusively establish the truth of the proposition "The Bible is true"? It appears to be trying to establish a causal relationship (God exists, hence Bible is true).

   - **Examine the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
     - The proof provided is "God exists because the Bible says so." This essentially means that the claim of God's existence is being used to support the truth of the Bible, which in turn claims the existence of God.

3. **Match Identified Issues to Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
     - **Diagnosis:** The argument essentially repeats the same claim in its proof and reason, forming a circular argument. "The Bible is true because God exists" and "God exists because the Bible says so" create a loop where each part is simply restating and relying on the other without introducing new evidence or logic.
     - The argument does not break out of this loop, rendering the reasoning as merely repeating the initial propositions.

4. **Determine if There Are Multiple Defective Types:**
   - It can initially be classified under **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** because it repeats the core assertion back and forth without independent supporting evidence.
   - It's also worth noting that this could be addressing **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the statement "Because God exists" does not conclusive demonstrate the proposition "The Bible is true," especially since its supportive proof is dependent on the same source.

**Final Classification:**
The defective argument most fittingly classifies as:
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** because the reasoning given ("The Bible is true" because "God exists", and "God exists" because "The Bible says so") reiterates the initial assertion without new proof.

Thus, we conclude that the sentence exhibits the defective argument type <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
