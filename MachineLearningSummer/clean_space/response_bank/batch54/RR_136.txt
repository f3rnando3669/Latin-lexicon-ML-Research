For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the identification task into specific steps) to the string "How do I know that Beth is the most intelligent person in our geometry class? I know because she's so smart," let's follow a systematic approach:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for IDA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P) in the string:**
   - The proposition is what we intend to prove.
   - In the given string, the Proposition (P) is: "Beth is the most intelligent person in our geometry class."

2. **Identify the Reason (R) provided in the string:**
   - The Reason is the causal basis for the Proposition.
   - In the given string, the Reason (R) is: "She's so smart."

3. **Analyze the form of Reason (R) in relation to the Proposition (P):**
   - Check if the Reason conclusively establishes the Proposition.
   - Check for any logical fallacies or defective argument characteristics defined previously (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - P: "Beth is the most intelligent person in our geometry class."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - R: "She's so smart."

3. **Analyze the Reason (R) with respect to the Proposition (P):**
   - In this case, the Reason "She's so smart" is essentially repeating the Proposition using different wording. It does not provide an independent basis to establish the truth of the Proposition.
   - Specifically, the Reason "She's so smart" does not bring any additional information or causal basis to prove that "Beth is the most intelligent person in our geometry class."

### Classification:

- The form of the Reason (R) given is faulty because it repeats the Proposition in different words without providing substantial justification or evidence.
- Therefore, this is a case of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**.

### Conclusion:

The string "How do I know that Beth is the most intelligent person in our geometry class? I know because she's so smart." is classified as a defective argument of type **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**.

This concludes the application of IDAA to the argument in the given string.
