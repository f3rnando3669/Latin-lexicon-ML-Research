For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, or DEP) to the given statement, we need to break down the classification task into specific steps and then apply each step to the statement. Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>)

1. **Proposition (<P>):**
   - "There must be objective rights and wrongs in the universe."
   
2. **Reason (<R>):**
   - "If not, how can you possibly say that torturing babies for fun could ever be right?"

### Step 2: Analyze the Argument Structure

Analyze whether the Reason (<R>) and Proof of Reason (<PR>, if any) effectively support the Proposition (<P>):

1. **Support Analysis:**
   - The Reason (<R>) is attempting to establish the Proposition by presenting an extreme example (torturing babies for fun) to emphasize the necessity of objective moral standards.

### Step 3: Classify the Statement

Compare the structure and content of the argument to each defective argument type:

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - The Proposition is not a generalization based on a part to a whole or on the majority to entirety.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - The Proposition does not claim to have made a complete enumeration of possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - This is a closer match because the Reason given— "If not, how can you possibly say that torturing babies for fun could ever be right?"—while emotionally compelling, does not conclusively demonstrate or logically prove the correctness of the Proposition that there must be objective rights and wrongs. It relies on an appeal to extreme consequences rather than providing a logically necessary connection.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - The Reason is not a mere restatement of the Proposition.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - The Reason provided is more about moral appeal than weak causal basis specifically.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - The argument does not claim universal agreement as a supporting reason.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - There is no apparent ambiguity in the language that suggests a different interpretation than the speaker’s intent.

### Step 4: Final Classification

Given the analysis, the closest classification for the defect in this argument is:

**<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):**  
The Reason doesn’t conclusively prove or establish the correctness of the Proposition. Instead, it relies on an emotional appeal to an extreme example rather than providing a logically necessary basis for the Proposition.

In summary, the defective argument in the given statement "There must be objective rights and wrongs in the universe. If not, how can you possibly say that torturing babies for fun could ever be right?" is best classified as **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**.
