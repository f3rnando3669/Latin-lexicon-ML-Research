For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the advanced task of classifying a string into specific steps) to "You should drive on the right side of the road because that is what the law says, and the law is the law," we can break down the task into smaller, more precise steps as follows:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
The proposition <P> is the assertion we intend to prove. In this case:
- **Proposition (P)**: "You should drive on the right side of the road."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
The reason <R> is the causal basis for the proposition:
- **Reason (R)**: "Because that is what the law says."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason <PR>
The proof of reason <PR> is the corroborative argument for the reason:
- **Proof of Reason (PR)**: "The law is the law."

### Step 4: Determine if <P> is a complete argument or defective
Analyze the given components to see if they fit into one of the defective argument categories:
- Check for **Generalization (G)**: Is the assertion about a part but referred to the whole? No, this is not relevant here.
- Check for **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Is there a claim of completeness but missing pertinent possibilities? Not applicable.
- Check for **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Does the reason fail to conclusively prove the proposition? Possibly, examine further.
- Check for **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Is the causal basis weak or not compelling? Possibly, examine further.
- Check for **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Does the reason merely restate the proposition? Yes, "the law is the law" is a restatement.

### Step 5: Identify the specific defective argument type
Based on the examination in Step 4:
- The reason "because that is what the law says" is an assertion about why you should drive on the right side, but the proof "the law is the law" does not add any new information; it simply repeats the idea that a law exists, without providing a compelling causal basis.

### Conclusion
The argument "You should drive on the right side of the road because that is what the law says, and the law is the law" falls under the defective argument type:
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The proof of reason is weak because it simply repeats the proposition without offering additional supportive information or causality.

Thus, the classification of the string is:
- **<RR>** (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)
