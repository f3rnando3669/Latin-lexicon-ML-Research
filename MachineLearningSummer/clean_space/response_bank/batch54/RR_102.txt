To apply the IDAA framework to the statement "My way of responding to difficult patients is by far the most ethical because no other way is so ethical and it is the only way that is completely ethical," we'll follow the steps outlined in IDAA:

### Step 1: Identify and isolate components
Firstly, we identify and isolate the components of the argument in the given statement.

1. **Proposition (P)**: Let's decipher what the proposition (what we intend to prove) is.
   - "My way of responding to difficult patients is by far the most ethical."
   
2. **Reason (R)**: Next, identify the reason (the causal basis for P).
   - "No other way is so ethical and it is the only way that is completely ethical."

3. **Proof of Reason (PR)**: Are there any additional arguments corroborating the Reason (R)?
   - In this statement, there seems to be an implied proof, but it is not providing any external evidence or detailed reasoning beyond the initial assertion.

### Step 2: Classify each component
Now, we need to determine if each component (P, R, PR) contains any defects based on the defective argument types defined: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

1. **Examining R**:
   - "No other way is so ethical" and "it is the only way that is completely ethical" are supposed to substantiate P, which claims the speaker's way is the most ethical.
   - This reason is tautological and doesn't provide a meaningful causal basis; it simply restates what the Proposition claims without additional evidence. This matches the definition of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**.

2. **Evaluating if P or R has any other defects**:
   - The Reason given does not enumerate other possible ethical ways to handle difficult patients, failing to address all possibilities and leading to a sweeping general conclusion without sufficient justification. This fits the **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** defect.
   - The language used, "most ethical" and "completely ethical," can be interpreted vaguely and could lead to ambiguity. However, in this context, it mainly supports incomplete enumeration rather than clear ambiguous language use qualifying for **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**.

### Step 3: Summarizing defects
We can now classify the statement:

- The argument contains a **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** because the reason provided does not independently substantiate the proposition and instead repeats it in different words.
- The argument can also be classified under **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** because it fails to consider other potential ethical ways sufficiently and completely.

### Conclusion
By following the framework of IDAA, we identify that the argument presented in the statement "My way of responding to difficult patients is by far the most ethical because no other way is so ethical and it is the only way that is completely ethical" is defective primarily due to RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition) and FE (Incomplete Enumeration).
