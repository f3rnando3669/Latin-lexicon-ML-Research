For 
To apply the task of IDAA (the application of the decomposition of the task into specific steps to the classification of a string), we must first decompose the task IDA into clear steps. Once we have the clear steps, we can systematically classify the given string into one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

Here are the steps we can take to perform IDA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Determine the claim that is intended to be proven.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Identify the causal basis or justification provided for the Proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - Determine the additional argument or evidence provided to corroborate the Reason.

4. **Evaluate the Reason (R):**
   - Check if the Reason appropriately supports the Proposition.

5. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - Check if the Proof of Reason appropriately supports the Reason.

6. **Classify the Defect:**
   - Based on the evaluation, classify the argument as one of the defective types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

Now, let’s apply these steps to the string: "We know he’s not lying since he says he’s telling the truth."

### Step-by-Step Evaluation:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Proposition: He’s not lying.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Reason: He says he’s telling the truth.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - Proof of Reason: None provided. The reason itself is the only evidence given.

4. **Evaluate the Reason (R):**
   - The reason given is that "He says he’s telling the truth."
   - Evaluate whether this reason appropriately supports the proposition.

5. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - There is no additional proof or evidence provided. The reason and the proposition are the same statement.

### Classification of the Defect:

- The reason provided to support the proposition is the proposition itself. This is a case where the reason does not introduce any new information but merely repeats the proposition in different words.

- Based on the definitions provided, this fits the defective argument type <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), where the Reason is weak because it says precisely the same thing as was stated in the Proposition.

### Final Classification:

- The string "We know he’s not lying since he says he’s telling the truth." can be classified as a defective argument type <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).

This completes the application of IDAA to the given string.
