For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to the given string "Flippityflu: smarter than a Floppityflip.\nFloppityflip: dumber than a Flippityflu.\n", we will decompose the task of classifying the defective argument \( \text{IDA} \) into specific steps and then follow this decomposition methodically.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (\( \text{D} \)) for \( \text{IDA} \):

1. **Identify the Propositions (<P>):**
   Extract the propositions set forth to be proven.

2. **Identify the Reasons (<R>):**
   Extract the causal basis for each proposition.

3. **Identify the Proofs of Reason (<PR>):**
   Determine if there are any additional arguments provided to support the reasons.

4. **Check for Defective Argument Types:**
   Assess the identified propositions, reasons, and proofs of reason against the types of defective arguments \( \text{G}, \text{FE}, \text{IR}, \text{RR}, \text{WCB}, \text{FU}, \text{DEP} \).

### Apply \( \text{IDAA} \):

#### Step 1: Identify the Propositions (<P>)
- **Proposition 1:** Flippityflu is smarter than a Floppityflip.
- **Proposition 2:** Floppityflip is dumber than a Flippityflu.

#### Step 2: Identify the Reasons (<R>)
- The reasons for the propositions are implicit and circular:
  - **Reason for Proposition 1:** Floppityflip is dumber than a Flippityflu.
  - **Reason for Proposition 2:** Flippityflu is smarter than a Floppityflip.

#### Step 3: Identify the Proofs of Reason (<PR>)
- No additional arguments or proofs are provided beyond the initial reasons, which are the propositions themselves.

#### Step 4: Check for Defective Argument Types
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
  - The stated reasons for each proposition repeat the respective opposite proposition without providing independent evidence or reasoning.
  - This fits the pattern of \( \text{RR} \), where the reason says precisely the same as the proposition.

\[
\boxed{RR}
\]

Thus, the given string "Flippityflu: smarter than a Floppityflip.\nFloppityflip: dumber than a Flippityflu.\n" exemplifies the defective argument type **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**.
