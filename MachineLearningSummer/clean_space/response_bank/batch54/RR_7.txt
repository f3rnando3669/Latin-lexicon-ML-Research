Let's apply IDAA, which involves decomposing the task of classifying the given string into specific steps.

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**

First, decompose the argument to identify the proposition.

In the given string: "When my parents talk to me about how important it is to learn a second language, I remind them they didn't learn another language."

- **Proposition (<P>):** "It is not important to learn a second language."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**

Next, determine the causal basis or reason for the proposition.

- **Reason (<R>):** "My parents didn't learn another language."

**Step 3: Evaluate the Reason**

Analyze the reason to see if it sufficiently establishes the truth of the proposition. Consider the following sub-steps to identify potential defects in the argument:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** Is the proposition an over-generalization?
   - It does not appear to be a generalization about a group of individuals.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Does the proposition claim completeness but miss possibilities?
   - The proposition does not seem to enumerate all possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the proposition?
   - The reason provided, "My parents didn't learn another language," doesn't conclusively demonstrate that it is not important to learn a second language for anyone. This reason is not a strong or compelling causal basis for the proposition.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Is the causal basis weak?
   - The causal basis, which is the experience of the parents, is insufficient to establish a broad claim about the importance of learning a second language.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Does the reason simply restate the proposition?
   - No, the reason does not restate the proposition; it provides an experience-based reason.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Is the proof of reason based on a presumed consensus?
   - This reason does not appeal to a universal agreement or consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Is there any ambiguous language in the proof of reason?
   - The language used is clear and straightforward.

**Step 4: Classification**

Based on the analysis:

- The main issue is that the reason "My parents didn't learn another language" is weak when used to argue that it is not important to learn a second language.
- Therefore, the argument fits the profile of a **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**, because the reason provided is not compelling enough to support the proposition.

**Conclusion**

By applying the IDAA framework, we decompose the task and classify the argument "When my parents talk to me about how important it is to learn a second language, I remind them they didn't learn another language" as of type **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
