For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task IDA into specific steps) to the classification task for the given string "Everybody loves Raymond because he is so popular. Popular people are loved by everybody," we should follow a structured approach:

### Step 1: Identify and Extract Elements of the Argument
- **Proposition (<P>):** "Everybody loves Raymond."
- **Reason (<R>):** "because he is so popular."
- **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** "Popular people are loved by everybody."

### Step 2: Match Elements to Defective Argument Types
With the key elements extracted, we now match them against the definitions of defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

#### Analyzing the Proposition (<P>):
- **<P>:** "Everybody loves Raymond."
  - This statement does not, by itself, indicate any particular defective argument type.

#### Analyzing the Reason (<R>):
- **<R>:** "because he is so popular."
  - This reason needs to be checked if it conclusively demonstrates the proposition.

#### Analyzing the Proof of Reason (<PR>):
- **<PR>:** "Popular people are loved by everybody."
- Here we identify potential issues:
  - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The <PR> essentially restates the <P> without providing additional independent support. "Everybody loves Raymond" is repeated in the sense when the reasoning shifts, "Popular people are loved by everybody" which means the same thing.
  - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The provided reason ("because he is so popular") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. Popularity does not necessarily cause everyone to love someone; it might lead to jealousy or indifference.

### Step 3: Determine the Most Appropriate Defective Argument Type
- Based on the analysis, the argument seems to be defective due to a repetition of the initial assertion in a slightly different form. This matches the definition of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**. The reason appears to be the same idea recast, not establishing a new ground for the initial assertion.

Thus, applying **IDAA** leads us to classify the given string "Everybody loves Raymond because he is so popular. Popular people are loved by everybody" as primarily of defective argument type **<RR>** (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).

Additionally, there is a hint of **<IR>** because the reason does not conclusively establish the correctness of the proposition, but the dominating defect here is the repetition.
