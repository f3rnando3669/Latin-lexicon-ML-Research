Applying the approach <IDAA> to the task of classifying the argument "Sleeping until noon is the worst thing to do because it is bad to sleep late." involves breaking down the task into specific steps and proceeding systematically. Let's decompose and solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Argument Structure
First, we need to clearly understand the components of the argument:
- **Proposition (P):** "Sleeping until noon is the worst thing to do."
- **Reason (R):** "because it is bad to sleep late."

### Step 2: Identify the Type of Defective Argument
We will now classify the argument according to the defective argument types provided, ensuring we consider the correct definition for each type:

1. **Generalization (G):** <P> makes a claim widely applicable without sufficient evidence, but in this argument, the claim "Sleeping until noon is the worst thing to do" is not strictly based on a generalized sample. Hence, <G> does not apply.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This occurs when a complete list is claimed but not provided. As the argument does not present any kind of enumeration, <FE> does not apply.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This implies <R> does not adequately support <P>. The Reason given ("it is bad to sleep late") may be a subjective or insufficient explanation but isn't decisively inconclusive yet.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Here, the reason is weak if the causal basis is inadequate. "It is bad to sleep late" is a subjective reason and not necessarily compelling, giving rise to the possibility of it being <WCB>.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This is when the reason restates the proposition. In this case, "it is bad to sleep late" seems to reiterate the same idea as "Sleeping until noon is the worst thing to do" without providing additional justification or different reasoning. Hence, the argument can fit well into the <RR> category.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This occurs when an argument is taken as valid because "everyone agrees." No such consensus is assumed here, so <FU> does not apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** This is when ambiguous language misleads or changes the meaning. "It is bad" might be seen as vague but not necessarily ambiguous enough to fit <DEP> directly.

### Step 3: Apply the Classification
Based on the structured breakdown, we can conclude that the most fitting classification for this argument is **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**, as the Reason (R) doesn't add new information or different reasoning from what is stated in the Proposition (P), essentially repeating it without further support.

### Conclusion
Therefore, applying <IDAA> to the argument "Sleeping until noon is the worst thing to do because it is bad to sleep late," we classify it as:

**<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**
