For 
Certainly! To apply \( IDAA \) to the statement "Tik Tok is popular among teens because so many of them use it," we need to decompose the task of \( IDA \) (classifying the argument defect type) into specific steps and then follow through with those steps. Here’s the decomposition (\( D \)):

1. **Identify the \( P \):** Determine the proposition, which is the statement or assertion being argued.
2. **Identify the \( R \):** Determine the reason given to support the proposition.
3. **Classify the Argument Type:** Compare the argument components to the defective argument types to identify the defect.

Let's go step-by-step.

### Step 1: Identify the \( P \)

In the statement: "Tik Tok is popular among teens because so many of them use it.", the proposition is:

**\( P \): "Tik Tok is popular among teens."**

### Step 2: Identify the \( R \)

The reason given to support the proposition is:

**\( R \): "Because so many of them use it."**

### Step 3: Classify the Argument Type

Now we compare the \( P \) and \( R \) to the defective argument types defined:

1. **\( G \): Generalization:** This doesn't seem to be just a generalization because the proposition doesn't extend a property from a part to the whole improperly.
2. **\( FE \): Incomplete Enumeration:** This doesn't apply here since the argument isn't making a claim based on an incomplete list.
3. **\( IR \): Inconclusive Reason:** This occurs when the reason does not conclusively prove the proposition. However, the reason given does directly affirm usage.
4. **\( WCB \): Insufficient Causal Basis:** This occurs when the causal basis is not compelling. The reason given (many use it) does correlate with popularity; hence, it's insufficient.
5. **\( RR \): Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** This might be applicable. Let’s see. \( R \) is essentially restating \( P \). If we rephrased \( R \): "so many use it" just rephrases "popular".
6. **\( FU \): Presumptuous Consensus:** This occurs when consensus is presumed without evidence. It's not relevant here.
7. **\( DEP \): Ambiguous Language Use:** This involves ambiguity in the meaning of words, which doesn't apply in this case.

**Given the analysis:**

- The faulty logic here is \( RR \) (Faulty Repetition of Proposition). The reason given for the supposed popularity of Tik Tok among teens merely restates the proposition in different words ("popular" vs. "many use it").

So, we classify the statement as \( RR \):

**Classification: RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**

The decomposition and classification steps are complete. The statement "Tik Tok is popular among teens because so many of them use it." has been classified as a \( RR \) type defective argument.
