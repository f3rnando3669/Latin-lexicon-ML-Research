For 
To apply \( <IDAA> \) to "The word of Zorbo the Great is flawless and perfect. We know this because it says so in The Great and Infallible Book of Zorbo's Best and Most Truest Things that are Definitely True and Should Not Ever Be Questioned," we need to break down the task of classifying the string into specific steps. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step decomposition and application:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for \( <IDA> \) (Classifying Defective Arguments):
1. **Identify the Proposition \( <P> \):**
   - What is being asserted or intended to be proven in the argument?
2. **Identify the Reason \( <R> \):**
   - What causal basis is being offered to establish the truth of the proposition?
3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason \( <PR> \):**
   - What additional arguments are provided to corroborate the reason?
4. **Classify the Defective Argument:**
   - Using definitions \( <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP> \), determine which defective argument type is present, if any.

### Application to Specific String:

1. **Identify the Proposition \( <P> \):**
   - \( <P> \): "The word of Zorbo the Great is flawless and perfect."

2. **Identify the Reason \( <R> \):**
   - \( <R> \): "We know this because it says so in The Great and Infallible Book of Zorbo's Best and Most Truest Things that are Definitely True and Should Not Ever Be Questioned."

3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason \( <PR> \):**
   - In this argument, no additional proofs or deeper reasons are provided; the Reason \( <R> \) stands alone without further supporting arguments.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument:**
   - Examine \( <P> \): "The word of Zorbo the Great is flawless and perfect."
     - It asserts the perfection of Zorbo's word.
   - Examine \( <R> \): "We know this because it says so in The Great and Infallible Book of Zorbo's Best and Most Truest Things that are Definitely True and Should Not Ever Be Questioned."
     - Here, the reason provided for knowing \( <P> \) is essentially that Zorbo's infallibility is asserted by a source that itself claims infallibility.

By evaluating the argument, we can classify it as:

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition \( <RR> \)**:
  The reason \( <R> \) for \( <P> \) ("The word of Zorbo the Great is flawless and perfect.") relies directly on a source claiming infallibility without providing independent substantiating reasons. This constitutes a form of circular reasoning, where \( <R> \) is not meaningfully different from \( <P> \).

Given this step-by-step decomposition, the string is classified as **Faulty Repetition of Proposition \( <RR> \)**.
