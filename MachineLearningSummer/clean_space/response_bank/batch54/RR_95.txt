For 
To apply the IDAA (application of decomposition to the task of classifying a string into a defective argument type) to the argument "Violent video games cause teens to be violent, because violent teens play violent video games," we first need to decompose the task IDA into specific steps. Here's the detailed decomposition and subsequent application:

### Decomposition of <IDA>:
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine what is being asserted or intended to be proved. 

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine the causal basis or the reasoning provided to support the proposition.

3. **Examine the nature of the reasoning process and the relationship between <P> and <R>:**
   - Assess whether the reasoning is conclusive, repetitive, insufficient, or suffers from any other identified defects.

4. **Classify the string:**
   - Match the string against the defective argument types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

### Application of <IDAA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**

   - Proposition (<P>): "Violent video games cause teens to be violent."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**

   - Reason (<R>): "Because violent teens play violent video games."

3. **Examine the nature of the reasoning:**

   - Here, the Reason (<R>) is attempting to establish a causative link between playing violent video games and teens becoming violent.
   - The Reason simply restates a correlation (violent teens play violent video games) but does not provide additional evidence or a causal mechanism that substantiates the claim.

4. **Classify the string:**

   - The Reason (<R>) is essentially repeating the assertion in the Proposition (<P>) without providing new evidence or additional causative reasoning.
   - This repetition where the Reason appears the same as the Proposition indicates the argument is a faulty repetition.

   Therefore, the argument fits the criteria of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**.

### Conclusion:
By following the IDAA process, we classify "Violent video games cause teens to be violent, because violent teens play violent video games." as a defective argument type: **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**.
