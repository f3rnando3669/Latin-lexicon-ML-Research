For 
Let's apply the process of decomposing the task <IDA> into specific steps (<D>) to identify the type of defective argument in the given conversation:

### Steps for Decomposition <D>:
1. **Identify the parts of the argument:** Break down the given argument into its main components: Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), and Proof of Reason (<PR>).
2. **Determine the structure and flow of reasoning:** Map out how each component leads to the next. 
3. **Evaluate each component individually:** Assess the validity of each part against the definitions provided for defective arguments.
4. **Cross-check against the types of defective arguments:** Determine which type (if any) the argument falls into by comparing it to the known defective types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

### Applying the Steps to the Given Argument:
1. **Identify the parts of the argument:**
   - **Proposition (<P>):** "You should trust the Bible because it’s the Word of God."
   - **Reason (<R>):** "Because God tells us it is."
   - **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** "Right here, in the Bible."

2. **Determine the structure and flow of reasoning:**
   - **Structure:** 
     - **Speaker 1:** You should trust the Bible (<P>)
     - **Speaker 2:** How do you know it’s the Word of God?
     - **Speaker 1:** Because God tells us it is (<R>)
     - **Speaker 2:** Where does God tell us this?
     - **Speaker 1:** Right here, in the Bible. (<PR>)

3. **Evaluate each component individually:**
   - **Proposition (<P>):** The assertion that the Bible should be trusted because it is the Word of God.
   - **Reason (<R>):** The causal basis provided is that God tells us it is the Word of God.
   - **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** The proof provided is that this assertion is written in the Bible.

4. **Cross-check against the types of defective arguments:**
   - **Compare the Reason <R> to <IR>, <WCB>, and <RR>:**
     - The Reason <R> that "God tells us it is" is checked in the Bible. 
     - However, this is circular reasoning because the Reason provided is reiterated within the content of the Proposition itself.
     - This suggests that the Reason is not providing new information; it simply restates the initial claim in a different form, leading us to suspect a **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**.

### Conclusion:
The given argument is an instance of a **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**. The Reason given for trusting the Bible is that it is the word of God, and this Reason is then "proven" by referring to the Bible itself—a circular form of reasoning that restates the Proposition instead of providing a substantive, independent reason.
