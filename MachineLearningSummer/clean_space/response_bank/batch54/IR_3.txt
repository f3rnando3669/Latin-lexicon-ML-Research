For 
To apply the process defined as <IDAA> to classify the given string as one of the defective argument types, we will decompose the task (<IDA>) into specific steps (<D>). 

Step 1: Extract the Proposition (<P>)
Identify the main assertion or proposition in the string.
- In this case, the proposition is: "Itâ€™s wrong to tax corporations."

Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Determine the reason(s) given to support the proposition.
- The reasons provided are: "think of all the money they give to charity" and "think of the costs they already pay to run their businesses."

Step 3: Evaluate the Reason (<R>)
Assess whether the reasons given appropriately support the proposition.
- We need to check if these reasons effectively establish that it's wrong to tax corporations.

Step 4: Categorize any Defective Argument (<DA>)
Determine if the argument falls into one of the defective categories:
  - <G> Generalization
  - <FE> Incomplete Enumeration
  - <IR> Inconclusive Reason
  - <RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition
  - <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis
  - <FU> Presumptuous Consensus
  - <DEP> Ambiguous Language Use

Let's analyze the reasons given:

1. "think of all the money they give to charity":
    - This reason implies that because corporations give money to charity, they should not be taxed. The charitable actions of corporations do not directly prove that taxing them is wrong.
    - This reason might be considered <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) if it does not provide a strong cause-effect relationship for the proposition.
    - It could also fall under <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) because the causal connection between charitable donations and the wrongness of taxation is weak or not compelling.

2. "think of the costs they already pay to run their businesses":
    - This reason suggests that the business expenses justify not taxing corporations. However, business expenses are a common aspect of running any business and do not necessarily prove that no taxation should be applied.
    - This reason might also fit <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) because it does not strongly prove that taxing corporations is wrong.
    - Similarly, it could fall under <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) as the causal basis is not compelling.

Upon evaluating the reasons given, it appears both reasons fail to strongly demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. Thus, the argument mainly suffers from:

**Classification: <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**

The reasons provided do not offer a compelling causal basis to prove that taxing corporations is wrong. The connection between the charitable actions or business expenses of corporations and the moral or economic justification for not taxing them is weak.
