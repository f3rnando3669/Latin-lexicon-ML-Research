For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to the string "John Green is a wonderful writer because he writes so well", we will decompose the task of identifying the defective argument type into specific steps. Here we go:

### Step-by-step Decomposition of \( \text{IDA} \)
1. **Identify the Proposition (\( \text{P} \)):**
   - The assertion or claim being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (\( \text{R} \)):**
   - The basis or rationale provided to support the Proposition.
3. **Analyze the Reason (\( \text{R} \)) and Proof of Reason (\( \text{PR} \)) if applicable:**
   - Check for common fallacies or defects in the argument.
4. **Classify the defective argument type:**
   - Compare the argument against the definitions of \( \text{G} \), \( \text{FE} \), \( \text{IR} \), \( \text{RR} \), \( \text{WCB} \), \( \text{FU} \), and \( \text{DEP} \).

### Apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to "John Green is a wonderful writer because he writes so well"

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\( \text{P} \))
- **Proposition (\( \text{P} \)):** "John Green is a wonderful writer"

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\( \text{R} \))
- **Reason (\( \text{R} \)):** "because he writes so well"

#### Step 3: Analyze the Reason (\( \text{R} \)) and Proof of Reason (\( \text{PR} \)) if applicable
- The Reason given is "because he writes so well". We need to check if this Reason is flawed based on any predefined defective argument types.

#### Step 4: Classify the defective argument type
- **Generalization (\( \text{G} \)):** Not applicable since it does not involve a generalization.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\( \text{FE} \)):** Not applicable as it doesn't involve enumerating possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (\( \text{IR} \)):** Not applicable because the Reason itself connects to the Proposition directly.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( \text{WCB} \)):** Not applicable because the Reason gives a basis, albeit identical.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( \text{RR} \)):** This appears to be applicable because the Reason ("he writes so well") is essentially restating the Proposition ("John Green is a wonderful writer") in different words.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (\( \text{FU} \)):** Not applicable for assuming consensus.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (\( \text{DEP} \)):** Not applicable as no ambiguous language is involved.

#### Conclusion:
- The defective argument type for the string "John Green is a wonderful writer because he writes so well" is **\( \text{RR} \)** (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).

In summary, the string exemplifies the defective argument type \( \text{RR} \), where the Reason presented merely restates the Proposition without providing any new or substantial proof.
