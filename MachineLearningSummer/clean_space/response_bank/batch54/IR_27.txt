For 
To apply **IDAA** to the string "Marty said that his Xbox One X had better resolution than Phil’s PS4 during their gaming console debate. Phil suddenly brought up how powerful his PC was when Marty started talking about the specs of the two gaming consoles.", we need to follow the steps of **D** to decompose the task of **IDA** into specific steps for classification.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of IDA:
1. **Identify the Proposition (P) in the string.**
2. **Identify the Reason (R) in the string.**
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR) in the string, if applicable.**
4. **Classify the argument into one of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP) based on the definitions.**

### Step-by-Step Application (IDAA):

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**
- The Proposition in the string is: "Marty said that his Xbox One X had better resolution than Phil’s PS4."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)**
- The Reason provided by Marty could be implied to revolve around the specs of their gaming consoles, but it's not explicitly stated here. The string focuses more on the debate than on a specific reason given by Marty for the better resolution claim.

**Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**
- There is no direct and explicit Proof of Reason given in this string; instead, there is a shift in topic when Phil responds.

**Step 4: Classify the defective argument type**

Evaluate the string against each defective argument type definition:
- **G (Generalization):** The string does not generalize from one part or majority to all.
- **FE (Incomplete Enumeration):** The string does not attempt a complete enumeration of possibilities.
- **IR (Inconclusive Reason):** The string does not provide a full causal basis that could be inconclusive; instead, it shifts focus.
- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis):** No causal basis is provided for the claim in the string.
- **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** The Reason is not a repetition of the Proposition.
- **FU (Presumptuous Consensus):** The string does not appeal to universal agreement.
- **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use):** The language is clear and shifts the topic rather than exhibiting ambiguity.

Given the options and definitions, the closest defective argument type is related to a shift or irrelevance in the conversation. This corresponds to:
- **IDAA Conclusion: Argument is Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because Phil's response ("how powerful his PC was") does not address Marty's initial claim about the resolution of Xbox One X vs. PS4, hence it does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness or incorrectness of the proposition (it's essentially avoiding the original argument).

Thus, applying **IDAA** to the given string concludes that the defective argument type is **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**, since Phil's sudden topic change does not address the specific proposition about the Xbox One X and PS4's resolution comparison.
