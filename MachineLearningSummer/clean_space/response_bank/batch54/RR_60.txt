To apply the process of decomposing the task of classifying the given string as a particular type of defective argument, we will break down the task into specific steps and then execute those steps one by one. Here is the step-by-step decomposition and application:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**  
First, determine what the main claim or assertion is within the string.

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**  
Secondly, identify the reason or rationale provided for the proposition.

**Step 3: Evaluate the Reason (<R>) in context to <P>**  
Determine if the reason given directly supports the proposition or if it is defective in some manner according to the definitions of defective argument types.

**Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type**  
Based on the evaluation in Step 3, classify the defect in the argument as one of the predefined types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

**Application of Decomposition Steps to the Given String:**

**Input String: "Sandra tells her mom, 'I deserve to have a later curfew, so you should let me stay out until 10pm!'"**

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**  
The Proposition (<P>) in Sandraâ€™s statement is: "I deserve to have a later curfew."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**  
The Reason (<R>) given for the Proposition is: "you should let me stay out until 10pm!"

**Step 3: Evaluate the Reason (<R>) in context to <P>**  
In evaluating, we notice that the reason given ("you should let me stay out until 10pm!") does not provide any causal basis or evidence as to why Sandra deserves a later curfew. It merely restates the desired outcome ("you should let me stay out until 10pm") without substantiating why this is justified.

**Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type**  
Based on the evaluation, it seems the Reason is simply a restatement of the Proposition. There is no additional argument or evidence provided. This type of reasoning aligns with "Faulty Repetition of Proposition" (<RR>), where the Reason merely repeats what was said in the Proposition without adding anything new or supportive.

**Conclusion:** 
The given string "Sandra tells her mom, 'I deserve to have a later curfew, so you should let me stay out until 10pm!'" is classified as <RR>, a Faulty Repetition of Proposition, since the Reason provided does not add any new rationale and simply restates the desired outcome.
