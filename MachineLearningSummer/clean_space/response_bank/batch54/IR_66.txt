For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of task decomposition, <D>, to the task of argument classification, <IDA>), we need to break down the process of analyzing the statement "4 percent of Americans believe that lizard people control politics." and classify it as one of the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

Here are the steps for decomposition (<D>):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Look into the statement and determine its principal claim or proposition.
2. **Determine the Reasoning (<R>)**:
   - Identify any causal basis or reasoning provided to support the proposition.
3. **Evaluate Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - Check if any additional arguments or evidence are provided to corroborate the reasoning.
4. **Classify Defective Argument Type**:
   - Based on the definitions of defective argument types, classify the argument as <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step-by-Step Application of <IDAA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - The proposition in the statement "4 percent of Americans believe that lizard people control politics." is essentially that "a certain percentage of people believe in the existence of lizard people controlling politics."

2. **Determine the Reasoning (<R>)**:
   - There isn't an explicit reasoning provided in the initial statement. The statement itself doesn't offer any causal basis or reasoning for why this belief might be held.

3. **Evaluate Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - The statement does not provide any corroborative arguments or evidence to support why this 4 percent believe in the claim. It's an isolated statistic without further context.

4. **Classify Defective Argument Type**:
   - The statement seems to provide statistical evidence for a belief, but it lacks complete enumeration and comprehensive reasoning for why the 4 percent figure is significant or how it represents the broader context.
   - The closest defective argument type is <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):
     - The statement implicitly suggests a complete understanding or consideration of public opinion based on a single, isolated statistic.
     - It's an incomplete enumeration because it fails to consider the broader range of possible beliefs and opinions, giving misleading importance to the 4 percent figure without a fuller analysis.

Therefore, the classification **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)** best applies to the statement "4 percent of Americans believe that lizard people control politics."
