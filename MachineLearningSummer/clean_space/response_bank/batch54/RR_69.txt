For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given argument, we need to first decompose the advanced task <t> of classifying the argument into the specific steps required. Here is the structured decomposition:

1. **Identify Proposition (<P>)**: Determine the central claim that is intended to be proven.
2. **Identify Reason (<R>)**: Identify the causal basis that is given to establish the truth of the proposition.
3. **Identify Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Highlight any additional arguments or evidence that are used to support the reason.
4. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: Check if a part, majority, or non-exhaustive set is incorrectly attributed to all.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Check if some possibilities that should be considered are missed.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Assess whether the reason fails to conclusively prove the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Determine whether the causal basis provided is weak or not compelling.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Check if the reason simply repeats the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: See if the proof of reason is assumed to be certain based on an alleged universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Identify if the proof of reason can be taken in another sense than intended.

Now we apply this systematic analysis to the given argument:

**Argument**: "We know the virus started in a lab because it's too deadly to have just been the result of basic circumstance. But it hasn't been as deadly for China which proves that it's lab-made. Because it's deadly."

### Step 1: Identify Proposition (<P>)

**Proposition (<P>)**: "The virus started in a lab."

### Step 2: Identify Reason (<R>)

**Reason (<R>)**: 
1. "It's too deadly to have just been the result of basic circumstance."
2. "It hasn't been as deadly for China."

### Step 3: Identify Proof of Reason (<PR>)

**Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: 
1. "Because it's deadly" supports the first reason but seems repetitive and insufficient.
2. The comparative observation between other places and China.

### Step 4: Analyze for Defective Argument Types

#### Generalization (<G>)
- The argument does not rely on a generalization about a part or majority being attributed to all.

#### Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- The argument does not try to enumerate all possibilities and miss out on some; rather, it sticks to a specific line of reasoning.

#### Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- The reason "It hasn't been as deadly for China" does not conclusively prove that the virus is lab-made, as there could be other factors influencing the differential impact (e.g., different public health measures).

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- The causal basis "too deadly to have just been the result of basic circumstance" is weak as it doesn't adequately support the claim without substantial additional evidence or explanation.

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
- The statement "Because it's deadly" is a repetition and doesn't add new reasoning. It restates the proposition rather than providing additional causal basis.

#### Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
- The argument does not rely on the grounds of presumed universal agreement.

#### Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)
- The argument does not exhibit ambiguity in language use.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the argument exhibits the following defective argument types:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasons provided do not conclusively prove the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The justification given for the proposition is weak.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Part of the argument repeats the proposition without adding substantive causal basis.

Thus, the string can be classified as a mix of <IR>, <WCB>, and <RR>.
