For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "Harold’s new book is well-written because Harold is a wonderful writer," we need to decompose the advanced task (identifying defective arguments) into specific steps. Here's the step-by-step decomposition of the task <IDA>, followed by applying it to the given string:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>) in the string.**

- **Proposition (<P>):** This is the claim or statement that is intended to be proven.
  - In this case: "Harold’s new book is well-written."

- **Reason (<R>):** This is the basis or rationale provided for the Proposition.
  - In this case: "Harold is a wonderful writer."

**Step 2: Examine the relationship between the <P> and <R> to determine if any defective argument types are present.**

- **Generalization (<G>):** Is the Proposition asserting something about all instances based on a subset?
  - No, the Proposition is specific to Harold’s new book.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Is the Proposition claiming completeness but missing some possibilities?
  - No, the Proposition does not claim completeness of possibilities.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Does the Reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition?
  - Possibly, but let's check other defect types first.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Is the Reason not compelling enough to support the Proposition?
  - Since "Harold is a wonderful writer" is not a robust causal basis to ensure that "Harold’s new book is well-written," this could apply. However, we need to check for more specific defects.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Does the Reason essentially restate what was said in the Proposition?
  - Yes, "Harold is a wonderful writer" essentially restates "Harold’s new book is well-written," without providing an independent Reason.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Is the Proof of Reason (if present) based on assumed universal agreement?
  - There is no explicit Proof of Reason in this statement, so this defect does not apply.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Can the Proof of Reason be interpreted in another way than intended?
  - No, there is no ambiguity in the language used.

**Step 3: Classify the string based on the defective argument types identified.**

Given the analysis, we find that the most fitting defective argument type is "Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)". The Reason ("Harold is a wonderful writer") merely repeats the claim of the Proposition ("Harold’s new book is well-written") without introducing new supportive evidence.

Thus, the classification of the string "Harold’s new book is well-written because Harold is a wonderful writer" is <RR>.
