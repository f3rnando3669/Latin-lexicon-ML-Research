Sure, let's apply the decomposition of the task of identifying defective arguments (IDAA) to classify the given statement step by step.

### Task: IDAA on the statement 
**Statement**: "I believe deeply that canceling the fashion show is the best decision. I know it is. I am very certain about it."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) for IDAA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - A proposition (P) is a part of a complete argument through which we set forth summarily what we intend to prove.
   - In this case, the proposition (P) seems to be: "Canceling the fashion show is the best decision."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - A Reason (R) sets forth the causal basis for the Proposition, establishing its truth.
   - Looking for the Reason in the statement to support (P): "I believe deeply," "I know it is," and "I am very certain about it" are expressions of personal conviction rather than an objective causal basis.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   - Proof of Reason (PR) corroborates the Reason by additional arguments.
   - In the provided statement, there is no additional argument or external proof given to support the Reason (R).

4. **Classify the Argument Type**:
   - We now apply the defective argument types to identify the nature of the argument in the statement:
     - **Generalization (G)**: Does not apply since there is no assertion based on a part or majority.
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Does not apply since there is no mention of enumerating possibilities.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: It might apply if the reason given does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: It possibly applies here, as the causal basis (personal conviction) is not compelling.
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This might apply if the Reason essentially repeats the Proposition without adding any substantial support.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Does not apply since there's no appeal to universal agreement.
     - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Does not apply since the language used is not ambiguous.

5. **Narrow Down the Defective Argument**:
   - The phrases "I believe deeply," "I know it is," and "I am very certain about it" essentially restate the Proposition "Canceling the fashion show is the best decision" with no additional proof or new information. This suggests that **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** is the appropriate defect here.

### Conclusion:
After step-by-step decomposition, we classify the given statement as an instance of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**.
