To apply the decomposition of the task of classifying the defective argument (IDA) into specific steps (D), and then to apply it to the specific argument presented, we will follow a systematic approach.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (IDAA)

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
    - What is the assertion or claim being made?
    
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
    - What is the causal basis provided for the proposition or claim?

3. **Evaluate the Reason (<R>):**
    - Determine if the reason conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the proposition.
    - Check if the reason is a valid causal basis.
    - Check for redundancy in the reason relative to the proposition.

4. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
    - Determine if the proof corroborates the reason as presented.
    - Identify any ambiguity or terms open to interpretation.
    - Check for presumptions of consensus that might not be universally agreed upon.

5. **Classify the Defective Argument:**
    - Based on the evaluation, classify the argument as one of the following types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

### Application to Example Argument

**Argument: "The Bible is the Word of God because God tells us it is... in the Bible."**

Let's apply the steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
    - Proposition (<P>): "The Bible is the Word of God."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
    - Reason (<R>): "because God tells us it is... in the Bible."

3. **Evaluate the Reason (<R>):**
    - The reason provided is that the Bible claims itself to be the Word of God. This is a form of circular reasoning where the claim and the evidence for the claim are the same.
    - There is no external or corroborative evidence provided outside the proposition itself.

4. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
    - The proof presented is internally referred within the Bible. This could lead to multiple issues such as ambiguity or presumptive consensus, but primarily, it repeats the proposition.

5. **Classify the Defective Argument:**
    - The main issue here is that the reason provided does not offer any additional substantiating evidence outside of the claim itself. This is a case of Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>).

### Conclusion

Based on the decomposition and evaluation, the argument "The Bible is the Word of God because God tells us it is... in the Bible" is best classified as a **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**. This classification arises because the reason provided is essentially a restatement of the proposition, offering no independent or external verification.
