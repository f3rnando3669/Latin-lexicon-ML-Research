To apply IDAA to classify the statement "The news is fake because so much of the news is fake," let's follow these steps for the decomposition and classification:

### Step 1: Decompose the Statement into <P>, <R>, and <PR> 
- **Proposition (<P>):** "The news is fake."
- **Reason (<R>):** "because so much of the news is fake."
  
### Step 2: Identify if the Argument Contains a <PR>
There seems to be no additional Proof of Reason provided in this argument. It simply states that the news is fake because a lot of it is fake.

### Step 3: Analyze the Reason (<R>)
We need to determine if the reason "so much of the news is fake" effectively supports the proposition that "the news is fake."

### Step 4: Match with Defective Argument Types
- **Generalization (<G>):** The argument might be trying to generalize that all news is fake based on the assertion that much of it is fake. This is a potential match.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Not applicable, as it does not involve enumerating possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This reason isn't necessarily inconclusive; it's just repetitively stating the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Not directly applicable, as the reason isn't offering a causal basis but rather an observational one.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This is a strong candidate, as the reason appears to be a restatement of the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Not applicable, as it doesn't base the argument on presumed consensus.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Not really applicable, as the language isn't particularly ambiguous.

### Step 5: Select the Best-Fit Defective Argument Type
Based on the analysis above, "The news is fake because so much of the news is fake" primarily repeats the proposition without providing additional substantial reasoning. Thus, it closely matches:

#### Classification: <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)

Therefore, by applying IDAA step by step, we classify the statement "The news is fake because so much of the news is fake" as <RR>, indicating a Faulty Repetition of Proposition.
