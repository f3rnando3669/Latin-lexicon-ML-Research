Certainly! To apply IDAA to classify the given string "It's important to argue logically because logic is an essential part of argumentation.", we need to decompose the task of classifying a defective argument into specific steps. Let's proceed with the detailed steps for IDAA:

### Step 1: Identify the Parts of the Argument

First, let's break down the sentence into its parts:

1. **Proposition (P)**: "It's important to argue logically"
2. **Reason (R)**: "because logic is an essential part of argumentation."

### Step 2: Evaluate the Type of Reason Provided (R)

We need to check if the given Reason conclusively supports the Proposition or if it falls into one of the defective argument categories.

### Step 3: Compare Against Defective Argument Types

Letâ€™s compare the Reason against each defective argument type:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument does not make a generalization based on a single or majority observation.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This argument does not enumerate possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: We need to see if "logic is an essential part of argumentation" conclusively demonstrates why "It's important to argue logically." In this case, it could be seen as simple restatement without providing deeper reasoning.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This argument may have an insufficient causal basis. Simply stating that logic is essential to argumentation does not necessarily compel that it is important to argue logically without deeper reasoning.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This seems likely. The Reason essentially repeats the Proposition without adding new information. The reason given largely restates the proposition in different words, thus failing to provide an independent Reason.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument does not appeal to universal agreement.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language used is clear and unambiguous within its context.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument Type

Given our analysis, the most fitting defective argument type for "It's important to argue logically because logic is an essential part of argumentation." is **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** because the Reason does not add substantial justification beyond what the Proposition states and instead reiterates it in different terms.

### Conclusion

Applying IDAA, we classify the string "It's important to argue logically because logic is an essential part of argumentation." as a type **RR**: Faulty Repetition of Proposition.
