Certainly, let's apply the process of IDAA to the provided string step by step. We'll start by decomposing the task of classifying the type of defective argument (IDA) into a set of specific steps (D), and then apply these steps to the given argument.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of IDA

1. **Identify Proposition (P):** Determine what the argument is intending to prove.
2. **Identify Reason (R):** Identify the causal basis given for the proposition.
3. **Evaluate Completeness of Reason (R):** Assess whether the reason provided adequately supports the proposition.
4. **Classify Defective Argument Type:**
    - **Generalization (G)**
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
    - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**

5. **Make a Classification Decision:** Based on the evaluation, classify the argument as one of the defective types.

### Applying IDAA to the Argument 

Given String: "President Bennett is an effective communicator, because he has a natural talent for speaking with people."

#### Step 1: Identify Proposition (P)

The proposition (P) is what the argument intends to prove. In this case, it is:
- **P:** "President Bennett is an effective communicator."

#### Step 2: Identify Reason (R)

The reason (R) is the causal basis provided for the proposition:
- **R:** "He has a natural talent for speaking with people."

#### Step 3: Evaluate Completeness of Reason (R)

We need to determine if the reason adequately supports the proposition. Is "having a natural talent for speaking with people" sufficient to establish that someone is an effective communicator in all relevant contexts and circumstances?

#### Step 4: Classify Defective Argument Type

- **Generalization (G):** R does not generalize P from a specific case to a more general one.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable as the argument does not enumerate possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This could be a candidate if the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This could also be relevant if the causal basis is weak (i.e., having a natural talent might not be sufficient for being an effective communicator).
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason does not simply restate the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There's no presumption that the proposition is true because "it is universally agreed upon."
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The reason does not use ambiguous language.

#### Step 5: Make a Classification Decision

Between the types IR and WCB, we need to select the most appropriate one:

- **IR:** The reason "he has a natural talent for speaking with people" does not conclusively prove that "President Bennett is an effective communicator." Having a natural talent doesn't necessarily mean one is effective in all communication situations.
- **WCB:** The causal basis is questionable or insufficient. Just having a natural talent might not cover all aspects of effective communication such as clarity, persuasiveness, and ability to tailor the message to different audiences.

Overall, both IR and WCB describe attributes of the given argument. However, **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)** seems more particular to this scenario because it directly points to the weakness in the causal link established by the reason.

### Conclusion

The argument, "President Bennett is an effective communicator, because he has a natural talent for speaking with people," can be classified as **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
