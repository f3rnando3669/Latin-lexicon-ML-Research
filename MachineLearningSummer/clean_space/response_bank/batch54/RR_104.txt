For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "J.K. Rowling is a wonderful writer because she writes so well" involves decomposing the task into specific steps to classify the argument type. Hereâ€™s how we can break it down:

### Step 1: Identify the Components of the Argument
1. **Proposition (P)**: "J.K. Rowling is a wonderful writer"
2. **Reason (R)**: "because she writes so well"

### Step 2: Analyze the Reasoning
- **Proposition (P):** This is the statement we intend to prove: "J.K. Rowling is a wonderful writer."
- **Reason (R):** This is the basis provided to support the proposition: "because she writes so well."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Reasoning (Match the Reasoning Against Defective Arguments)
1. **Generalization (G):** Is the proposition based on an assertion about a majority but not necessarily applicable to all? Not applicable here.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Does the proposition claim a complete enumeration while missing pertinent possibilities? Not applicable here.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition? Examine whether saying someone writes so well conclusively demonstrates they are a wonderful writer.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the causal basis weak or non-compelling for the proposition? This can be argued if simply writing well is not enough to be labeled as a wonderful writer.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Does the reason merely repeat the proposition in different words without adding substantial information? "J.K. Rowling is a wonderful writer" and "she writes so well" are essentially expressing the same idea.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Is there an assumption of universal agreement on something that is still in dispute? Not applicable here.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Is there ambiguity in the language used in the reason? Not directly applicable here.

### Step 4: Conclusion Based on Evaluation

The statement "J.K. Rowling is a wonderful writer because she writes so well" seems to fit the definition of Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR). The reason provided ("she writes so well") does not add significant new information to the proposition ("J.K. Rowling is a wonderful writer") and essentially repeats the same idea.

### Final Classification

- The given example "J.K. Rowling is a wonderful writer because she writes so well" is classified as a defective argument of type **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**.
