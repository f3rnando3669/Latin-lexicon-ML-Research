Sure, I'll apply the process of decomposing the task of classifying "She is good at writing because she writes words effectively." in step-by-step detail, according to the definitions provided.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of IDA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   The proposition (P) is the statement that declares what is intended to be proven.
   - In this case, P is "She is good at writing."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   The reason (R) sets forth the causal basis for P.
   - In this case, R is "because she writes words effectively."

3. **Assess the Relation between P and R**:
   - Check if R sufficiently supports and provides a causal basis for P.

4. **Classify the Argument based on the Definitions of Defective Arguments**:

   - **Generalization (G)**: Check if P is a broad assertion based on insufficient instances.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Check if P claims completeness but is missing some possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Check if R does not conclusively prove P.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Check if R is not a compelling causal basis for P.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Check if R is just a repetition or rephrasing of P.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Check if R is assumed to be true based on disputed consensus.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Check if PR uses ambiguous or misleading language.

Now, let’s apply these steps to classify the given string:

### Step-by-Step Application of IDAA:

1. **Proposition (P)**:
   - "She is good at writing."

2. **Reason (R)**:
   - "Because she writes words effectively."

3. **Assess the Relation between P and R**:
   - **P**: "She is good at writing."
   - **R**: "She writes words effectively."
   
   The reason states that the effectiveness of her word writing is the causal basis for her being good at writing.

4. **Classify the Argument**:
   
   Assessing for each defective argument type:
   
   - **Generalization (G)**: This doesn’t seem to be a generalization based on limited instances.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not try to enumerate all possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the truth of the proposition. Writing words effectively is insufficient on its own to prove someone is generally good at writing as it overlooks other aspects of writing.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Check if R ("she writes words effectively") is compelling enough for P ("she is good at writing"). This suggests the reason provided fails to compellingly establish the causal basis needed for P because "writing words effectively" is too narrow to fully support the claim of being "good at writing" in general, as good writing typically encompasses more than just basic word effectiveness.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason seems to restate the proposition in a way. The reason, "she writes words effectively," merely reiterates the proposition "she is good at writing" in other words. It doesn't offer new information or evidence, making it a weak reasoning.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The reason doesn’t rely on assumed consensus.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language in the argument seems unambiguous.

Given this analysis, the primary defect seems to be that the reason (R) is essentially a rephrasing of the proposition (P), indicating that this is a **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**. It also could be somewhat related to **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, but RR fits best since R basically mirrors P without providing additional compelling information.
