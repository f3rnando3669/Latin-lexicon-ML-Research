For 
Certainly! Let's apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task into specific steps) to the task of classifying the defective argument in the given string: "This legislation is sinful because it is the wrong thing to do."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for IDAA

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Analyze the string to determine the main claim or assertion that is being made.
   - In this case, the proposition is: "This legislation is sinful."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Determine the causal basis or reason given to support the proposition.
   - In this case, the reason given is: "because it is the wrong thing to do."

3. **Evaluate the Quality of the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Check if the reason provided conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the proposition.
   - Assess whether the causal basis is compelling and if it avoids circular reasoning.
   - Determine whether the reason is making new points or merely repeating the proposition.

4. **Match the Defective Argument Type**:
   - Compare the reason with the definitions of defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) to see which one it most closely resembles.

### Step-by-Step IDAA Application

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Proposition: "This legislation is sinful."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Reason: "because it is the wrong thing to do."

3. **Evaluate the Quality of the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Is the reason sufficient and compelling? We need to check if it adds any meaningful causal basis to the proposition or if it just restates the proposition in different words.

   - "It is the wrong thing to do" essentially means the same as "this legislation is sinful" without providing any additional information or justification.

4. **Match the Defective Argument Type**:
   - The reason ("because it is the wrong thing to do") essentially repeats the proposition ("this legislation is sinful") without adding any new information or justification. This is a form of circular reasoning where the reason is just a restatement of the proposition. According to our definitions, this falls under:
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**.

### Final Classification:

The string "This legislation is sinful because it is the wrong thing to do" is classified as defective argument type **<RR>** (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
