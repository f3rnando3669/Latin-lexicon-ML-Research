For 
To apply IDAA to the statement "My friend said that if you sneeze more than three times, you have the corona virus," we'll first decompose the task (D) into specific steps and then classify the string as one of the defective argument types (IDA). 

### Decomposition of IDA (D)

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):** Determine what the statement is asserting or intending to prove.
2. **Identify the Reason (R):** Determine the causal basis or logic provided to support the Proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):** Check for any additional arguments or evidence provided to corroborate the Reason.
4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type (IDA):** Determine whether the argument falls into any of the specified defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, or DEP).

### Applying D to IDA (IDAA)

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - The statement asserts: "If you sneeze more than three times, you have the corona virus."
   
2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - The reason given to support the proposition is implied through what a friend said.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - There isn't additional evidence or arguments provided beyond the assertion made by the friend.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type (IDA):**
   - **Generalization (G):** This defective argument type involves making a general assertion based on insufficient data. In this case, it seems like a generalization based on anecdotal evidence or a specific instance (what a friend said).
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This argument doesn’t appear to list all possibilities and only focuses on one possible link.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason (a friend’s assertion) does not conclusively demonstrate the accuracy of the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reason provided (a hearsay from a friend) is not a compelling causal basis.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason does not simply repeat the proposition, so this does not apply.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There is no implied universal agreement here, so this does not apply.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language is relatively straightforward, so this does not apply.

### Conclusion

Based on the steps, the classifier can be narrowed down. The argument "My friend said that if you sneeze more than three times, you have the corona virus" could reasonably be classified as follows:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition's truth.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis (what a friend said) is not compelling or strong enough to support the proposition.
- **Generalization (G):** It generalizes a specific instance (what a friend said) to all cases without sufficient evidence.

It's most fundamentally:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the provided Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition. 

So, the statement "My friend said that if you sneeze more than three times, you have the corona virus," is classified as **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**.
