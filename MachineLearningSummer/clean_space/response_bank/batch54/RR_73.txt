Certainly! Let's apply the defined process of IDAA to the statement "President Reagan was a great communicator because he had the gift of talking effectively to the people." We'll decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps (D) and then apply those steps to the task (IDA).

Steps for decomposition (D):
1. Identify the Proposition (P) in the statement.
2. Identify the Reason (R) provided in support of the Proposition.
3. Determine if the Reason (R) sufficiently supports the Proposition (P).
4. Check for any characteristics of defective arguments: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).
5. Classify the argument based on the identified characteristics.

Step-by-step application (IDAA) to the given statement:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - The Proposition (P) is "President Reagan was a great communicator."

2. **Identify the Reason (R) provided in support of the Proposition:**
   - The Reason (R) given is "because he had the gift of talking effectively to the people."

3. **Determine if the Reason (R) sufficiently supports the Proposition (P):**
   - The Reason (R) is essentially stating that Reagan's effectiveness in communication is due to his ability to talk effectively to the people.
   
4. **Check for characteristics of defective arguments:**
   - **Generalization (G):** This type does not apply as the statement is not making a broad assertion based on a limited number of cases.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This does not apply as the argument does not enumerate possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This does not apply as the reason is not inherently inconclusive based on its premise.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This does potentially apply, as the causal basis "the gift of talking effectively to the people" might not be compelling enough alone to establish that Reagan was a "great communicator."
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This applies directly here. The Reason (R) is repeating the Proposition (P) in different words. "Great communicator" and "gift of talking effectively to the people" are essentially the same idea.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This doesn’t apply as the statement doesn’t appeal to any consensus.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** This does not apply as the statement’s language is clear and specific.

5. **Classify the argument based on the identified characteristics:**
   - The identified type of defective argument here is "Faulty Repetition of Proposition" (RR). The Reason provided merely repeats the Proposition in different words without adding any new information.

Therefore, according to the classification task IDA, "President Reagan was a great communicator because he had the gift of talking effectively to the people" is of type RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
