For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "Circular reasoning occurs when someone makes an argument in which both the premises and the conclusion have to rely on the truthfulness of the other," we need to decompose the task of classifying this string into specific steps, then apply those steps to our example.

Let's start with the decomposition of the task <IDA> into specific steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Determine what is being asserted or claimed.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Determine the causal basis supporting the proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Examine any additional arguments that support the reason.
4. **Check for Defective Argument Types:** Compare the identified parts against the definitions of defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, and <DEP>).
5. **Classify the Argument:** Based on the analysis, classify the string into one of the defective argument types.

Now, we will apply these steps to the given string.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)

The proposition in the given string is:
- "Circular reasoning occurs when someone makes an argument in which both the premises and the conclusion have to rely on the truthfulness of the other."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)

The causal basis supporting the proposition is:
- The premises and the conclusion depend on each other for their truthfulness.

### Step 3: Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>)

This statement provides a definition and does not include any additional arguments supporting the reason.

### Step 4: Check for Defective Argument Types

From the analysis, letâ€™s compare with each defective argument type:

- **Generalization (<G>):** The proposition is not making a general claim based on incomplete data.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The proposition does not enumerate possibilities but defines a concept.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This could be applicable if the reason doesn't conclusively demonstrate the proposition, but here it simply defines a concept rather than proving a point.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The reason given seems straightforward as a definition, so this doesn't apply.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason restates the proposition in different words, indicating possible redundancy.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** There is no appeal to consensus in the statement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The language and terms used do not appear to be ambiguous but clear in forming a definition.

### Step 5: Classify the Argument

Given our analysis, the classification would be:
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason provided is essentially a restatement of the proposition, offering no additional support or proof beyond the assertion itself.

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the statement "Circular reasoning occurs when someone makes an argument in which both the premises and the conclusion have to rely on the truthfulness of the other," we classify it as <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
