To apply the task of IDAA (the application of the decomposition of "Identify Defective Arguments" into specific steps) to the given string: "He’s not a great athlete; he’s a fraud, a cheat and a liar. That’s why not everybody is ‘happy for Lance,'" we need to decompose the task IDA into a set of specific steps to classify the argument in the string properly. 

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The proposition is a statement or claim made in the argument. In this string, the proposition is:

**P:** "He’s not a great athlete."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason provides the causal basis to support the proposition. In this string, the reason is provided immediately following the proposition:

**R:** "He’s a fraud, a cheat and a liar."

### Step 3: Check the nature of the Reason (Validate <R> Against <P>)
Determine if the given reason (<R>) logically supports and establishes the truth of the proposition (<P>):

- The reason given (R) is essentially character attacks (fraud, cheat, liar). Examine whether these traits logically prove that "He’s not a great athlete."

### Step 4: Look for any Proof of Reason (PR)
The proof of reason would be additional arguments or evidence that support the reason (R). This string doesn't provide clear, objective evidence, but that's something to note while identifying the defective argument.

### Step 5: Classify the Defective Argument Type
Using the definitions provided, we classify the defects:

1. **Generalization (G)** - Not applicable. This is not a generalization based on a part or majority of individuals.  

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** - Not applicable. This string does not discuss enumeration of possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** - **Applicable.** The reason "he’s a fraud, a cheat and a liar" does not conclusively establish the correctness of "he’s not a great athlete." Being a fraud, cheat, or liar doesn't definitively mean he is not a great athlete.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** - **Applicable.** The presented reason does not provide a strong, compelling causal basis to support the proposition. The negative traits of fraud, cheat, and liar do not directly address athletic prowess.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** - Not applicable. The reason (R) is different in content from the proposition (P).

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** - Not applicable. There is no appeal to universal agreement in the proof of reason here.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)** - Not applicable. The language itself isn't ambiguous in the context of the reason and proposition.

### Final Classification
The argument primarily exhibits the defects categorized as **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. This is because the assertions about Lance's character flaws do not logically or causally establish that he is not a great athlete.

So, the final classification of the defective argument in the string is:

- **<IR>: Inconclusive Reason**
- **<WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis**
