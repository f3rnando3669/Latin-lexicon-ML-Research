For 
To apply IDAA (the application of task decomposition to the task of identifying defective arguments) to the string "Smoking pot is against the law because it's wrong; I know it's wrong because it is against the law.", we will decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps and follow through each of them.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
First, we identify the main proposition or assertion of the argument.

In this case, the proposition <P> is: "Smoking pot is against the law because it's wrong."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
Next, we identify the reason given to support the proposition.

The reason <R> given is: "I know it's wrong because it is against the law."

### Step 3: Identify any Proof of Reason <PR>
We check if there is any proof provided to corroborate the reason.

In this case, there does not seem to be an additional proof provided for the reason. The argument mainly revolves around the proposition and the reason.

### Step 4: Classify the argument as one of the defective types
Now we move to classify the argument based on the defective argument types provided.

To classify the argument supplied:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument does not involve generalizing from a sample to a whole.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not involve claiming to have enumerated all possibilities when it hasn't.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason given does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal relationship provided is not compelling.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The reason seems to repeat the proposition without adding new information.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument does not appeal to a presumed universal agreement.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The argument does not rely on ambiguous language that could be misunderstood.

We observe that the reason "<R>: I know it's wrong because it is against the law" merely restates the proposition "<P>: Smoking pot is against the law because it's wrong" in a slightly altered form. This is essentially falling into the category of circular reasoning, where the reason simply restates the proposition without providing any independent support.

### Conclusion
The argument "Smoking pot is against the law because it's wrong; I know it's wrong because it is against the law." is classified as type <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), as the reason given duplicates the proposition without providing new or additional justification.
