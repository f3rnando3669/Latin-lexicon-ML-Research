For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as a defective argument type) to the string "Pamela never lies. She told me herself, so it must be true," we need to break down the advanced task of identifying the defect in the argument into specific steps. Here, we apply those steps to classify the given string. Let's proceed step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>):**
   - **Proposition (<P>):** "Pamela never lies."
   - **Reason (<R>):** "She told me herself."

2. **Determine if there is a Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - No additional proof is provided beyond the Reason given in the string. Thus, the <PR> is essentially the same as <R>.

3. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization <G>:** This doesn't apply here because there isn't a broad assertion made about a group based on a part or majority. The statement is about a single individual, Pamela.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>:** This doesn't apply here either, since there's no claim of having made a complete enumeration of possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason <IR>:** Consider this. The reason "she told me herself" does not conclusively establish the correctness of the proposition "Pamela never lies."
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>:** Evaluate this. The causal basis (Pamela's own statement) for the proposition that she never lies is weak, as it is not compelling and can be circular.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>:** This is a strong candidate. The Reason essentially repeats the Proposition with no additional information: "Pamela never lies" and "She told me herself" are almost self-referential.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>:** Not applicable here since no universal agreement is being assumed.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>:** There is no ambiguous language employed here that could be taken differently than intended.

4. **Classify the Argument:**
   - The best fit classification for the given string is **<RR>** (Faulty Repetition of Proposition). The Reason provided ("She told me herself") is effectively a repetition of the Proposition ("Pamela never lies"). It doesn't add an independent basis for the claim; instead, it uses circular reasoning.

Therefore, by applying IDAA, the string "Pamela never lies. She told me herself, so it must be true." is classified as **<RR>** (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
