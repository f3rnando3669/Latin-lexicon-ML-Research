For 
To apply IDAA (Decomposition and classification of the argument type) to the statement "Aaron Rodgers says you should get State Farm Insurance on your home, car, motorcycle, or trailer!", we will take the process step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - The proposition here is: "You should get State Farm Insurance on your home, car, motorcycle, or trailer."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - The reason provided is implicit: "Because Aaron Rodgers says so."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - There is no explicit proof of reason given. The statement is relying on Aaron Rodgers' endorsement.

Now, let's classify this argument according to the defect types provided:

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - Does the argument assume a characteristic of one individual or a small group applies to everyone? 
   - No, it does not generalize based on a characteristic, but relies on authority endorsement.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - Does it claim completeness of possibilities but misses some?
   - No, this is not an argument based on listing all possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
   - Potentially, yes. Aaron Rodgers' endorsement alone does not conclusively demonstrate why one should choose State Farm Insurance.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - Is the causal basis compelling?
   - No, the fact that Aaron Rodgers says to get it is not a compelling basis by itself.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - Is the reason just a repetition of the proposition?
   - No, it is not a repetition. It is weak but not the same statement.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - Is the argument assuming consensus or universal agreement?
   - No, it does not assume "it is universally agreed upon".

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - Can the argument be taken another way than intended due to ambiguous language?
   - No, the language is not ambiguous.

From the assessment, the argument is defective largely due to **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** as the recommendation is based solely on Aaron Rodgers' endorsement without providing substantial reasons or evidence why the insurance is beneficial. It also has aspects of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** since the reason doesn't conclusively establish the proposition but isn't purely circular or ambiguous. 

Thus, the primary classification for this statement would be **WCB** with a secondary aspect of **IR**.
