To apply the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types (i.e., <IDAA>), we'll break the task down into specific steps and analyze the given string "This has to work so it will work."

**Step 1: Understand the Components of the Argument**

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** The statement or claim that is being put forward.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** The justification or causal basis for the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Additional arguments that support the reason.

**Step 2: Analyze the Argument**

Examine the provided string to extract the Proposition and the Reason to see if any defective argument types apply based on their definitions.

**Step 3: Apply the Definitions of Defective Argument Types**

1. **Generalization (G):** Check if the statement is an unwarranted generalization.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Check if the statement falsely claims to have considered all possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Check if the reason provided is not conclusively determining the correctness of the proposition.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Check if the causal basis provided for the proposition is weak or not compelling.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Check if the reason merely repeats the proposition without adding new justification.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Check if the proof of reason assumes universal agreement without substantiating it.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Check if the language used in the proof of reason is ambiguous.

**Step 4: Classify the Argument**

Given the string "This has to work so it will work."

- **Identify <P>:** "This has to work."
- **Identify <R>:** "It will work."

There is no additional argument here to serve explicitly as a Proof of Reason (<PR>).

**Step 5: Evaluate Each Defective Argument Type**

1. **Generalization (G):** The statement doesn't appear to be a generalization, so <G> doesn't apply.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** There are no enumerations of possibilities, so <FE> doesn't apply.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason given ("It will work") does not conclusively prove the proposition ("This has to work") since it simply asserts a necessity without justification. Therefore, <IR> could apply.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reason provided lacks a compelling causal basis. It's not clear why "it will work" makes "this has to work" true. So, <WCB> applies as well.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason "it will work" is essentially a rephrasing of the proposition "this has to work," making it a repetition rather than a new justification. <RR> strongly applies.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There is no assumption of universal agreement here, so <FU> doesn't apply.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language is not ambiguous; it is quite clear in its direct assertion, so <DEP> doesnâ€™t apply.

**Conclusion:**

After applying the decomposition and analyzing the given string, the defective argument types that apply are:
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
- Inconclusive Reason (IR)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)

The primary classification for the string "This has to work so it will work." is **RR** (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), as the reason provided merely repeats the proposition without providing any new justification.
