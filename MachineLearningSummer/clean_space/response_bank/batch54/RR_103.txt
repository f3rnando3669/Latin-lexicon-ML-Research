For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposing of the task IDA into specific steps) to the string "A is true because B is true, and B is true because C is true, and C is true because A is true," we need to follow a structured approach to classify the argument based on the types of defective arguments provided.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (IDAA)

1. **Identify Proposition (P), Reason (R), and Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - Proposition (P): "A is true"
   - Reason (R) for P: "B is true"
   - Proposition (P) for R: "B is true"
   - Reason (R) for P (second level): "C is true"
   - Proposition (P) for second R: "C is true"
   - Reason (R) for P (third level): "A is true"

2. **Analyze Structure:**
   - "A is true because B is true"
   - "B is true because C is true"
   - "C is true because A is true"
   
   This leads to a circular reasoning pattern: A → B → C → A.

3. **Check against Defective Argument Types:**

   a. **Generalization (G):**
      - Does not apply as the argument does not generalize from a part to a whole.

   b. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
      - Does not apply as there is no claim of listing possibilities completely.

   c. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
      - Partially applies as the reasons given for each proposition (A because B, B because C, and C because A) do not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the propositions. A better term in standard logic is circular reasoning.

   d. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
      - Applies as each reason provided (B, C, A) does not provide a compelling causal basis for the respective propositions.

   e. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
      - This specifically suggests that the reason repeats the proposition in different wording. In this case, the reasons eventually loop back to the original proposition but without restating it identically in each step. Hence, it doesn't strictly fit RR.

   f. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
      - Does not apply as there is no appeal to universal agreement.

   g. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
      - Does not apply as there is no ambiguous language that might be interpreted in multiple ways.

4. **Classification:**
   - The most fitting classifications for this example primarily involve **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** and **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** due to the circular reasoning structure that does not provide compelling, conclusive support for the propositions.

### Conclusion:
- The given argument "A is true because B is true, and B is true because C is true, and C is true because A is true" falls under **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** and **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** primarily due to its nature of circular reasoning and lack of compelling causal support.
