To apply the process of IDAA to the given argument, we'll break down the advanced task (IDA - classifying the argument string as a defective argument type) into specific steps.

### Decomposition (D) of Task (t) IDA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Determine the main assertion or claim that is intended to be proven.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Determine the causal basis or reasoning provided to support the proposition.

3. **Identify if there's a Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - Determine if there's additional supporting argumentation to corroborate the reason.

4. **Evaluate Potential Defectiveness:**
   - Compare the identified Proposition (P), Reason (R), and Proof of Reason (PR) against defections types G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, and DEP.
   - Determine if the argument fits any of the specified defective argument types.

### Application of Decomposition (D) to Given Argument (IDA):

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
- **Proposition (P)**: "We need more revenue to support the programs that we have."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
- **Reason (R)**: "Children are our future."

#### Step 3: Identify if there's a Proof of Reason (PR)
- There is an additional statement: "Let's support children."
- **Proof of Reason (PR)**: This statement can be seen as an attempt to reinforce the reason by appealing to the value of children and the future.

#### Step 4: Evaluate Potential Defectiveness

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument does not appear to generalize from a specific case to an entire group.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This argument is not making a claim of complete enumeration of possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
    - The reason ("Children are our future") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition ("We need more revenue to support the programs that we have").
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
    - The reason given ("Children are our future") seems weak or not directly compelling as a causal basis for the need for more revenue.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
    - The reason does not simply repeat the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
    - The argument does not rely on the assumption of universal agreement that is in dispute.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
    - There does not appear to be a notable ambiguity in terms of language use in this context.

The argument most closely aligns with the defective argument type **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. The reason provided ("Children are our future") is not directly conclusive or sufficiently compelling in demonstrating why raising taxes is necessary to support the programs that exist. While it's an appeal to emotion, it doesn't adequately address the financial mechanics or direct impact related to the proposition.
