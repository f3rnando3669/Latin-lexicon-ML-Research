For 
To apply the process of <IDAA> to the task of classifying the given statement "Distracting and dangerous mobile devices should be banned from use in vehicles," we need to decompose the advanced task (<t>) of identifying the type of defective argument into specific steps and then apply these steps to the statement. Here are the steps we can take:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
The proposition is the central assertion or claim of the argument. In this case, the proposition is:
- "Distracting and dangerous mobile devices should be banned from use in vehicles."

### Step 2: Determine if There is a Reason <R>
Next, we look for the causal basis or reasoning that supports the proposition. However, the provided statement only gives the proposition and does not explicitly state the reasoning behind it. We can infer the reasoning as something like:
- "Because they cause distractions and danger, leading to accidents."

### Step 3: Check for a Proof of Reason <PR>
Then, we look for any additional arguments or evidence that supports the reason. In the provided statement, there is no explicit proof presented.

### Step 4: Evaluate the Proposition for Defective Argument Types
Using the definitions provided:
1. **Generalization <G>**: The argument may be considered a generalization if it asserts a rule based on limited observations (e.g., "all mobile devices are distracting and dangerous").
2. **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>**: The argument misses other factors or safety measures that could pertain to mobile devices in vehicles.
3. **Inconclusive Reason <IR>**: The reason provided may not definitively prove that a ban is necessary.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>**: The causal basis (distraction and danger) may be insufficiently compelling without additional data or analysis.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>**: The reason should not simply restate the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>**: Assuming everyone agrees that all mobile devices are distracting and dangerous without evidence.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>**: Terms like "distracting" and "dangerous" may be ambiguous.

### Step 5: Classify the Argument Based on the Evaluation
Let's assess whether each potential defective argument applies:

- **Generalization <G>**: Yes, it generalizes that all mobile devices should be banned due to being distracting and dangerous.
- **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>**: Possibly, as it does not consider other mitigation strategies, such as hands-free devices.
- **Inconclusive Reason <IR>**: Could be, as it does not conclusively prove that a ban is the only solution.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>**: The reason provided could indeed be insufficient without statistical data or studies.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>**: Not applicable here since no direct repetition is present.
- **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>**: If it assumes everyone agrees without evidence, it could be <FU>, though not explicitly stated.
- **Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>**: "Distracting" and "dangerous" could be seen as somewhat ambiguous terms without specific contexts or definitions.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the given statement "Distracting and dangerous mobile devices should be banned from use in vehicles" primarily falls under:

- **Generalization <G>**: It asserts that all mobile devices are distracting and dangerous based on what may be limited observations.
- **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>**: Missing consideration of other measures or factors regarding the use of mobile devices in vehicles.
- **Inconclusive Reason <IR>**: Does not conclusively demonstrate that banning is the only or necessary course of action.
  
Thus, the argument can be classified as primarily containing elements of <G>, <FE>, and <IR>.
