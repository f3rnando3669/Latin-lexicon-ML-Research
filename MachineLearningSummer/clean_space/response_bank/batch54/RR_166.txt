For 
Applying the decomposition strategy (\<D>) to classify the given string (\<s>) under the defective argument types (\<IDA>), we can break down the task into specific steps:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\<P>)**
Let's start by identifying the proposition in the argument.

- The proposition here is: "Free trade will be good for this country."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (\<R>)**
Next, let's look for the reason given to support the proposition.

- The reason provided is: "The reason is patently clear." [Preliminary observation suggests this statement is somewhat insufficient but let's proceed to see if more is provided.]

**Step 3: Identify any additional arguments or Proof of Reason (\<PR>)**
Let's determine if there are further details or proof offered that substantiate the reason.

- The additional detail is: "Isn't it obvious that unrestricted commercial relations will bestow on all sections of this nation the benefits which result when there is an unimpeded flow of goods between countries?"

**Step 4: Analyze each part identified (P, R, PR)**
We now analyze each part of the argument to classify it under the defective argument types.

- **Generalization (\<G>):** This would be applicable if the argument is making a broad claim based on insufficient or non-universal evidence.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE>):** This would be present if the argument claims to cover all possibilities but clearly misses some.

- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>):** Applies if the reason given does not conclusively establish the proposition.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB>):** This applies if the reason's causal basis for the proposition is weak or unconvincing.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR>):** This would be the case if the reason essentially repeats the proposition without adding new information.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU>):** This type is relevant if the proof of reason assumes universal agreement on something still in dispute.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP>):** Applies if the proof uses language in a way that can be interpreted differently than the speaker's intended meaning.

**Step 5: Classify the argument based on the analysis**
Let's classify the given argument based on our analysis.

- The phrase "The reason is patently clear" does not actually supply a valid causal basis for the proposition.

- The subsequent question "Isn't it obvious that unrestricted commercial relations will bestow on all sections of this nation the benefits which result when there is an unimpeded flow of goods between countries?" attempts to provide a causal basis but does so by appealing to what should be obvious rather than providing concrete evidence or reasoning.

Upon evaluating this in light of the defective argument types defined:

- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>):** The reason ("The reason is patently clear") given does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB>):** The informal logic presented ("Isn't it obvious...") lacks a strong and compelling causal basis.

Therefore, the argument exhibits both **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB>)**. Given the definition provided, it seems primarily to be a case of **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB>)** because the causal link is not convincingly established.

**Final Classification: \(\<WCB\>\)**
The argument "Free trade will be good for this country. The reason is patently clear. Isn't it obvious that unrestricted commercial relations will bestow on all sections of this nation the benefits which result when there is an unimpeded flow of goods between countries?" is best classified under the defective argument type \<WCB\>.
