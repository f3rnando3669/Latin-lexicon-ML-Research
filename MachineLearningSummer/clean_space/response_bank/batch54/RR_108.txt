For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to the string "Global warming doesn’t exist because the earth is not getting warmer," we will decompose the task of classifying the defective argument into specific steps (\( D \)) and then apply those steps.

### Decomposition of Task \( t \) into Specific Steps (\( D \)):
1. **Identify the Proposition \( P \).**
2. **Identify the Reason \( R \).**
3. **Examine the Reason \( R \) for type classification.**
4. **Determine if the argument is defective and classify the type \( IDA \).**

Let's apply these steps to the string.

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition \( P \)
   - Proposition (\( P \)): "Global warming doesn’t exist."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason \( R \)
   - Reason (\( R \)): "because the earth is not getting warmer."

#### Step 3: Examine the Reason \( R \) for type classification
   - Is \( R \) a Generalization (\( G \))? 
     - No, it is not making a generalization based on a part or majority applied to all.
   - Is \( R \) an Incomplete Enumeration (\( FE \))? 
     - No, it is not claiming a complete enumeration of possibilities.
   - Is \( R \) an Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \))? 
     - Possibly. It needs to be checked whether \( R \) conclusively demonstrates \( P \).
   - Is \( R \) an Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \))? 
     - Possibly. We need to check if \( R \) provides a weak causal basis for \( P \).
   - Is \( R \) a Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( RR \))? 
     - No, it is not merely repeating \( P \).
   - Is \( R \) assuming a Presumptuous Consensus (\( FU \))? 
     - No, it does not assume something is certain based on universal agreement.
   - Is \( R \) using Ambiguous Language (\( DEP \))?
     - No, the language seems clear.

#### Step 4: Determine if the argument is defective and classify the type \( IDA \)
   - After examining \( R \), it appears that the reason given ("the earth is not getting warmer") does not conclusively demonstrate that global warming doesn’t exist because current scientific data shows that global warming involves more than just surface temperature increases—it includes ocean warming, ice melt, and more complex climatic changes. Therefore, the reason \( R \) is inconclusive and provides an insufficient basis for \( P \).

   - Consequently, the argument can be considered defective due to Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \)) and Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \)).

### Conclusion
The classification (\( IDA \)) of the argument "Global warming doesn’t exist because the earth is not getting warmer" is of type \( IR \) (Inconclusive Reason) and \( WCB \) (Insufficient Causal Basis).

This completes the application of \( IDAA \) (the decomposition and classification) to the given argument.
