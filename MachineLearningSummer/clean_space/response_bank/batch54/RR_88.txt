Applying the definition of IDAA to the provided dialogue between Bert and Ernie involves breaking down the task of classifying the string as one of types G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, or DEP step by step. Here's how we can do this:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) Applied to IDA (IDAA):

#### Step 1: Identify the Propositions (P)
We need to identify the main propositions presented in the dialogue.

1. **Proposition 1 (P1)** from Ernie: "Think of it as a little guy in your brain watching the movie projected by your eyes."
2. **Proposition 2 (P2)** from Ernie: "Well, think of it as a little guy in his brain watching a movie..."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
Determine if Ernie provides a reason (R) to support the propositions (P).

- In this context, the main reason (R) provided seems to be the analogy of a "little guy" to explain the function of the brain and perception:
  - R1 for P1: "There's a little guy in your brain."
  - R2 for P2: "There's a little guy in the little guy's brain."

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
Assess if additional arguments or evidence corroborate the reasons provided.

- No further substantive proof or arguments are provided to substantiate the analogy. It's simply repeated.

#### Step 4: Classify Potential Defective Argument Types
Classify the arguments according to the provided defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

1. **Generalization (G)**: Not applicable here as it doesn't involve extrapolating from a sample to a whole.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable as no enumeration is attempted.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The analogy does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the propositions (P1 and P2); it just repeats or extends the analogy without explanation.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The reasons given (the "little guy" analogy) do not provide a compelling causal explanation for how eyes and brains project images or process them.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason (R) effectively repeats the proposition in different terms â€” the concept of a "little guy" in the brain is reiterated without adding new explanatory power.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Not applicable, as no consensus is presumed.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The argument doesn't rely on ambiguous terms; it's rather an analogy that fails to provide clarification.

#### Step 5: Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the most fitting classifications of the defective arguments in the dialogue are:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** - The analogy does not conclusively prove or demonstrate the propositions.
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** - The analogy of a "little guy" in the brain watching a movie is not a compelling causal basis for explaining how eyes and brains function.
3. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** - The reasoning provided repeats the proposition without adding new insights or proof.

### Final Classification
The dialogue between Bert and Ernie can be classified primarily under IR (Inconclusive Reason), WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis), and RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
