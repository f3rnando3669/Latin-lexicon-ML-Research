To apply the process of IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string into specific steps and the application of those steps to the task of identifying the type of defective argument), let's follow a structured approach to classify the string "I hated the movie because it was the worst movie I ever saw."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) for IDA

1. **Identify Proposition (P):**
   - Recognize the main assertion or claim being made.

2. **Identify Reason (R):**
   - Determine the causal basis supporting the Proposition (P).

3. **Evaluate Defective Argument Types:**
   - Classify the given string into one of the defective argument types based on the nature of the Reason (R) and its relationship to the Proposition (P).

### Application of Decomposition to the Given String (IDAA):

**Step 1: Identify Proposition (P)**
- Proposition (P): "I hated the movie."

**Step 2: Identify Reason (R)**
- Reason (R): "because it was the worst movie I ever saw."

**Step 3: Evaluate Defective Argument Types**
Let's evaluate the potential defective argument types based on the definitions:

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - The P does not assert anything general based on a part or majority, so it is not a generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - The P does not claim to have considered all possibilities, hence it is not an incomplete enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - The R ("it was the worst movie I ever saw") is subjective and may not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the P. This makes the argument weak but not necessarily inconclusive by definition.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - The causal basis ("it was the worst movie I ever saw") is largely subjective and personal judgment, which may not be compelling to others. Thus, it fits the definition of WCB since the reason provided is not compelling enough to establish the Proposition.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - The R does not simply repeat P in different words.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - The R does not assume consensus on a universally agreed-upon point.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - The R does not use ambiguous language that could have another interpretation.

**Conclusion:**
Given that the reason "it was the worst movie I ever saw" is based on a subjective personal judgment and does not provide an objective, compelling causal basis, the defective argument type best fitting this string is **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.

Thus, the classification of the string "I hated the movie because it was the worst movie I ever saw" is:
- **IDAA Result:** `<WCB>`
