For 
To apply **IDAA** (the application of the decomposition method to the task of classifying a defective argument) to the given string, "Politician Running for Public Office: You can all trust what I say. I have never lied in my life," we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - The argument claims something that the speaker wants to prove. In this case, the proposition is "You can all trust what I say."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - The reason given to support the proposition is "I have never lied in my life."

3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - In this case, there is no additional proof provided for the reason. The reason stands alone without further evidence or arguments.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**:
   - We need to see whether the argument fits any of the defective argument types outlined.

Based on the argument:

- **Generalization (G)**: This does not seem to fit here because there is no assertion about a group based on an insufficient sample.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This doesn't apply as there is no enumeration of possibilities.
  
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason given "I have never lied in my life" does not conclusively demonstrate that "You can all trust what I say". The past behavior does not always guarantee future honesty; thus, this doesn’t conclusively prove the politician’s trustworthiness.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis for the proposition is weak. Just because someone claims never to have lied in the past doesn’t necessarily mean that they are always trustworthy or truthful in every statement. The link between the past alleged behavior and the current claim of trustworthiness is not compelling.
  
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason "I have never lied in my life" does not simply repeat the proposition "You can all trust what I say," so this is not applicable.
  
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There's no assumption of universal agreement here.
  
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: There is no ambiguous language within the proposition or reason that would lead to misinterpretation based on this argument alone.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The most fitting defective argument type here is **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
     The reason provided, "I have never lied in my life," does not offer a compelling causal basis to establish the truth of the proposition, "You can all trust what I say."

Therefore, the classification of the string "Politician Running for Public Office: You can all trust what I say. I have never lied in my life." is **<WCB>** (Insufficient Causal Basis).
