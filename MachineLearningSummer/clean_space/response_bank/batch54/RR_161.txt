For 
To apply \(IDAA\) to the string "Has your psychology department stopped teaching that ineffective approach to therapy yet?", we need to decompose the task of identifying the defective argument type into specific steps \( D \). Here is the step-by-step process:

1. **Identify the Proposition \((P)\):**
   - Determine the main assertion or claim made in the statement.

2. **Identify the Reason \((R)\):**
   - Identify the causal basis or reasoning provided to support the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason \((PR)\):**
   - Identify any additional arguments or evidence presented to support the reason.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument:**
   - Using the identified components \((P)\), \((R)\), and \((PR)\), classify the argument as one of the defective argument types \((G)\), \((FE)\), \((IR)\), \((RR)\), \((WCB)\), \((FU)\), or \((DEP)\).

Let’s break down the example step-by-step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition \((P)\)
The proposition in the question "Has your psychology department stopped teaching that ineffective approach to therapy yet?" is implicitly suggesting two things:
- The psychology department **was** teaching an ineffective approach to therapy.
- The question presupposes that this approach is currently under scrutiny and that there is an expectation it should have stopped.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason \((R)\)
The question implies that there are reasons to believe the approach is ineffective, but it doesn't provide explicit reasons within the question itself.

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason \((PR)\)
The question does not provide additional arguments or evidence to support the reason. It is phrased as a loaded question, assuming the ineffectiveness of the approach.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument
Given the breakdown:
- The statement implicitly assumes facts (the ineffectiveness and the teaching of the ineffective therapy approach) without providing evidence \((PR)\).
- The term “ineffective” is used without clarification and can be subjective or ambiguous, leading to potential misinterpretation.

Based on the steps:
1. \((P)\): The psychology department was teaching an ineffective approach.
2. \((R)\): It is implied to stop teaching it.
3. \((PR)\): No explicit proof or evidence is provided.

The classification of the defective argument type could be:
- **Ambiguous Language Use \((DEP)\)**, because terms like "ineffective" are ambiguous and can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended.
- Also, there’s an element of **Presumptuous Consensus \((FU)\)**, because it assumes the ineffectiveness of the approach is universally agreed upon without evidence.

### Conclusion
The defective argument type for the string "Has your psychology department stopped teaching that ineffective approach to therapy yet?" can be classified primarily as \(DEP\) (Ambiguous Language Use) due to the ambiguous term "ineffective". Additionally, there are elements of \(FU\) (Presumptuous Consensus) since the question presumes a universal agreement on the ineffectiveness.

Thus, using \(IDAA\), we classify the argument as primarily \((DEP)\) with elements of \((FU)\).
