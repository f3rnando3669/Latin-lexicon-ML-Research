For 
To apply the IDAA (the application of decomposition to identifying defective arguments) to the statement "Paranormal activity is real because I've seen a ghost," we need to follow a specific series of steps to classify the argument type. We'll break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Parts of the Argument
First, we need to extract and label the parts of the argument using our previously defined terms:

1. **Proposition (<P>):** "Paranormal activity is real"
2. **Reason (<R>):** "I've seen a ghost"
3. **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** This argument does not explicitly provide a further proof for the reason, so we may assume this step is not applicable or is embedded within the reason itself.

### Step 2: Analyze the Components for Defects
Next, we'll analyze whether the argument fits into any of the defective argument types.

1. **Generalization (<G>):** The proposition is about paranormal activity being real, based on a personal experience. Generalization would apply if this was extended to all paranormal activity being real based on one instance. 
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** There's no claim to have enumerated all possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason given ("I've seen a ghost") does not conclusively prove the proposition about all paranormal activity being real.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal basis here is a singular personal experience which may not be compelling to establish the broad claim of paranormal activity's reality.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason and the proposition are not repetitions of each other.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Thereâ€™s no mention of universal agreement.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The terms are clear and not ambiguous in language usage.

### Step 3: Classify the Defective Argument
From the analysis above, we note:
- The personal experience (seeing a ghost) is used to generalize the reality of all paranormal activities, fitting <G>.
- The reason provided is inconclusive (<IR>) and insufficient (<WCB>) as it does not compellingly establish the truth of the proposition.

### Step 4: Conclude the Classification
Based on the steps, the argument "Paranormal activity is real because I've seen a ghost" can be classified as containing the following defects:
- **<G> (Generalization)**
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**

Thus, the primary classification is these three types: <G>, <IR>, and <WCB>.
