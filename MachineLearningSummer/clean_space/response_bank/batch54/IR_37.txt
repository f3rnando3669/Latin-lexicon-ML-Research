For 
To apply the decomposition process \(\langle D \rangle\) to the task of classifying the string "My opponent raises a good point, but can we really trust him? I mean, he moved to this town two years ago and everyone knows that his wife left him." as one of the defective argument types \(\langle IDAA \rangle\), we need to break it down into specific steps to identify which defective argument type it represents. Here are the steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (\(\langle P \rangle\))**: Determine what the main assertion or claim is.
   
2. **Identify the Reason (\(\langle R \rangle\))**: Determine the causal basis or reasoning given to support the proposition.
   
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\(\langle PR \rangle\))**: Determine the supporting argument for the reason, if any.

4. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types**: Compare the identified parts with the definitions of defective argument types \(\langle G \rangle\), \(\langle FE \rangle\), \(\langle IR \rangle\), \(\langle RR \rangle\), \(\langle WCB \rangle\), \(\langle FU \rangle\), and \(\langle DEP \rangle\).

Let's apply this process step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\(\langle P \rangle\))

The main assertion is implied rather than explicitly stated. It can be summarized as:
- **Proposition (\(\langle P \rangle\))**: "We cannot trust my opponent."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\(\langle R \rangle\))

The reasoning given to support the proposition is:
- **Reason (\(\langle R \rangle\))**: "He moved to this town two years ago and everyone knows that his wife left him."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (\(\langle PR \rangle\))

There doesn't seem to be an additional proof provided for the reason. The reason itself is suggested by context and social information.

### Step 4: Analyze for Defective Argument Types

- **Generalization (\(\langle G \rangle\))**: This type doesn't apply as there is no generalization from a part to the whole.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\(\langle FE \rangle\))**: This type doesn't apply as there is no enumeration that claims to be complete.
- **Inconclusive Reason (\(\langle IR \rangle\))**: The reason given does not conclusively demonstrate the untrustworthiness of the opponent. Moving to a new town and marital status are not directly related to trustworthiness.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(\langle RR \rangle\))**: This type doesn't apply as the reason is not merely a restatement of the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(\langle WCB \rangle\))**: The causal connection between the reason (moving to a new town and marital issues) and the proposition (trustworthiness) is not compelling or logically sufficient.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (\(\langle FU \rangle\))**: The argument does appeal to a presumed universal agreement ("everyone knows"), which can be seen as a faulty appeal to consensus.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (\(\langle DEP \rangle\))**: This type doesn't apply as the language in the reason is not ambiguous.

Given the analysis, two types seem relevant: Inconclusive Reason \(\langle IR \rangle\) and Presumptuous Consensus \(\langle FU \rangle\). 

However, because the reason provided is not logically connected to the proposition, the primary classification should be:

\[ \text{\(\langle IDA \rangle\):} \quad \langle IR \rangle \]

Given that "everyone knows" is used to bolster the argument without further proof, a secondary note can be made:

\[ \text{\(\langle IDA \rangle\):} \quad \langle FU \rangle \]

So, the primary defect in the argument is \(\langle IR \rangle\) with an additional indication of \(\langle FU \rangle\).
