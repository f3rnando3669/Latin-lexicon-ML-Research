For 
To apply <IDAA> to the argument "All eighteen-year-olds have the right to vote because it's legal for them to vote," we need to break down the task of classifying the defective argument step by step.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA> for the Argument

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - **<P>:** "All eighteen-year-olds have the right to vote."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - **<R>:** "Because it's legal for them to vote."

3. **Check for Defective Argument Types:**
   
   1. **Generalization (<G>):**
      - This would involve making an assertion about a group based on some part or majority without it necessarily being applicable to all. 
      - In this case, the statement doesn't seem to generalize from a subset; it categorically states something about all eighteen-year-olds.

   2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
      - This involves claiming a complete enumeration of possibilities while missing out on pertinent ones.
      - Since the statement does not attempt to list possibilities, <FE> does not apply.

   3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
      - This is applicable if the reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
      - In this case, the reason given ("it's legal for them to vote") does support the proposition directly, assuming legality directly confers the right.

   4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
      - This involves presenting a reason that simply restates the proposition in a different form.
      - Here, "All eighteen-year-olds have the right to vote" is essentially being restated as "it's legal for them to vote." The cause stated is the same as the claim.
      - **Applies:** This argument is an example of <RR>.

   5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
      - This means the causal basis submitted is not compelling or sufficient.
      - Since we already determined that <RR> applies more accurately, this is secondary.

   6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
      - This would involve assuming something is true because it is "universally agreed upon."
      - There's no appeal to a universal agreement in this argument.

   7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
      - This involves the argument being taken in another sense than intended due to ambiguous language.
      - The statement is quite clear and unambiguous.

### Conclusion of <IDAA>

Based on this analysis, the argument "All eighteen-year-olds have the right to vote because it's legal for them to vote" is classified under the defective argument type:

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**

The reason given repeats the proposition without adding substantive information or a different causal basis.
