For 
Sure, let's decompose the task of classifying the argument in the statement "I am only slightly obese. That is perfectly normal here in America." into specific steps. Here's the structured approach (D):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):** Determine what the main claim or assertion is in the statement.
2. **Identify the Reason (R):** Determine the causal basis or reason provided to support the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):** Determine if there's additional evidence provided to support the reason.
4. **Evaluate Argument Types:** Determine if the argument fits one of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, or DEP).

Now, apply these steps (IDAA) to the statement:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The proposition (P) in the statement is:
- "I am only slightly obese."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason (R) provided to support the proposition is:
- "That is perfectly normal here in America."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
There is no explicit additional evidence provided in the statement to support the reason. Thus, there appears to be no PR in this argument.

### Step 4: Evaluate Argument Types
Evaluate if the argument is defective and classify it among the possible defective argument types.

1. **Generalization (G):** The proposition “I am only slightly obese” is based on a personal condition, but the reason “That is perfectly normal here in America” generalizes the condition to "normal" within an entire country. This can be seen as a generalization without statistical backing.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This does not enumerate other possibilities about health standards or norms outside America, but it's more about a generalization.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason “That is perfectly normal here in America” does not conclusively demonstrate why "slightly obese" should be regarded as normal without further evidence or explanation.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reason “That is perfectly normal here in America” is weak as it does not provide a compelling causal basis for why being slightly obese is justified as acceptable.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason (R) does not simply repeat the proposition (P), so this type is not applicable.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The statement implies that it’s universally agreed that being slightly obese is normal in America without evidence of such a consensus. 

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** There is no apparent ambiguous language in the context of how the reason (R) could be taken in a different sense than intended.

Considering the specific argument defects:
- **<G> Generalization** seems to most accurately describe the defect in this argument as it relies on a generalized societal norm without robust evidence.

**Final Classification:**
- The argument in “I am only slightly obese. That is perfectly normal here in America.” is a type <G> (Generalization).

Thus, applying IDAA to the given statement categorizes it as a Generalization (G).
