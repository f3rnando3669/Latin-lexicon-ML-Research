Certainly! For the task of classifying the argument string based on the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>), we can apply the decomposition of the task into specific steps. Here is the application of <IDAA> for the given string:

String: "Andy states that a Scotsman would never put sugar on his porridge. Dougal replies that he is a Scotsman and he does put sugar on his porridge. Andy counters that no true Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge. Andy thus changes the terms of the argument, implying that Dougal is not a 'true' Scotsman in order to support his own position."

### Steps:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**
- Original Proposition (<P>): A Scotsman would never put sugar on his porridge.

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>) given for the Proposition**
- Reason (<R>): Andy asserts a cultural trait or identity aspect about Scotsmen related to their eating habits.

**Step 3: Examine the interaction where the argument changes**
- Dougal challenges Andy's Proposition by countering with a contradictory example: he, a Scotsman, does put sugar on his porridge.
- Andy then modifies or refines his Proposition to exclude Dougal by stating that "no true Scotsman" puts sugar on his porridge, implying Dougal is not a "true" Scotsman.

**Step 4: Determine if the Reason (<R>) is conclusively supporting the Proposition (<P>) or if it shifted**
- Andy's refinement shifts from a general cultural claim to a specific exclusionary redefinition of "true Scotsman".
  
**Step 5: Examine if the redefinition introduces any defect**
- The term "true Scotsman" shifts the argument by excluding counterexamples through redefining the term to fit his argument.

### Classification:

This pattern matches a known logical fallacy called the "No True Scotsman" fallacy, which is closely related to one of our predefined defective argument types.

- **Defective Argument Type:** This falls under **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)** and **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**, because:
  - **<DEP>:** Andy's use of "true Scotsman" introduces ambiguity in the language by redefining what a Scotsman is according to an arbitrary standard whenever a counterexample is presented.
  - **<IR>:** The assertion that "no true Scotsman" puts sugar on porridge does not conclusively demonstrate that all Scotsmen indeed act according to Andy's claim. It changes the scope of the original proposition to avoid addressing counterexamples.

Thus, classifying the string "Andy states that a Scotsman would never put sugar on his porridge. Dougal replies that he is a Scotsman and he does put sugar on his porridge. Andy counters that no true Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge. Andy thus changes the terms of the argument, implying that Dougal is not a 'true' Scotsman in order to support his own position." involves a combination of defective arguments: **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)** and **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**.
