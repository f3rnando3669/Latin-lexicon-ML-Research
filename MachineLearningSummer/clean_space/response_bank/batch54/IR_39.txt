To apply the process of IDAA (the application of D to IDA, which involves decomposing the task of classifying defective arguments into specific steps) to the dialogue provided, we will break down the dialogue and analyze it step by step to identify the type of defective argument it may represent. Here’s how to approach it:

### Step 1: Extract and Summarize the Argument
First, we need to summarize what is being presented in the dialogue.

#### "person 1: "We should argue with logic facts"
- **Proposition (P)**: "We should argue with logic facts."
- **Reason (R)**: There is no explicit reason given in this statement, but it implies that logical facts are the basis for arguments.

#### "person 2: "You should grow a brain before you open your mouth"
- **Response to (P)**: Person 2 is rejecting Person 1's proposition, asserting that Person 1 lacks the intelligence to engage in argumentation.

### Step 2: Identify the Nature of the Response
Now we need to identify the nature of Person 2's response to classify it appropriately.

### Step 3: Analyze Possible Defective Argument Types
We'll consider each defective argument type in relation to Person 2's response:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This does not involve a generalization about a group based on a few cases.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: There is no enumeration of possibilities that have been missed.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The statement "You should grow a brain before you open your mouth" does not provide any reason concerning logical facts.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This does not provide a weak causal claim related to the proposition about arguing with logical facts.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This statement does not reiterate the proposition "We should argue with logic facts".
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There is no appeal to a universal agreement here.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language used here is dismissive and offensive, but not necessarily ambiguous.

### Step 4: Classify Based on Analysis
Based on the analysis, we should identify the most applicable category:

- **The response of Person 2 ("You should grow a brain before you open your mouth") does not present a reason or argument related to the original proposition. Instead, it is an ad hominem attack, which is a personal attack on Person 1 rather than addressing the actual argument. However, within the context of the given defective argument types, this most closely aligns with**:

   **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This is because Person 2’s response does not provide any logical or relevant reason to counter the proposition made by Person 1. It fails to address why or why not "we should argue with logic facts", substituting a personal insult instead of engaging with the argument.

### Step 5: Conclude the Classification
Finally, we classify the argument:
- The argument "You should grow a brain before you open your mouth" is an instance of **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** as it fails to address or refute the original proposition with a relevant reason.

Thus, we have applied the steps of IDAA to classify the defective argument in the provided dialogue sample.
