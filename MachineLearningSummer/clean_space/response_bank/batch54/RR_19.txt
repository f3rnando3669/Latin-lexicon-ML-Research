For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying defective arguments into specific steps) to the given statement "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there," we need to follow a structured approach. Below are the detailed steps for decomposing this task and applying it:

### Step 1: Understand the Statement
Identify the components of the argument:
- **Proposition (<P>)**: "That restaurant is popular"
- **Reason (<R>)**: "everyone in town goes there"

### Step 2: Analyze the Reason (<R>)
Examine if the provided reason adequately supports the proposition.
- Is the reason conclusive?
- Is it based on proper reasoning?

### Step 3: Identify Types of Defective Arguments
For each type of defective argument, check if the statement fits the criteria:
- **<G> Generalization**: Is the statement based on a generalization of a specific subset?
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: Does the statement claim completeness when it might not be?
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: Does the reason fall short of demonstrating the proposition conclusively?
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: Is the causal basis weak or unconvincing?
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: Is the reason just a repetition of the proposition?
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: Does the statement assume consensus without evidence?
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: Is there ambiguous language that might lead to misinterpretation?

### Step 4: Apply the Definitions to the Statement
Evaluate the specific defects against the statement "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there":

1. **<G> Generalization**: 
   - The statement suggests that the restaurant's popularity is due to attendance by "everyone in town." This could be an over-generalization since it presumes that the behavior of everyone in town is a defining factor of popularity, ignoring the opinions/preferences of others.

2. **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: 
   - The statement does not deal with enumeration; it is not listing possibilities or choices.

3. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: 
   - The reason provided ("everyone in town goes there") may not conclusively establish popularity. Popularity could be due to various factors like quality of food, service, or ambiance.

4. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: 
   - The causal basis seems weak. Just because people go there does not mean the restaurant is intrinsically popular. Other factors like lack of alternatives may play a role.

5. **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: 
   - The reason given is slightly nuanced but does not merely repeat the proposition. It provides a supposed causal link.

6. **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: 
   - The statement presumes that "everyone in town" signifies a universal agreement, which might not be the case. Some people might visit without considering the restaurant popular.

7. **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: 
   - The language is not particularly ambiguous in this context.

### Step 5: Conclusion of Classification
Determine the most fitting defective argument type(s):
- The statement primarily fits <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus) because it assumes universal agreement that “everyone in town goes there,” which is likely still in dispute or not universally true.
- Additionally, <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) applies since the reason "everyone in town goes there" is not inherently compelling enough to establish the restaurant's popularity without considering other factors.

### Final Classification
The given statement "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there" is primarily classified as type <FU> and also shows characteristics of type <WCB>.
