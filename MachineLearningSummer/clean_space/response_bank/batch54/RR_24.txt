Sure, let's proceed step by step to apply the task of decomposing and classifying the provided statement according to the defective argument types.

### Task: Classify the sentence "You have to invite Jenna to your party because it would not be nice not to invite Jenna."

#### Step 1: **Decompose the task into specific steps (D)**
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Determine the main assertion intended to be proven.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Identify the causal basis used to support the Proposition.
3. **Identify if there's a Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Check for any additional arguments corroborating the Reason.
4. **Classify the Argument:** Determine if the argument falls under any defective argument types.

#### Step 2: **Application of the Decomposition (D) to the Task (IDA)**

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - "You have to invite Jenna to your party"

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - "because it would not be nice not to invite Jenna"

3. **Identify if there's a Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - In this case, there is no additional argument provided to support the Reason.

4. **Classify the Argument:**
   - Check for defective argument types:
     - **Generalization (<G>):** Not applicable here; no generalization is made.
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Not applicable; no enumeration of possibilities.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Not applicable; the reason provided is conclusive, though tautological.
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This appears to be the correct classification. The Reason is essentially a restatement of the Proposition.
       - **Proposition (P):** You have to invite Jenna.
       - **Reason (R):** It would not be nice not to invite Jenna. (Restating the obligation without additional reasoning)
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Could be considered here, but the primary issue appears to be the repetition.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Not applicable.
     - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Not applicable; the language is clear but repetitive.

#### Classification:
- The defective argument in this case is **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**.

### Conclusion:
By applying the decomposed steps, we classify the argument "You have to invite Jenna to your party because it would not be nice not to invite Jenna" primarily as a **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** argument. The Reason provided restates the Proposition without adding new information or a compelling causal basis.
