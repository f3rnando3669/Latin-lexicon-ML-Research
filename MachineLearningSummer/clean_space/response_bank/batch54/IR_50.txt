For 
Let's decompose the process of classifying the argument provided into specific steps as per <IDAA>.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Application

**Step 1: Identify and Define the Proposition (P)**
- The Proposition is the main statement or claim that is being made.
- In the provided argument, the Proposition (P) appears to be: "I have no intention of stopping the use of somatostatin on patients suffering from acute pancreatitis."

**Step 2: Identify and Define the Reason (R)**
- The Reason (R) provides the basis for the Proposition, explaining why it should be accepted.
- In this case, the Reason (R) is: "I consider it to be a very reasonable choice."

**Step 3: Identify and Define the Proof of Reason (PR)**
- The Proof of Reason (PR) supports the Reason by providing additional arguments or evidence.
- Here, the Proof of Reason (PR) is: "After all, it has been standard practice in our department for many years and we’ve been quite satisfied with the results we’ve had."

**Step 4: Analyze for Defective Argument Types**
- Now, we need to classify whether the argument falls into any of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

**Step 4a: Check for Generalization (G)**
- Is the Proposition based on a part, but extrapolated to apply to all?
- No, the Proposition is specific to the speaker's intention and does not generalize beyond the department’s practice.

**Step 4b: Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- Is the Proposition based on claims of completeness that miss possibilities?
- No, the argument does not list possibilities and claim completeness.

**Step 4c: Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- Does the Reason fail to conclusively support the Proposition?
- The Reason ("I consider it to be a very reasonable choice") is subjective and lacks substantial evidence by itself, suggesting potential weakness.

**Step 4d: Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- Is the Reason based on an insufficient causal basis?
- Yes, saying it is a "reasonable choice" without specifying why it is medically or scientifically reasonable is weak.

**Step 4e: Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
- Is the Reason merely a repetition of the Proposition?
- No, the Reason ("reasonable choice") and the Proposition ("no intention of stopping") are not identical in expression, though both are subjective.

**Step 4f: Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
- Is the Proof of Reason assuming consensus which is in dispute?
- Yes, claiming that it has been standard practice and that they are satisfied assumes that this consensus is sufficient proof of its appropriateness, which might be disputed.

**Step 4g: Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**
- Is there any ambiguous use of language that could be interpreted differently?
- The terms "reasonable choice" and "satisfied with the results" are somewhat subjective and vague, leading to potential ambiguity.

### Classification:
Based on the above steps, the argument primarily fits into two defective categories:
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The Reason given ("reasonable choice") lacks a strong causal basis.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The Proof of Reason assumes past practice and satisfaction as sufficient without objective evidence.

Thus, the argument can be classified as:
- **<WCB>**, **<FU>**
