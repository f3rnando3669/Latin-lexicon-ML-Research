For 
To apply IDAA to the argument "The best minds in physics have studied physics most of their lives, as it’s necessary to study physics extensively to become a top physicist.", we need to decompose the task of classifying the string using the given defective argument types. Here are the steps:

1. **Identify the main components of the string**:
   - Proposition (\<P>): "The best minds in physics have studied physics most of their lives."
   - Reason (\<R>): "it’s necessary to study physics extensively to become a top physicist."

2. **Analyze the argument for defects**:
   - Is the Proposition (\<P>) based on a broad generalization or an incomplete enumeration?
   - Does the Reason (\<R>) have any logical flaws, inconclusive reasoning, or insufficient causal basis?
   - Is there any repetition of the Proposition within the Reason?
   - Does the argument rely on a presumptuous consensus?
   - Is there any ambiguous language used in the Proof of Reason (\<PR>)?

Let's apply these analyses step by step:

### Step 1: Analyze for Generalization (\<G>)
- The Proposition (\<P>) states that "The best minds in physics have studied physics most of their lives."
- This seems to assert a generalization that applies to all top physicists.

### Step 2: Analyze for Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE>)
- The Proposition does not attempt to enumerate all possibilities, so Incomplete Enumeration does not apply here.

### Step 3: Analyze for Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>)
- The Reason (\<R>) states: "it’s necessary to study physics extensively to become a top physicist."
- This Reason does not conclusively demonstrate why the best minds in physics have studied physics most of their lives. It assumes a necessity without providing conclusive evidence. Therefore, this might meet the criteria for Inconclusive Reason.

### Step 4: Analyze for Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB>)
- The causal basis presented is that studying physics extensively is necessary to become a top physicist. While this seems reasonable, it may not be a compelling causal basis given that other factors (e.g., inherent talent, mentorship) could also contribute to becoming a top physicist.

### Step 5: Analyze for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR>)
- The Reason does repeat the concept from the Proposition that studying physics extensively is connected to being a top physicist. Therefore, it might be considered a repetition, but it is not a precise repetition.

### Step 6: Analyze for Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU>)
- The statement does not invoke a universal consensus to assert its claim, so Presumptuous Consensus does not apply here.

### Step 7: Analyze for Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP>)
- The language in the statement seems clear without obvious ambiguity.

After analyzing these steps, the argument is most closely characterized by the following defective argument types:
- **Generalization (G)**: It generalizes the experiences of "the best minds in physics" to suggest that studying physics extensively is a universal necessity to become a top physicist.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The Reason provided does not conclusively establish the Proposition.

Therefore, the provided statement can be classified as follows:
- **<G> (Generalization)**
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**

By applying IDAA, we have decomposed the task IDA into specific steps and analyzed the statement accordingly, identifying it primarily as a combination of a Generalization and an Inconclusive Reason.
