For 
To apply the decomposition \( <IDAA> \) to the task of classifying the string \( <s> \) as one of the defective argument types, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Break down the conversation:**
    - Mother: It’s bedtime Jane
    - Jane: Mom, how do ants feed their babies?
    - Mother: Don’t know dear, close your eyes now.
    - Jane: But mama, do ant babies cry when they’re hungry?

2. **Identify propositions and reasons:**
    - Proposition (P): Mother suggests it's bedtime.
    - Reason (R): The reason implied is that it is time to sleep and thus Jane should close her eyes.
    - Additional Statements: Jane raises questions about ants feeding their babies and whether ant babies cry when they're hungry.

3. **Analysis of the argument quality:**
    - **Mother's initial proposition (P):** "It’s bedtime Jane" (This is a direct assertion without any explicit support or reasoning given initially).
    - **Jane's inquiry:** This introduces a tangent, asking for information about ants rather than addressing the bedtime statement.
    - **Mother's response to inquiry:** "Don’t know dear, close your eyes now." Here, Mother does not provide reasoning related to why it's bedtime but reiterates the instruction to “close your eyes now.”
    - **Jane's further inquiry:** "But mama, do ant babies cry when they’re hungry?" This continues the tangent and does not engage with the bedtime statement.

4. **Classify the argument type based on definitions:**
    - The main defective argument types to consider based on the conversation could be:
        - \( <RR> \): Faulty Repetition of Proposition
        - \( <WCB> \): Insufficient Causal Basis
    - Evaluate each type:
        - **\( <RR> \)**: Faulty Repetition of Proposition might not strictly apply since Mother does not just repeat that it's bedtime but rather dismisses the question.
        - **\( <WCB> \)**: Insufficient Causal Basis appears more fitting. The reason provided ("close your eyes now") doesn't compellingly support the proposition (that it's bedtime).

**Conclusion:**
Based on the steps and analysis:
\[ s = "Mother: It’s bedtime Jane \newline Jane: Mom, how do ants feed their babies? \newline Mother: Don’t know dear, close your eyes now. \newline Jane: But mama, do ant babies cry when they’re hungry?" \]

The classification of \( s \) is **\( <WCB> \)**: "Insufficient Causal Basis". The Mother's response lacks compelling reasoning to substantiate the initial proposition that it is bedtime.
