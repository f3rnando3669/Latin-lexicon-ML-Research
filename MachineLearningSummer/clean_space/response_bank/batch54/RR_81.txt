For 
Let's apply the decomposition strategy to the task of classifying the fallacy in the given statement step by step.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of the Task (IDAA)

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**
   - **P:** "You must obey the law"

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**
   - **R:** "because it's illegal to break the law"

3. **Proof of Reason (PR)**
   - **PR:** Not explicitly stated, but an assumed understanding that legality determines the necessity of following laws.

### Classification and Analysis (IDA)

4. **Assess the Reason (R) against Potential Defective Argument Types**
   - **Generalization (G):** The statement does not make a broad generalization. It is specific to the concept of obeying the law.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument does not claim to enumerate all possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The Reason does not provide external information or evidence to support why the law should be obeyed, except by restating the initial proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis (because it's illegal) is weak since it doesn't provide a compelling rationale; it just restates that a law exists.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The Reason (illegal to break the law) essentially repeats the Proposition (obey the law) without adding any substantive justification.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument does not appeal to a "universally agreed upon" assertion.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language used is straightforward and not ambiguous.

### Conclusion

Upon examining the statement, the most fitting classification for the fallacy is **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**. The Reason provided merely reiterates the Proposition without offering additional support or a new argument. 

### Answer

The logical fallacy used in the statement "You must obey the law, because it's illegal to break the law" is **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**.
