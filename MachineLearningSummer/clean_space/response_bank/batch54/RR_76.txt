For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the classification task IDA into specific steps) to the string "This is an example of....", we need to break down the task IDA of classifying defective argument types into more manageable and specific steps. Here is how we can proceed:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
First, determine if there is a proposition in the statement. The proposition sets forth summarily what is intended to be proved.

**Operation:**
Examine the sentence "This is an example of...."
Does it set forth what is intended to be proven? 
Since the sentence is incomplete, it does not clearly set forth a proposition.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Next, identify if there is a reason provided that sets forth the causal basis for the proposition, establishing the truth of what is being urged.

**Operation:**
Check if the sentence provides any reasoning or rationale that would establish the truth of a proposition.
Again, the sentence is incomplete and does not provide any reasoning.

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
Determine if the sentence provides a proof of the reason by corroborating it with additional arguments or evidence.

**Operation:**
Evaluate if the sentence offers any corroborative arguments or evidence.
In this case, the sentence does not provide any proof or corroborative arguments as it is incomplete.

### Step 4: Check for Defective Argument Types
Based on the definitions of the defective argument types, classify whether the incomplete sentence can still fit any:

**Operation:**
- Generalization (<G>): The sentence does not make an assertion applicable to all based on a part.
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>): The sentence does not attempt to enumerate possibilities.
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>): The sentence does not provide any reasoning to evaluate.
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>): The sentence does not provide any causal basis for a proposition.
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>): The sentence does not repeat any proposition as reason.
- Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>): The sentence does not assume universal agreement on a disputed matter.
- Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>): The sentence does not present ambiguous use of language as it is incomplete.

Given the analysis, the string "This is an example of...." does not fit any of the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP> directly because it is incomplete and lacks required components for analysis. Therefore, we cannot classify it under any defective argument type with certainty.

### Conclusion
Performing IDAA on the string "This is an example of...." reveals that the sentence is incomplete and lacks enough information to apply any of the defective argument types. It does not sufficiently present a proposition, reason, or proof to be classified as any type of defective argument. The string itself is simply too ambiguous to classify without additional context or completion.
