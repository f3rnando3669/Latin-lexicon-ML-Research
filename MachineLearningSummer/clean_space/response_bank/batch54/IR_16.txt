For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "Although we have proven that the moon is not made of spare ribs, we have not proven that its core cannot be filled with them; therefore, the moon’s core is filled with spare ribs," we first must decompose the task of classifying the argument (IDA) into specific steps (D).

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: 
   Identify what the argument is aiming to prove.
   
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: 
   Identify the causal basis presented for the proposition.
   
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**: 
   Identify any additional arguments corroborating the reason.
   
4. **Check for Defective Argument Types**:
   Evaluate the argument to see if it falls into one of the predefined defective argument types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

Now let us apply these steps to the given string:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
**P**: "The moon’s core is filled with spare ribs."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
**R**: "We have not proven that its core cannot be filled with them."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
**PR**: There is no explicit additional argument presented to corroborate the reason. 

### Step 4: Check for Defective Argument Types
- **Generalization (G)**: The argument doesn’t claim that what's true for some part or majority is true for all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument doesn’t list multiple possibilities while missing out on pertinent ones.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason "We have not proven that its core cannot be filled with them" does not convincingly demonstrate the correctness of "The moon's core is filled with spare ribs."
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The provided reason lacks a compelling causal basis for the proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason is not a mere repetition of the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There is no appeal to universal agreement in the argument.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language used is not ambiguous in different senses.

### Conclusion
The argument is primarily defective due to **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition, and the causal basis is weak since it relies on a lack of disproving rather than providing solid evidence.

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the given argument, we classify it as:
**<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** and **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
