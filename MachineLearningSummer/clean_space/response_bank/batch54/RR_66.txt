For 
To apply IDAA to the statement "Only a mentally ill person would kill someone, so anyone who kills someone is automatically mentally ill," we must decompose the task IDA into specific steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - The proposition in this case is: "Anyone who kills someone is automatically mentally ill."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - The reason given to support the proposition is: "Only a mentally ill person would kill someone."

3. **Identify any Evidence or Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - In this statement, there is no additional argument or evidence provided to support the reason.

4. **Assess Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: There is a sweeping assertion that all killers must be mentally ill without evidence broad enough to substantiate it.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This does not seem to be an enumeration of possibilities, so it's not applicable here.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided does not conclusively prove the proposition since other factors could cause a person to kill.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis (that only mentally ill persons kill) lacks compelling evidence.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The reason is different from the proposition, so this is not applicable.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Although it is asserted without basis, it’s not specifically relying on a presumed universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The language of mental illness could be interpreted in varied ways, but that’s not the primary issue here.

Let's check which among the errors <G>, <IR>, or <WCB> is the most fitting:

- **G (Generalization)**: The statement applies the conclusion to all individuals based on a presumed characteristic of all killers without sufficient evidence.
- **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**: The reason that "Only a mentally ill person would kill someone" does not conclusively support the proposition as it lacks necessary logical or empirical backing.
- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The reason provided lacks a strong causal relationship and does not compellingly substantiate why only mentally ill individuals would kill.

Considering these points, the statement at hand most prominently fits the categories of Generalization (<G>) and Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>). Since Generalization implies an overly broad conclusion, and WCB points out the weak causal reasoning, I would classify this primarily as a **Generalization (<G>)** with an element of **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:

- **Primary Classification**: <G>
- **Secondary Classification**: <WCB>

Thus, the statement "Only a mentally ill person would kill someone, so anyone who kills someone is automatically mentally ill" is primarily a **Generalization (<G>)**.
