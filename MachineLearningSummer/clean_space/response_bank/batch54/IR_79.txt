For 
To apply \( IDAA \) to the string "Beware of appeals made only to your feelings and not to your logic," we need to decompose \( IDA \) into specific steps and then apply these steps to the string in question. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Understand the Definition of Each Defective Argument Type
- **Generalization (\( G \))**: Analyze if the proposition is based on an assertion about a part/majority being applicable to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\( FE \))**: Determine if the proposition claims a complete enumeration but misses some possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \))**: Evaluate if the reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \))**: Assess if the causal basis for the reason is weak or not compelling.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( RR \))**: Check if the reason merely repeats the proposition without adding substantial support.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (\( FU \))**: Examine if the proof of reason assumes certainty based on universal agreement that is still in dispute.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (\( DEP \))**: Verify if the proof of reason can be taken in a different sense than intended by the speaker.

### Step 2: Analyze the String in Question
The string in question is: **"Beware of appeals made only to your feelings and not to your logic."**

### Step 3: Decompose the String
- **Proposition (\( P \))**: The implied proposition is that one should be cautious about arguments that appeal solely to emotions rather than reason.
- **Reason (\( R \))**: The reason behind this caution is the contrast between emotional appeals and logical reasoning.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument in the String
Now we systematically apply the definitions from **Step 1** to evaluate the string:

1. **Generalization (\( G \))**: The string does not appear to make a generalization about a specific subset being applicable to all.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\( FE \))**: The string does not seem to enumerate possibilities exhaustively or otherwise.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \))**: Analyzing the reason, the statement implies that appeals to feelings lack logical support. This may fit, but further analysis is required.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \))**: The causal basis provided (the distinction between feelings and logic) is a general principle used widely in critical thinking; hence it may not be considered compelling without further context.
   
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( RR \))**: The reason does not simply restate the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\( FU \))**: The argument in the string does not claim universality of acceptance.
   
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\( DEP \))**: The language in the string is quite clear in its intent to distinguish between emotional and logical appeals.

### Step 5: Determine the Defective Argument Type
Based on the analysis:

- The most fitting classification appears to be **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \))**. The reason given ("appeals made only to your feelings") may be considered a weak causal basis for the caution advised, primarily because it lacks specific logical support or evidence.

### Conclusion
Therefore, the string **"Beware of appeals made only to your feelings and not to your logic."** is classified as **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \))**.
