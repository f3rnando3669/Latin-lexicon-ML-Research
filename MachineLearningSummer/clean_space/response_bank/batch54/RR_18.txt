To apply the IDAA (decomposition of the classification task into specific steps) to the given string "Everything I say is true. This is true because I said it, and everything I say is true.", we need to systematically break down the process of identifying the type of defective argument.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>

**Proposition (P):** "Everything I say is true."

This is the central assertion that the argument attempts to prove.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>

**Reason (R):** "This is true because I said it."

This is the causal basis provided to establish the truth of the proposition (P).

### Step 3: Analyze the Reason for Proof <PR>

In this case, the reason itself includes the proof: 
**Proof of Reason (PR):** "and everything I say is true."

This is essentially repeating the original proposition.

### Step 4: Identify Defective Argument Types

Now, we classify the given argument by comparing it to the definitions of defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G):** The proposition doesn't consist of an assertion based on a sample, so this is not applicable.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument doesn't deal with enumerating possibilities, so this is not applicable.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason provided doesn't conclusively demonstrate the correctness but is instead circular.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reason "because I said it" is weak as a causal basis.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason is essentially repeating the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** No claim of universal agreement is made, so this is not applicable.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language used is not ambiguous but circular.

Thus, we identify two possible defective argument types:

1. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

### Step 5: Determine the Primary Defective Argument Type

Between the two identified types, the primary fault lies in the fact that the reason is simply restating the proposition, leading to a circular argument.

### Conclusion:

The defective argument type for "Everything I say is true. This is true because I said it, and everything I say is true." is primarily:
**Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
