For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "This fallacy isn’t proof of anything except that you don’t know something," we will decompose the task of classifying the string as one of the defective argument types into specific steps. Let's break the classification task down:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>) of <IDA>:

1. **Identify <P>, <R>, and <PR>:**
   - Determine if the string contains a Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), and Proof of Reason (<PR>).
   
2. **Analyze the string for defective argument types:**
   - Check if <P> is based on generalization, incomplete enumeration, etc.
   - Determine if <R> provided to support <P> is weak, inconclusive, or just a repetition of <P>.
   - Examine if <PR> suffers from presumptions, ambiguity, or other defect types.

### Step-by-Step Application (<IDAA>) for the string:

#### Step 1: Identify <P>, <R>, and <PR>

- **Proposition (<P>):** The string suggests, "This fallacy isn’t proof of anything except that you don’t know something."
- **Reason (<R>):** The Reason here is implicit. It suggests that the observation of the fallacy equates to a lack of knowledge on the part of the opponent.
- **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** The string does not provide an explicit Proof of Reason but assumes that recognizing the fallacy demonstrates a lack of knowledge.

#### Step 2: Analyze the string for defective argument types

- **Generalization (<G>):** The proposition is not asserting something based on one part or a majority and then referring to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The string does not claim to have listed all possibilities or miss out on pertinent ones.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The Reason given, that a fallacy indicates a lack of knowledge, does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition. This could fit <IR> because recognizing a fallacy does not necessarily prove a lack of knowledge; it could be a specific instance or context.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal basis that recognizing a fallacy demonstrates a lack of knowledge is weak because it is not a compelling or detailed argument.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The Reason given seems to restate the Proposition by implying that the fallacy only means a lack of knowledge without adding substantive support.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The proposition doesn't assume that something is universally agreed upon.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The expression “you don’t know something” could be taken ambiguously, meaning it could refer to specific ignorance or general inadequacy, but it is not strongly ambiguous to fit <DEP> conclusively.

#### Step 3: Determine the primary defective argument type

- Given the above analysis, the statement mainly suffers from **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The Reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the truth of the Proposition.
  
### Conclusion:

We classify the string "This fallacy isn’t proof of anything except that you don’t know something" as of type **<IR>** based on the analysis performing <IDAA>. This is because the Reason provided is inconclusive in demonstrating the correctness of the Proposition.
