Sure, let's apply the decomposition steps to classify the given string according to the list of defective arguments (IDA).

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>**
   - <P> typically states what is intended to be proven. Here, the proposition seems to be that University of Virginia professor [Charlotte] Patterson, a leading researcher, has found in her review of 22 studies that offspring of gays did not suffer or show abnormal tendencies to be gay.

**Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>**
   - <R> typically sets forth the causal basis for <P>. The reason given here in support of <P> is Patterson's review of 22 studies.

**Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason <PR>**
   - <PR> corroborates <R> by means of additional arguments. In this case, <PR> might include the details and credibility of the 22 studies reviewed by Patterson.

**Step 4: Identify any defects as per the specified defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>**

Go through the list of defective argument types and cross-check the given argument for each:

### Classification of Argument Defects:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - Not necessarily applicable here; the statement does not extrapolate findings to an unjustifiably broad population.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The argument does not seem to miss out on pertinent possibilities by claiming a complete enumeration. It merely discusses findings within 22 studies without claiming completeness.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The statement that Patterson found no evidence is based on her review of 22 studies. However, from the information given, we cannot determine if that is an inconclusive reason without evaluating the quality and breadth of those studies in more detail.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - This argument does not appear to just restate the proposition as its reasoning.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The causal basis (review of 22 studies) provided could be considered weak if those 22 studies were not comprehensive enough or there are significant studies that contradict her findings which were not reviewed. From the given string alone, this sense would depend on the interpretation.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - This defect might be considered, particularly in how conservatives discredit Patterson by emphasizing her personal background (acknowledged lesbian). This implies a dismissal based on an assumed ideological bias rather than a consensus based on her work.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - There may be ambiguity in language, particularly in the dismissive part regarding her sexual orientation implying bias. However, the argument might hint rather than directly using ambiguous language.

### Argue the Match:

The section where "Conservatives discredit Patterson by pointing out that she is an acknowledged lesbian, with a presumed ideological interest in the subject she studies" might properly fall under Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), where the additional proof is assumed to be disputable or invalid due to a supposed general consensus related to her sexual orientation.

### Conclusion:

Applying <IDAA> to the given string:

"University of Virginia professor [Charlotte] Patterson, considered a leading researcher in the field, says she has reviewed 22 studies involving offspring of gays ranging from toddlers to adults. She found none convincing [sic] that the children had suffered or were more than normally inclined to be gay. [...] Conservatives discredit Patterson by pointing out that she is an acknowledged lesbian, with a presumed ideological interest in the subject she studies."

#### Classified as: Presumptuous Consensus (FU)

### Subsequent Steps:
For deeper validation or refining classification, additional steps may include examining the context of the 22 studies, how they were conducted, their individual conclusions, and the interpretation by the researcher.
