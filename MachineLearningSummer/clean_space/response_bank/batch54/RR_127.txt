Sure, let's apply the decomposition process to classify the given statement "something that kills is deadly" into the appropriate type of defective argument.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

**Step 1: Identify and understand the proposition (\<P\>) and reason (\<R\>)**
- **Proposition (\<P\>)**: What is the statement intending to prove?
  - "something that kills is deadly"
- **Reason (\<R\>)**: What is the causal basis provided?
  - In this case, the assertion that "something that kills" itself acts as the reason.

**Step 2: Analyze if there is a corroboration for the reason (\<PR\>)**
- **Proof of Reason (\<PR\>)**: Is there any additional argument used to corroborate the reason?
  - The statement does not provide any additional arguments beyond the given assertion.

**Step 3: Check for defective argument types**

1. **Generalization (\<G\>)**:
   - **Definition**: Proposition asserts based on a part or majority, applicable to all.
   - **Analysis**: The statement does not really generalize a part to the whole. 

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)**:
   - **Definition**: Claims complete enumeration but misses pertinent possibilities.
   - **Analysis**: There is no enumeration of different possibilities in the statement.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**:
   - **Definition**: The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition.
   - **Analysis**: The reason provided essentially restates the proposition without offering substantive proof or logical backing—a potentially inconclusive rationale.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**:
   - **Definition**: The causal basis submitted is not compelling.
   - **Analysis**: The reason given ("something that kills is deadly") lacks depth and does not offer a robust causal explanation—potentially matches.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)**:
   - **Definition**: Reason repeats the proposition without adding value.
   - **Analysis**: The reason ("kills") is essentially the same as the proposition ("is deadly"). Both are synonymous, indicating this could be the case.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)**:
   - **Definition**: Assumes universal agreement on a disputed claim.
   - **Analysis**: The statement does not rely on presumed consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)**:
   - **Definition**: Ambiguous sense of terms that could be taken wrongly.
   - **Analysis**: The terms "kills" and "deadly" are not particularly ambiguous in this context.

**Step 4: Select the most appropriate defective argument type(s)**
- Based on the analysis:
  - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)**: The reason essentially repeats the proposition using different words.
  - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**: The reason is weak and does not provide substantial causal backing.

### Conclusion

The statement "something that kills is deadly" most closely fits the defective argument types:
- **\<RR\>**: Faulty Repetition of Proposition
- **\<WCB\>**: Insufficient Causal Basis
