Sure! Let's apply the process of decomposing the task of identifying defective argument types (\<IDA\>) to classify the given string "You must obey the law, because it’s illegal to break the law." step by step.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (\<D\>)

1. **Identify Proposition (\<P\>) and Reason (\<R\>)**:
   - Determine the main claim (\<P\>) and the reason (\<R\>) provided to support it.

2. **Classify the Argument Type**:
   - Compare the identified argument components against the definitions of defective argument types (\<G\>, \<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<RR\>, \<WCB\>, \<FU\>, \<DEP\>).

### Application (\<IDAA\>)

1. **Identify Proposition (\<P\>) and Reason (\<R\>)**:
   - **Proposition (\<P\>)**: "You must obey the law"
   - **Reason (\<R\>)**: "because it’s illegal to break the law"

2. **Classify the Argument Type**:
   - **Compare with Generalization (\<G\>)**: This type involves making an assertion based on a subset of cases. The given argument does not rely on such a basis.
   - **Compare with Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)**: This involves missing pertinent possibilities in the reasoning. This does not fit the given argument.
   - **Compare with Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**: This means the reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. Here, the reason seems circular but not inconclusive in isolation.
   - **Compare with Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)**: The reason appears to restate the proposition without adding any new information.
     - Proposition (\<P\>): "You must obey the law"
     - Reason (\<R\>): "because it’s illegal to break the law"
     - The reason given is essentially a restatement of the proposition.
   - **Compare with Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**: Not about compelling causation, but rather the issue here is redundancy.
   - **Compare with Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)**: No assumption of consensus is present.
   - **Compare with Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)**: No ambiguity in the language is detected.

### Result
- The argument "You must obey the law, because it’s illegal to break the law." showcases Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>) since the reason provided merely restates the proposition without providing further justification or reasoning.

Therefore, the classification (\<IDA\>) for this string is \<RR\> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
