For 
To apply the task of identifying defective argument types (IDA) to the given string "My opponent raised a good point, but can we trust him? I mean he just moved to town only 5 months ago, how much could he really know?", we must first break down the string and evaluate it step by step. Here is the step-by-step decomposition (IDAA) of this process:

### Step 1: Identify the Elements and Structure of <s>
- **Proposition (<P>)**: "My opponent raised a good point."
- **Reason (<R>)**: "but can we trust him? He just moved to town only 5 months ago, how much could he really know?"

### Step 2: Analyze the Reason (<R>)
In this step, we need to figure out the nature of the causal basis or reasoning provided after the proposition. 

### Step 3: Classify the Defective Argument Type
#### Evaluate Each Defective Argument Type:
1. **Generalization (G)**: No general rule is being incorrectly applied to everyone here.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: There is no enumeration of possibilities here.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason given is not a concrete logical follow-up to the proposition. 
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The reason given (the opponent just moved to town 5 months ago) is not necessarily a compelling cause that directly invalidates the opponentâ€™s knowledge or trustworthiness.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason does not repeat the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There is no assertion of universality or consensus here.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language used is not particularly ambiguous.

### Step 4: Determine the Closest Match
Compare the criteria and reasoning:

- The reason (the opponent just moved to town 5 months ago) does not convincingly establish that their point is invalid, nor does it conclusively demonstrate they can't be trusted or don't know much. It seems to focus on an irrelevant detail to discredit the opponent.

### Step 5: Conclude the Defective Argument Type
- The most fitting classification based on the identified steps would be **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. The argument uses irrelevant information about how long the opponent has been in town, which does not conclusively address the validity of the opponent's good point.

Hence, the string "My opponent raised a good point, but can we trust him? I mean he just moved to town only 5 months ago, how much could he really know?" is classified as type **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
