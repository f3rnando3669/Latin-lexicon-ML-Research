For 
To classify the given string "Companies that make huge profits must be exploiting their customers because the only way a company could make large profits is by taking advantage of their customers." as one of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP), we will decompose the task into specific steps using IDAA (Application of Decomposition to Identify Defective Arguments):

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The proposition (P) is the assertion or claim that is set forth to be proven.

**Proposition (P):** "Companies that make huge profits must be exploiting their customers."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason (R) is the causal basis provided in support of the proposition (P).

**Reason (R):** "The only way a company could make large profits is by taking advantage of their customers."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
The proof of reason (PR) would be any additional arguments or evidence that corroborate the reason (R). In this statement, there does not appear to be a separate PR provided; the statement is self-contained with P and R.

### Step 4: Analyze the Reason for Defects
Next, we analyze the reason (R) to determine if it aligns with any of the defective argument types.

1. **Generalization (G):** The argument does not seem to rely on generalization from a sample to a whole. 
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This argument does not enumerate possibilities; rather, it presents a single cause.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason provided is conclusive only if the assumption that all companies making large profits exploit customers is true.
   
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reason here assumes a single cause for large profits without considering other possible reasons.
   
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason given is essentially a restatement of the proposition. The reason that "the only way a company could make large profits is by taking advantage of their customers" is just another way of phrasing the proposition that "companies that make huge profits must be exploiting their customers."
   
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument does not assume consensus or refer to universal agreement.
   
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language is not ambiguous; it is quite direct about the claim and reason.

### Step 5: Identify the Defective Argument Type
Based on the analysis, the defective argument type that fits the provided statement is **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** because the reason provided is essentially just a rephrasing of the proposition and does not present an independent, supporting rationale.

### Conclusion
Applying IDAA, we classify the given string as a defective argument of type **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):**

**Classification: RR**
