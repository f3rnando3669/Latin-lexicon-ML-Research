For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying defective arguments) to the string "Why did you steal my keys?", we will proceed by breaking down the task into specific steps and then analyzing the string according to those steps.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
A proposition is the statement that is being argued or the claim being made.

In the string "Why did you steal my keys?", the implied proposition (<P>) can be thought of as: 
- "You stole my keys."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
A reason is the basis given to support the proposition.

In the given string, there is no explicit reason provided for the proposition. The statement is a question, not an argument with an explicit reason.

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
A proof of reason would corroborate the reason given for the proposition, usually supported by additional arguments.

Again, because the original string is a question and lacks an explicit reason, there is no proof of reason provided.

### Step 4: Check for Defective Argument Types
Given that we have identified the implied proposition but found no explicit reason or proof of reason, we must now categorize the proposition for defective argument types.

1. **Generalization (G)**: This is not applicable as the proposition doesnâ€™t generalize from a part to the whole.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This is not applicable as there is no claim of enumerating possibilities in the question.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This is not applicable since there is no explicit reason given.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This is not applicable because of the lack of a reason with a causal basis.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This is not applicable because there is no reason to be repetitively matching the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This is not likely unless there was an implied assumption of universal agreement, which is not present in this question.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: This defective type involves ambiguity in language. 

### Step 5: Consider Context and Implications
Since the primary defect here is related to the nature of the question rather than the construction of an argumentative logic, the biggest potential defect appears to be a presumption embedded within the question itself. The question presumes that the listener has indeed stolen the keys, without providing evidence or reasoning, which can be misleading or assumptive.

### Step 6: Determine Classification
Based on this analysis, "Why did you steal my keys?" can be considered if it conveys some ambiguity or implies guilt without evidence. However, none of the predefined defective argument types perfectly fit without more context. 

However, one might argue it has an element of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** indirectly: the question "Why did you steal my keys?" almost reiterates the unsupported accusation "You stole my keys" as a reason by implication without further substantiation.

**Conclusion:**
"Why did you steal my keys?" indirectly fits the **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** category, as it implies the truth of the proposition without providing actual evidence or additional arguments.
