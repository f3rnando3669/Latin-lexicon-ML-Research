For 
To apply **<IDAA>** to the given string, we need to decompose the task **<IDA>** into specific steps and then perform each step one by one. The goal is to classify the argument provided as one of the defective argument types.

### Steps for Decomposing **<IDA>**:
1. **Identify Protagonists and their Statements:** Identify who is speaking and what they are stating.
2. **Classify Each Statement:** Determine which part of the argument structure (Proposition `<P>`, Reason `<R>`, Proof of Reason `<PR>`) each statement represents.
3. **Analyze Defectiveness:** Compare the statements to the definitions of defective argument types and classify accordingly.

### Applying **<IDAA** to the Given String:

#### Step 1: Identify Protagonists and Their Statements
- **Mom's Statement:** "Remember, dear. Nobody's going to buy the cow if they get the milk for free."
- **Daughter's Responses:**
  - "You are only saying that because you are my mother."
  - "Wait... did you just call me a cow?"

#### Step 2: Classify Each Statement
- **Mom's Statement:** 
  - This appears to be a warning or advice, which could be interpreted as a proposition `<P>` meant to convey a moral lesson.
- **Daughter's Responses:**
  - The first response is a rebuttal, questioning the basis of the mother's statement.
  - The second response questions the implication of the initial proposition.

#### Step 3: Analyze Defectiveness for Each Statement

- **Mom's Proposition (`<P>`):** "Nobody's going to buy the cow if they get the milk for free."
  - **Possible Defective Argument Type:** This appears to be a Generalization (`<G>`) because it applies a specific metaphor to all situations without considering individual circumstances.

- **Daughter's First Response:**
  - **Statement:** "You are only saying that because you are my mother."
  - **Analysis:** This response suggests an ad hominem or bias, but not directly one of the defective argument types given in the list. It does not really fit the predefined defective argument types.

- **Daughter's Second Response:**
  - **Statement:** "Wait... did you just call me a cow?"
  - **Analysis:** This is an emotional or rhetorical response, addressing the unintended implication of the mother's Proposition.

### Conclusion:
The string contains a potential **Generalization (`<G>`)** in the mom's statement. The daughter's responses do not neatly fit into the categories provided. However, since the classification **<IDA>** focuses on the proposition, we will conclude that the provided string should be classified as containing a **Generalization (`<G>`)**.

### Final Classification:

- **Defective Argument Type:** **<G>**

Mom's statement is identified as a Generalization (`<G>`) where the Proposition is based on a metaphor not necessarily applicable to all potential scenarios. The daughter's responses, though relevant to the conversation's emotional and contextual analysis, do not directly introduce new defective argument types within the given definitions.
