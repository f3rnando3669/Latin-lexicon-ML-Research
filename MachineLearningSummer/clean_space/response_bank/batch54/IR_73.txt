For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of classification into specific steps) to the task of classifying the statement "Saying that a compromise between two extremes is the truth" as of type <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>, we'll follow a structured approach:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of the Task:
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Determine the main assertion or claim within the string.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>) and its Proof (<PR>):** Determine the causal basis and any supporting arguments for the proposition.
3. **Define and Understand Defective Argument Types:** Understand the criteria for each defective argument type (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).
4. **Compare the Statement Against Each Defective Argument Type:** Evaluate the statement to see if it matches any of the defective argument types.
5. **Classify the Statement:** Based on the evaluation, classify the statement as one of the defective argument types.

### Application of IDAA to "Saying that a compromise between two extremes is the truth"

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition (<P>): "A compromise between two extremes is the truth."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>) and its Proof (<PR>):**
   - Reason (<R>): The statement implies that the compromise inherently represents the truth because it lies between two extremes.
   - Proof of Reason (<PR>): The statement does not provide additional arguments or proof. It simply asserts the truth of the compromise.

3. **Define and Understand Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** Asserting a generalization based on partial information.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Claiming a complete list of possibilities while missing some.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Providing a reason that does not conclusively prove the proposition.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason is just a restatement of the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal basis is weak or uncompelling.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Assuming something is true because it is "universally agreed upon."
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The proof can be taken in a different way than intended.

4. **Compare the Statement Against Each Defective Argument Type:**
   - **<G>:** The statement does not make a generalization based on partial information.
   - **<FE>:** The statement does not claim a complete enumeration of possibilities.
   - **<IR>:** The reason ("between two extremes is the truth") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. Just because something is a compromise does not mean it is true.
   - **<RR>:** The reason is essentially a restatement of the proposition without additional justification.
   - **<WCB>:** The causal basis (compromise is truth) is not compelling.
   - **<FU>:** The statement does not rely on a premise being universally agreed upon.
   - **<DEP>:** The language used is not particularly ambiguous.

5. **Classify the Statement:**
   - The string "Saying that a compromise between two extremes is the truth" fits primarily under **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** as the reasoning given does not conclusively demonstrate that the compromise is indeed the truth.
   - It also fits <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition) since the reason is essentially a repetition of the original proposition.

### Conclusion
The statement "Saying that a compromise between two extremes is the truth" can be classified as **<IR>** and **<RR>**.
