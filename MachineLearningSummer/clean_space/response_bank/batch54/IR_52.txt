To apply the process of decomposing the task of classifying the given statement as one of the defective argument types, we will break it down step-by-step as follows:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   The proposition (P) is the assertion or statement in the argument that we intend to prove or establish.
   
   - In this case, the implied proposition is: "Global warming is not real."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   The reason (R) is the causal basis or rationale that is provided to support the proposition (P).
   
   - In this case, the reason is: "Dr. X is an engineer, and he doesn’t believe in global warming."

3. **Analyze the Reason (R) in relation to the Proposition (P):**
   We need to determine if the reason (R) presented conclusively supports or proves the proposition (P).

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:**

   - **Generalization (G):** This does not seem to be a generalization because it's not asserting something about all engineers based on a single instance.
   
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This argument does not claim to have made a complete enumeration of possibilities.
   
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason provided ("Dr. X is an engineer, and he doesn’t believe in global warming") may not conclusively demonstrate that global warming is not real. It lacks a connection that would establish the truth of the proposition (P) solely based on the opinion of Dr. X.
   
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The rationale that being an engineer gives Dr. X’s belief in global warming validity is not necessarily a compelling causal basis.
   
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason (R) does not simply restate the proposition (P) in different words.
   
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument does not assume a consensus that is disputed; it relies on the authority of a single individual.
   
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The reason (R) does not appear to be ambiguous in its language.

Given this analysis, the most fitting classification for the statement "Dr. X is an engineer, and he doesn’t believe in global warming" would be **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. The reason provided does not conclusively establish that global warming is not real. The argument relies on the authority of a single individual without sufficient causal link convincing an audience that Dr. X’s belief should be taken as definitive proof.
