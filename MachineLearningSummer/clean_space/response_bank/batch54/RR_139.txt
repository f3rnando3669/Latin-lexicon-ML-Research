For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task into specific steps) to the classification of the string "I shouldn't have flunked the test because I never get F's" as an example of a defective argument, we need to break down the process as follows:

1. **Identify <P> (Proposition)**: Determine what is being asserted.
2. **Identify <R> (Reason)**: Identify the causal basis provided to support the assertion.
3. **Evaluate <R> in relation to <P>**: Check if the reason provided conclusively supports the proposition.
4. **Classify the Argument under the Defective Types**: Compare the structure and content of the argument to the definitions of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Step-by-Step Application of IDAA:

1. **Identify <P> (Proposition)**:
   - Statement: "I shouldn't have flunked the test."
   - <P>: The speaker is asserting that they should not have flunked the test.

2. **Identify <R> (Reason)**:
   - Statement: "because I never get F's."
   - <R>: The causal basis for the assertion is that the speaker claims they never get F's.

3. **Evaluate <R> in relation to <P>**:
   - Evaluate the relationship: The reason given is that the speaker never gets F's. This attempts to justify why the speaker shouldn't have flunked the test.

4. **Classify the Argument under the Defective Types**:
   - Compare with <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition): 
     - <RR>: A weak reason when it appears to be presented as the reason, but says precisely the same as was said in the proposition.
     - Here, the reason given does not provide new information or a true causal basis for the assertion. It simply restates the implication of the proposition in a different form. 
     - Proposition: "I shouldn't have flunked the test" → Assertion that failing is wrong.
     - Reason: "because I never get F's" → Implies that it's unusual or wrong for the speaker to fail.
   - Compare with <IR> (Inconclusive Reason): 
     - <IR>: When the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
     - Here, the reason provided doesn't necessarily prove that the speaker shouldn't have flunked the test; it merely states a personal history or pattern without addressing why the specific instance of the test does not conform to that pattern.

After analyzing, we can determine which defective argument type it falls under:

**The argument "I shouldn't have flunked the test because I never get F's" is an example of <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**. 

The reasoning used essentially repeats the assertion in a different form without providing a new or compelling causal basis for why the proposition is true.
