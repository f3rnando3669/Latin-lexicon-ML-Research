For 
To apply the process of IDAA (decomposition of the IDA task into specific steps) to the statement "A is true because B is true, and B is true because A is true," we will break down the task into logical steps to classify the given argument. Letâ€™s proceed step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the components of the argument

1. **Proposition (P):** "A is true."
2. **Reason (R) for P:** "Because B is true."
3. **Proof of Reason (PR):** "B is true."

### Step 2: Examine the relationship between components

1. **PR for R (Proof of Reason for Reason):** "B is true because A is true."
2. **Recursive Structure:** Notice that B's truth is justified by A, and A's truth is justified by B. This creates a circular reasoning pattern.

### Step 3: Compare with defective argument types

- **Generalization (G):** Not applicable. The argument does not generalize from a specific instance to a whole.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable. There is no frequency list or possibilities enumeration issue.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Potentially applicable. Reason R might be inconclusive because it relies on circular justification.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Potentially applicable. Reason R may lack a compelling causal basis, given that it recycles the initial proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Strongly applicable. The Reason (R) and the Proof of Reason (PR) are fundamentally repeating the initial claim, creating a loop.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Not applicable. The argument does not appeal to consensus.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Not applicable. The language is not ambiguous; it is straightforward but circular.

### Step 4: Conclusion and classification

1. The primary issue with the argument is that it engages in circular reasoning.
2. Specifically, the Reason that "A is true because B is true" and the Proof of Reason that "B is true because A is true" repeat the same assertion mutualistically.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the given argument "A is true because B is true, and B is true because A is true" is best classified as a **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**.
