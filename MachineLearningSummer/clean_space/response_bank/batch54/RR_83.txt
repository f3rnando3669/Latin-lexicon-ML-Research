For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "After years of ignoring God, people have a hard time realizing what is right and what is wrong, what is good and what is bad," we need to break down the task into specific steps for classifying the argument. Let's follow a step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
The proposition is the main statement that is intended to be proven. In this string, <P> is: 
"After years of ignoring God, people have a hard time realizing what is right and what is wrong, what is good and what is bad."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
Next, we look for the causal basis for the proposition. In this string, <R> is implied:
"Ignoring God results in people having a hard time realizing what is right and what is wrong, what is good and what is bad."

### Step 3: Determine if <PR> Exists
Examine if there is a corroborative proof for the reason. In this case, there's no additional argument or evidence provided to support the reason.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument Type
Now, we'll classify the argument based on predefined defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** The proposition may be a generalization. It asserts that all people have trouble identifying right from wrong after ignoring God for years, which is not necessarily applicable to everyone.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Thereâ€™s no claim of a complete enumeration of all possibilities.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** While the reason provided ties the proposition to its cause, it doesn't conclusively demonstrate that ignoring God is the sole or primary cause of moral confusion.
   
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The reason, "Ignoring God causes moral confusion," might lack sufficient causal basis since it assumes a direct link without compelling evidence.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason is not a repetition of the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** There's an implicit suggestion that this view is widely agreed upon, but there's no stated assumption that "it is universally agreed upon."

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The terms "right," "wrong," "good," and "bad" can be ambiguous, but that doesn't directly apply to how proof of reason is presented.

### Step 5: Conclusion of Classification
Given the steps, the classification of the argument within the string "After years of ignoring God, people have a hard time realizing what is right and what is wrong, what is good and what is bad" can be determined as:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** It generalizes the experience of moral confusion to all people who ignore God.
2. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The causal reason provided is not conclusively strong enough to support the assertion made in the proposition.
3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The reason provided lacks a compelling causal basis since it doesn't present sufficient evidence for the claimed effect.

Therefore, the argument presented can be categorized primarily under:
- **Generalization (<G>)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**

The primary classification here would be <IR> and <WCB> due to the weak causal connection and inconclusive strength of the reason provided.
