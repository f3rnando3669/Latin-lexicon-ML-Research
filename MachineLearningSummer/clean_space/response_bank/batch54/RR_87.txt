For 
To apply the process of <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types) to the string "You must obey the law, because it's illegal to break the law," we'll need to decompose the task into more specific steps:

### Decomposition of <IDA> into Specific Steps for <IDAA>:
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) in the Argument:**
   - The proposition is the main statement or claim being made.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>) in the Argument:**
   - The reason is the justification or causal basis for the proposition.

3. **Check for Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Determine if there is any corroboration by means of additional arguments.

4. **Classify any Defective Arguments:**
   - Analyze the argument to classify it as one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

#### Step-by-Step Application to the String:
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition: "You must obey the law."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason: "because it's illegal to break the law."

3. **Check for Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - There isn't any additional proof provided beyond the reason itself in this argument.

4. **Classify any Defective Arguments:**
   - **Examine for Generalization (<G>):**
     - Not applicable here; this argument doesn't rely on a generalization of individuals.
   
   - **Examine for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
     - Not applicable here; this argument doesn't claim to provide a complete enumeration of possibilities.
   
   - **Examine for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
     - The reason does appear to be an inherent tautology rather than an external causal basis, but more accurately, we need to check if the reason provides any real new information to justify the proposition.
   
   - **Examine for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
     - The reason "because it's illegal to break the law" essentially restates the proposition "You must obey the law" without adding any new information as justification. This fits the definition of a faulty repetition.

   - **Examine for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
     - While the causal basis is weak, it is more specifically a repetition of the proposition rather than a separate weak reason.

   - **Examine for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
     - Not applicable here; the argument does not rely on the assumption of universal agreement that is still in dispute.

   - **Examine for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
     - Not applicable here; the argument does not hinge on ambiguity in language.

Based on this analysis, the argument "You must obey the law, because it's illegal to break the law." most accurately falls under:

- **<RR>**: Faulty Repetition of Proposition, as the reason given is simply a restatement of the proposition itself without providing an independent or additional justification.

This completes the application of <IDAA> to the given string.
