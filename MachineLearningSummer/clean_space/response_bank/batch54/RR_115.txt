To apply IDAA (the application of D to IDA) to the argument "The universe has a beginning. Every thing that has a beginning has a cause. Therefore, the universe has a cause called God," we first need to decompose the advanced task of classifying the string <s>. Here's a step-by-step breakdown (D):

### Step 1: Identify the Arguments
- Proposition (<P>): "The universe has a beginning."
- Reason (<R>): "Every thing that has a beginning has a cause."
- Proof of Reason (<PR>): "Therefore, the universe has a cause called God."

### Step 2: Examine for Defective Argument Types

1. **Generalization (G)**: This would involve an assertion applied to all based on some individuals. Here, the argument does not seem to generalize based on some individuals.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This would involve claiming a complete set but missing possibilities. This argument does not list various possibilities but rather focuses on a specific point sequence.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This occurs when the reason doesn't conclusively prove the proposition. Evaluate "Every thing that has a beginning has a cause," and if it conclusively proves "The universe has a cause called God":
    - **Potential Issue:** The jump from "a cause" to specifying "God" as the cause is not conclusively demonstrated. The reason does not conclusively establish "God" as the specific cause, thus making it an IR.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This involves weak reasoning where the causal basis is not compelling. Evaluate if "Every thing that has a beginning has a cause" sufficiently supports "The universe has a cause called God."
    - **Potential Issue:** The basis "has a cause" needs compelling linkage to specifically name the cause as "God." The causal connection is debatable and does not present a compelling argument outlining why the cause must be God.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This involves a reason restating the proposition. Here:
    - It doesn't seem like "The universe has a beginning" is the same as "Every thing that has a beginning has a cause," since they present different information.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Declaring something universally agreed upon without dispute. Here:
    - The argument doesn't cite universal agreement as the grounding for its claims.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Argument taken differently than intended due to ambiguity. Here:
    - There's no clear ambiguous language leading to multiple interpretations noted.

### Step 3: Determine the Most Applicable Defective Argument Types

Given the steps above, the argument "The universe has a beginning. Every thing that has a beginning has a cause. Therefore, the universe has a cause called God" chiefly demonstrates issues with:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning doesn't definitively prove the specific claim that the cause is "God."
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The leap from having "a cause" to specifying "God" as the cause lacks compelling causal foundation.

### Conclusion

Applying IDAA to the argument leads us to classify the string <s> primarily as showing characteristics of:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

These classifications reveal key weaknesses in the argument regarding proving the specific cause and the strength of the causal link to "God."
