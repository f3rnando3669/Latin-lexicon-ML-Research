For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as a defective argument type) to the given statement:

"Stephen Hawking is the smartest scientist on the planet, so if he says global warming is real, it must be true!"

we need to decompose the classification process into specific steps and apply those steps sequentially. Here is how we might proceed:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Components of the Argument:**
   - **Proposition (<P>):** Identify the main assertion or claim being made.
   - **Reason (<R>):** Identify the causal basis or supportive reason for the proposition.
   - **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Identify any additional arguments backing up the reason.

2. **Analyze Each Component for Defective Argument Types:**
   - Check if the proposition (<P>) fits any defective argument types (e.g., Generalization or Incomplete Enumeration).
   - Examine if the reason (<R>) is weak or inconclusive, fitting types such as Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, or Faulty Repetition of Proposition.
   - Assess if the proof of reason (<PR>), if present, fits into types like Presumptuous Consensus or Ambiguous Language Use.

### Applying These Steps:

1. **Identify the Components of the Argument:**
   - **Proposition (<P>):** "Global warming is real."
   - **Reason (<R>):** "Stephen Hawking is the smartest scientist on the planet."
   - **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** There are no additional arguments provided in the statement.

2. **Analyze Each Component for Defective Argument Types:**

   - **Proposition (<P>):** "Global warming is real." This does not immediately fit any defective argument types for a proposition listed (e.g., Generalization or Incomplete Enumeration), but it can often become clearer upon examining the reason.
   
   - **Reason (<R>):** "Stephen Hawking is the smartest scientist on the planet, so if he says global warming is real, it must be true."
     - **Generalization (G):** This does not apply as the claim is not a generalization from a part to the whole.
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This does not apply as the claim does not involve an enumeration of possibilities.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason does not conclusively establish the proposition. The intelligence or expertise of one individual does not inherently validate the correctness of a scientific claim without further evidence.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reason (being the smartest scientist) is not a compelling causal basis to conclude the claim (global warming is real) is true. Expertise in one area does not imply unassailable authority.
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason does not simply repeat the proposition.
   
   - **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** There are no additional arguments provided. No faulty repetition, presumptuous consensus, or ambiguous language use can be identified without a proof of reason.

Based on this analysis, the most fitting defective argument type for the given statement is:

### <IR> Inconclusive Reason
The reason provided (Stephen Hawking's intelligence and status) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (global warming is real).

In summary, the sentence "Stephen Hawking is the smartest scientist on the planet, so if he says global warming is real, it must be true!" contains an **Inconclusive Reason**.
