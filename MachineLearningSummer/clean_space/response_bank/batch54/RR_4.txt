For 
To apply \(IDAA\) to the given string "Why must you always take positions that are so unscientific?", we need to break down the task of classifying the string as one of type \(G\), \(FE\), \(IR\), \(RR\), \(WCB\), \(FU\), or \(DEP\) into specific steps.

### Step-by-step Decomposition (\D) for \(IDA\):

1. **Identify the Proposition (\(P\)):**
   What is the claim or main assertion being made?

2. **Identify the Reason (\R\)):**
   What reasoning is provided to support the Proposition (\(P\))?

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (`PR`):**
   Look for any additional arguments or evidences provided to substantiate the Reason (\(R\)).

4. **Evaluate for Defective Argument Types:**
   Compare the identified \(P\), \(R\), and \(PR\) against the definitions of \(G\), \(FE\), \(IR\), \(RR\), \(WCB\), \(FU\), and \(DEP\).

### Applying \IDAA\) to the string:

1. **Identify the Proposition (\(P\)):**
   In this case, the proposition can be implied as, "Your positions are unscientific."

2. **Identify the Reason (\R\)):**
   No explicit reason is provided in the string, which implies that the assertion of the unscientific nature of the positions is given without substantiation.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\(PR\)):**
   There is no proof provided in the string to support the reasoning.

4. **Evaluate for Defective Argument Types:**
   
   a. **Generalization (\(G\)):**
      - The term "always" suggests a sweeping generalization about the positions being unscientific. This seems to fit as a \(G\) since it generalizes all positions of the person without specific examples.

   b. **Incomplete Enumeration (\(FE\)):**
      - There is no attempt to enumerate all possibilities, so this does not quite fit.

   c. **Inconclusive Reason (\(IR\)):**
      - There is no reasoning provided, so it doesn't fit. However, if considered, the lack of sufficient reasoning to justify the unscientific nature could be conclusive.

   d. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(WCB\)):**
      - Again, due to lack of reasoning, this type doesn't fit directly here.
   
   e. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(RR\)):**
      - This isn't observed in the string, as the reasoning is absent.

   f. **Presumptuous Consensus (\(FU\)):**
      - There is no reference to "universal agreement" so this does not apply.
   
   g. **Ambiguous Language Use (\(DEP\)):**
      - The term "unscientific" could potentially be ambiguous without additional context, but considering the directness, it's a weak fit.

### Conclusion
The most fitting defective argument in this case is:

- **Generalization (\(G\))**: The use of "always" indicates an unfounded generalization.

Thus, we classify the string "Why must you always take positions that are so unscientific?" as type \(G\).
