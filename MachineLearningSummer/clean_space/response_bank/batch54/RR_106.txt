For 
To apply IDAA to the argument "God did not create the world six thousand years ago because matter has always existed, and therefore the world has always existed," we'll begin by decomposing the task of classifying the argument (`IDA`) into specific steps (`D`). 

### Decomposition of IDA (`D`):
1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   Determine the main statement that is being proposed.

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   Find the causal basis or reasoning presented to support the Proposition.

3. **Analyze the Reason (R) for Defects**:
   Assess whether the Reason adheres to any of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

4. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR), if Present**:
   Look for any supportive arguments or evidence corroborating the Reason.

5. **Analyze the Proof of Reason (PR) for Defects**:
   Evaluate whether the Proof of Reason adheres to any of the defective argument types.

### Applying Decomposition Steps to the Argument ("IDAA"):

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The main statement being proposed is:
> "God did not create the world six thousand years ago."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The causal basis or reasoning presented to support the Proposition is:
> "because matter has always existed, and therefore the world has always existed."

#### Step 3: Analyze the Reason (R) for Defects
We need to assess whether the Reason presented is defective.

1. **Generalization (G)**: The Reason does not seem to fall into this category because it is not generalizing from some part to a whole.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The Reason is not listing possibilities but making a claim about matter's existence.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Yes, the Reason might be inconclusive. Simply stating that matter has always existed does not necessarily preclude a divine creation event six thousand years ago; the existence of matter forever does not inherently rule out all possible cosmological events.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Here, the basis for why matter's eternal existence precludes a divine creation is not well-explained. The Reason is weak because it assumes eternal matter equates to the world’s eternal existence without sufficient justification.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The Reason does not appear to repeat the Proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: No claim of universal agreement is made here.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: There is no apparent ambiguity based on language used.

The Reason primarily strikes as an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and an **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

#### Step 4: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR), if Present
The secondary support is:
> "and therefore the world has always existed."

#### Step 5: Analyze the Proof of Reason (PR) for Defects
Assess whether the Proof of Reason itself is defective.

1. **Generalization (G)**: This aspect does not apply directly.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not listing possibilities here.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Yes, reiterating that the world has always existed based on matter's eternal existence lacks conclusiveness.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Again, weak causality—no further evidence connects eternal matter to the eternal world.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This assertion can be considered a restatement by pushing the same idea: eternal matter means an eternal world—no new information.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: No here either.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Language use is consistent with stated ideas.

The Proof of Reason seems to be flawed as **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**.

### Summary Classification:
- The argument's Reason is classified as **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
- The Proof of Reason is classified as **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**.

Applying these steps shows multiple defects in the argumentation structure, weakening the overall argument's persuasiveness.
