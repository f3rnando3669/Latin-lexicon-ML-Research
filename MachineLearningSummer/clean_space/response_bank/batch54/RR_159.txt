For 
To classify the given string "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people." using the task <IDA>, we will apply the advanced task <IDAA>, which is the decomposition of the task into specific steps.

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition (<P>): "We need to fix our broken judicial system."
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason (<R>): "by electing new people."

3. **Assess for the Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):**
     - Does the proposition (<P>) make a sweeping statement based on some part or majority of individuals, but not necessarily applicable to all?
     - In this case, "fixing our broken judicial system" is a sweeping statement, but it does not generalize a part to the whole, so it is not <G>.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
     - Does the proposition claim to enumerate all possibilities but miss some pertinent ones?
     - The statement does not aim to enumerate all possible solutions to fixing the judicial system, so it is not <FE>.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
     - Does the reason (<R>) fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (<P>)?
     - The reason given, "by electing new people," does not conclusively demonstrate that this action will indeed fix the judicial system. Hence, this could be an example of <IR>.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
     - Is the causal basis weak or unconvincing?
     - The causal link between electing new people and fixing the judicial system is not compelling, which suggests <WCB>.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
     - Does the reason simply repeat what was said in the proposition?
     - The reason does not simply repeat the proposition, so it is not <RR>.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
     - Does the proof of reason assume something as universally agreed which is still in dispute?
     - There is no indication in the string that something is presumed to be universally agreed upon, so it is not <FU>.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
     - Can the proof of reason be taken in another sense than intended by the speaker due to ambiguous language?
     - The language here is straightforward and not ambiguous, so it is not <DEP>.

4. **Final Classification:**
   - After evaluating each defective argument type, the most applicable types for the provided string are:
     - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate that electing new people will fix the broken judicial system.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reason (R) lacks a strong causal relationship to the proposition (P).

Therefore, the given string "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people." falls under the defective argument types **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
