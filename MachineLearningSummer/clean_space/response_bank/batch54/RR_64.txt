For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of IDA into specific steps) to the string "Richardson is the most successful mayor the town has ever had because he's the best mayor of our history," we'll follow a structured approach to classify the defect in the argument. Here is how we can go about it step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Proposition and Reason
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - **<P>:** "Richardson is the most successful mayor the town has ever had."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - **<R>:** "He's the best mayor of our history."

### Step 2: Evaluate the Reason's Support for the Proposition
3. **Assess if <R> provides a causal basis for <P>:**
   - <R> should provide a basis that supports the claim made in <P>.

### Step 3: Consider Defective Argument Types
4. **Check for Generalization (<G>):**
   - Nothing in <P> suggests a generalization fallacy as it does not generalize from a sample to a whole group.

5. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - There are no claims about enumerating possibilities, so this does not apply.

6. **Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - This is not a strong candidate since the issue isn't about the inconclusiveness of <R> but the nature of <R> itself.

7. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Although <R> could be seen as insufficiently explaining why Richardson is the most successful, it's not the main issue here.

8. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - <R> essentially repeats what is said in <P> in different wording. "Most successful mayor" is stated as "best mayor," essentially the same idea.

9. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - There's no mention of a consensus or universally agreed upon opinion, so this doesn't apply.

10. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
    - The argument does not hinge on ambiguity in the language.

### Step 4: Make the Classification
11. **Determine the Defective Argument Type:**
    - The argument repeats the proposition in different terms without providing new information. Therefore, the defect is:
      - **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)** because "most successful mayor" and "best mayor" convey the same meaning.

### Conclusion:
The string "Richardson is the most successful mayor the town has ever had because he's the best mayor of our history" is classified as a **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)** according to the IDAA process.
