For 
To apply IDAA to the task of classifying the argument "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity," we need to decompose the task into specific steps and then classify the statement according to the defective argument types defined.

1. **Identify the Proposition (\<P\>)**:
   - Proposition (\<P\>): "Paranormal activity is real"

2. **Identify the Reason (\<R\>)**:
   - Reason (\<R\>): "I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity"

3. **Decompose and Analyze the Reason**:
   - We need to examine whether the given Reason (\<R\>) properly supports the Proposition (\<P\>) or if it falls into one of the defective argument categories.

4. **Classify the Argument**:
   - Compare the structure of this argument with the types of defective arguments: Generalization (\<G\>), Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>), Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>), Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>), Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>), Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>).

Based on the analysis, the argument is structured as follows:
- Proposition (\<P\>): "Paranormal activity is real"
- Reason (\<R\>): "I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity"

Here, the Reason does not provide sufficient causal basis to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition. Individual experience alone does not conclusively establish the reality of paranormal activity for everyone or in general, making the argument fall short of providing compelling evidence.

Given this evaluation, the defective argument type most applicable here would be:

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)**: The Reason (\<R\>) restates the Proposition (\<P\>) in different terms without providing new evidence. The statement "I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity" essentially reiterates "paranormal activity is real" in a subjective manner, thus not adding any compelling causal basis or proof beyond the initial assertion.

Therefore, the argument "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity" classifies as an instance of Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>).

In summary, applying IDAA to the given argument results in:
- **Classification**: Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)
