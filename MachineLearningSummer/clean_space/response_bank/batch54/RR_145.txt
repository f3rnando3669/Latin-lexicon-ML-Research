For 
Certainly! Let's apply <IDAA> to the argument "Students should not be allowed to park in lots now reserved for faculty because those lots should be for faculty only."

**Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDAA>:**

1. **Identify the Proposition (\<P\>):**
   - The proposition (\<P\>) is the statement of what the argument is trying to prove.
   - In this case, the proposition is: "Students should not be allowed to park in lots now reserved for faculty."

2. **Identify the Reason (\<R\>):**
   - The reason (\<R\>) is the causal basis given for the proposition.
   - Here, the reason is: "because those lots should be for faculty only."

3. **Classify the Defect in the Argument:**
   - Now we need to determine if the argument falls into one of the defective argument types (\<G\>, \<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<RR\>, \<WCB\>, \<FU\>, or \<DEP\>).

   - Let's examine the reason provided. The argument states that "those lots should be for faculty only." This appears to be a repetition of the proposition in different words rather than offering a concrete reason or evidence to support the claim.

4. **Determine the Specific Defective Argument Type:**
   - The reason given does not provide new information. It essentially repeats the proposition.
   - According to our definitions, this fits the defective argument type \<RR\> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), where the reason is weak when it appears to be presented as the reason, but says precisely the same as was said in the proposition.

**Conclusion:**

- The argument "Students should not be allowed to park in lots now reserved for faculty because those lots should be for faculty only" is classified as a defective argument of type \<RR\> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), because the reason given simply restates the original proposition without providing additional supporting information or evidence.
