For 
To apply IDAA to classify the defective argument type in the given string, "the reason why more people are leaving this country is because of economic problems, therefore because there is an economic problem is that people are leaving this country," we need to follow a step-by-step approach to decomposition (D) of the classification task (IDA). We will analyze the argument, identify the parts, and check for any defects based on the definitions provided.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D)
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   The proposition is a statement of what is intended to be proved.
   - In this case, the proposition appears to be: "the reason why more people are leaving this country is because of economic problems."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   The reason provides the causal basis for the proposition.
   - Here, the reason looks like: "because of economic problems."

3. **Analyze the Structure of the Argument:**
   Check if the argument follows the expected structure:
   - Is there a Proposition (<P>)?
   - Is there a Reason (<R>)?
   - Is there any attempt at Proof of Reason (<PR>)?

4. **Identify the Argument Type:**
   Based on the definitions of defective arguments, inspect if the argument falls into one of the categories: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Applying Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- "the reason why more people are leaving this country is because of economic problems."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- "because of economic problems."

#### Step 3: Analyze the Structure of the Argument
- The argument states: "the reason why more people are leaving this country is because of economic problems, therefore because there is an economic problem is that people are leaving this country."
- Restating it, it says: <P> “The reason why more people are leaving this country is because of economic problems” followed by a conclusion or reiteration <R> “therefore because there is an economic problem is that people are leaving this country.”

#### Step 4: Identify the Argument Type
- Check for Generalization (<G>): The argument does not generalize from one part to the whole, so <G> is not applicable.
- Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>): The argument does not list out possibilities, so <FE> is not applicable.
- Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>): This is partially applicable but not entirely correct.
- Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>): The reasoning does suggest a causal relationship that might not be compelling; however, this is not the primary issue.
- Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>): The reason seems to restate the proposition without adding new information. Let's scrutinize this more.
  
  - The proposition and the reason are essentially the same:
    - <P>: "the reason why more people are leaving this country is because of economic problems."
    - <R>: "therefore because there is an economic problem is that people are leaving this country."

This repetitive nature, where the reason restates the proposition without adding a new causal basis, strongly aligns with the definition of <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):

**<RR> to be a defective argument type called Faulty Repetition of Proposition where a <R> is weak when it appears to be presented as the <R>, but says precisely the same as was said in the <P>.**

### Conclusion
The given argument is of type <RR>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition.

### Summary
By decomposing the task steps to identify and classify the argument, it is evident that the argument primarily suffers from the defect of repeating the proposition as the reason, thereby falling into the category of <RR>.
