Sure, let's apply the decomposition methodology (<IDAA>) to the task of classifying the provided string "Circular definition: a definition that is circular." using <IDA>.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Identify the main claim or assertion made in the argument.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Look for the reasoning or causal basis provided to support the proposition.
3. **Identify any Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Look for any additional arguments or corroboration supporting the reason.
4. **Classify the Defective Argument**: Determine if the argument fits into one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Applying <IDAA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
    The proposition or main claim in the string is "Circular definition: a definition that is circular."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
    The reason provided for the proposition is "a definition that is circular." Essentially, this just restates the proposition without offering additional information.

3. **Identify any Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
    There is no substantial proof or additional argument provided beyond the repetition of the initial proposition.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument**:
    - **<G> (Generalization)**: This string does not generalize based on one part or majority.
    - **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: This string does not attempt to enumerate possibilities.
    - **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: Could be considered; the reason does not provide a compelling argument.
    - **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: The reasoning is a repetition of the initial proposition.
    - **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: Could be considered; the causal basis is weak but not detailed enough.
    - **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: This string does not assume universal agreement.
    - **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: The language isn't ambiguous; it is circular.

The most fitting classification for the string "Circular definition: a definition that is circular." is:
- **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**

The reason (<R>) provided ("a definition that is circular") is simply a repetition and does not introduce any new information to support the proposition (<P>).

Thus, the final classification is: **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**.
