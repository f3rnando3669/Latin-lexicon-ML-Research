To apply the process of IDAA to the given string "Why should we put people on trial when we know they are guilty?", we'll decompose IDA into specific steps and then execute them systematically.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDA (D):

1. **Identify Proposition (<P>)**: Identify the main statement or claim being made.
2. **Identify Reason (<R>)**: Identify the causal basis provided to support the proposition.
3. **Identify Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Identify any additional arguments that support the reason.
4. **Check for Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: Check if <P> is a sweeping statement based on limited cases.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Check if <P> claims completeness when it misses possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Check if <R> fails to conclusively support <P>.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Check if <R> offers a weak causal basis for <P>.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Check if <R> merely repeats <P> without providing new information.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Check if <PR> assumes agreement without proving it.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Check if <PR> is ambiguous or can be taken in a different sense than intended.

### Application of IDAA:

1. **Identify Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Proposition: "We should not put people on trial when we know they are guilty."
   
2. **Identify Reason (<R>)**:
   - Reason: Implied reason is that the trial is unnecessary if guilt is already known.

3. **Identify Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - There isn't a clear separate <PR> provided in this statement. It hinges on the assumption that knowing guilt makes the trial redundant.

4. **Check for Defective Argument Types**:

   **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - Does the proposition rely on an assertion applicable to some but referred to all?
   - In this case, it asserts something about the necessity of trials for all guilty individuals based on a specific situation. This could be a form of generalization.

   **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - Does it claim completeness but miss possibilities?
   - This argument does not enumerate all possible scenarios (e.g., procedural justice, legal requirements). So, it could be considered an incomplete enumeration.

   **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - Is the reason insufficient to demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
   - The reason does not address why a trial might still be necessary (legal processes, rights to a fair trial), making it inconclusive.

   **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - Is the causal basis weak?
   - The causal basis may be seen as insufficient because it overlooks other factors that necessitate a trial aside from knowing guilt.

   **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - Does the reason merely repeat the proposition?
   - The reason does not repeat the proposition. It provides a linked thought but not a repetition.

   **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - Does it assume agreement without proving it?
   - There is an implicit presumption that knowing guilt makes a trial unnecessary, without an argument establishing why this should be universally accepted.

   **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
   - Is the proof ambiguous or can be taken differently than intended?
   - The statement isn't particularly ambiguous. It's quite direct in its implication.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the argument in "Why should we put people on trial when we know they are guilty?" primarily exhibits characteristics of:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: It fails to consider other essential aspects of why trials are necessary.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided is insufficient to conclusively support the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis (knowing guilt) is weak as it ignores legal and procedural necessities.

Thus, using IDAA, we classify this string as primarily fitting types <FE>, <IR>, and <WCB>.
