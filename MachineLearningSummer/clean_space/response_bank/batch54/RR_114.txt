For 
To apply IDAA to the string "It is what it is!", we need to decompose the advanced task (IDA) of classifying this string into specific steps. Let's break it down:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
In order to classify the argument type, we first need to determine if there is a clear proposition or assertion made in the string. 

In the case of "It is what it is!", the proposition <P> is "It is what it is."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
Next, we attempt to find a reason given to support the proposition. 

In "It is what it is!", a reason <R> does not seem to be explicitly provided. The statement appears to stand alone without further justification or explanation.

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason <PR>
Determine if there is any corroboration or proof offered to substantiate the reason.

Since no reason <R> is given, there also cannot be a proof of reason <PR> in this instance.

### Step 4: Check for Defective Argument Types
At this stage, we need to classify the argument based on the identified defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: The statement does not generalize anything about multiple individuals or groups; therefore, it is not a generalization.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: There is no enumeration of possibilities; hence FE is not applicable.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: There is no reason <R> provided, so it cannot be inconclusive.
   
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Without a reason <R>, there is no causal basis to be evaluated.
   
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: "It is what it is!" essentially repeats the same idea within itself. It does not offer a reason different from the proposition but rather restates it.
   
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The statement does not rely on any assumed consensus.
   
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The statement does not use ambiguous language that can be interpreted in different ways.

### Step 5: Conclusion
Based on the above analysis, we classify the string "It is what it is!" under the defective argument type **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** because it merely repeats the proposition without providing any further reasoning or support.

So, applying IDAA to the given string results in the classification: **RR**.
