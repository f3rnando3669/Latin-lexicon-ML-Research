To apply IDAA (the application of task decomposition to the classification task IDA), we need to follow a systematic breakdown of the task of classifying the string as of a specific defective argument type. Here are the steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - **Step:** Determine the main assertion or claim in the given string.
   - **Application:** The proposition is: "Cell phones, high-tech devices that cause severe distractions and cyberbullying, should be banned in schools."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - **Step:** Identify the causal basis or reasons that support the proposition.
   - **Application:** The reasons given are: "cause severe distractions" and "cyberbullying."

3. **Identify the Type of Defective Argument:**
   - **Step:** Compare the proposition and reason to the definitions of each defective argument type (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).
   - **Application:** Analyze the reasoning to see if it fits any of the defective argument types.

4. **Classify the Argument:**

   - **For Generalization (<G>):**
     - **Criteria:** Is the assertion based on a part or majority of individuals but not applicable to all?
     - **Analysis:** The statement generalizes the behavior of cell phones as disruptive and contributing to cyberbullying for all school contexts, which might not be universally true. However, this argument applies to all cell phones in schools immediately without stating specific instances or data.
     
   - **For Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
     - **Criteria:** Is the enumeration of possibilities incomplete?
     - **Analysis:** The argument doesn't enumerate all potential negative effects or counterarguments but focuses on distractions and cyberbullying.
     
   - **For Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
     - **Criteria:** Does the reason conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
     - **Analysis:** The reasons provided (distractions and cyberbullying) are problematic but may not conclusively demonstrate that banning phones is the only or best solution.
     
   - **For Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
     - **Criteria:** Is the causal basis for the proposition compelling?
     - **Analysis:** Whether these reasons are sufficient for a ban could be debatable, as the link between phones and the issues may not be strong enough to justify a complete ban.
     
   - **For Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
     - **Criteria:** Does the reason repeat the proposition?
     - **Analysis:** The reasons provided do not simply restate the proposition but add specific harms attributed to cell phones.
     
   - **For Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
     - **Criteria:** Is the proof based on a presumed universal agreement?
     - **Analysis:** The claim does not rely on presumed consensus.
     
   - **For Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
     - **Criteria:** Can the proof be taken in another sense than intended?
     - **Analysis:** Language is relatively clear; does not seem to rely on ambiguous terms.

Given this analysis, the strongest classification appears to be:

- **G (Generalization):** The argument generalizes the negative impact of cell phones in school settings without specifying instances or considering different contexts.

Therefore, the string "Cell phones, high-tech devices that cause severe distractions and cyberbullying, should be banned in schools" is best classified as <G> (Generalization) according to IDAA.
