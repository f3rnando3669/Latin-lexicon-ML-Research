For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string into specific steps), let's proceed with the following steps to classify the given dialogue into the types of defective arguments listed.

1. **Identify the Propositions (<P>) and Reasons (<R>)**:
   - Proposition 1 (<P1>): "Aliens from another planet seeded this planet with life billions of years ago."
   - Reason 1 (<R1>): No explicit reason is given for <P1>; it’s stated as a fact.
   - Proposition 2 (<P2>): "Aliens from another planet seeded that planet with life."
   - Reason 2 (<R2>): This essentially mirrors <P1>.

2. **Examine each argument for defects**:
   - **Argument 1 (Ralphie’s first statement)**:
     - <P1>: Aliens from another planet seeded this planet with life billions of years ago.
     - <R1>: Not provided.

     Here, Ralphie doesn't provide a causal basis (<R>) for his proposition, leaving it as a mere claim without supporting evidence.

   - **Argument 2 (Ralphie's second statement)**:
     - <P2>: Aliens from another planet seeded that planet with life.
     - <R2>: This reason essentially echoes the same proposition stated originally (<P1>).

3. **Identify types of defective arguments in each identified <P> and <R>**:
   - For Argument 1:
     - Lack of an explicit reason makes it unclear, but not easily fitting into one of the listed defective arguments directly from the <P>/<R> pattern.

   - For Argument 2:
     - Here, <P2> is presenting an explanation identical in form to <P1>, making <R2> a faulty repetition of the original proposition (<P1>).
     - This fits the defective argument type **<RR>** (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).

4. **Additional Considerations**:
   - Since the explanation (seeding by aliens) can be seen as a presumption widely debated but not universally agreed upon, there’s another defect present, the **<FU>** (Presumptuous Consensus). This posits a contentious claim as universally accepted.

Based on the IDAA process, we classify the given dialogue as follows:

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Ralphie’s second statement repeats the structure of his first statement without adding a new causal basis or proof.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The claim about aliens is presented as a fact without considering it’s a widely disputed assertion.

Thus, Ralphie’s statements embody defects fitting both the <RR> and <FU> categories.
