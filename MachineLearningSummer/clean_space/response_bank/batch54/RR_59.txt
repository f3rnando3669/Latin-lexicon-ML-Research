For 
To apply the task of <IDAA> to the argument "marijuana shouldn’t be legalized because it wasn’t socially acceptable," we will follow the advanced task decomposition method <D>. Here are the steps to break down the complex task into more straightforward components and then classify the given argument:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The proposition is the assertion or the main claim that is being put forth.
- **Proposition (P):** "marijuana shouldn’t be legalized."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason is the causal basis that supports the proposition.
- **Reason (R):** "it wasn’t socially acceptable."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Argument Structure
Understand whether the Reason (R) as provided conclusively supports or has any defects when viewed in conjunction with the Proposition (P).

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument (IDA)
Using the specific defects defined (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>), classify the defect present in the given argument.

#### Classification of Defective Argument:
1. **Generalization (G):** The argument doesn't attempt to apply characteristics of some individuals to all, so it’s not a case of generalization.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** There is no enumeration of possibilities to miss any relevant ones.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** "It wasn’t socially acceptable" may not conclusively demonstrate why marijuana should not be legalized today, as social acceptability can evolve over time.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reason provided ("it wasn’t socially acceptable") may be considered weak or insufficient because it lacks a compelling evidential causal basis why it shouldn’t be legalized now.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason does not just repeat the proposition in other words.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There’s no presumption of universal agreement.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language here is relatively straightforward, without ambiguity in the intended sense.

Based on the above evaluation, the most fitting classifications are:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition since social acceptability can change over time.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis (social acceptability) is insufficient for substantiating the proposition as it may not be compelling in a current context where social norms may have changed.

### Step 5: Conclusion
The defective argument type primarily fits <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis). 

### Final Classification:
The argument "marijuana shouldn’t be legalized because it wasn’t socially acceptable" is an example of:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
