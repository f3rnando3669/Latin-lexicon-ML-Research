For 
To apply the process of <IDAA> to the task of classifying the argument "A is true because A is true," we will decompose the task into specific steps for clarity and then systematically apply these steps to determine the type of defective argument. Here are the steps taken in the decomposition process <D>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine what is being asserted or intended to be proven.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the basis or cause given for the Proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Assess any corroborative arguments provided.
4. **Check for Defective Argument Types**: Determine if the argument matches any predefined defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>).

Let's proceed step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- \( P = \) "A is true"

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- \( R = \) "because A is true"

### Step 3: Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- There is no additional proof given beyond the initial reason.

### Step 4: Check for Defective Argument Types
**Generalization (<G>)**
- Check: Is the assertion based on a sample that is not necessarily applicable to all?
- Evaluation: No, this type does not apply here.

**Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
- Check: Does the argument claim a complete enumeration but miss out on possibilities?
- Evaluation: No, completeness of enumeration is not an issue.

**Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- Check: Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
- Evaluation: This is possibly relevant because the reason does not add any new information or demonstrate why the proposition must be true.

**Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
- Check: Is the causal basis weak?
- Evaluation: This is possibly relevant because the causal basis provided is identical to the proposition, which is inherently weak.

**Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**
- Check: Does the reason essentially repeat the proposition?
- Evaluation: Yes, this fits perfectly. The statement "A is true because A is true" is a clear case of faulty repetition, where the reason does not add any new information to support the proposition.

**Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
- Check: Is a universally agreed-upon statement assumed for disputed matters?
- Evaluation: No, consensus or assumption about universal agreement is not at issue here.

**Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**
- Check: Can the proof be taken in another, unintended sense?
- Evaluation: No, there is no ambiguity in the language used.

### Final Classification

Based on our systematic evaluation of each defective argument type, the argument "A is true because A is true" most closely matches the defective argument type:
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**

### Conclusion
Thus, applying <IDAA> to "A is true because A is true" identifies it as a defective argument of type **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**.
