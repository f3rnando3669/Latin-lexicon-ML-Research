For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument) to "The Philippines is in poverty because of poor people," we need to break down the classification task into specific steps and then classify the argument accordingly.

### Step 1: Identify and Extract the Parts of the Argument
First, we should extract the Proposition (\<P>) and the Reason (\<R>) from the statement.
- **Proposition (\<P>)**: "The Philippines is in poverty."
- **Reason (\<R>)**: "because of poor people."

### Step 2: Check for Each Type of Defective Argument

#### Generalization (\<G>):
- **Definition**: \<P> is an assertion based on some one part or majority of individuals but not necessarily applicable to all.
- **Analysis**: This proposition does not seem to be based on a small subset but rather makes a national-level statement. It does not qualify as a Generalization in this context.

#### Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE>):
- **Definition**: \<P> is defective when we claim to have made a complete enumeration of the possibilities, but actually miss out on some pertinent ones.
- **Analysis**: The proposition does not enumerate all the reasons why The Philippines is in poverty. However, it does not claim to be an exhaustive list, so it's not an incomplete enumeration on its face.

#### Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>):
- **Definition**: \<R> does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of \<P>.
- **Analysis**: The reason given ("because of poor people") does not conclusively demonstrate why The Philippines is in poverty. Poverty involves complex structural, economic, and policy-related factors, and the presence of poor people may be a consequence rather than a cause. Hence, this could be an inconclusive reason.

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB>):
- **Definition**: \<R> is weak if the causal basis which it submits for the \<P> is not compelling.
- **Analysis**: Stating that The Philippines is in poverty "because of poor people" does not provide a compelling causal basis. It is vague and lacks explanatory power about the true causes of poverty.

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR>):
- **Definition**: \<R> is weak when it appears to be presented as the \<R>, but says precisely the same as was said in the \<P>.
- **Analysis**: The Reason given repeats the Proposition in a circular fashion without providing new information or causing a deeper understanding. The concept of "poverty" and "poor people" is essentially the same idea stated differently.

#### Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU>):
- **Definition**: \<PR> is assumed as certain, on the ground that "it is universally agreed upon," a thing which is still in dispute.
- **Analysis**: There is no presumption of consensus in the statement given, so this does not apply here.

#### Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP>):
- **Definition**: \<PR> can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended.
- **Analysis**: The language used is clear and not ambiguous in different interpretations.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the statement "The Philippines is in poverty because of poor people" most likely falls into two categories of defective arguments:
- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>)**: The Reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR>)**: The Reason given is essentially repeating the Proposition without providing new causal information or deeper understanding.

Thus, the classification should be:
**\<IR> and \<RR>.**
