For 
To apply IDAA to the string "What drugs were you on?", we need to decompose the task of classifying this string as one of the defective argument types into specific steps and then apply each step to the string. Hereâ€™s how we can do it:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
First, we need to identify what the intended proposition (<P>) is in the string.

- **Proposition (<P>)**: The string "What drugs were you on?" is implying that the person being questioned was using drugs.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Next, identify if there is a Reason (<R>) that sets forth the causal basis for the proposition. This step is challenging because the string provided is a question, not a complete argument.

- **Reason (<R>)**: The reason is implied and can be interpreted as questioning the state of mind or behavior of the person by implying it may have been influenced by drug use.

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
Then, identify if there is a Proof of Reason (<PR>), which could corroborate the implied reason through additional arguments.

- **Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: The string does not contain an explicit proof or additional arguments. The question asks for a clarification or confirmation.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type (<IDA>)
Based on the identification of <P>, <R>, and <PR>, we can classify the string "What drugs were you on?" into one of the defective argument types.

- **Generalization (G)**: The question does not generalize from a part to a whole.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The question does not attempt to enumerate possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The question does not provide a reason that fails to conclusively demonstrate the proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: There is no repetition of the proposition as a reason.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The question implies causality without providing a compelling causal basis.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There is no claim of universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The question contains ambiguity that could be taken in another sense.

### Conclusion
Considering the analysis:

- The question implies causality without offering evidence or a compelling causal basis.
- It can also be taken in other senses, leading to ambiguity.

Therefore, we will classify the string "What drugs were you on?" under **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** and **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**.

- **Classification**: <WCB>, <DEP>

Final classification: "What drugs were you on?" can be categorized under defective argument types **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** and **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)** due to its lack of a compelling causal basis and potential for multiple interpretations.
