For 
To classify the string "All people from Pinole are liars" using the application of <IDAA>, we need to decompose the task <IDA> into specific steps. Here are the steps we will follow to perform <IDAA>:

1. **Break down the defective argument types:**
   - <G> (Generalization)
   - <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)
   - <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)
   - <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)
   - <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)
   - <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)
   - <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)

2. **Identify the components of the given string <s>:**
   - Proposition (<P>)
   - Reason (<R>)
   - Proof of Reason (<PR>)

3. **Analyze the string to identify which type of defective argument it matches:**
   - Check if it’s a Generalization (<G>).
   - Check if it’s an Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>).
   - Check if the Reason is Inconclusive (<IR>).
   - Check if the Reason is a Faulty Repetition (<RR>).
   - Check if the Reason has an Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).
   - Check if the Proof of Reason is a Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>).
   - Check if there is Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

Now we can apply these steps to "All people from Pinole are liars":

### Step 1: Break down defective argument types

This step is more for understanding and setting up our classification framework. We move to Step 2 directly here with our problem string "All people from Pinole are liars."

### Step 2: Identify the components of the given string

The given string "All people from Pinole are liars" presents a proposition (<P>):
- **Proposition (<P>):** "All people from Pinole are liars."

The string does not provide an explicit Reason (<R>) or Proof of Reason (<PR>).

### Step 3: Analyze the string

#### Check if it’s a Generalization (<G>):
- The proposition "All people from Pinole are liars" makes a sweeping assertion about an entire group of people based on either an unspecified or a singular observation, without evidence. 
- This fits the definition of a defective argument type <G> (Generalization), as it applies a characteristic to all members of a group without sufficient grounding.

#### Check other defective argument types:
- **<FE>:** There’s no enumeration involved here, so this is not an incomplete enumeration.
- **<IR>:** Since there's no Reason provided, we can’t test for an inconclusive reason.
- **<RR>:** There's no repetition of the proposition as a reason.
- **<WCB>:** No reason is given, so insufficient causal basis doesn't apply.
- **<FU>:** No proof or consensus is provided.
- **<DEP>:** There’s no ambiguous language use as the proposition is clear in its intended meaning.

### Conclusion:
The most applicable defective argument type is <G> (Generalization).

Therefore, the string "All people from Pinole are liars" is classified as <G>.
