Certainly! To apply the advanced task of decomposing the classification process for a string (in this case, "Invoke shared values and principles. They call upon the audience’s sense of right and wrong.") into specific steps, we need to follow a structured approach. Here’s how we can break it down:

### Step 1: Analyze the Proposition
- Identify if the given string is a proposition (<P>) that sets forth what needs to be proven.
- Examine if it makes a specific claim that can be evaluated for truth.

**For our string:**
"Invoke shared values and principles." - this segment seems directive but not a clear proposition setting forth what is to be proven.
"They call upon the audience’s sense of right and wrong." - this appears to provide reasoning or rationale but also doesn’t set forth a clear, provable proposition.

### Step 2: Determine the Reason for the Proposition
- Examine the second part of the string to see if it provides a causal basis for any proposition made.
- Identify if it explicitly supports what might have been established in the first part.

**For our string:**
- The second part, "They call upon the audience’s sense of right and wrong," seems to provide reasoning about the invocation of shared values and principles.

### Step 3: Look for Proof of Reason
- Identify any additional arguments or evidence presented to corroborate the reasoning placed forward.

**For our string:**
- The string does not present any explicit proof or additional argument beyond the initial reasoning.

### Step 4: Evaluate for Defective Arguments
- Now we shall check what type of defective argument, if any, is present in the string.

#### Check for Generalization (<G>)
- Does the string assert something about a single part or a subset and incorrectly generalize it to all?
- **No evidence of generalization is present.**

#### Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- Does the string claim to present all possibilities but misses some important ones?
- **No enumeration of possibilities is mentioned.**

#### Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- Does the reasoning provided in the string fail to conclusively demonstrate the proposition (even if implied)?
- **Yes, the reasoning "They call upon the audience’s sense of right and wrong" is rather subjective and does not conclusively demonstrate why invoking shared values and principles would work universally.**

#### Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- Is the causal basis provided for the proposition weak or not compelling?
- **Yes, the justification relies on an assumption about the audience's sense of right and wrong, which may not be universally compelling.**

#### Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
- Does the reason restate the proposition without adding new information?
- **No clear evidence of restating is found as the reason was attempting to supplement the directive given in the proposition.**

#### Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
- Does it assume universal agreement on something still in dispute?
- **Yes, “They call upon the audience’s sense of right and wrong” assumes a universal moral compass which might be debatable and variable among different audiences.**

#### Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)
- Can the statement be interpreted in different senses than intended?
- **No evidence of ambiguous language use in the given context.**

### Step 5: Classification
Based on the above analysis, the string "Invoke shared values and principles. They call upon the audience’s sense of right and wrong." possesses characteristics of multiple defective argument types, prominently:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The justification doesn’t conclusively prove the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal basis is weak as it hinges on a subjective assumption.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** It assumes a universal agreement about invoking shared values based on an assumed common sense of right and wrong.

Final classification: **<IR>**, **<WCB>**, **<FU>**.
