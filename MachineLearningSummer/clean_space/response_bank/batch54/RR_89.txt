For 
To apply the process of identifying the defective argument type (IDA) to the given string "Andanar is unfit for the position because he seems unqualified for it," we start by decomposing the task into specific steps (D) and then methodically applying these steps to the task of identifying the defective argument type (IDAA).

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The first part of our analysis is to identify the proposition (P) that the argument is presenting. 

- **Proposition (P):** "Andanar is unfit for the position."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Next, we identify the reason given to support the proposition.

- **Reason (R):** "because he seems unqualified for it."

### Step 3: Analyze the Reason (<R>)
We now analyze the reason to see if it properly supports the proposition. In particular, we need to check if the reason is a logical basis for the proposition.

### Step 4: Match with Defective Argument Types
We now compare the reason to the list of defective argument types and see if any match:

1. **Generalization (G):** The argument does not seem to be a generalization; it is specific to Andanar.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This type is not applicable as the argument does not list possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason provided, "he seems unqualified," is subjective and based on an impression rather than factual evidence. This could indicate that the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The argument essentially states that Andanar is unfit because he seems unqualified. This is essentially repeating the same idea without giving a substantive basis. 
5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The term "seems unqualified" is weak and not compelling; it does not provide a strong causal basis to support the conclusion.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument does not appeal to a universally agreed notion.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The argument does not contain ambiguous language that could be taken in another sense.

### Step 5: Determine the Most Appropriate Defective Argument Type
Considering the comparison, the argument:
- Lacks a compelling causal basis (WCB), as "seems unqualified" is not a strong reason.
- Repeats the proposition in a slightly different form (RR), as "unfit" and "seems unqualified" are almost equivalent without providing additional support.

Among these, the most salient defective argument type seems to be **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** because the reason essentially restates the proposition without providing independent validation.

### Conclusion
After careful analysis, the defective argument type for the string "Andanar is unfit for the position because he seems unqualified for it," is identified as:

- **<RR>:** Faulty Repetition of Proposition
