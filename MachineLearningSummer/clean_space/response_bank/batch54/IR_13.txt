For 
To apply the process of IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of identifying a defective argument) to the statement "You're not Kenyan enough to be a good leader in Kenya," we need to break down the task into specific steps and then apply those steps. Here is a structured approach:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (IDAA)

1. **Identify the Components:**
   - **Proposition (P):** What is the statement intended to prove?
   - **Reason (R):** What reasons are given to support the proposition?
   - **Proof of Reason (PR):** What additional arguments are provided to support the reason?

2. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (G):** Is a generalization being made from insufficient samples?
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Are possibilities being missed out?
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does the reason fail to conclusively support the proposition?
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the causal link weak?
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Is the reason just a repetition of the proposition?
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Is a consensus improperly assumed?
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Is ambiguous language being used?

### Application to the Statement:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - **Statement:** "You're not Kenyan enough to be a good leader in Kenya."
   - **Proposition:** The individual is not adequately Kenyan to qualify as a good leader for Kenya.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Implicit **Reason:** To be a good leader in Kenya, one must be "Kenyan enough." (Implicit criteria or standards are not clearly defined here.)

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - There isn't a specifically stated additional argument supporting the reason in this statement, making it harder to identify a clear PR.

4. **Check for Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (G):** The assertion "not Kenyan enough to be a good leader" may generalize what it means to be "Kenyan enough" without specifying criteria.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This argument might not consider all aspects of leadership qualities, focusing narrowly on the notion of being "Kenyan enough."
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason provided ("not Kenyan enough") does not conclusively establish why one can't be a good leader. It is vague and doesn't directly correlate with leadership qualities.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The connection between being "Kenyan enough" and being a good leader is not necessarily compelling; cultural or national identity isn't inherently linked to leadership ability.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** There seems to be somewhat of a restatement issue here—the reason "not Kenyan enough" is almost tautological with the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The statement might imply that there is a universal agreement on what it means to be "Kenyan enough," though this is disputable and likely context-dependent.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** "Kenyan enough" is an ambiguous phrase that can be interpreted in various ways—not clearly defined which attributes this entails.

### Conclusion:
The statement "You're not Kenyan enough to be a good leader in Kenya" can be classified under multiple defective argument types, but the most striking ones include:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The provided reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal link between being "Kenyan enough" and being a good leader is weak and not well substantiated.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The phrase "Kenyan enough" is ambiguous and can be interpreted in different ways.

By following the IDAA process, we've analyzed and identified the specific argument defects in the given statement.
