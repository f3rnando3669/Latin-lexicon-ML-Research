To apply the task of decomposing the task of identifying defective arguments (IDAA) to the given string, “I admire the president for being a good role model.” REPLY: “But the New York Times says he’s a lousy role model, so you’re wrong,” we will follow a step-by-step breakdown (D) of the complex task (t) to classify the statement as one of the predefined defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, or DEP).

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P) and Reason (R) in the Original Argument**
- Original Proposition (P): "I admire the president for being a good role model."
- Original Reason (R): The personal admiration and the assertion that the president is a good role model.

**Step 2: Identify the Counterargument and its Proposition (P) and Reason (R)**
- Counterargument Proposition (P): "you’re wrong."
- Counterargument Reason (R): "The New York Times says he’s a lousy role model."

**Step 3: Analyze the Counterargument’s Basis**
- Determine if the Reason (R) presented in the counterargument effectively challenges or refutes the original Proposition (P).

**Step 4: Match the Counterargument to Defective Argument Types**
1. **Generalization (G):** The counterargument does not seem to generalize based on a small or non-representative sample.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The counterargument does not enumerate possibilities but leverages an external authority.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Assess if the Reason (R) provided by the counterargument conclusively disproves the Proposition (P). In this case, citing the New York Times does not logically or conclusively prove that the original assertion ("the president is a good role model") is false; it merely presents an opposing opinion.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The counterargument's basis (the New York Times' opinion) might not be sufficiently compelling as it relies on authority rather than evidence.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** There isn’t a repetitive restating of the same point.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The counterargument assumes that the New York Times' opinion is universally accepted as the truth, although it is still in dispute.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language is not ambiguous but clearly states differing opinions.

**Step 5: Classification Based on Analysis**
- The counterargument could be classified as **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the Reason (R) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition (P). Merely citing the New York Times' differing opinion without additional supporting evidence does not logically invalidate the original claim.
- It may also exhibit traits of **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** to some extent, as it relies on the assumed authority of the New York Times without addressing the underlying claims directly.

Therefore, the best classification for this argument is **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, with a secondary possibility of **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.
