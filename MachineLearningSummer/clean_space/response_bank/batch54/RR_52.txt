Sure, let's decompose the task IDA (classifying the statement as one of the defective argument types) into specific steps and then apply it to the given string "Senator Randall isn't lying when she says she cares about her constituents—she wouldn't lie to people she cares about."

### Decomposition of Task (D):
1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Look at the statement and identify the main assertion or claim.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Determine the reasoning provided to support the Proposition.
3. **Compare the Reason with Known Defective Argument Types**: Analyze the Reason to see if it matches any of the known defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).
4. **Classify the Argument (IDA)**: Based on the analysis, classify the argument under the correct defective argument type.

### Application to the Given String:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
    - The main assertion here is that "Senator Randall isn’t lying when she says she cares about her constituents."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
    - The reasoning provided is "she wouldn’t lie to people she cares about."

3. **Compare the Reason with Known Defective Argument Types**:
    - **Generalization (G)**: This argument does not include a sweeping statement about a group. So it does not match G.
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not miss out on possibilities in a list. It is not an FE.
    - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Let's evaluate if the reason conclusively proves the Proposition.
        - The reason here is based on an assumption about behavior ("she wouldn’t lie to people she cares about"), which may not necessarily be true in all cases or provide conclusive evidence. This seems relevant but requires further consideration.
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Check if the reason simply restates the proposition.
        - The proposition is "she isn't lying," and the reason is "she wouldn’t lie to people she cares about." This appears to be a rewording rather than providing new information or evidence. This is likely RR.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Assess whether the reason is a weak or insufficient causal basis.
        - The causality here is based on an unsubstantiated claim about behavior, suggesting this could also be WCB.
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This argument does not claim universal agreement. It is not FU.
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language does not seem ambiguous. It is not DEP.

4. **Classify the Argument (IDA)**:
    - The most fitting classification appears to be **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** because the reason is essentially a restatement of the proposition, providing no substantial new evidence or argument.
    - An alternative consideration is **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** as the reason does not compellingly validate the proposition based on causality alone.

Considering both observations, the primary classification would be **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** due to the redundancy of the reasoning presented.

### Conclusion:
The defective argument type for "Senator Randall isn't lying when she says she cares about her constituents—she wouldn't lie to people she cares about." is **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**.
