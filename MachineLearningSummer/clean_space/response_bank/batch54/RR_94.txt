For 
To apply IDAA to the string "“You should always do what you are being told because following the rules is important.”", we will decompose the task of classifying the defective argument step by step. Here's the breakdown:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
First, we need to identify the Proposition, <P>, which summarizes what we intend to prove.

**Proposition <P>:** "You should always do what you are being told."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
Next, we identify the Reason, <R>, which sets forth the causal basis for <P>.

**Reason <R>:** "because following the rules is important."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Relationship Between <P> and <R>
Now, we will assess the relationship between <P> and <R> to see if <R> conclusively establishes the truth of <P>.

Evaluating the relationship, we can see that the Reason given ("following the rules is important") does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that "you should always do what you are being told." The Reason emphasizes the importance of following rules but does not establish a conclusive or compelling basis for the absolute statement made in the Proposition.

### Step 4: Classify Defective Argument
Based on the defective argument types given, we need to determine which classification best fits the identified defect.

#### Possible Classifications:
1. **Generalization (<G>)** - Making a broad assertion based on limited evidence.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** - Missing out on pertinent possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** - The Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the Proposition.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** - The Reason presented is weak.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)** - The Reason merely repeats the Proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)** - Assuming something is universally agreed upon without evidence.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)** - The Proof of Reason can be taken in another sense.

Given the evaluation in Step 3:

- The Reason ("because following the rules is important") does not conclusively demonstrate the Proposition ("You should always do what you are being told").
- This fits the classification of **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, where the Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.

Therefore, the classification of the defective argument for the string “You should always do what you are being told because following the rules is important.” is <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
