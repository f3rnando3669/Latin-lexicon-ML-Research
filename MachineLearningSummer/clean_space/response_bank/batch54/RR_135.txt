For 
To apply \( <IDAA> \) to the string "Nike's are great because they're awesome.", we will decompose the task of classifying this string as one of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>) into specific steps. This will help us systematically determine which defective argument type the string corresponds to.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>)
1. **Proposition (<P>):** "Nike's are great"
2. **Reason (<R>):** "because they're awesome"

### Step 2: Identify the Defective Argument Types and Their Characteristics
1. **Generalization (<G>):** The argument applies an assertion about a part or majority to all.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The claim fails to consider all possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The reason for the proposition is weak or not compelling.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason is merely a repetition of the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The proof of reason assumes an unverified consensus.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The proof of reason is ambiguous or unclear.

### Step 3: Analyze the Given String
1. **Check for Generalization (<G>):** The string doesn't make a generalization based on partial observation.
   
2. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The string doesn't enumerate possibilities, so this doesn't apply.

3. **Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reasoning provided ("they're awesome") doesn't add substantive support but rather another subjective term.

4. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The reason "they're awesome" is not a compelling or logical basis to support "Nike's are great".

5. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason "they're awesome" is nearly identical in meaning to "Nike's are great," merely using a synonym.

6. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** There is no claim to universal agreement.

7. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The language, while subjective, is not ambiguous in this context.

### Step 4: Determine the Most Suitable Defective Argument Type
Based on the analysis, the most suitable defective argument type is:

**<RR>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition**

### Conclusion
The string "Nike's are great because they're awesome." is classified as an instance of \( <RR> \) (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), because the reason provided repeats the proposition using different words without offering additional substantive support.
