Certainly! To apply the decomposition of the task of classifying the given statement, "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you," into one of the defective argument types (<IDA> task), we will follow specific steps. Here’s the application of <IDAA>:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The proposition in this statement is: "I’m not going to talk to you."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason given for the proposition is: "My best friend says you’re a liar."

3. **Evaluate if the Reason (<R>) sufficiently supports the Proposition (<P>):**
   - We need to analyze if the reason provided substantiates the proposition logically and conclusively.

4. **Identify Potential Defects in the Argument (<IDA>):**
   - We have to examine if the reason commits any of the known defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Analysis

- **Generalization (<G>):**
  - Does the reason generalize from specific instances inappropriately? Not quite applicable in this context.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
  - Does the argument claim to consider all possibilities but miss relevant ones? No, this doesn't seem to be the issue here since no enumeration of possibilities is involved.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
  - Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition? This warrants further examination.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
  - Is the reason weak in providing a compelling causal basis for the proposition? It appears relevant to check this.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
  - Is the reason merely a rephrased version of the proposition? Not applicable here.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
  - Does the reason assume consensus or agreement when it's actually still controversial? This is related but the key focus should be slightly different.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
  - Is there ambiguous language that could be misinterpreted? This doesn’t seem relevant at first glance.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, determining that “my best friend says you’re a liar” isn't a sufficiently compelling reason to support the proposition “I’m not going to talk to you” because it:
- **Fails to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (<IR>)**.
- **Relies on a weak basis since an assertion by a third party isn’t a strong or compelling causative link (<WCB>)**.

Therefore, the argument can be classified under:
- **<IR> - Inconclusive Reason**
- **<WCB> - Insufficient Causal Basis**

These two defective argument types both apply in this case, as the reason given is insufficient and doesn’t conclusively support the conclusion. Both classifications highlight the weakness in the causal connection between the reason and the proposition.
