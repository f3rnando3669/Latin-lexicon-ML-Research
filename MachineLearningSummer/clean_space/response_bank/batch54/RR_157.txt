To apply IDAA, which involves decomposing the IDA task into specific steps and then applying those steps to identify the nature of a defective argument, we'll break down the task step by step.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine what the claim or assertion is in the given argument.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine what the causal basis or reasoning provided is to support the claim.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Determine any additional arguments or evidence provided to support the Reason.

4. **Evaluate the Argument Types:**
   - Check if the identified <R> or <PR> is defective and categorize the argument into one of the defective argument types: Generalization <G>, Incomplete Enumeration <FE>, Inconclusive Reason <IR>, Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>, Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>, Presumptuous Consensus <FU>, or Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>.

### Applying These Steps to the Provided String:

"The writer, speaker, or an ad supports a claim with restatements of the same claim. (The argument goes around and around in a circle)"

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - <P> is the claim being supported in the argument, but the string does not provide a specific proposition. However, for the sake of this exercise, we can infer that the proposition is implied to be any claim made by the writer, speaker, or ad.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The Reason in the argument is the support provided by restatements of the same claim.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - In this case, no additional evidence or arguments are presented other than the restatement of the claim itself, which could be considered as a faulty form of proof.

4. **Evaluate the Argument Types:**
   - Based on the analysis, the reasoning provided by restating the same claim points to:
   
      **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
      - The argument "goes around and around in a circle," indicating that the Reason given is essentially the same as the Proposition.

### Conclusion:

Based on the steps decomposed and applied, the provided string "The writer, speaker, or an ad supports a claim with restatements of the same claim. (The argument goes around and around in a circle)" is classified as:

- **<RR>** (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)

In this case, the argument is defective because it restates the Proposition as the Reason without providing any new causality or evidence.
