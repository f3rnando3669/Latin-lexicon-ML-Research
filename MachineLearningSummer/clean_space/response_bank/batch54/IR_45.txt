Alright, let's decompose the task of classifying the given string using the defective argument types you've provided. 

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (IDAA) for Classifying Argument:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - "there is no better hobby than cat-juggling."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - "I have been around the block many times, and I have had my share of success."

3. **Assess if there's Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - The string does not present additional arguments to substantiate the Reason directly. Hence no explicit Proof of Reason is provided.

4. **Check for Defective Argument Type:**

   **a. Generalization (<G>):**
   - The Reason is based on the speaker's personal experience ("been around the block many times" and "had my share of success"). It does not explicitly generalize from a part to the whole, so this does not fit <G>.

   **b. Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The argument does not claim to enumerate all possibilities. It merely states a singular opinion based on personal anecdote, so this does not fit <FE>.

   **c. Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The Reason provided ("been around the block many times, and I have had my share of success.") does not directly support the Proposition that "there is no better hobby than cat-juggling." This is more about personal success rather than reasons why cat-juggling is the best hobby. This fits <IR>.

   **d. Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The Reason is not a compelling basis for the hobby's value. Personal success does not logically correlate with the merit of cat-juggling as the best hobby. This fits <WCB>.

   **e. Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - The Reason is not a repetition of the Proposition. The Proposition is about cat-juggling, whereas the Reason is about personal experience. This does not fit <RR>.

   **f. Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - The argument does not assume a consensus. It does not rely on a claim that "everyone agrees" with the Proposition. This does not fit <FU>.

   **g. Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - The terms do not seem to have a different sense than intended. The language is clear insofar as the context provided. This does not fit <DEP>.

### Conclusion:

Based on the steps of decomposition, the argument fits both **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** and **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)** types of defective arguments. The Reason provided does not conclusively support the Proposition, and even if taken into consideration, it is not a compelling causal basis for the claim.
