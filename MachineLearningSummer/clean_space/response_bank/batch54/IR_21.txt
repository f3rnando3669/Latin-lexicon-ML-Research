To approach the task of classifying the string "Have you stopped cheating on your tests?" using the process defined as IDAA, we need to decompose the classification task (IDA) into specific steps. Here is the step-by-step decomposition (D) and application of these steps to the given string:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) for IDA:
1. **Identify the Proposition (P) in the string:** Determine the main proposition being set forth.
2. **Identify the Reason (R) in the string:** Determine if there is a causal basis provided for the proposition.
3. **Identify if there is a Proof of Reason (PR):** Determine if any additional arguments are presented to corroborate the Reason.
4. **Check for Defective Arguments:**
   1. **Generalization (G):** Check if the proposition is a generalization based on an incomplete sample.
   2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Check if the proposition claims completeness but misses some possibilities.
   3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Check if the reason provided does not conclusively support the proposition.
   4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Check if the reason for the proposition is weak or unconvincing.
   5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Check if the reason merely repeats the proposition.
   6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Check if the proof of reason assumes something universally agreed upon that is actually in dispute.
   7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Check if the language in the proof of reason can be interpreted in more than one way.

### Application of Decomposition (D) to the String:
1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - The proposition implied by the question "Have you stopped cheating on your tests?" is that the individual addressed has been cheating on tests.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - There isn't a clear causal basis or reason provided for the proposition within the question itself. The question directly suggests prior cheating without any supporting reason.

3. **Identify if there is a Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - No additional arguments are provided to corroborate the reason.

4. **Check for Defective Arguments:**
   1. **Generalization (G):** The question does not create a generalization from a sample, so this does not apply.
   2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The question does not claim completeness of possibilities, so this does not apply.
   3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** There's no explicit reason given in the question that could be inconclusive.
   4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** There is no causal basis provided, so this does not apply.
   5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Not applicable since no reason is presented that repeats the proposition.
   6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Not applicable since the question does not assume an agreement.
   7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language in the question is loaded and presumes guilt irrespective of an answer. The key ambiguity here lies in its presumption, which leads to ambiguity in intent.

Given these observations, the defective argument type in the question "Have you stopped cheating on your tests?" is akin to Ambiguous Language Use (DEP) because the question presumes without evidence that the person has cheated, thus creating an ambiguous and potentially misleading context. Additionally, the structure of the question is known as a "loaded question" or a "complex question fallacy," which is built on a presupposition that may not be true and forces an answer that implicates guilt regardless of the response.
