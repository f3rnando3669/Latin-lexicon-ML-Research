For 
Applying IDAA (application of decomposition to classify the provided string as one of the defective argument types) to the quote from Plato's Timaeus involves several steps. Let's go through it step-by-step.

### Step 1: Understand and Analyze the Proposition <P>

The proposition <P> in the quote is:
- "We must accept the traditions of the men of old time who affirm themselves to be the offspring of the gods."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>

The reason <R> provided for accepting the proposition is:
- "... they must surely have known their own ancestors." 

### Step 3: Evaluate the Proof of Reason <PR>

The proof of reason <PR> provided in the quote is:
- "... How can we doubt the word of the children of the gods?”

### Step 4: Classify the Argument as One of the Defective Types

We'll need to check the argument against each type of defective argument:

#### Generalization <G>
- The argument does not appear to generalize from a single or a few cases to all cases.

#### Incomplete Enumeration <FE>
- The argument does not seem to suffer from claiming a complete enumeration but missing possibilities.

#### Inconclusive Reason <IR>
- The reason "they must surely have known their own ancestors" may be considered inconclusive. Ancestors knowing their lineage doesn't automatically establish the truth of their divine origin.

#### Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>
- The causal basis—knowing ancestors—may be seen as insufficient for proving divine origin. It does not offer a compelling or scientifically valid basis.

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>
- The reason provided does not simply repeat the proposition. It claims ancestral knowledge as the support.

#### Presumptuous Consensus <FU>
- There is a hint of appealing to tradition and assumed widespread acceptance, but this is more about ancestral knowledge than consensus.

#### Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>
- The terms could be considered ambiguous, but the main critique here is not about ambiguous language but the logic behind the reason.

### Step 5: Conclude the Classification

Considering the defective arguments, the argument primarily suffers from **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

**IR** is evidenced by the non-conclusive claim that the ancients must have known their ancestors, which does not necessarily validate their divine connection.

**WCB** is evidenced by the weak causal link—knowing ancestors does not inherently support the proposition that they were divine offspring.

### Conclusion

The quote "“We must accept the traditions of the men of old time who affirm themselves to be the offspring of the gods - that is what they say - and they must surely have known their own ancestors. How can we doubt the word of the children of the gods?”" can primarily be classified as falling into the defective argument types of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
