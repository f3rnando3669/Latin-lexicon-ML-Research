For 
To apply IDAA (decomposition of the task of classifying a string as a type of defective argument) to the given string "My phone charger is broken because it doesn't work," we need to break down the classification task into specific steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
Identify the part of the string that sets forth what is intended to be proven. 

- **Proposition (P):** "My phone charger is broken."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
Identify the part of the string that provides the causal basis for establishing the truth of what is being urged in <P>.

- **Reason (R):** "because it doesn't work."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Reason <R>
Evaluate if the Reason <R> conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the Proposition <P>.

### Step 4: Check for Defect Types
Compare the Reason <R> and Proposition <P> against the defined defective argument types to see if one fits.

#### Type <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):
- To see if the Reason <R> is a mere repetition of the Proposition <P>.

In this case:
- **Proposition (P):** "My phone charger is broken."
- **Reason (R):** "because it doesn't work."

The Reason "because it doesn't work" is essentially restating the Proposition "My phone charger is broken" using different words but not providing any additional causal information or evidence. Both statements mean the same thing.

### Conclusion
Given that the Reason (R) does not add any new information or causative justification but merely repeats what was already said in the Proposition (P), this argument falls under the defective argument type <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).

### Final Classification
The string "My phone charger is broken because it doesn't work." is classified as type **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**.
