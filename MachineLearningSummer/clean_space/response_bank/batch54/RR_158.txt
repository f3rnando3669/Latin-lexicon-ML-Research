For 
Certainly! Let's apply the process of **IDAA (the application of D to IDA)** to the given string:

**Step 1: Understand and decompose the task**

1. **Identify and understand task IDA (classifying defective argument)**:
    - We need to classify the given string as a type of defective argument.

2. **Decompose the advanced task (D)**:
    - Break down **IDA** into specific steps to systematically analyze and classify the argument.
  
**Step 2: Analyze the given argument string**

Given argument: "It says in the Bible that God exists. Since the Bible is God's word, and God never speaks falsely, then everything in the Bible must be true. So, God must exist."

**Step 3: Break down the argument into components:**

- **Proposition (P):** "God exists."
- **Reason (R):** "The Bible is God's word, and God never speaks falsely."
- **Proof of Reason (PR):** "Therefore, everything in the Bible must be true."

**Step 4: Analyze the Reason (R) and Proof of Reason (PR) for defects**

1. **Check Reason (R)**:
    - **Is it conclusive or defective?** 
        - The reason hinges on accepting the Bible as God's infallible word without substantiating why this should be accepted as a base fact.
    - **Potential defect:**
        - It seems like this reason leads back to the same point without independent substantiation.

2. **Check Proof of Reason (PR)**:
    - **Is it based on additional arguments or is it defective?**
        - PR claims everything in the Bible must be true based on the assertion the Bible is God's word and He doesnâ€™t lie.
    - **Potential defect:**
        - This reasoning is circular; it assumes the conclusion within the premises.

**Step 5: Classify the defective argument type**
  
Based on the analysis:
- The argument assumes the Proposition (God exists) within its Reason (The Bible is God's word, and since God never speaks falsely, God must exist).

The proper classification is **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** because:
- The Reason (R) essentially restates the Proposition (P) instead of providing a new justification.

**Conclusion:**

By applying **IDAA** to the given argument, we classify it as being of the **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)** type.
