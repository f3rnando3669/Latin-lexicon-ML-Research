For 
To apply IDAA (the process of applying the decomposition of a task into specific steps) to IDA (classifying the given argument as one of the defective argument types), we start by breaking down the task into distinct steps. Here is the detailed decomposition and application process for identifying the argument type in the provided statement:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - The argument centers around the assertion that Clinton deleted "33,000" emails.
   - Proposition: "Clinton deleted 33,000 emails."

2. **Identify the Response (R)**:
   - Clinton's response is not addressing the stated Proposition directly.
   - Clinton's Response: "We turned over 35,000 emails."

3. **Examine the Nature of the Response (R)** and Evaluate its Correctness:
   - Clinton's response does not directly address the claim about the deleted emails but instead shifts the focus to the number of emails turned over.
   - This can be seen as avoiding the original claim about the deleted emails.

4. **Determine if the Response (R) Provides Adequate Reasoning**:
   - Clinton's response does not provide reasoning connected to the original Proposition about the deleted emails.
   - The response may be perceived as evasive rather than addressing the central issue.

5. **Examine how the Argument Corresponds to the Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: Not applicable since the statement does not appear to generalize individual actions to a broader group.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable since the statement doesn't claim a complete set of possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Potentially applicable because the response does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness or falsity of the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Not applicable because there is no causal basis argument presented.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Not applicable since the response is not merely a repetition of the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Not applicable since there's no implied universal consensus being claimed.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Not directly applicable since the response doesn't seem to hinge on ambiguous language.

Given the detailed analysis, the classification that best fits the provided statement is:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The response provided by Clinton does not conclusively address the original proposition about the deleted emails, thus leaving the initial claim unverified or unresolved.

Therefore, the defective argument type for the statement "Trump asked Clinton about her “33,000“ deleted emails, but Clinton responds by correcting him rather than addressing the deleted emails: “Not — well, we turned over 35,000, so…”" is classified as **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**.
