For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the classification task IDA into specific steps) to the given string, "Senator Jones wants a strong national defense, but I will not vote for him because he moved to Canada to avoid being drafted for war when he was in college," we will break the task down into steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
The proposition in the statement is:
- "Senator Jones wants a strong national defense."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
The reason provided in the statement is:
- "I will not vote for him because he moved to Canada to avoid being drafted for war when he was in college."

### Step 3: Analyze the Reason <R>
We need to determine if this reason appropriately supports the proposition. The reason provided is not a causal basis for why Senator Jones wants a strong national defense; rather, it is a rationale for not voting for him, which relates to his past actions.

### Step 4: Identify Defective Argument Type
We need to classify the defective argument type if the argument is faulty. Here, we see a classic example of an ad hominem attack, where personal circumstances (moving to Canada to avoid the draft) are used instead of providing a reason that directly challenges the proposition about a strong national defense.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness or incorrectness of the proposition. The personal action of moving to Canada to avoid the draft is unrelated to his stance on national defense.

### Step 5: Validate the Classification
To ensure the classification is correct, we have to check:
- Does the reason conclusively demonstrate the proposition? No.

Thus, based on the definitions provided:
- The reason (R) does not directly challenge the intention set forth in the proposition (P). 
- This makes the argument an <IR> type (Inconclusive Reason).

### Conclusion
After decomposition and detailed analysis, the string "Senator Jones wants a strong national defense, but I will not vote for him because he moved to Canada to avoid being drafted for war when he was in college." can be classified as a defective argument of type:
- <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
