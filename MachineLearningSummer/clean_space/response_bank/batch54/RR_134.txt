For 
To apply the decomposition task \(<IDAA>\) to the task of classifying the given string \(<s>\) "Plagiarism is deceitful because it is dishonest," let's break down the steps:

1. **Understand and identify \(<P>\) and \(<R>\)**:
    - \(<P>\): Proposition that we intend to prove.
    - \(<R>\): Reason that sets forth the causal basis for \(<P>\).

2. **Analyze the provided string**:
    - Given string: "Plagiarism is deceitful because it is dishonest."
    - Proposition (\(<P>\)): "Plagiarism is deceitful."
    - Reason (\(<R>\)): "because it is dishonest."

3. **Verify if the structure fits an argument type as given by the defective argument types**:
    - Check for \(<G>\): Does the proposition suffer from generalization?
    - Check for \(<FE>\): Does the argument claim to have enumerated all possibilities but misses some?
    - Check for \(<IR>\): Is the reasoning given insufficient to conclusively prove the proposition?
    - Check for \(<WCB>\): Is the reason based on an insufficient causal basis?
    - Check for \(<RR>\): Is the reason faulty because it just repeats the proposition in different words?
    - Check for \(<FU>\): Is the proof of reason assumed to be universally agreed upon without proof?
    - Check for \(<DEP>\): Is there any ambiguous language use in the argument?

4. **Evaluate the given string against the defective argument types**:

   - **\(<G>\) Generalization**: No, the proposition does not generalize based on a sample.
   - **\(<FE>\) Incomplete Enumeration**: No, the proposition does not make a claims of exhausting possibilities.
   - **\(<IR>\) Inconclusive Reason**: No, the reason provided relates directly to the proposition but does not fail due to inconclusiveness.
   - **\(<WCB>\) Insufficient Causal Basis**: No, the reason presented is not weak purely because it provides an expected basis.
   - **\(<RR>\) Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: Upon inspection, the reason "it is dishonest" simply repeats what is already contained in the proposition "it is deceitful." Both terms overlap in meaning and provide no additional basis.
   - **\(<FU>\) Presumptuous Consensus**: No, there is no fallacy of assuming universal agreement here.
   - **\(<DEP>\) Ambiguous Language Use**: No, there is no ambiguity in the language used.

5. **Conclusion**: 

   - The reason "it is dishonest" essentially says the same thing as the proposition "it is deceitful."

   Thus, the string "Plagiarism is deceitful because it is dishonest." fits the defective argument type \(<RR>\) (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
