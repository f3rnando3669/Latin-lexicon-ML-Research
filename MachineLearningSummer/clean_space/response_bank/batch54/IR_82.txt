To apply the decomposition of an advanced task (IDAA) to the classification task (IDA) for the string "Using a double standard or arguing for an unjustified exception," we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Parse the String
**Action:** Parse the string to understand its content.
**String:** "Using a double standard or arguing for an unjustified exception."
**Parsing Result:** The string describes a situation where one is applying two different standards to similar situations or making an exception without adequate justification.

### Step 2: Identify the Nature of the Argument
**Action:** Determine the nature of the argument described by the string.
**Nature:** The argument involves applying inconsistent standards or making special cases without solid reasoning.

### Step 3: Compare with Defective Argument Types
**Action:** Compare the characteristics of the string with the definitions of defective argument types.

**1. Generalization (G):** 
   - Assertion based on one part or majority, referring to all.
   - **Comparison:** Not directly related to applying double standards or unjustified exceptions.

**2. Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** 
   - Claiming complete enumeration but missing out on possibilities.
   - **Comparison:** Not applicable, since the argument is not about enumeration.

**3. Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - Reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
   - **Comparison:** Related, but not specific to double standards or exceptions.

**4. Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - Reason's causal basis is not compelling.
   - **Comparison:** Related since unjustified exceptions could be seen as lacking compelling basis, but not specific enough.

**5. Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - Reason repeats the proposition.
   - **Comparison:** Not relevant to double standards or exceptions.

**6. Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - Assuming something is certain because it is "universally agreed upon."
   - **Comparison:** Not relevant to double standards or exceptions.

**7. Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - Proof can be taken in another sense than intended.
   - **Comparison:** Not relevant to double standards or exceptions.

### Step 4: Determine the Best Fit Defective Argument Type
**Action:** Determine the defective argument type that most closely aligns with "Using a double standard or arguing for an unjustified exception."

After comparing, the argument type that best fits is **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** or **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. However, since the string explicitly mentions an "unjustified exception," which implies a weak basis for the exception, **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** more accurately captures the essence of the described argument.

**Classification:** <s> is of type <WCB>.

### Conclusion
The string "Using a double standard or arguing for an unjustified exception" is classified as <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) because it highlights the use of weak or unjustified reasons for applying inconsistencies or exceptions.
