For 
To tackle the task of classifying the argument "All useless laws, such as Reform Bill 13, should be repealed" using IDAA (the application of task decomposition to the classification task), we need to break down the advanced task (t) of identifying defective arguments (IDA) into specific steps (D). Here is the decomposition (D) for this task:

1. **Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**
   - Determine the main claim or assertion being made.

2. **Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)**
   - Determine the causal basis or reasoning provided to support the main claim.

3. **Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**
   - Identify any supporting arguments or evidence provided to support the reason.

4. **Step 4: Evaluate the Argument**
   - Assess the argument based on the identified Proposition, Reason, and Proof of Reason.

5. **Step 5: Classify the Defective Argument Type**
   - Based on the assessment, classify the argument as one of the defective argument types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

### Application of IDAA:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**
- The main claim being made is: "All useless laws should be repealed."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)**
- The reasoning provided is: "Reform Bill 13 is an example of a useless law."

**Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**
- No specific supporting arguments or evidence are provided to support the assertion that Reform Bill 13 is a useless law.

**Step 4: Evaluate the Argument**
- Analyze the completeness and sufficiency of the reasoning and evidence:
  - The Proposition (P) is broad and categorical: "All useless laws should be repealed."
  - The Reason (R) cites a specific example but does not provide conclusive or compelling evidence why Reform Bill 13 is considered a useless law.
  - There is a lack of supporting arguments (PR) to corroborate that Reform Bill 13 is indeed useless. 

**Step 5: Classify the Defective Argument Type**
- Based on the evaluation, the argument exhibits characteristics of a defective argument.
  - The argument makes a broad claim based on a single example without demonstrating that the example is representative of all items in the category being discussed.
  - Therefore, the argument can be classified as <G> (Generalization) because it oversimplifies by taking one example (Reform Bill 13) and extrapolating it to a broader generalization (all useless laws).

### Conclusion:
The argument "All useless laws, such as Reform Bill 13, should be repealed" is classified as a Generalization (G) because it erroneously extrapolates from a single example without sufficient evidence to justify the broader claim.
