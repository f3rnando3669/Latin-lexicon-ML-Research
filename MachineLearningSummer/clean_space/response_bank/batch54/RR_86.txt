To apply the IDAA (decomposition of the task of classifying a string as a type of defective argument) to the string "We know God exists because he made everything," we'll break down the process into specific steps.

### Step-by-Step Application of IDAA to the Given String:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition (<P>) is the part of the argument that sets forth what is intended to be proven.

- In the given string: "We know God exists."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason (<R>) is the part of the argument that provides the causal basis for the proposition, establishing the truth of what is being urged.

- In the given string: "because he made everything."

#### Step 3: Analyze the Sufficiency of the Reason
Determine if the reason sufficiently supports the proposition. To do this, consider the nature of the reason and whether it logically supports the proposition.

#### Step 4: Classify the Type of Defective Argument
Based on the definitions of defective argument types, classify the argument as one of the following: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

Now, let's categorize the defect in the argument:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: This doesn't apply since the argument is not about generalizing a property of a subset to a whole set.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This doesn't apply because there is no mention of enumerating possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This argument potentially falls under this category. The reason given ("he made everything") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition ("God exists"). It assumes the conclusion in the premise, which makes it an inconclusive reason.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This specific argument has a weak causal basis. The given reason is not compellingly established to prove the proposition, but this is closely related to IR.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This doesn't strictly apply as the reason does add some additional information, though weakly.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This doesn't apply as the argument is not based on an assumed universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: This doesn't apply since the language appears clear in its intent and meaning.

Given this analysis, the most fitting classification for the defective argument is:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided for the proposition does not conclusively prove the proposition and relies on an assumption within the premise.

### Conclusion
The string "We know God exists because he made everything" is best classified as an instance of the defective argument type **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**.

By following these steps, we've applied the IDAA framework to systematically classify the given string.
