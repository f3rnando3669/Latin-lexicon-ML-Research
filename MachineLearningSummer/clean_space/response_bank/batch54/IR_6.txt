Applying IDAA to "We're going to celebrate New Year's Eve this way because that's how we've always done it. This is an example of...":

### Step 1: Identify the Task
**Task**: Classify the argument string (s) as one of the defective argument types: <G> (Generalization), <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration), <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis), <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus), or <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use).

### Step 2: Breakdown the Argument
**Proposition (P)**: "We're going to celebrate New Year's Eve this way."
**Reason (R)**: "because that's how we've always done it."

### Step 3: Match with Defective Argument Types
1. **<G> (Generalization)**: The argument doesn't make a broad assertion based on a part or majority applied to all. It's not generalizing, so it's not <G>.
2. **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: The argument isn't about listing possibilities and missing some. It's not attempting an incomplete list, so it's not <FE>.
3. **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: This type indicates that <R> doesn't conclusively support <P>. In this case, "because that's how we've always done it" doesn't effectively justify the decision; it's more of an assertion based on tradition without providing a conclusive reason.
4. **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: The reason should be a restatement of the proposition. Here, the reason isn't exactly the same as the proposition, though it is closely tied.
5. **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The reason provided ("because that's how we've always done it") is weak as it only refers to tradition and doesnâ€™t provide a compelling justification for continuing the practice. It lacks a strong causal basis.
6. **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: The argument isn't claiming universal agreement on the disputed matter. It doesn't employ consensus, so it's not <FU>.
7. **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: There is no language ambiguity that allows the proposition to be taken in another sense than intended. Hence, it's not <DEP>.

### Step 4: Draw a Conclusion
Based on the steps above, the sentiment in "because that's how we've always done it" displays a weak causal basis and does not provide a compelling reason beyond tradition. Hence, it is best classified under:

**Classification**: <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)

**Fully Analyzed Statement**:
"We're going to celebrate New Year's Eve this way because that's how we've always done it. This is an example of <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)."
