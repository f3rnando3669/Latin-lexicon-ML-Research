For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the argument "Running a marathon is very tiring because it is so exhausting," we need to break down and analyze the argument step by step, based on the given definitions and classifications of defective argument types. 

**Step 1: Identify components of the argument**
- **Proposition (<P>):** "Running a marathon is very tiring."
- **Reason (<R>):** "because it is so exhausting."

**Step 2: Check for defective argument types**
Next, we will evaluate the argument to classify it under one (or more) of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP). We check each classification against our argument to see if it fits.

- **Generalization (G):** 
  - This argument type involves making a general assertion based on some individuals, not necessarily all.
  - The argument doesn't seem to be based on a limited sample but is making a universally accepted idea about marathons being tiring, so it doesn't fit this category.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** 
  - This would imply that the argument claims completeness but misses some possibilities.
  - The argument doesn't seem to involve listing possibilities at all, so it doesn't fit this category.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** 
  - Here, the <R> does not conclusively demonstrate the truth of the <P>.
  - Consider: "Running a marathon is very tiring because it is so exhausting." The reason essentially restates the proposition without providing new information, so it doesn't conclusively demonstrate the truth of the proposition. However, it seems closely related to another category.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
  - This involves a reason which isn't compelling.
  - While the reason is repetitive, it's more about how the reason does not add additional understanding rather than being weak based on causality.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
  - Here, the <R> merely repeats the <P> without adding new information.
  - In this case, "because it is so exhausting" is essentially repeating "very tiring" (tiring, exhausting are synonyms) without adding any new justification or evidence. This clearly fits the definition of RR.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
  - The argument assumes something as universally agreed upon which is still in dispute.
  - This isn't applicable here as there is no mention of universal consensus being assumed.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
  - This involves the <PR> being taken in another sense than intended.
  - There is no ambiguity in terms of multiple senses being possible; the repetition is quite clear.

**Step 3: Conclusion**
Based on the above analysis, the argument "Running a marathon is very tiring because it is so exhausting" fits best under the defective argument type **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** because the reason provided merely restates the proposition in different words without adding any new substance or evidence. 

Therefore, the classification <s> for the given argument is **<RR>**.
