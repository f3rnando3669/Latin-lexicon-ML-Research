For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given argument "If there is no objective morality, then all the bad people will not be punished for their bad behavior after death. I don’t like that; therefore, morality must be objective," we need to follow the steps to break down and classify the argument defect. Let's perform <D> on <IDA>:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Analysis

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**
The Proposition is the statement we intend to prove.
- Proposition: "Morality must be objective."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)**
The Reason sets forth the causal basis for the Proposition.
- Reason: "If there is no objective morality, then all the bad people will not be punished for their bad behavior after death."

**Step 3: Examine the Proof of Reason (PR)**
The Proof of Reason corroborates the Reason.
- Proof of Reason: "I don’t like that."

**Step 4: Analyze for Defective Argument Types**
We now classify the argument using the defective argument types defined (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>).

**Step 5: Classify the Argument**
Let's apply this to identify the specific defects:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument does not make a broad claim based on insufficient evidence. Not applicable here.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not claim completeness of enumeration and miss out on pertinent possibilities. Not applicable here.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This could apply if the Reason does not sufficiently support the Proposition. The Reason provided is conditional but does not conclusively establish the objective nature of morality.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The Reason given is weak because it is based on a hypothetical and subjective emotional response ("I don’t like that"), rather than a compelling causal link. This seems to apply.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The Reason doesn't merely repeat the Proposition. Not applicable here.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument does not base the Reason on an assumed universal agreement. Not applicable here.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The argument does not hinge on ambiguous language. Not applicable here.

### Conclusion
The argument "If there is no objective morality, then all the bad people will not be punished for their bad behavior after death. I don’t like that; therefore, morality must be objective." is defective due to **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**. The causal link between not liking a hypothetical consequence and the objective nature of morality is weak and unconvincing.

So, the application of <IDAA> to this argument classifies it as:

- **<WCB>**: Insufficient Causal Basis
