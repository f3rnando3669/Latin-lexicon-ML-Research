For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of the decomposition of a task into specific steps) to <IDA> (the task of classifying a string as a certain type of defective argument) for the string "Order is necessary to justice because justice can only be achieved by a program of social and legal order," we need to take the following steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine what the argument is trying to prove.
   
   - Here, the proposition (\<P\>) is "Order is necessary to justice."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Determine the causal basis provided to support the proposition.
   
   - Here, the reason (\<R\>) is "because justice can only be achieved by a program of social and legal order."

3. **Evaluate the Relationship Between P and R**: Analyze how effectively the reason supports the proposition.

   - We need to assess if the reason (\<R\>) convincingly establishes the truth of the proposition (\<P\>).

4. **Check for Defectiveness**: Classify the argument based on the types of defective arguments defined: 
   - \( G \): Generalization
   - \( FE \): Incomplete Enumeration
   - \( IR \): Inconclusive Reason
   - \( WCB \): Insufficient Causal Basis
   - \( RR \): Faulty Repetition of Proposition
   - \( FU \): Presumptuous Consensus
   - \( DEP \): Ambiguous Language Use

**Evaluate the Example:**
1. **Proposition (P)**: "Order is necessary to justice."
2. **Reason (R)**: "because justice can only be achieved by a program of social and legal order."

Now, let's see how the reason (\<R\>) attempts to establish the proposition (\<P\>).

- The reason given is "because justice can only be achieved by a program of social and legal order," which appears to be essentially repeating the idea in the proposition without providing new causal evidence or rationale.

**Possible Classification of Defectiveness:**
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason (\<R\>) seems to be restating the proposition (\<P\>) without adding any new information that independently supports (\<P\>). It says almost the same thing in different words.

Given this analysis:

1. The proposition (\<P\>) is "Order is necessary to justice."
2. The reason (\<R\>) is "because justice can only be achieved by a program of social and legal order."
3. The reason does not introduce a new causal basis but restates the proposition's idea.

**Conclusion:**
- The argument demonstrates the flawed reasoning categorized as **\( RR \): Faulty Repetition of Proposition**.

Therefore, the string "Order is necessary to justice because justice can only be achieved by a program of social and legal order." is classified as \( RR \) using the <IDAA> approach.
