For 
To apply IDAA (the application of the decomposition of an advanced task into specific steps to the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types), we need to follow a structured approach. Let's decompose the task of identifying defective argument types (IDA) and then apply it to the given string "You can’t prove your candidate will win, so I assume he won’t."

### Decomposition Steps (D) for Identifying Defective Argument Types:

1. **Understand the Proposition (P)**: Identify what the speaker intends to prove or assert.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Look for the causal basis or rationale provided for the Proposition.
3. **Analyze the Proof of Reason (PR)**: Check for corroboration by means of additional arguments for the Reason.
4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**:
   - Determine if the argument is a Generalization (G).
   - Determine if the argument is an Incomplete Enumeration (FE).
   - Determine if the argument has an Inconclusive Reason (IR).
   - Determine if the Reason is a Faulty Repetition of the Proposition (RR).
   - Determine if the argument has Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).
   - Determine if there is a Presumptuous Consensus (FU).
   - Determine if there is an Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

### Applying the Decomposition (IDAA) to the String:

1. **Understand the Proposition (P)**:
   - Proposition: "Your candidate will not win."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - Reason: "You can’t prove your candidate will win."

3. **Analyze the Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   - There is no additional argument provided. The Reason itself is used to support the Proposition.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: This does not seem to be a generalization based on a part or majority applied to all.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not miss out on pertinent possibilities in a complete enumeration.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The Reason ("You can’t prove your candidate will win") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition ("Your candidate will not win"). The inability to prove a future event does not necessitate the conclusion that the event will not happen.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The Reason is not just a repetition of the Proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This is similar to Inconclusive Reason, indicating that the causal basis is weak.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This is not a case where a consensus is presumptuously cited.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language does not appear to be ambiguous in another sense than intended.

### Conclusion:
The string "You can’t prove your candidate will win, so I assume he won’t" appears to best fit the classification of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the Reason provided does not conclusively prove the Proposition.

Thus, the defective argument type for the string "You can’t prove your candidate will win, so I assume he won’t" is <IR>.
