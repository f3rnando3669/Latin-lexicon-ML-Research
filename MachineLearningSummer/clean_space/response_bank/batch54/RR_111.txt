Certainly! To apply IDAA, which is the decomposition of the task IDA (classifying defective arguments) into specific steps, let's analyze the given statement step-by-step.

### Statement:
"God exists because the Bible says so. The Bible is a reliable source because it is the word of God."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- The proposition here is: "God exists."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- The reason provided is: "the Bible says so."

#### Step 3: Analyze the Reason (<R>)
- Determine if the reason conclusively supports the proposition.
- Here, the reason provided is based on the authority of the Bible.

#### Step 4: Identify Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- The proof for the reason is: "The Bible is a reliable source because it is the word of God."

#### Step 5: Check for Defective Argument Types

##### 1. Generalization (<G>)
- Is there an assertion based on some part or majority, but not necessarily applicable to all?
- No, this does not seem to apply here.

##### 2. Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- Is there a claim of having made a complete enumeration of all possibilities, but missed some?
- No, this does not seem to apply here.

##### 3. Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- Does the reason given conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
- The reason ("the Bible says so") does not independently verify the proposition ("God exists") without assuming the truth of the Bible, so it is inconclusive.

##### 4. Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- Is the causal basis weak or not compelling?
- Similar to IR, the causal basis ("the Bible says so") is not compelling as it assumes the Bible's authority without independent evidence.

##### 5. Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
- Does the reason merely repeat the proposition in different words?
- The reason is different from the proposition, so this does not apply.

##### 6. Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
- Is there an assumption that something is certain because "it is universally agreed upon"?
- This does not seem to be claiming universal agreement but rather stating the supposed reliability of a source.

##### 7. Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)
- Can the proof be taken in another sense than the speaker intended?
- There is no ambiguity in the language used. The terms are clear in their intended religious context.

#### Step 6: Classify the Defective Argument Type(s)
- The argument primarily suffers from:
  - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason given does not independently and conclusively support the proposition.
  - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis provided is not compelling as it assumes the authority of the Bible without independent verification.

### Conclusion
The given statement "God exists because the Bible says so. The Bible is a reliable source because it is the word of God" can be classified as containing the defective argument types of Inconclusive Reason (<IR>) and Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).
