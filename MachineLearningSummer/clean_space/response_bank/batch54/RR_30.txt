For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "smoking cigarettes is deadly because cigarettes can kill you," we will decompose the task <IDA> of classifying the string as one of the defective argument types into specific steps. Here is a step-by-step decomposition:

### Step 1: Identify Proposition <P>
Identify the proposition <P> that the argument is trying to establish. In this case, the proposition is:
- "Smoking cigarettes is deadly."

### Step 2: Identify Reason <R>
Identify the causal basis <R> that the argument provides for the proposition <P>.
- "Because cigarettes can kill you."

### Step 3: Evaluate Reason <R>
Determine if the reason <R> provided is conclusive, compelling, repetitive, or ambiguous. We'll consider the defective argument types:
- Generalization (<G>)
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
- Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
- Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)

### Step 4: Classify using Defective Argument Types
Now, let's classify the argument:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** The argument does not generalize from a few instances to all instances, so it doesn't fit this category.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument does not claim to have enumerated all possibilities, so it isn't <FE>.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** 
    - <P>: "Smoking cigarettes is deadly"
    - <R>: "Because cigarettes can kill you."
    - The reason provided ("cigarettes can kill you") does not provide additional information or evidence beyond restating the proposition in a different form. It doesn't add substantial evidence to prove smoking is deadly since it's more of a tautology rather than providing a real causal link or additional proof.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** 
    - The reason does present some causal link ("cigarettes can kill you"), but it's not elaboratively argued or clearly shown how smoking leads to death. Therefore, this could be <WCB>, but it's more of an indication of <RR>.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** 
    - The reason ("because cigarettes can kill you") is essentially a repetition of the proposition stated as "smoking cigarettes is deadly". It doesn't provide new evidence, just restates it in different wording.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** There is no appeal to a universal agreement here, so it isn't <FU>.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** There seems to be no language ambiguity in this statement.

### Step 5: Synthesize and Conclude
After evaluating the categories, the closest fit for the classifier is:

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**

Therefore, applying <IDAA> to "smoking cigarettes is deadly because cigarettes can kill you," we classify it as <RR>.

The string "smoking cigarettes is deadly because cigarettes can kill you" is an example of the Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>) defective argument type.
