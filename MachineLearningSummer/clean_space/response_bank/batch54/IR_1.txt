To apply the decomposition task IDAA to the classification task IDA based on the given argument, we need to break down the advanced task IDA into specific steps. Here’s the step-by-step decomposition:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
- **Proposition (P)**: The statement that we intend to prove.
- In the provided argument: "Exposure to natural sunlight, even exposure resulting in mild sunburn, is significantly less of a cancer risk than brief exposure to the artificial light in a tanning bed."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
- **Reasoning (R)**: The causal basis for the Proposition that establishes its truth.
- In the provided argument: The credibility of Dr. Patricia Mitchell lends support to the proposition.

### Step 3: Identify the Potential Proof of Reason <PR>
- **Proof of Reason (PR)**: Corroborations or additional arguments that support the Reason.
- In the provided argument: The assertion "World-renowned physicist Dr. Patricia Mitchell assures me..." could be seen as appealing to authority, serving as the proof.

### Step 4: Examine Potential Defective Argument Types
- **Generalization (G)**: Is the argument making an assertion about all cases based on a limited sample?
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Did the argument fail to consider relevant possibilities?
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Does the reason fail to conclusively support the proposition?
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Is the causal basis for the reason not compelling enough?
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Does the reason merely restate the proposition?
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Is the proof assumed certain due to a presumed consensus?
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Can the proof be taken in a sense other than intended by the speaker?

### Step 5: Apply the Criteria to the Argument
- **Examine for G**: There's no direct overgeneralization from a sample to a broader population in this specific statement as it's a comparative risk statement.
- **Examine for FE**: The argument does not mention specific exposures to other potential risks — the focus is on natural sunlight vs. tanning beds, but other potential risks still might be unaddressed.
- **Examine for IR**: The Reason (endorsement by Dr. Patricia Mitchell) does not conclusively prove the proposition by scientific or empirical data. Hence this could potentially be an incomplete reason.
- **Examine for WCB**: The endorsement from an expert in itself may not be a compelling causal basis without additional supporting empirical data.
- **Examine for RR**: The reasoning is not a repetition of the proposition.
- **Examine for FU**: The reason assumes the truthfulness because it relies on the reputation of the physicist without addressing any opposing views.
- **Examine for DEP**: There's no clearly ambiguous language usage.

### Step 6: Determine the Most Applicable Defective Types
From the detailed examination:
- **WCB** (Insufficient Causal Basis): The causal basis, reliance on expert authority without empirical data or further scientific argument, may not be compelling enough.
- **FU** (Presumptuous Consensus): It assumes certainty based on "world-renowned physicist" without substantial evidence beyond this authority.

### Conclusion
Based on the step-by-step analysis, the argument "World-renowned physicist Dr. Patricia Mitchell assures me that exposure to natural sunlight, even exposure resulting in mild sunburn, is still significantly less of a cancer risk than brief exposure to the artificial light in a tanning bed. So I make sure to tell all of my friends that if they’re looking to get a tan this summer they should do it outdoors, and not at the tanning salon!" is best classified under **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)** and **FU (Presumptuous Consensus)**.
