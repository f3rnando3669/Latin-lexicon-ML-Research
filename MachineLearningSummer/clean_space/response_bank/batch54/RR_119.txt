For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to the argument "I am athletic because I run, and I run because I'm athletic," we need to decompose the task of classifying the string \(\langle s \rangle\) as of type \(\langle G \rangle\), \(\langle FE \rangle\), \(\langle IR \rangle\), \(\langle RR \rangle\), \(\langle WCB \rangle\), \(\langle FU \rangle\), or \(\langle DEP \rangle\) into specific steps. Here are the steps in \( \text{D} \) to achieve this:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P) and the Reason (R)
- The proposition (\(\langle P \rangle\)) is "I am athletic."
- The reason (\(\langle R \rangle\)) is "I run."

### Step 2: Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(\langle RR \rangle\)) occurs when the reason (\(\langle R \rangle\)) just restates the proposition (\(\langle P \rangle\)) in different words.
- In the argument, "I run because I am athletic" is exactly the same as the proposition "I am athletic" when restated as the reason: "I am athletic because I run."

### Step 3: Verify the Classification
- Compare the identified defect in Step 2 with notes on \(\langle RR \rangle\). The definition of \(\langle RR \rangle\) states, "a \(\langle R \rangle\) is weak when it appears to be presented as the \(\langle R \rangle\), but says precisely the same as was said in the \(\langle P \rangle\)."
- The argument “I am athletic because I run, and I run because I'm athletic” fits precisely this description.

### Step 4: Conclude the Classification
- Given the above steps, the argument fits the type \(\langle RR \rangle\) (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).

Therefore, the string "I am athletic because I run, and I run because I'm athletic" is a defective argument classified as \(\langle RR \rangle\) (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
