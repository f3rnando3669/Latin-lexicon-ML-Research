For 
To apply \( IDAA \) (the application of decomposition to the task of identifying defective arguments) to the statement "You should certainly be the one who washes the dishes -- you are just so good at it!" we will decompose the task of classifying this string into specific steps. 

Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine what we are trying to prove.
    - In this case, the proposition (\( P \)) is: "You should certainly be the one who washes the dishes."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the causal basis for the proposition.
    - The reason (\( R \)) provided is: "You are just so good at it."

3. **Check for Generalization (<G>)**: Is the \( P \) making a general assertion based on one part or a majority?
    - The statement does not appear to generalize from one instance to all instances.
    - Conclusion: Not \( G \).

4. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Is there a claim of complete enumeration that is missing possibilities?
    - There is no enumeration of options missing any pertinent ones.
    - Conclusion: Not \( FE \).

5. **Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Does the \( R \) fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the \( P \)?
    - The reason given ("You are just so good at it") does not conclusively demonstrate that this is sufficient justification for washing dishes. It could be argued that being good at it is not the only or the most crucial factor.
    - Conclusion: This could be \( IR \).

6. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Is the \( R \) a weak causal basis for \( P \)?
    - The reason ("You are just so good at it") might not be compelling enough to justify the claim conclusively. It does not consider other factors such as fairness, responsibility, or sharing of chores.
    - Conclusion: This could be \( WCB \).

7. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Is the \( R \) just a repetition of the \( P \)?
    - The reason given is not a repetition of the proposition.
    - Conclusion: Not \( RR \).

8. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Does the \( PR \) assume consensus on a disputed matter?
    - There is no mention of universal agreement or a consensus here.
    - Conclusion: Not \( FU \).

9. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Can the \( PR \) be taken in another sense?
    - The language used does not appear to be ambiguous here.
    - Conclusion: Not \( DEP \).

Final Classification:
- The statement "You should certainly be the one who washes the dishes -- you are just so good at it!" is identified as an instance of \( IR \) (Inconclusive Reason) and also \( WCB \) (Insufficient Causal Basis). The reason given does not conclusively justify the proposition, and the causal basis is not compelling enough as it oversimplifies the decision-making process.
