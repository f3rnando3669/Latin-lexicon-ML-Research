For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string, we will decompose the task of classifying the argument defects step-by-step. Here’s the process:

### Step 1: Decompose the Argument
First, identify the Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), and Proof of Reason (<PR>) within the given string.

**String:** "The Cardinals are the best football team because they're better than all the other teams. They're better than all the other teams because they're the best."
- **Proposition (<P>):** "The Cardinals are the best football team."
- **Reason (<R>):** "They're better than all the other teams."
- **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** "They're better than all the other teams because they're the best."

### Step 2: Analyze the Reason (<R>)
Next, check if the Reason (<R>) is conclusively demonstrating the correctness of the Proposition (<P>).

- **Proposition (<P>):** "The Cardinals are the best football team."
- **Reason (<R>):** "They're better than all the other teams."

### Step 3: Check for Defective Arguments
Now apply the definitions of defective arguments to see if they fit.

1. **Generalization (<G>):** Not applicable, as this defect relates to broad generalizations from insufficient data which isn't the issue here.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Not applicable, as there’s no enumeration or listing of options.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Could be applicable if the Reason provided is not conclusive.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Could be considered if the causal basis for the Reason is weak.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This seems the most relevant here. The Reason is essentially the same as the Proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Not applicable, as there is no mention of universal agreement.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Not applicable, as ambiguity in language is not the issue.

### Step 4: Identify the Most Relevant Defective Argument
Based on the analysis, the most relevant defective argument type is <RR>.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This is because the Reason ("They're better than all the other teams") is just a rephrasing of the Proposition ("The Cardinals are the best football team"), which makes the argument circular.

### Conclusion
Applying <IDAA> to the given string, we classify the defect of the argument as **<RR>** (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).

So, the complete application of IDAA results in identifying the argument as:
**"Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)."**
