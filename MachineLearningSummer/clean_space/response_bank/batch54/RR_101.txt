Applying IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types) step by step to the statement "You can’t give me a C. I’m an A student!" involves several steps:

### Step 1: Decomposition of the Task (D)
1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   Determine what the main assertion or claim is in the statement.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   Understand the causal basis provided to support the Proposition.

3. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:**
   Based on the identified Proposition and Reason, classify the argument into one of the defective types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

### Step 2: Application of the Decomposition to IDA
1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   In the statement "You can’t give me a C. I’m an A student!", the main assertion is "You can’t give me a C."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   The causal basis provided to support the Proposition is "I’m an A student."

3. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:**
   - **Generalization (G):** No generalization is being made based on a subset of individuals.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** There is no enumeration of possibilities here.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The Reason provided, "I’m an A student," does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition that "You can’t give me a C." Being an "A student" in general does not logically imply that one cannot receive a C on a specific instance or assignment. The causal relationship is weak.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis "I’m an A student" is not compelling or sufficient enough to support the conclusion "You can’t give me a C." This also fits; however, we are primarily focusing on the conclusiveness of the reason, so we may have to differentiate strongly between IR and WCB based on context.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The Reason is not a repetition of the Proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** No universal consensus is being presumed.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language here is not ambiguous or taken in another sense.

From this analysis, the most fitting classification is:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The statement "I’m an A student" does not conclusively substantiate that "You can’t give me a C," thus making the reasoning defective.

### Conclusion
The statement "You can’t give me a C. I’m an A student!" is classified as having a defective argument of type <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
