For 
To apply IDAA (decomposition of advanced task into steps) to IDA (classifying the given string as a type of defective argument), we need to break down the process of identifying the type of defective argument present in the string. Here are the steps for decomposing IDA into specific steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - Determine the main assertion or claim that the argument is making.

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - Identify the causal basis or reasoning provided to support the Proposition.

3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   - Assess any additional arguments or supporting evidence provided to substantiate the Reason.

4. **Analyze for Defects**:
   - Compare the identified Proposition, Reason, and Proof of Reason against the definitions of defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

5. **Classify the Defective Argument**:
   - Based on the comparison, determine which type of defect is present in the argument.

Now, let's apply this decomposition to classify the given string:
"We know God exists because we can see the perfect order of His Creation, an order which demonstrates supernatural intelligence in its design."

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - Proposition (P): "We know God exists."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - Reason (R): "because we can see the perfect order of His Creation."

3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   - Proof of Reason (PR): "an order which demonstrates supernatural intelligence in its design."

4. **Analyze for Defects**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: Does not apply, as the claim is specific rather than a generalization based on a part.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Does not apply, as the argument does not enumerate possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Consider if the Reason conclusively demonstrates the Proposition.
     - The existence of a perfect order does not necessarily prove the existence of God; it could be interpreted in multiple ways, not conclusively establishing the claim.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Consider if the Reason weakly supports the Proposition.
     - The link between observing order and attributing it to God is not compelling without further evidence or reasoning.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Does not apply, as the Reason is not merely a repetition of the Proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Does not apply, as the argument does not rely on presumed universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Consider if the language in PR could be taken in another sense.
     - "Perfect order" and "supernatural intelligence" can be interpreted differently, leading to ambiguity.

5. **Classify the Defective Argument**:
   - The primary defect appears to be **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because the Reason provided ("we can see the perfect order of His Creation") is not a compelling or conclusive basis for proving the Proposition ("We know God exists"). Additionally, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** could apply since the Reason does not conclusively establish the Proposition.

### Conclusion:
The string "We know God exists because we can see the perfect order of His Creation, an order which demonstrates supernatural intelligence in its design." can be classified as primarily exhibiting the defective argument type <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) and potentially <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
