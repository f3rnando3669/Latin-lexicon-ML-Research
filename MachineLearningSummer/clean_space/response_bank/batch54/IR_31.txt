For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to the argument "Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist and perhaps the foremost expert in the field, says that evolution is true. Therefore, it's true," we must decompose the task \( \text{IDA} \) (classifying the defective argument) into specific steps. Let's break down this process systematically:

### Decomposition of \( \text{IDA} \) into Steps (\( \text{D} \))
1. **Identify the Proposition (\( P \))**: Determine the statement or claim being argued for.
2. **Identify the Reason (\( R \))**: Determine the causal basis or evidence provided to support the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\( PR \))**: Look for any supporting arguments or evidence that corroborate the reason.
4. **Analyze the Argument**: Compare the argument structure with the definitions of defective argument types (\( G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP \)).
5. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**: Based on the analysis, determine which defective argument type(s) apply.

### Step-by-Step Application (\( \text{IDAA} \))

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( P \))**:
   - *Proposition (P)*: "Evolution is true."

2. **Identify the Reason (\( R \))**:
   - *Reason (R)*: "Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist and perhaps the foremost expert in the field, says that evolution is true."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\( PR \))**:
   - In this case, there is no additional explicit support or proof provided beyond the appeal to authority (Richard Dawkins).

4. **Analyze the Argument**:
   - We need to understand whether the given \( P \) and \( R \) fit into one of the defective argument types. The Reason is heavily relying on the authority of Richard Dawkins rather than providing objective causal or scientific evidence.

5. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**:
   - The argument is dependent on the authority of a single expert to claim the truth of the proposition without providing further substantiating evidence. It assumes that the expertise and consensus around an authority figure sufficiently support the claim.

Considering the definitions of the defective argument types, this argument fits the type:

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument assumes that because Richard Dawkins, an expert, says evolution is true, it must be true. However, the truth of evolution should be supported by various forms of objective evidence, not just the statement of an authority figure.

### Conclusion:
The classification of the given argument "Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist and perhaps the foremost expert in the field, says that evolution is true. Therefore, it's true" is of type \( \text{FU} \) (Presumptuous Consensus).
