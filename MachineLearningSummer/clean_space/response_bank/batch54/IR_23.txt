To apply the task of classifying the argument expressed in the string "I'm tailgating her, because she cut me off!" using the IDAA approach, we first need to decompose the task (IDA) into specific steps (D). Here’s how we can do it:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) and the Reason (<R>) in the argument.**
2. **Evaluate the Reason to see if it fits any of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).**

### Step 1: Identify Proposition and Reason
- **Proposition (<P>):** "I'm tailgating her."
  - This is what the speaker intends to justify or prove.
- **Reason (<R>):** "because she cut me off!"
  - This is the causal basis given for the proposition. It explains why the speaker is tailgating.

### Step 2: Evaluate the Reason
We need to check if the Reason provided falls into any defective argument types.

1. **Generalization (<G>):** Does the Reason generalize from an insufficient number of cases?
   - No, it doesn't make a broad generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Does the Reason claim completeness while missing out on possibilities?
   - No, it doesn’t claim completeness regarding a list of possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Does the Reason fail to conclusively support the proposition?
   - Yes, it seems to fit under this. The act of being cut off does not necessarily justify tailgating as a rational or acceptable response. The causal link is weak and doesn't conclusively justify the behavior.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Does the Reason merely restate the Proposition in a different way?
   - No, it’s not a restatement.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Is the Reason given an insufficient or weak causal basis for the Proposition?
   - Yes, there's a strong argument for this as well. The provided Reason (being cut off) is not a compelling or rational basis for justifying the action of tailgating, especially considering safety and legality concerns.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Does the Reason assume a consensus where there is none?
   - No, there is no presumed consensus stated.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Is there ambiguous language?
   - No, the language seems clear in its intention.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the Reason falls under two primary defective argument types:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis provided for the Proposition is weak and not compelling.

Between the two, the most fitting categorization would be **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**, as the Reason provided does not conclusively justify the Proposition. However, considering the weak causal relationship, **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)** also applies.

Therefore, the string "I'm tailgating her, because she cut me off!" can be classified primarily as **<IR>** and secondarily as **<WCB>**.
