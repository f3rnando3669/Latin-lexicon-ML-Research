For 
To apply IDAA (the application of the decomposition of the task of classifying a string into the seven defined defective argument types), we need to follow a structured approach. We will decompose the advanced task (IDAA) into specific steps. Here are the steps for decomposing IDA (classifying the string) and applying it to the given string.

### Steps for IDAA

1. **Identify Proposition (<P>):**
   Determine the main assertion or claim being made in the string.

2. **Identify Reason (<R>):**
   Determine the causal basis or justification provided for the proposition.

3. **Identify Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   Determine if any arguments or evidence are presented to corroborate the reason.

4. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types:**
   Compare the string against each of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) to see if it meets the criteria for any of them.

### Applying IDAA to the String

Let's apply these steps to the string: "Sure, we haven't given raises in over five years to our employees, but we work really hard to make a good product. We try to ensure the best customer service, too."

#### Step 1: Identify Proposition (<P>)

The main assertion or claim (<P>) can be considered:
- "**We haven't given raises in over five years to our employees.**"

#### Step 2: Identify Reason (<R>)

The justification or causal basis provided (<R>) is:
- "**We work really hard to make a good product. We try to ensure the best customer service, too.**"

#### Step 3: Identify Proof of Reason (<PR>)

There doesn't appear to be a separate corroborative argument or evidence presented in the string. For the purposes of this classification, we'll consider only the reason given.

#### Step 4: Analyze for Defective Argument Types

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - This does not seem to be a claim which involves generalization. No broad population or cases are generalized from a single case or majority.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - No exhaustive list of possibilities is given or claimed to be given, so this does not fit the criteria.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The reason provided ("We work really hard to make a good product. We try to ensure the best customer service, too.") does not directly link to the proposition about not giving raises. It seems unrelated to the raises, which would make it inconclusive in demonstrating the correctness of the proposition.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - The reason and the proposition are not the same; therefore, this is not an example of <RR>.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The causal basis given for the lack of raises is weak because hard work on the product and customer service doesn't logically justify not giving raises. This indicates an insufficient causal basis.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - There is no statement made on the grounds of universal agreement or consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - The language does not seem ambiguous or open to interpretation in a way that the speaker may not have intended.

By comparing the analysis with the defective argument types' definitions, the argument appears to predominantly fit the following defective argument types:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis given does not compellingly support the proposition.

### Conclusion

The string "Sure, we haven't given raises in over five years to our employees, but we work really hard to make a good product. We try to ensure the best customer service, too." classifies under both <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
