For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "Whatever is less dense than water will float, because such objects won't sink in water," we first need to decompose the task of classifying the defective argument into specific steps. Here's a detailed breakdown of how to approach this:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Determine what the argument is trying to assert or prove.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Determine the causal basis provided to support the proposition.
3. **Analyze the Validity of the Reason (<R>):** Evaluate if the reason effectively supports the proposition.
4. **Identify the Proof of Reason (if any) (<PR>):** Check for any additional arguments provided to support the reason.
5. **Classify the Defective Argument:** Based on the analysis, classify the argument as one of the defective types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

Now, apply these steps to the given string:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The Proposition (P) in the string is:
"Whatever is less dense than water will float."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The Reason (R) provided to support the Proposition is:
"because such objects won't sink in water."

### Step 3: Analyze the Validity of the Reason (<R>)
The Reason given is essentially a restatement of the Proposition. Both the Proposition and Reason are asserting the same fact: if an object is less dense than water, it will float, which can be restated as "such objects won't sink."

### Step 4: Identify the Proof of Reason (if any) (<PR>)
There is no additional Proof of Reason provided in this argument.

### Step 5: Classify the Defective Argument
Given the analysis, the Reason provided is not offering any additional information or evidence beyond what is stated in the Proposition. This suggests that the Reason is merely a restatement of the Proposition.

**Classification:** The argument type here is <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), because the Reason simply repeats the Proposition without providing any new causal basis or evidence.

### Conclusion
Applying <IDAA> to the string "Whatever is less dense than water will float, because such objects won't sink in water," we conclude that the defective argument type is <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
