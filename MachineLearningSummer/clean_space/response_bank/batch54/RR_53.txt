To apply the advanced task decomposition to the task of classifying the string "Repeating the same thing as if you’re proving something" as one of the defective argument types, follow these specific steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of the Task
1. **Understand the Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: Proposition is based on one part or a majority, but applied to all.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Proposition claims complete enumeration but misses some possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Reason provides a weak causal basis for the Proposition.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Reason repeats the Proposition without adding new information.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Proof of Reason is assumed certain on the basis of disputed consensus.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Proof of Reason can be interpreted differently than intended.

2. **Analyze the Given String**:
   Analyze the phrase "Repeating the same thing as if you’re proving something" to determine which defective argument type it represents.

3. **Map the Given String to Definitions**:
   Compare the given phrase with the definitions of the defective argument types identified in step 1.

4. **Identify the Most Suitable Defective Argument Type**:
   Based on the analysis and mapping, identify which defective argument type the phrase represents.

### Application of the Decomposition

#### Step 1: Understand the Defective Argument Types
We've already outlined the defective argument types above.

#### Step 2: Analyze the Given String
"Repeating the same thing as if you’re proving something."

This phrase suggests that one is restating the same point without providing new or additional information that moves the argument forward or substantiates it.

#### Step 3: Map the Given String to Definitions
Compare this to the definitions:
- **Generalization (G)**: Does not fit as it doesn’t talk about using a sample to generalize to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable, as it does not discuss the completeness of enumeration.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: It suggests there is no additional reasoning, but rather repetition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is no reference to the strength or nature of a causal relationship.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This fits as it explicitly talks about repetition without proving anything new.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Not relevant, as there is no mention of consensus.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Does not suggest multiple interpretations.

#### Step 4: Identify the Most Suitable Defective Argument Type
The most fitting type based on the analysis is **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**. The phrase "Repeating the same thing as if you’re proving something" directly aligns with the idea of repeating the proposition without adding new information or proof.

### Conclusion
By applying the decomposed steps to classify the string, we conclude that "Repeating the same thing as if you’re proving something" falls under the defective argument type of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**.
