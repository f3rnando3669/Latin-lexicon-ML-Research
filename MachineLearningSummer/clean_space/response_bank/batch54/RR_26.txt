To apply the decomposition of the advanced task (D) to the classification task (IDA) for the given argument, we need to follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of IDA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):** Determine the main assertion or claim being made in the argument.
2. **Identify the Reason (R):** Identify the causal basis or reasoning provided to support the Proposition.
3. **Check for Proof of Reason (PR):** Look for additional supporting arguments or evidence that corroborate the Reason.
4. **Evaluate for Defective Argument Types:**
   - Check for **Generalization (G)**
   - Check for **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
   - Check for **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
   - Check for **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**
   - Check for **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
   - Check for **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
   - Check for **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**

### Application of IDAA to the Given Argument:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**
- _Proposition (P)_: "Abortion is not really a private moral matter."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)**
- _Reason (R)_: "Abortion is our problem, and the problem of every human being. We are one human family. Nobody can be neutral on abortion. It involves the destruction of an entire group of human beings!"

**Step 3: Check for Proof of Reason (PR)**
- In this argument, there doesnâ€™t seem to be a distinct line of additional supporting arguments. The Reason provided attempts to encompass the Proof by making broad philosophical and moral claims.

**Step 4: Evaluate for Defective Argument Types**

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - _Assessment_: The Reason contains a potential generalization. The claim "Abortion is our problem, and the problem of every human being" and "We are one human family. Nobody can be neutral on abortion." suggests a generalization without specifying the basis for asserting it's applicable to all.
   - _Classification_: Likely type G.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - _Assessment_: There is no explicit complete enumeration attempt here, so this does not apply directly in this case.
   - _Classification_: Not type FE.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - _Assessment_: The Reason does not provide empirical evidence or logical deductive reasoning that conclusively demonstrates the proposition. It appeals more to moral and emotional aspects rather than factual or analytical bases.
   - _Classification_: Possibly type IR.

4. **Weak Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - _Assessment_: The causal basis appears to be moral and emotional, which are subjective and not necessarily compelling from a purely logical standpoint.
   - _Classification_: Likely type WCB.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - _Assessment_: The Reason does not restate the Proposition directly but provides related moral and emotional claims.
   - _Classification_: Not type RR.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - _Assessment_: The statement "Nobody can be neutral on abortion" may suggest a presumed consensus, assuming universal agreement on a contentious issue.
   - _Classification_: Likely type FU.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - _Assessment_: There may be ambiguity in terms like "our problem," "human family," and "neutral," but they do not seem core to the Reason's purpose rather than emotional appeals.
   - _Classification_: Possibly type DEP but less likely primary issue.

Based on this step-by-step analysis, the argument presented can be primarily classified as a type **G** (Generalization) defective argument, with elements of **IR** (Inconclusive Reason), **WCB** (Weak Causal Basis), and **FU** (Presumptuous Consensus).
