For 
To apply IDAA to the statement "President Reagan was a great communicator because he had the knack of talking effectively to the people," we begin by decomposing the task of classifying the argument as potentially defective (IDA) into specific steps (D). Then, we systematically apply these steps to analyze and classify the given statement.

### Decomposition of Task (D):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - Determine what is being claimed or intended to be proven.
   
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - Find the causal basis or reason given for the Proposition.

3. **Assess the Reason (R)**:
   - Evaluate whether the Reason effectively supports the Proposition.

4. **Classify the Argument Type**:
   - Based on the evaluation, classify the argument into one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Application of IDAA to the Given Statement:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - Proposition (P): "President Reagan was a great communicator."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - Reason (R): "He had the knack of talking effectively to the people."

3. **Assess the Reason (R)**:
   - Evaluate whether the Reason given effectively establishes the truth of the Proposition.

   - Consider the potential defects:
     - **Generalization (G)**: The statement does not seem to assert a generalization based on limited instances.
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: It does not attempt to enumerate all possibilities.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Does the Reason not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition?
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Is the causal basis weak or not compelling?
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Does the Reason repeat the Proposition in different words without adding value?
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Is the Reason based on an assumed universal agreement?
     - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Is the Reason ambiguous or open to different interpretations?

4. **Classify the Argument Type**:
   - The Reason given, "he had the knack of talking effectively to the people," appears to be a restatement or a near restatement of the Proposition, "President Reagan was a great communicator," because being a great communicator inherently involves the ability to talk effectively to the people.
   
   - Therefore, the Reason does not provide a distinct causal basis or additional information to support the Proposition but merely repeats the Proposition in a different form.

   - This aligns with the definition of a **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** where a Reason is weak when it appears to be presented as the Reason but says precisely the same as was said in the Proposition.

### Conclusion:
The statement "President Reagan was a great communicator because he had the knack of talking effectively to the people" is classified as a defective argument of type **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**.
