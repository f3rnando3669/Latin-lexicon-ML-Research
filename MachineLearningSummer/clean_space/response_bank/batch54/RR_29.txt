For 
To apply IDAA (Decomposition of an advanced task into specific steps) to IDA (classifying a string as a type of defective argument) for the given string "But this here research must go on. This space effort must go on" is an example of which logical fallacy?, we need to break down the task of classification into systematic steps. Here's how we can do it:

### Step 1: Understand the Given String and Context

First, we need to comprehend the string in question:
- "But this here research must go on. This space effort must go on."

It appears to be an argument supporting the continuation of research and space effort.

### Step 2: Decompose the Task (D)

1. **Identify the Argument Structure**:
    - Proposition (P): "This here research must go on" / "This space effort must go on."
    - Reason (R): Implied but not explicitly provided.
    - Proof of Reason (PR): Not provided.

2. **Examine for Defective Argument Types**:
    - **Generalization (G)**: Check if the proposition is extrapolated from limited observations.
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Check if the argument misses out on other possibilities.
    - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Check if the reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Check if the reason for the argument is weak.
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Check if the reason merely restates the proposition.
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Check if it assumes consensus without evidence.
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Check for language ambiguity.

### Step 3: Apply Each Defective Argument Type (IDA)

- **Generalization (G)**: The string does not make a generalization based on limited observations.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not enumerate possibilities, so not applicable.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: There is no explicit reason given, so this isnâ€™t clearly applicable.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is no provided causal basis, more so strong or weak.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Here, the phrase "This here research must go on" is followed by "This space effort must go on," which essentially repeats the same assertion in different words without providing a reason. Thus, this may be the faulty repetition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There is no indication of presumed consensus here.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language and terms used are not ambiguous in this context.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument Type

Based on the analysis, the argument appears to have:
- Repetition of the proposition without providing any supporting reason or causal basis.

Thus, the logical fallacy in this string is best classified as **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**.

### Conclusion

By decomposing the task and applying each defective argument type, we determined that the given string is an example of the logical fallacy **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**.
