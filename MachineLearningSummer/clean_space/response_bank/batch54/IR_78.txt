To apply the defined processes and tasks, we will start by decomposing the advanced task of classifying the given string into specific steps and then applying these steps to identify the type of defective argument for the given string. Here's how to go step-by-step:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of the Task (D)
1. **Identify Proposition (P):** Extract what the arguer intends to prove.
2. **Identify Reason (R):** Extract the causal basis claimed to support the proposition.
3. **Identify Proof of Reason (PR):** Determine if there is any supporting argument that corroborates the reason.
4. **Classify Defective Argument:** Based on the extraction of P, R, and PR, classify the defective argument into one of the types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Application of Steps (IDAA) to the Given String
1. **Analyze the string:**
   - Given String: "I hope I presented my argument clearly. Now, my opponent will attempt to refute my argument by his own fallacious, incoherent, illogical version of history."

2. **Identify Proposition (P):**
   - The proposition appears to be the claim that the speaker's argument is clear and valid, whereas the opponent's argument is fallacious, incoherent, and illogical.

3. **Identify Reason (R):**
   - Here, the implicit reason seems to be that because the opponent's argument is fallacious, incoherent, and illogical, the speaker's argument is valid.
   - Explicitly, the speaker does not provide a causal basis for the own argument's validity but focuses on discrediting the opponent.

4. **Identify Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - Proof of Reason is not evident here. The speaker does not present additional arguments corroborating the reason but rather makes an assertive statement about the opponent's argument.

5. **Classify Defective Argument:**
   - The argument seems to make an assertion without a strong causal basis and relies heavily on discrediting the opponent without providing solid proof.

Let's analyze the given defective argument types:
- **Generalization (G):** Not applicable as there isn't a claim generalized to all instances.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable as there is no claim of complete enumeration.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Not fully applicable as the reason section is more of an assertion.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** *Applicable,* as the causal basis provided to discredit the opponent’s argument is weak and relies on assertion rather than evidence.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Not applicable, there’s no repetitive statement.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Not directly applicable as no consensus or universal agreement is cited.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Not applicable as there is no ambiguous language that might be misinterpreted here.

### Conclusion
The string "I hope I presented my argument clearly. Now, my opponent will attempt to refute my argument by his own fallacious, incoherent, illogical version of history." can be classified under the defective argument type **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).** This is because the assertion about the opponent's argument being fallacious lacks compelling evidence or a strong causal basis to support the original proposition.
