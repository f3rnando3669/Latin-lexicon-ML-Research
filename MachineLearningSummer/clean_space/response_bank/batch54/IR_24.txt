For 
To decompose the task of classifying the argument as one of the defective types using \( IDAA \), we should take the following steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\( P \))
The Proposition is the main claim the argument is trying to prove.
- In this case, the Proposition is: "Jesus' favorite snack was raisins dipped in wine."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\( R \))
The Reason sets forth the causal basis for the Proposition.
- In this case, the Reason seems to be: "I hold a doctorate in theology, have written 12 books, and personally met the Pope."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (\( PR \))
The Proof of Reason corroborates the Reason with additional arguments or evidence.
- In this case, there is no explicit additional argument beyond what is presented as the Reason. So, we will consider the entire string together as the Reason and its implicit proof (the qualifications mentioned).

### Step 4: Examine for Defective Arguments
Now we need to check for defective arguments. We'll analyze the argument step by step.

1. **Generalization (\( G \))**:
   - This typically occurs when a conclusion is drawn about all cases based on a few examples. This doesn't apply here, as there is no generalization about a larger group being made.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\( FE \))**:
   - This would mean claiming to have considered all possibilities when some are omitted. This doesn't fit as there is no enumeration of possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \))**:
   - The Reason does not necessarily demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition. Here, knowing theology, writing books, or meeting the Pope does not logically conclude that "Jesus’ favorite snack was raisins dipped in wine."

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \))**:
   - The causal basis (credentials) is weak and not compelling evidence for the specific claim about Jesus' favorite snack. While the qualifications might make the person an expert in related fields, it does not directly support the claim about Jesus' favorite snack.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( RR \))**:
   - This happens when the Reason is just a restatement of the Proposition. This does not apply here, as the Reason is not merely a repetition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\( FU \))**:
   - This involves assuming something as true based on universal agreement, which is not evident here.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\( DEP \))**:
   - This involves ambiguity in language. There is no evident ambiguity in the language here.

### Conclusion:
The argument best fits into the category of **Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \))** because the Reason provided (credentials and experiences) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition (Jesus’ favorite snack).

So, the classification of the string is:

\[ IR \]

The detailed process for \( IDAA \) led us to identify the Reasoning flaw in the argument accurately.
