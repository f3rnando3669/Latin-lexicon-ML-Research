For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given statement, we need to decompose the task of classifying the given argument into specific steps. Here we follow a methodical approach to analyze each component of the argument and classify it according to the defective argument types defined earlier.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D)

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Determine the central claim or conclusion that the speaker is making.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Find the causal basis or supporting reason provided for the Proposition.

3. **Analyze the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - Look for additional arguments or evidence that corroborate the Reason.

4. **Check for Defective Argument Types**:
   - Evaluate the identified components against defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

5. **Classify the Argument**:
   - Based on the analysis, classify the argument as one of the defective types.

### Application of IDAA to the Provided Argument

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)

- The central claim made by the speaker is:
  - "Is that worth possible violations of the rights of some psycho-violent street thug? To me it is."
  - The Proposition can be paraphrased as: "It is worth violating the rights of some psycho-violent street thug."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)

- The reason provided is:
  - "If a dirty bomb goes off on Wall Street and the winds are blowing this way, then I and much of this part of Brooklyn are possibly toast."
  - The Reason can be paraphrased as: "The threat of a dirty bomb justifies violating rights."

#### Step 3: Analyze the Proof of Reason (<PR>)

- The argument does not provide any explicit additional proof beyond the speculative scenario (the dirty bomb and winds blowing to Brooklyn).

#### Step 4: Check for Defective Argument Types

- **Generalization (G)**:
  - The argument does not appear to be a generalization; it is a specific scenario being discussed.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
  - There is no enumeration of possibilities here, so this type is not applicable.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
  - The Reason provided (the scenario of a dirty bomb going off) is highly speculative and does not constitute a conclusive proof that violating rights is justified.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
  - The Reason provided is based on a hypothetical situation. While it presents a possible causal link, it is not compelling or sufficient to justify the Proposition conclusively.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
  - The Reason is different from the Proposition. Thus, this type is not applicable.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
  - There is no claim of universal agreement in the argument, so this type is not applicable.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
  - The language used does not seem to be ambiguous; it is straightforward in its speculative nature.

#### Step 5: Classify the Argument

- Based on the analysis, the argument most closely fits the defective argument types <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).

### Conclusion

The given argument "What I do know is that if a dirty bomb goes off on Wall Street and the winds are blowing this way, then I and much of this part of Brooklyn are possibly toast. Is that worth possible violations of the rights of some psycho-violent street thug? To me it is." can be classified primarily as:

- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The causal basis provided is not compelling enough to justify the proposition conclusively.
