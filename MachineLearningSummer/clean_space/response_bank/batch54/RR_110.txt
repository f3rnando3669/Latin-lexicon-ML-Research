For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying <s> as a specific defective argument type) to the string "Mr. Casal got sick last week, so it was likely due to the students," we will follow a systematic approach. Here, the argument type classification task (IDA) will be broken down into specific steps (D) for analytical clarity:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D)

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):** Determine the main assertion or claim that the argument is trying to establish.
2. **Identify the Reason (R):** Determine the causal basis or reasoning supporting the Proposition (P).
3. **Evaluate the Completeness of Enumeration (FE):** Check if the argument claims to consider all possibilities but omits some relevant ones.
4. **Assess the Strength of Reason (WCB & IR):** Evaluate if the provided reason conclusively and compellingly supports the proposition.
5. **Check for Faulty Repetition (RR):** Verify if the reason is merely a restatement of the proposition.
6. **Consider Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Determine if the argument assumes universal agreement on something that is still in dispute.
7. **Examine Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Inspect if the proof or reasoning can be misunderstood due to ambiguous language.
8. **Generalization Check (G):** See if a general conclusion is drawn from a limited set of examples.

### Applying IDAA to "Mr. Casal got sick last week, so it was likely due to the students."

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - **P:** "Mr. Casal got sick last week, so it was likely due to the students."
   - The proposition is suggesting a causal link between Mr. Casal's illness and the students.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - **R:** "It was likely due to the students."
   - The reason provided is that the cause of Mr. Casal's illness is attributed to the students.

3. **Evaluate the Completeness of Enumeration (FE):**
   - The argument does not explicitly enumerate all possible causes of Mr. Casal's illness. There may be other relevant possibilities (e.g., he could have contracted the illness from someone else, or from another environment).

4. **Assess the Strength of Reason (WCB & IR):**
   - **IR:** The reason does not conclusively prove that the students were the cause of Mr. Casal's illness. It merely suggests a possibility without solid evidence.
   - **WCB:** The causal basis ("likely due to the students") is not compelling without further proof or evidence. There are many potential sources of illness that are not accounted for.

5. **Check for Faulty Repetition (RR):**
   - In this case, the reason doesn't directly repeat the proposition. It associates the illness with the students but doesn't simply restate the proposition.

6. **Consider Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - The argument does not appeal to universal agreement, so this does not apply.

7. **Examine Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - The language is not particularly ambiguous; it is clear but lacks the necessary evidence for a strong argument.

8. **Generalization Check (G):**
   - The argument is generalizing that because Mr. Casal got sick last week, it is likely due to the students. This could imply that whenever someone in a similar scenario gets sick, it is likely due to the same cause, which is a form of generalization without sufficient evidence.

### Classification:

Based on the analysis, the defective argument types most applicable are:

- **FE (Incomplete Enumeration):** The argument does not account for all the possible causes of the illness, only suggesting one potential cause (the students).
- **IR (Inconclusive Reason):** The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The causal basis for the proposition is weak and non-compelling.

Therefore, the string "Mr. Casal got sick last week, so it was likely due to the students." can be classified as a defective argument type primarily due to **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** and **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, with elements of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
