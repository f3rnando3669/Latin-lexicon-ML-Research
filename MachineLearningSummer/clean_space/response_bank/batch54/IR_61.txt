For 
To apply the concept of **<IDAA>** to classify the string "One day robots will enslave us all. It's true. My computer science teacher says so," let's decompose the task **<IDA>** into specific steps **<D>**, then apply these steps systematically.

**Decomposition of <IDA> into specific steps <D>:**
1. Identify the proposition <P>.
2. Identify the reason <R>.
3. Identify the proof of reason <PR>.
4. Analyze the proposition, reason, and proof of reason to determine which defective argument type (if any) they represent.
5. Classify the string based on the identified defect(s).

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Application

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
The proposition is the central statement that we intend to prove.
- In this string, the proposition <P> is: **"One day robots will enslave us all."**

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
The reason <R> sets forth the causal basis for the proposition.
- In this string, the reason <R> is: **"My computer science teacher says so."**

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason <PR>
The proof of reason <PR> corroborates the reason by means of additional arguments. However, in this case, there isn't an additional argument provided beyond the authority of the teacher.
- In this string, the proof of reason <PR> is: **Implied consensus based on the authority of the teacher.**

#### Step 4: Analyze the Proposition, Reason, and Proof of Reason to determine which defective argument type:
1. **Generalization (G):** The proposition does not generalize from a subset to all cases, so it is not <G>.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The string does not claim a complete enumeration of possibilities, so it is not <FE>.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason given ("My computer science teacher says so") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis provided by the authority of a teacher is weak, as it does not provide a compelling, evidence-based argument.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason does not simply repeat the proposition, so it is not <RR>.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The string relies on the assumption that the teacher's authority is a universally agreed-upon proof, assuming a point still in dispute.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** There is no ambiguous language that could be taken in another sense than intended, so it is not <DEP>.

#### Step 5: Classify the string based on the identified defect(s):
- The most fitting classifications here are:
  - **<IR>** for Inconclusive Reason, as the reason does not conclusively prove the proposition.
  - **<WCB>** for Insufficient Causal Basis, as the teacher's opinion is not a strong causal basis for the proposition.
  - **<FU>** for Presumptuous Consensus, as there is an assumption that the teacherâ€™s authority is universally accepted without question.


### Final Classification
Based on the analysis, the string "One day robots will enslave us all. It's true. My computer science teacher says so." can be classified as:

**<IR>, <WCB>, <FU>**

These are the defective argument types present in the provided string.
