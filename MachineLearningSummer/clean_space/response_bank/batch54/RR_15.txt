For 
To apply the task of IDAA (the application of the decomposition of an advanced task into specific steps) to IDA (the task of classifying a string as a type of defective argument), we need to systematically break down the steps required to identify which type of defective argument the given string represents. Here is the step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Understand the String (s)
The given string is: 
"Once a year, a miracle causes this large rock to float about ten centimeters off the ground since supernatural powers want us to remember the martyrs who died in that spot."

### Step 2: Identify the Proposition (P)
In the string, the <P> (Proposition) is:
"A miracle causes this large rock to float about ten centimeters off the ground once a year."

### Step 3: Identify the Reason (R)
The <R> (Reason) is:
"Supernatural powers want us to remember the martyrs who died in that spot."

### Step 4: Assess the Proof of Reason (PR)
The string does not provide a clear <PR> (Proof of Reason) but seems to assume the existence of supernatural powers as a given.

### Step 5: Classify the Defective Argument Type
Based on the definitions provided for defective arguments:
1. **Generalization (G)** - Does not seem applicable as it is not a general statement based on one part or a majority.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** - Does not involve an incomplete list of possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** - Applicable since <R> ("supernatural powers want us to remember the martyrs") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of <P> (a miracle causes the rock to float).
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** - This could be considered since the causal basis (supernatural powers) is not strong enough to compel belief in the proposition.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** - Not applicable, as <R> is not a simple repetition of <P>.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** - Could be applicable if the reason is assumed to be universally agreed upon, without evidence.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)** - Not applicable, as there is no ambiguous term whose sense is being disputed.

### Step 6: Determine the Most Appropriate Defective Argument
In this specific case, while <IR> and <WCB> both seem relevant, we need to pick the one which primarily best describes the nature of the defect:
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** is the most fitting because the reason given does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition. The assertion of supernatural powers wanting us to remember the martyrs does not logically ensure that the rock must float due to a miracle.

Therefore, the classification of the string "Once a year, a miracle causes this large rock to float about ten centimeters off the ground since supernatural powers want us to remember the martyrs who died in that spot." under IDA would be <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
