For 
To apply IDAA (the application of task decomposition to the task of identifying defective arguments) to the provided statement "I view any discussion concerning the limiting of therapy as morally wrong, that is why I do not accept it," we need to break down the identification steps as follows:

### Step 1: Identify and Clarify the Proposition (<P>)
- **Proposition (<P>):** "I view any discussion concerning the limiting of therapy as morally wrong."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- **Reason (<R>):** "That is why I do not accept it."
- This Reason states why the person does not accept the discussion concerning the limiting of therapy; it is tied to their moral position.

### Step 3: Assess the Reason in the Context of the Proposition
- The Reason (<R>) here can be paraphrased as: "Because I view it as morally wrong, I do not accept it."
- This suggests the Reason is essentially repeating the subjective belief stated in the Proposition without providing new supporting evidence or logical reasoning.

### Step 4: Determine Which Defective Argument Type Applies
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
  - **Definition:** "<R> is weak when it appears to be presented as the <R>, but says precisely the same as was said in the <P>."
  - In our case, the Reason "<R>: That is why I do not accept it" is essentially echoing the Proposition "<P>: I view any discussion concerning the limiting of therapy as morally wrong."

### Conclusion
The defective argument type for the given statement: 

"The statement 'I view any discussion concerning the limiting of therapy as morally wrong, that is why I do not accept it.' is classified as **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**."

It doesn't provide a new substantive Reason; it merely repeats the Proposition in different words, failing to establish an independent supporting argument.
