Certainly! To apply the task of classifying the defective argument to the given string, we start by decomposing the task into specific steps. Let's begin:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine the main claim or assertion.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the causal basis for the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Look for any additional arguments that corroborate the reason.
4. **Analyze the Structure**: Evaluate the relationship between <P>, <R>, and <PR>.
5. **Classify the Defective Argument**: Determine which type of defective argument (generalization, incomplete enumeration, inconclusive reason, insufficient causal basis, faulty repetition of proposition, presumptuous consensus, or ambiguous language use) the argument falls into.

Let's apply these steps to the string "Smoking pot is against the law because it is wrong; I know it is wrong because it is against the law."

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - The main claim being made is: "Smoking pot is against the law because it is wrong."
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - The reason given for the proposition is: "It is wrong."
   
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - The proof provided for the reason is: "I know it is wrong because it is against the law."

4. **Analyze the Structure**:
   - Proposition (<P>): "Smoking pot is against the law because it is wrong."
   - Reason (<R>): "It is wrong."
   - Proof of Reason (<PR>): "I know it is wrong because it is against the law."

5. **Classify the Defective Argument**:
   - To classify the defective argument, we look at the structure and see if the <R> and <PR> properly support the <P>.
     - In this case, the <R> ("it is wrong") is circular because the <PR> ("I know it is wrong because it is against the law") simply restates the proposition (that it is against the law).
     - This means that the reason doesn't add any new or compelling information and only repeats the assertion in different words.

### Classification:
This is a case of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** because the reason essentially just repeats the proposition without adding any substantial supporting evidence.

**Conclusion**: The argument "Smoking pot is against the law because it is wrong; I know it is wrong because it is against the law" falls under the defective argument type **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**.
