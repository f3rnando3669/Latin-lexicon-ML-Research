For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given statement, we need to decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps. Let's break it down:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) for IDA

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - What's the primary assertion or claim made in the argument?

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - What's the causal basis offered to support the Proposition?

3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Are there additional arguments presented that corroborate the Reason?

4. **Check for Defective Argument Types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP):**
   - Analyze the argument to see if it falls into one of the defective argument categories.

### Applying Decomposition (D) to the Task (IDA):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Bill's Proposition (<P>): "I think capital punishment is wrong."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Adam's Reason (<R>): "If it was wrong, it wouldn't be legal."

3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - No additional arguments are provided by Adam to support his Reason.

4. **Check for Defective Argument Types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP):**
   - Let's analyze Adam's Reason in relation to Bill's Proposition.

### Analysis against Defective Argument Types:

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - Adam's argument does not involve generalizing based on a subset of people or cases.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - Adam does not claim to have listed all possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - Adam's Reason does not provide a conclusive basis for proving Bill's Proposition right or wrong. The legality of an action does not necessarily correlate with its moral or ethical correctness.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - Adam's Reason is weak because the legality of something does not compellingly establish its moral correctness.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - Adam's Reason does not simply repeat Bill's Proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - Adam does not assume universal consensus on the illegality equating to moral correctness.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - Adam's argument does not rely on ambiguous language.

Given these considerations, Adamâ€™s argument is an example of:

**Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

**Summary:**
Adam's Reason fails to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition; thus, it fits the defective argument type of Inconclusive Reason (IR). Additionally, the causal basis (i.e., legality equating to morality) is not compelling, making it also an example of Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).

To categorize it strictly according to the exact match from the steps, we'll say this example falls under **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
