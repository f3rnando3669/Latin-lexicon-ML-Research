For 
Let's apply the process of <IDAA> (Decomposition of the task of classifying a string as a type of defective argument) step by step to the example: "Ghosts exist.... because I saw a ghost in my closet," to determine the logical fallacy present.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
In the given statement, the proposition (<P>) is "Ghosts exist."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason (<R>) provided for the proposition is "because I saw a ghost in my closet."

### Step 3: Classify the <R>
Next, we need to classify the type of defective argument the <R> represents. Let's systematically check each type of defective argument against the example:

#### Generalization (<G>)
- **Definition**: The proposition (<P>) is an assertion based on some one part or a majority of individuals, but not necessarily applicable to all, is referred to all.
- **Analysis**: The reason here is based on a single personal experience ("I saw a ghost in my closet") and is being used to generalize that "ghosts exist" overall. This matches the definition of a generalization.

#### Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- **Definition**: The proposition (<P>) is defective when we claim to have made a complete enumeration of the possibilities but actually miss out on some pertinent ones.
- **Analysis**: There's no mention or claim of a complete enumeration of possibilities in the reason provided.

#### Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- **Definition**: The reason (<R>) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (<P>).
- **Analysis**: While the reason may be considered weak or inconclusive to a critical thinker, it does provide a kind of evidence linking the proposition and reason.

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- **Definition**: The reason (<R>) is weak if the causal basis which it submits for the proposition (<P>) is not a compelling one.
- **Analysis**: The cause-effect relationship here (seeing a ghost leading to the conclusion that all ghosts exist) may be weak, but it's more accurately classified another way.

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
- **Definition**: The reason (<R>) is weak when it appears to be presented as the <R>, but says precisely the same as was said in the <P>.
- **Analysis**: The reason and proposition are not identical statements; hence this does not fit.

#### Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
- **Definition**: The proof of reason (<PR>) is assumed as certain on the ground that "it is universally agreed upon," a thing which is still in dispute.
- **Analysis**: There's no appeal to universal agreement here.

#### Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)
- **Definition**: The proof of reason (<PR>) can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended.
- **Analysis**: There is no ambiguity in the language used in this argument.

### Step 4: Conclusion
After evaluating the defective argument types, the most fitting classification for "Ghosts exist.... because I saw a ghost in my closet," is:

**Generalization (<G>)**

This is because the proposition is broadly generalized based on a single personal experience.

By applying <IDAA>, we have systematically determined that the logical fallacy present in the provided statement is a **Generalization (G)**.
