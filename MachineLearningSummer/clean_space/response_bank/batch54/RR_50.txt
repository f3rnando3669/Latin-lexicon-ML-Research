For 
To apply the IDAA (Decomposition of the task IDA) to the given string "Standardized dress should be used in schools because kids should wear standardized dress," we will follow the specific steps of breaking down the task of classifying the defective argument:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - The proposition is the statement that sets forth summarily what is intended to be proven.
   - In this case, "<P>: Standardized dress should be used in schools."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - The reason provides the causal basis for establishing the truth of the proposition.
   - In this case, "<R>: because kids should wear standardized dress."

3. **Analyze the argument against the potential defective argument types**:

   a. **Generalization (<G>)**:
      - Is the proposition based on a general assertion that might not apply to all cases?
      - Here, the statement doesn't attempt to generalize from a part to the whole, so it doesn't fit <G>.

   b. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
      - Does the argument claim a complete enumeration of possibilities but misses some?
      - This case doesn't attempt to enumerate possibilities, so it doesn't fit <FE>.

   c. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
      - Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
      - The reason given is a reiteration of the proposition itself, not an independent, conclusive reason.

   d. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
      - Is the reason a weak causal basis for the proposition?
      - The reason provided is not even attempting to be a causal argument but a repetition, so this isn't fully describing the defect.

   e. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
      - Does the reason merely repeat the proposition?
      - Yes, the reason "because kids should wear standardized dress" is just a reiteration of the proposition.

   f. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
      - Is the proof assumed certain on a ground that is still in dispute?
      - This doesn't apply here; there's no appeal to a consensus basis.

   g. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
      - Can the proof be taken in another sense than the speaker intended?
      - The language isn't ambiguous here. It is clear but repetitive.

4. **Classify the argument**:
   - Based on the analysis, the argument is classified as a **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**, because the reason simply repeats the proposition without any actual supporting argument.

So, the classification using IDAA for the given string is:
```<RR>```
