For 
To apply the task of IDAA (application of the decomposition of the advanced task IDA to the string) to the given string, "Kerry’s plan will raise taxes by at least $900 billion his first hundred days," let's break down the process step by step:

### Step 1: Understand and Decompose the Task (D)
1. **Identify the Argument Components:**
   - Determine the Proposition (P), Reason (R), and Proof of Reason (PR) if present.
2. **Classify the Defect in the Argument:**
   - Check if the proposition and reason fit any of the defective argument types.

### Step 2: Identify the Argument Components for String (s)
- **Proposition (P):** What is the assertion or statement that is being made?
  - "Kerry’s plan will raise taxes by at least $900 billion his first hundred days."

- **Reason (R):** What is the causal basis or supporting reason given for the proposition?
  - Note: In the given string, no explicit reason (R) is provided for why Kerry’s plan will raise taxes.

- **Proof of Reason (PR):** Is there any additional argument or evidence provided to prove the reason?
  - There’s no additional argument or evidence provided in the given string.

### Step 3: Classify the Defective Argument Type
- **Generalization (<G>):**
  - Is the proposition based on insufficient data applied to the whole?
  - No, it makes a specific claim without applying to a broader context.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
  - Does it claim to consider all possibilities, but misses some?
  - No, the string doesn’t enumerate possibilities.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
  - Is the reason provided insufficient to conclusively support the proposition?
  - Not applicable since no reason is explicitly given in the string.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
  - Is the reason provided weak or not compelling?
  - Not applicable for the same reason as above.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
  - Is the reason a mere repetition or restatement of the proposition?
  - Not applicable since there is no reason given.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
  - Is something assumed to be true based on presumed universal agreement?
  - No, the string does not appeal to any consensus or presumed universal agreement.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
  - Could the proof or statement be taken in another sense than intended?
  - No, the statement itself is a straightforward claim without ambiguous language.

### Step 4: Conclusion – Identification of the Defective Argument Type
Given the analysis above, the string provided lacks a reason (R), which typically would support the Proposition (P). It makes a strong claim without supporting evidence or reasoning.

Based on the available definitions, the closest classification is:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
  Because the reason (R) that should be supporting the proposition (which in this case is entirely missing), the argument falls short of conclusively demonstrating the correctness of the proposition. Since we have no (R), the proposition stands unsupported and hence inconclusive.

### Final Classification of "Kerry’s plan will raise taxes by at least $900 billion his first hundred days":
- **Type: <IR> (Inconclusive Reason):**
  - Although the argument string does not provide an explicit reason (R), it implicitly fails to establish the truth of the Proposition (P) due to the absence of supportive reasoning.
