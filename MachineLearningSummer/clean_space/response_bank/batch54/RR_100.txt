To apply the method of IDAA to classify the given string as one of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, or DEP), we need to decompose the task (IDA) systematically and analyze the provided argument step by step. Here are the steps for IDA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), and Proof of Reason (<PR>)** in the string.
2. **Check if the <P>, <R>, or <PR> fall into any of the defective argument categories** (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, or DEP).

Let's apply this step-by-step method to the provided string:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition, Reason, and Proof of Reason

1. **Proposition (<P>)**: "I am a great leader."
2. **Reason (<R>)**: "I make great leadership decisions."
3. **Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: "The proof that I make great leadership decisions is that I am a great leader, and that's what leaders do."

### Step 2: Check for Defective Argument Types

- **Generalization (G)**: This type does not apply because there's no assertion based on a sample or group here.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This type does not apply because there's no enumeration of possibilities that's purported to be complete.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason given does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. However, we need to check further for other defective types.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This type is about the causal basis being weak; here it’s more of a repetition rather than a weak causal link.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason "I make great leadership decisions" is essentially the same as "I am a great leader." The proof "That’s what leaders do" is also just repeating the proposition in different words.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This type does not apply as there is no claim of universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: This does not apply because there's no ambiguous language taking different senses than intended.

### Conclusion

Upon examining the steps, the argument presented in the string is a classic example of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**. The reason and the proof essentially repeat the proposition without offering new or compelling evidence:

- **Proposition (<P>)**: "I am a great leader."
- **Reason (<R>)**: "I make great leadership decisions."
- **Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: "The proof that I make great leadership decisions is that I am a great leader, and that's what leaders do."

The string rephrases the proposition as the reason and proof, making it a case of Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR).
