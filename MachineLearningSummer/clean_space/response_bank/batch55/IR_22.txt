For 
To classify the given argument using the defined defective argument types, let's first decompose the task into specific steps. Here is the decomposition of the classification task (IDA) into specific steps (D):

### Decomposition (D):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   Determine what the speaker is trying to establish or prove.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   Determine the causal basis that the speaker provides to support the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   Determine any additional arguments that corroborate the reason.

4. **Analyze the Argument:**
   Examine the identified parts to see if they fit into any of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>).

5. **Classify the Argument:**
   Based on the analysis, classify the argument into one of the defective argument types.

Now, apply these steps to the provided argument:

### Step-by-Step Application (IDAA):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - "I’m an orphan!"

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - "Have mercy on me."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - "I know you want to imprison me for having murdered my parents."

4. **Analyze the Argument:**
   - Proposition (P): "I’m an orphan!" is asserted as a reason to show that the speaker deserves mercy.
   - Reason (R): "Have mercy on me" is used as the causal basis for why the speaker should not be imprisoned.
   - Proof of Reason (PR): The argument "I know you want to imprison me for having murdered my parents" acts as the additional context but does not provide a logical link that justifies why being an orphan should result in mercy for the crime of murdering their parents.

5. **Classify the Argument:**
   - The proposition "I’m an orphan!" attempts to use the speaker's orphan status as a basis for mercy, but this status is a direct result of the crime. This is an example of a **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** because it relies on the emotional appeal of being an orphan without providing a substantial reason related to the crime itself. 

   In essence, the speaker's proposition reiterates the consequence of the crime (being an orphan), which does not serve as a logical justification for mercy.

Therefore, the given argument can be classified as **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**.
