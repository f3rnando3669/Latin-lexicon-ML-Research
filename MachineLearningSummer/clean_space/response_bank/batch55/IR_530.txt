For 
Let's break down the task \( <IDAA> \) step by step to classify the argument type for the given string.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the proposition \( <P> \):** The proposition is the statement or conclusion being put forth.
2. **Identify the reason \( <R> \):** The reason is the basis provided to support the proposition.
3. **Check for proof of reason \( <PR> \):** Any corroborating arguments provided to support the reason.
4. **Classify the argument into one of the defective types \( <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, \) or \( <DEP> \):** Determine which, if any, defective argument type fits the given string.

### Analysis and Classification

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition \( <P> \)**:
The implicit proposition here seems to be questioning the credibility of the opponent: _"Can we really trust my opponent?"_.

**Step 2: Identify the Reason \( <R> \)**:
The reason provided is: _"He moved to this town three years ago and everyone knows his wife left him."_.

**Step 3: Check for Proof of Reason \( <PR> \)**:
There is no explicit additional evidence presented to support this reason. Instead, the argument relies on assumptions about the opponent's credibility based on personal circumstances.

**Step 4: Classify the Argument**:
We have to determine which defective argument type the string represents based on the identified \( <P> \) and \( <R> \).

- **<G> (Generalization):** The argument does not seem to generalize a trait from some individuals to all.
- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):** The argument does not attempt to consider all possibilities and miss some.
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** The reason given does not logically conclude that the opponent is untrustworthy. The personal details mentioned (moving to town and wife leaving) do not logically imply untrustworthiness.
- **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** The reason does not merely repeat the proposition.
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The causal basis for the reason is not compelling because moving to a town and marital issues are not relevant to trustworthiness.
- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):** The argument does not rely on a presumed consensus.
- **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):** The argument does not contain ambiguous language that could be interpreted differently.

The closest classification here is \( <IR> \) (Inconclusive Reason) because the reasons given (moving to the town and personal marital issues) do not logically conclude that the opponent cannot be trusted. They are irrelevant to the proposition.

### Conclusion
The given argument can be classified as \( <IR> \) (Inconclusive Reason) because the reasons provided do not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition about the opponent's trustworthiness.
