To apply the task of IDA to the string "present ideas that elicit strong feelings" using the framework of IDAA, we need to decompose IDA into specific steps and then apply those steps systematically to determine whether the argument fits any of the defective argument types. Here's how it breaks down:

### Step 1: Identify and understand the string
- The string given is: "present ideas that elicit strong feelings"

### Step 2: Check for Generalization (<G>)
- **Definition of G**: An assertion based on some one part or a majority of individuals, but not necessarily applicable to all, is referred to all.
- **Analysis**: The string does not appear to make a generalization about a whole group based on a part. It is more of an instruction or suggestion.

### Step 3: Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- **Definition of FE**: A claim to have made a complete enumeration of possibilities, but actually missing some pertinent ones.
- **Analysis**: There is no enumeration or listing of possibilities in the string. It does not claim to cover all possible ideas or feelings.

### Step 4: Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- **Definition of IR**: The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **Analysis**: The string does not provide a reason or argument; it simply makes a statement about the nature of ideas that elicit strong feelings.

### Step 5: Check for Inconclusive Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- **Definition of WCB**: The causal basis submitted for the proposition is not compelling.
- **Analysis**: Again, the string provides no reason or causal explanation to analyze. It does not try to substantiate 'why' one should present such ideas.

### Step 6: Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
- **Definition of RR**: The Reason appears to be the same as the Proposition.
- **Analysis**: There are no separate propositions and reasons given in the string.

### Step 7: Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
- **Definition of FU**: Assuming a proof is certain because it is 'universally agreed upon' while it is still in dispute.
- **Analysis**: There is no claim of universal agreement or consensus within the string.

### Step 8: Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)
- **Definition of DEP**: The Proof can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended.
- **Analysis**: While the phrase "strong feelings" can be broad and somewhat subjective, in the context given, it does not seem to show ambiguous language that can be definitively taken in another unintended sense.

### Conclusion
- After applying all diagnostic steps, the string "present ideas that elicit strong feelings" does not fit any of the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>. It is a straightforward imperative instruction and does not construct an argument that can be analyzed under the specified defective argument categories.

Thus, applying IDAA to the string "present ideas that elicit strong feelings" results in the conclusion that it does not qualify as any type of defective argument described.
