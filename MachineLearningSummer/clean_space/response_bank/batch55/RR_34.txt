For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a defective argument) to the given string "We must accept the traditions of the men of old time who affirm themselves to be the offspring of the gods - that is what they say - and they must surely have known their own ancestors. How can we doubt the word of the children of the gods?" - Plato, Timaeus, we need to follow a step-by-step approach. Below is the decomposition of this task (D) into specific steps:

### Step 1: Identification of Proposition (<P>)
Identify the main assertion or proposition that is intended to be proved in the statement.

### Step 2: Identification of Reason (<R>)
Identify the causal basis or the reasoning used to establish the truth of the proposition.

### Step 3: Classification of Defective Argument Type
Examine the identified proposition and reason to see if any of the identified defects (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP) apply.

### Step 4: Detailed Analysis
Analyze each defect type to determine which one best classifies the defect found in the argument.

Now, let's apply these steps to the given string:

### Step 1: Identification of Proposition (<P>)
The main assertion in the passage is:
- "We must accept the traditions of the men of old time who affirm themselves to be the offspring of the gods."

### Step 2: Identification of Reason (<R>)
The reason given for the assertion is twofold:
1. "That is what they say - and they must surely have known their own ancestors."
2. "How can we doubt the word of the children of the gods?"

### Step 3: Classification of Defective Argument Type
We need to closely examine the reasoning to determine if it falls under any of the defective argument classifications. Let's analyze:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument does not seem to generalize from a part to the whole in this case.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not claim to have enumerated all possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasoning given might not conclusively establish the proposition since it relies heavily on assumed truths.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis may not be compelling here. The reasoning relies on what ancient men say and their knowledge of their ancestors.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The reason does not repeat the proposition itself; itâ€™s a different statement.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument does suggest that the traditions should be accepted because "they must surely have known their own ancestors," appealing to authority and tradition without solid proof.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: There does not seem to be ambiguity in the language use.

### Step 4: Detailed Analysis
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasoning "they must surely have known their own ancestors" is not a conclusive reason that the traditions are true.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Relying on the statement of traditions without additional proof does not form a strong causal basis for accepting the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Suggesting that we must accept the traditions because ancient men say so implies an appeal to authority that others might not universally accept.

The passage can be most strongly classified as **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**, due to its reliance on the authority and tradition of ancient men without providing additional concrete proof.

### Conclusion
The defective argument of the given string by Plato can be classified primarily as:
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**. 

This defect is found due to the reliance on the supposed universal agreement or authority of ancient people without providing sufficient foundational proof for the proposition.
