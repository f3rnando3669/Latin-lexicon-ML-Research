For 
To apply the decomposition of the task (D) of classifying the string ("Billy murdered all those people because I spanked him when he was a child.") as one of the defective argument types (IDA), we will proceed step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The Proposition (P) is the main claim or assertion the argument is making.

**P:** "Billy murdered all those people."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The Reason (R) is the cause or basis provided to support the Proposition (P).

**R:** "because I spanked him when he was a child."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Argument Based on Defective Types
We will now look at the argument in the context of each defective argument type to classify it.

#### Generalization (G)
- **Definition:** A claim is asserted based on one part, or a majority of individuals, but not necessarily applicable to all.
- **Assessment:** This does not apply here as the argument does not generalize from a part to a whole group of individuals.

#### Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
- **Definition:** Claiming a complete enumeration of possibilities but missing some pertinent ones.
- **Assessment:** This is not relevant here since the argument makes no attempt at a complete enumeration of possibilities.

#### Inconclusive Reason (IR)
- **Definition:** The Reason (R) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition (P).
- **Assessment:** The Reason provided (spanking as a child) does not conclusively demonstrate why Billy murdered people. Behavioral causation is complex and cannot be reduced to a simple cause-effect relationship like this.

**Classification:** This fits the defective argument type **IR** (Inconclusive Reason).

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
- **Definition:** The Reason (R) provides a weak causal basis for the Proposition (P).
- **Assessment:** The causal link between spanking a child and future murders is weak and not compelling.

**Additional Classification:** This also fits the defective argument type **WCB** (Insufficient Causal Basis).

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
- **Definition:** The Reason (R) repeats the Proposition (P) without adding new information.
- **Assessment:** The Reason provided is not a repetition of the proposition.

#### Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
- **Definition:** Assuming a Proposition (PR) is certain because "it is universally agreed upon."
- **Assessment:** This does not apply here since the argument does not rely on a presumed consensus.

#### Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)
- **Definition:** The Proof of Reason (PR) can be interpreted in multiple ways other than intended.
- **Assessment:** There is no ambiguous language in the Reason that leads to misinterpretation.

### Conclusion
The argument "Billy murdered all those people because I spanked him when he was a child" classifies under:
- **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**
- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**

These classifications indicate that the reasoning provided does not conclusively support the proposition and the causal basis is not compelling.
