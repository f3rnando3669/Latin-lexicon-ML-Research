For 
To apply IDAA (the application of the decomposition of the task into specific steps) to IDA (the task of classifying the given string), let's break down the procedure step-by-step to classify the statement "Students who want cell phones in school have no idea what they're talking about."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>) for <IDA>

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Name the assertion being put forward in the statement.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Identify any supporting reason presented for the assertion.

3. **Identify Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Look for any additional arguments that substantiate the reason.

4. **Classify Defective Argument Type:**
   - Based on the identified parts (<P>, <R>, <PR>), determine which defective argument type the statement falls under: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Applying <D> to Perform <IDA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The proposition in this statement is: "Students who want cell phones in school have no idea what they're talking about."
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - In this case, the statement does not present a direct reason to support the assertion. It only makes a categorical claim about students without providing justification.

3. **Identify Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Since there is no reason given, there is also no proof of reason provided.

4. **Classify Defective Argument Type:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** The proposition is a categorical assertion about "students who want cell phones in school" based on the presumption that such students have "no idea what they're talking about." It applies this assertion universally to all such students without supporting evidence.
     - *Assessment*: The argument type can be classified as <G>, as it generalizes about all students who want cell phones in school without specific supporting data or argument.

The argument falls into the category of **Generalization (<G>)** because it makes a blanket statement about a group (students who want cell phones in school) without backing it up with specific reasons or evidence to justify the claim.
