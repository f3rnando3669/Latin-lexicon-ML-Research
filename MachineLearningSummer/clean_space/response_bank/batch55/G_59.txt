For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string into specific steps) to the statement "If you break your diet and have one cookie tonight, you will just want to eat 10 cookies tomorrow, and before you know it, you will have gained back the 15 pounds you lost," we need to analyze the types of defective arguments present in the statement.

1. **Step 1: Identify Proposition**:
   - The Proposition (<P>) can be extracted from the statement as: "If you break your diet and have one cookie tonight, you will gain back the 15 pounds you lost."

2. **Step 2: Identify Reason**:
   - The Reason (<R>) given for the Proposition is: "You will want to eat 10 cookies tomorrow, and before you know it..."

3. **Step 3: Identify Proof of Reason**:
   - The Proof of Reason (<PR>) isn't explicitly mentioned but is implied: The implication is that eating one cookie will inevitably lead to a loss of control and overconsumption.

4. **Step 4: Check for Generalization (G)**:
   - <G> does not apply here. The argument is not generalizing from a single or a majority subset to all.

5. **Step 5: Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - <FE> does not apply, as the argument does not claim to have enumerated possibilities.

6. **Step 6: Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - <IR> applies here. The reason does not conclusively demonstrate that breaking your diet by eating one cookie will lead to a cascade of events ultimately resulting in gaining back the lost weight. The causal link between the initial action (eating one cookie) and the final outcome (gaining back 15 pounds) is weak and not conclusively shown.

7. **Step 7: Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - <WCB> also applies here. The causal basis provided is not compelling enough. There are many factors involved in weight gain beyond the simplistic scenario presented.

8. **Step 8: Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - <RR> does not apply as the Reason provided is not merely a repetition of the Proposition.

9. **Step 9: Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - <FU> does not apply. The argument does not rest on a supposed universal agreement.

10. **Step 10: Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
    - <DEP> does not apply as the language used does not seem ambiguous or open to multiple interpretations in the context of the argument.

**Conclusion**: The defective argument types that apply here are **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
