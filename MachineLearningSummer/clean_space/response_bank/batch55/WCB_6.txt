Sure, let's apply IDAA to classify the string "Believing that 'runs' occur to statistically independent phenomena such as routine wheel spins." Here are the steps we'll take for IDAA:

### Step 1: Understand the Proposition (\<P\>)

Identify the central claim or proposition in the provided string.

**Proposition (P):** "Runs occur to statistically independent phenomena such as routine wheel spins."

### Step 2: Evaluate the Reason (\<R\>)

Examine if a causal basis or reason is provided to support the Proposition (\<P\>).

**Reason (R):** The causal basis in this case seems to be an implied belief that statistically independent phenomena like wheel spins can exhibit "runs" or streaks.

### Step 3: Check for the Proof of Reason (\<PR\>)

Determine if there is any additional argument or evidence presented to corroborate the Reason (\<R\>).

**Proof of Reason (PR):** There is no additional proof provided in this string to validate the reason.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument

Given our understanding of the Argument components (P, R, PR), we classify the defective argument type based on the criteria provided.

1. **Generalization (G):** Does the string make a broad assertion from a small sample? This doesn't seem to fit, as the string is discussing a theoretical concept applicable broadly.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Does the string claim completeness but omit options? The string does not enumerate possibilities, so this does not apply.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does the Reason not conclusively demonstrate the Proposition? The Reason given ("belief") does not actually establish the claim definitively.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the Reason provided weak or not compelling? The Reason is a belief without strong causal evidence.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Does the Reason merely restate the Proposition? No, the Reason is based on belief, which is not a direct repetition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Is the Proof of Reason assumed correct based on supposed universal agreement? There's no claim to universal agreement here.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Is there ambiguous language that can be misinterpreted? The term "runs" might be ambiguous, but not in a sense that leads to a different meaning significantly impacting the argument.

### Step 5: Conclude the IDAA

Based on the evaluation, the most fitting classification for the given string:

**Conclusion (Classification):** The string falls under **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)** because the Reason provided for the Proposition is weak and not compelling. It relies on belief rather than strong evidence to support the claim.

So, the IDAA classification for "Believing that 'runs' occur to statistically independent phenomena such as routine wheel spins" is **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
