Sure, let's apply the task of IDAA to "Everyone is/is not doing it! It must/must not be a good thing!" step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P> and the Reason <R>
1. **Proposition <P>:** "It must/must not be a good thing."
2. **Reason <R>:** "Everyone is/is not doing it!"

### Step 2: Determine if the Reason <R> satisfactorily supports the Proposition <P>
- **Proposition <P>:** "It must/must not be a good thing."
- **Reason <R>:** "Everyone is/is not doing it!"

In this step, we need to evaluate whether the reason provides adequate support for the proposition.

### Step 3: Classify the Reason <R> based on its type of defectiveness 

#### Defective Arguments Classification

- **Generalization (G):** Not applicable here because it's not presenting an assertion based on a part or majority of individuals applied to all.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable here because the argument isn’t about missing out on enumerations.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Could be applicable, depending on whether the reason "Everyone is/is not doing it!" actually provides conclusive proof for "It must/must not be a good thing."

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Could be relevant if the reason provided is not compelling enough to substantiate the proposition.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Not applicable, as the reason provided isn’t a repetition of the proposition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Very likely applicable. The reason hinges on the "everyone" aspect, suggesting that universal agreement implies truth.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Not necessarily applicable as the language isn’t particularly ambiguous.

### Step 4: Final Classification

Given the reasoning aligns significantly with arguing from a presumed consensus ("everyone is/is not doing it"), the argument seems to fall best under **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.

### Conclusion
By decomposing the task IDA into specific steps (D), we identified and classified the string as follows:
- The string "Everyone is/is not doing it! It must/must not be a good thing!" is of type **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.

This implies that the argument assumes the truth of the proposition based on an assumed universal agreement, a premise which itself is disputable.
