Sure! Let's apply the task of IDAA to the example statement "I can't understand how such a low performance student is able to talk about politics."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDA into Specific Steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), and Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Proposition (<P>): "A low performance student should not be able to talk about politics."
   - Reason (<R>): "Such a student's low performance in academics implies they are not qualified to discuss politics."
   - Proof of Reason (<PR>): No explicit PR provided in the statement. The proof would need to show additional arguments supporting the reason.

2. **Examine the Statement Components for Defective Arguments:**
   - **Generalization (G):** Does the argument generalize a characteristic (low academic performance) and apply it universally to political discourse ability?
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Does it suggest incompletely considered alternatives/reasons/qualifications for political dialogue?
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does the reason provided ("low performance in academics") fail to conclusively support the proposition?
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the causal link between academic performance and political discussion weak?
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Does the reason merely restate the proposition?
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Does the argument assume a consensus without evidence?
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Is the language used ambiguous in a way that it can be misunderstood or taken in another sense?

### Analysis of the Example Statement:
- **Generalization (G):** The argument appears to generalize the characteristic of being a "low performance student" to all domains of knowledge and abilities, such as political discourse.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The statement does not consider other factors that might qualify a person to talk about politics (experience, personal interest, other forms of knowledge, etc.).
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason given (low performance in academics) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (incapacity to discuss politics).
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal link between academic performance and the ability to discuss politics is weak because competence in political discussion is not solely dependent on academic performance.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The argument does not appear to be a repetition of the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There is no claim of universal agreement in the statement itself.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language, while dismissive, does not appear to be inherently ambiguous.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the argument most closely fits as a combination of **Generalization (G)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:

1. It uses a generalization by assuming that low academic performance automatically disqualifies someone from competent political discourse (Generalization, G).
2. The causal link proposed (academic performance to political discourse ability) is weak (Insufficient Causal Basis, WCB).

Thus, the given statement "I can't understand how such a low performance student is able to talk about politics" is an example of both **Generalization (G)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
