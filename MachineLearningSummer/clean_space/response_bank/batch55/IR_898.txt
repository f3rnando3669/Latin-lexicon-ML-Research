For 
To apply <IDAA> to classify the fallacy in the conversation provided, we'll break down the task into specific steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - <P> is the statement we intend to prove or disprove.
   - In this case, the proposition is "It is morally wrong to cheat on your spouse."

2. **Determine the Reason (<R>):**
   - <R> is the causal basis for <P> that establishes its truth.
   - Ashley's reason appears to be implied by the question "why on earth would you have done that?" suggesting that it is a well-accepted moral code.

3. **Identify any Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - <PR> corroborates the Reason with additional arguments.
   - Ashley's statement that "It’s a code of conduct shared by cultures" acts as a further justification.

4. **Analyze the conversation to spot any Defective Argument types:**
   - Generalization (<G>)
   - Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
   - Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
   - Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
   - Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
   - Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)

5. **Analyze the argument to identify which defective argument, if any, is present.**

Let's examine the conversation again within this framework:

1. **Ashley says:** "It is morally wrong to cheat on your spouse."
   - This is the proposition (<P>).

2. **Hannah questions:** "But what is morality exactly?"
   - Hannah introduces a challenge to the definition of morality.

3. **Ashley responds:** "It’s a code of conduct shared by cultures."
   - Ashley provides a reason (<R>) for what morality is.

4. **Hannah questions further:** "But who creates this code?"
   - Hannah continues to challenge the basis and source of the moral code.

Now, we need to identify the relevant defective argument committed by Hannah:

- **Type DEP (Ambiguous Language Use):** If Hannah's questioning is seen as deliberately trying to create confusion by using ambiguous terms, it could fit here.
- **Type IR (Inconclusive Reason):** If Ashley's reason doesn't fully support the claim, this might be relevant, but it's a separate issue from Hannah's fallacy.
- **Type WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis):** If the response Ashley gave does not sufficiently support the moral standing alone.
- **Type FU (Presumptuous Consensus):** If Ashley assumed a universal agreement on her definition of morality without substantiation.
  
- **Type RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition),** **Type G (Generalization),** and **Type FE (Incomplete Enumeration):** Don't directly apply here.

Given Hannah's continuous questioning without providing counter-arguments or challenging the basis effectively, Hannah's fallacy seems most aligned with **Type DEP (Ambiguous Language Use)**, as she is introducing ambiguity to derail the argument.

Therefore, the application of <IDAA> classifies the fallacy as follows:
**"Hannah has committed type DEP (Ambiguous Language Use) fallacy."**
