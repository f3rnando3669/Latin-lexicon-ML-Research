For 
To apply IDAA to the string "If I tell my teacher I have done my homework, but I have only done part of it, I am using," we need to decompose the task of classifying this argument defect into specific steps. Here's how we proceed:

### Step 1: Understand the Context and Structure
- Identify the main proposition (P): "I have done my homework."
- Identify what is being used as the Reason (R): "I have only done part of it."

### Step 2: Analysis of Defective Argument Types
Evaluate which of the defective argument types apply by matching the characteristics of the statement to the definitions provided:

- **Generalization (G)**: Not applicable because this does not involve an assertion based on a part or majority applied to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable because there is no claim of having made a complete enumeration of possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Not applicable because the reason given ("I have only done part of it") does not fail to demonstrate the correctness of the proposition but rather contradicts it.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Not applicable because the causal basis is irrelevant in this context.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Not applicable because the reason does not repeat the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Not applicable because it does not rely on assumed universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Not applicable because there is no ambiguity in understanding the statement.

### Step 3: Identification
The defective argument type that closely aligns with the provided structure is **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**. This is because the proposition made ("I have done my homework") implies a completed action, but the reality is only partial completion, thus lacking completeness in the enumeration of what constitutes "doing homework."

### Conclusion
So, applying IDAA step-by-step to the statement "If I tell my teacher I have done my homework, but I have only done part of it, I am using" would classify it as:
```
FE (Incomplete Enumeration)
```
Because the statement implies that homework is fully done, while in reality, only part of it is completed.
