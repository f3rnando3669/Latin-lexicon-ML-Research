For 
To apply <IDAA> (decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument into specific steps) to the given string, let's break down the process step by step.

Step 1: Identify the components of the argument.
- Proposition (P): What is the core assertion or claim being made?
- Reason (R): What is the causative basis or reasoning provided for the proposition?
- Proof of Reason (PR): Is there any additional evidence or arguments presented to support the Reason?

Step 2: Analyze for defects.
- Determine whether the argument corresponds to one of the predefined defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

Step 3: Classify the defective argument.
- Compare the identified components with the definitions of defective argument types to determine which type (if any) applies.

Now, let's apply these steps to the provided string.

### Analysis of the Given String

1. **Proposition (P) Identification:**
   - "Many parents have withdrawn their children from the local schools."

2. **Reason (R) Identification:**
   - "All the schools in the area had to be kept closed for most part of the week."

3. **Evaluation of the Argument against Defective Types:**

   **Generalization (<G>):**
   - Check if the assertion is based on a sample but applied broadly. (Not applicable)

   **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Determine if the argument claims to cover all possibilities but misses some. (Not applicable)

   **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Evaluate whether the reason conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the proposition. (Possible match: need more context)

   **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Check if the causal basis provided is compelling. (Possible match: need more context)

   **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - See if the reason merely restates the proposition. (Not applicable)

   **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - See if the argument relies on assumed but disputed consensus. (Not applicable)

   **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - Check if the argument contains language that can be interpreted differently than intended. (Not applicable)

### Conclusion

Based on the provided string, the most fitting defective argument types to consider are:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: 
   - While the reason that schools were closed may correlate with parents withdrawing their children, it doesnâ€™t conclusively demonstrate that this is the only cause or major cause. Other reasons could include parents' dissatisfaction with online learning, safety concerns, or other issues unrelated to schools being closed for part of the week.

2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: 
   - The reason provided might be insufficient if the closure of schools for part of the week isn't compelling enough to be the sole or primary cause of parents withdrawing their children. More evidence or stronger causative factors might be required to firmly establish the link.

Thus, the given argument can be classified as primarily of type **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** with a possibility of **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)** depending on further context and evidence.
