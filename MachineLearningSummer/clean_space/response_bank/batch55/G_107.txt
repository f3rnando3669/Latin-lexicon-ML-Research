Sure, let's apply IDAA to classify the given statement, "People nowadays only vote with their emotions instead of their brains." Here’s the detailed step-by-step decomposition of the task:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)

First, we need to identify the proposition being put forth in the statement. The proposition here seems to be:
**P**: "People nowadays only vote with their emotions instead of their brains."

### Step 2: Identify if there’s any Reason (<R>)

Next, we look to see if there's a causal reason given for the proposition. In the given statement, there isn’t an explicit causal reason provided to illustrate why people vote with their emotions rather than their brains. So, we move on to the next step without identifying an <R>.

### Step 3: Identify if Proof of Reason (<PR>) exists

Since there's no explicit reason given in step 2, there should be no proof of the causal reason. This means no <PR> exists based on the given statement.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type

Now, we classify the defective argument type by analyzing the proposition.

- **Generalization (<G>)**: This involves an assertion based on a part or majority, but applied to all. The proposition "People nowadays *only* vote with their emotions instead of their brains" appears to fall under this category because it is making a sweeping generalization about all people based on an unspecified portion of people.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Here, a complete enumeration of possibilities is claimed, but some possibilities are missed. The statement does not list potential reasons or scenarios for emotional vs. rational voting, nor does it claim to enumerate all possibilities explicitly.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>) and Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Since no reason (<R>) is provided, these types are irrelevant in this context.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This involves the reason being the same as the proposition. As there is no reason provided, this type is irrelevant here as well.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This category involves assuming proof by way of universal agreement. The statement does not mention any consensus, so this is also not applicable.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: This involves ambiguous language that can be taken in more than one sense. The statement’s language is quite direct and unambiguous. It specifically claims "only" emotions over brains, not a mix or an uncertainty that could lead to ambiguity.

Based on these considerations, the appropriate classification for the argument in the statement is:

**G (Generalization)**

### Conclusion

Applying IDAA step-by-step to the proposition "People nowadays only vote with their emotions instead of their brains," we classify it as a **Generalization (G)** due to its sweeping assertion about people's voting behavior.
