Sure, let's apply <IDAA>, the application of task decomposition <D> to the task of identifying the defective argument type <IDA> in the given string "40 million people can't be wrong! Buy the new iPhone XIV today!"

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D for IDA):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine the main assertion being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Look for the causal basis or justification provided for the proposition.
3. **Consider any Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Examine any supporting arguments provided for the reason.
4. **Evaluate for Defective Argument Types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>)**: Assess whether the argument fits any predefined defective argument types.

### Applying Decomposition (D) step-by-step:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- **<P>**: "Buy the new iPhone XIV today!"

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- **<R>**: "40 million people can't be wrong!"

#### Step 3: Consider any Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- No additional proof is provided. The provided reason is assumed to be self-sufficient.

#### Step 4: Evaluate for Defective Argument Types
Let's match the identified <P> and <R> against the defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The Reason asserts something based on 40 million people, potentially implying it applies to everyone. This does not immediately seem like a classic overgeneralization as it doesn't assert that the experience of these 40 million people applies universally, but rather implies popularity as a basis for correctness.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The argument does not attempt to enumerate all possibilities but rather relies on the popularity, so this does not fit.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The reason ("40 million people can't be wrong!") does not conclusively demonstrate why buying the new iPhone XIV today is the correct course of action. It merely appeals to popularity.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - The causal relationship ("40 million people can't be wrong!") may be seen as weak, as popularity does not inherently imply quality or correctness.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - The reason does not repeat the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - The statement assumes a consensus ("40 million people can't be wrong!") as a final proof, which is still under dispute.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
   - There is no significant ambiguity in language.

### Determination:
Based on the decomposition and analysis, the given string "40 million people can't be wrong! Buy the new iPhone XIV today!" most closely fits the defective argument type:

- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: The argument presumes that the opinion of 40 million people is conclusively correct simply because it is widely held.

Given the context and the nature of the reasoning, it also partially fits:

- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: The reasoning provided does not substantiate the proposition conclusively.

Therefore, the primary classification for this argument would be:
- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**
  
A secondary classification could be noted as:
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** since the reason does not conclusively establish the correctness of the proposition.

This completes the application of <IDAA> to "40 million people can't be wrong! Buy the new iPhone XIV today!"
