For 
Applying IDAA (the application of the task decomposition to the task of classifying the given statement "There's no point listening to you. Everybody knows you're just a little do-gooder.") involves breaking down the classification task into specific steps. Here's how it can be done step by step:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The statement asserts that "There's no point listening to you." This can be considered the main proposition.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reasoning provided is "Everybody knows you're just a little do-gooder."

3. **Evaluate the Reason's Causal Basis:**
   - Analyze whether the reason given sufficiently establishes the truth of the proposition. In this case, the reason given appears to be that the speaker is a "little do-gooder," which supposedly means there's no point listening to them.

4. **Classify the Type of Reasoning:**
   - Determine if the reasoning falls into one of the defective argument categories specified (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

Now, let's categorize the reasoning step by step:

### Step-by-Step Classification:

**Step 1: Check for Generalization (<G>):**
   - The statement might be considered a generalization if it assumes that because "everybody" supposedly holds a view, it must be true universally. However, this is more about the presumption of consensus ("universally agreed upon") rather than a generalization from a particular instance to the whole.

**Step 2: Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The argument does not involve enumerating possibilities, so this does not apply.

**Step 3: Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The reason ("you're just a little do-gooder") is not conclusively demonstrating why "There's no point listening to you." This suggests possible inconclusiveness.

**Step 4: Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The causal basis that "you're just a little do-gooder" is not presented compellingly to establish that there's no point in listening to the speaker.

**Step 5: Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - There is no repetition of the proposition in the reason.

**Step 6: Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - The reason assumes it is universally known and agreed ("everybody knows"), implying truth without justification for this consensus. This makes it likely a case of presumptuous consensus.

**Step 7: Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - There is no indication of ambiguous language usage that could be interpreted differently from the speaker's intent.

After considering all these checks, the statement "There's no point listening to you. Everybody knows you're just a little do-gooder." falls most clearly into <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus). The reasoning relies on the pretense that everyone universally agrees on the proposition, which remains in dispute or is not substantiated with evidence.

**Conclusion:**
The classification of the given statement using IDAA is <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).
