To apply the method of decomposing the task of classifying the given string as a defective argument (<IDAA>) step by step, we will break down the process into specific steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of the Task (<IDAA> for <IDA>)

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>) in the Argument:**
   - Proposition (<P>): "Cheesecake Factory is the best"
   - Reason (<R>): "because it is always crowded"

2. **Analyze the Reason to Check its Validity:**
   - Is the Reason (<R>) logically compelling and sufficient to support the Proposition (<P>)? 

3. **Classify the Defective Argument Type Based on the Analysis:**
   - Generalization (<G>)
   - Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
   - Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
   - Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
   - Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
   - Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)

### Application:

1. **Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>):**
   - Proposition (<P>): "Cheesecake Factory is the best"
   - Reason (<R>): "because it is always crowded"

2. **Analyze the Reason (<R>):**
   - **Reason's Claim**: "because it is always crowded"
     - The Reason suggests that the Cheesecake Factory's constant crowd is the basis for its superiority.
     - To determine if this is a valid causal basis, we need to assess whether "being always crowded" necessarily implies "being the best."

3. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:**
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: Does not apply here, as the statement is not making a generalization about a group.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Does not apply, as the statement does not involve enumerating all possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This is a potential match. The crowdiness might not conclusively demonstrate the superlative quality of the restaurant.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This is likely the most appropriate. The causal basis ("being crowded") is not a compelling or sufficient reason to claim that Cheesecake Factory is "the best."
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Does not apply here, as the Reason is not simply a repetition of the Proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Does not apply; the argument does not claim universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Does not seem to apply, as the terms used in the Reason are straightforward and do not have multiple meanings in this context.

### Conclusion:
The argument "Cheesecake Factory is the best because it is always crowded" is classified as a defective argument type **Insufficient Causal Basis** (<WCB>). The Reason provided does not offer a compelling and sufficient causal basis to establish the truth of the Proposition.

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the given string, the classified argument type is **<WCB>**.
