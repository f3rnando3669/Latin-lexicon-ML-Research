For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposition) to the task of classifying the string "Your friend says, 'You can't prove that space aliens don't exist, so they must be real.'" according to the defined defective argument types, we need to follow a step-by-step procedure. Hereâ€™s how we can do it:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
First, identify the core assertion or claim (Proposition) made in the statement.

**Proposition (P):**
"Space aliens must be real."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
Next, identify the Reason that is being used to support the Proposition.

**Reason (R):**
"You can't prove that space aliens don't exist."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Logical Structure
Evaluate the causal basis for the relationship between the Proposition <P> and the Reason <R> given. Determine if the Reason actually supports the Proposition logically and conclusively, or if it falls into one of the defective argument types.

### Step 4: Compare with Defective Argument Types
Compare the reasoning pattern in the statement against the definitions of defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

1. **Generalization (G)**: The argument is not based on applying a single instance to a whole group.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not pertain to a set of possibilities being wrongly deemed complete.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: While the Reason "You can't prove that space aliens don't exist" does not conclusively demonstrate the truth of the Proposition, this is actually a specific type of fallacious reasoning known as **Argument from Ignorance** rather than just an inconclusive reason.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The Reason is not repeating the Proposition.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: While plausible, this argument pattern is more accurately captured by a specific type of fallacy.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Not relevant as the PR is not based on a presumed universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: There is no ambiguity in language use that changes the meaning of the Reason.

### Step 5: Conclusion
From the above comparison, while <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) seems fitting as the Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the Proposition, the specific nature of this argument is known as an **Argument from Ignorance**. This is where the lack of evidence against something is taken as evidence for it.

However, given our defined categories:

**This statement is best classified as an <IR> (Inconclusive Reason):**

### Summary
The defective argument type is: **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**

Specific Reasoning:
The Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the Proposition, fitting our defined category despite the argument being a specific case of Argument from Ignorance.
