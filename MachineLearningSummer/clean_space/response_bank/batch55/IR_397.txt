For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of the decomposition of a task into specific steps) to <IDA> (the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types), we need to decompose the task of identifying defective arguments into systematic steps. Let's break this down step-by-step using the provided string:

**String for Analysis:**
"Debate moderator: 'What will you do to fix the economic crisis?' Candidate: 'It's important to focus on what started this crisis to begin with. My opponent...'"

### Step 1: Extract the Proposition (P)
Identify the main assertion or the proposition set forth in the string.

**Analysis:**
The proposition hinted at by the candidate is that to fix the economic crisis, one needs to focus on its origin. The candidate's final assertion is incomplete: "It's important to focus on what started this crisis to begin with. My opponent...".

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
Determine the causal basis or the reasoning provided to support the proposition.

**Analysis:**
The candidate's reason is implied in the statement "It's important to focus on what started this crisis to begin with." The candidate suggests that understanding the origin of the crisis is crucial, but no clear reasoning is provided for this.

### Step 3: Assess the Proof of Reason (PR)
Look for further evidence or arguments that corroborate the Reason. 

**Analysis:**
There is no additional argument presented here. The argument stops at an implied suggestion without further backing.

### Step 4: Evaluate the Argument for Defective Patterns (Classify <s>)
Using the classifications G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, and DEP, determine if there are any defective argument types involved.

**Analysis:**
- **G (Generalization):** Not applicable, as no generalization about a group is made.
- **FE (Incomplete Enumeration):** Not applicable, as no enumeration is asserted.
- **IR (Inconclusive Reason):** The reason "It's important to focus on what started this crisis" does not conclusively demonstrate how that action will fix the crisis.
- **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** Not applicable, as there is no repetition present here.
- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The reason provided is weak and does not compellingly support how focusing on the origin will fix the crisis.
- **FU (Presumptuous Consensus):** Not applicable, no appeal to universal agreement is made.
- **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use):** The language is not particularly ambiguous.

Given the analysis, the argument appears to suffer primarily from:

**IR (Inconclusive Reason)**: The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate how the proposed action (focusing on the origin of the crisis) will achieve the goal (fixing the economic crisis).

**WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The causal basis provided (focusing on the origin) is weak and does not compellingly support the proposition.

### Conclusion
Based on the step-by-step analysis, we classify the given string "Debate moderator: 'What will you do to fix the economic crisis?' Candidate: 'It's important to focus on what started this crisis to begin with. My opponent...'" as primarily demonstrating the defective argument types **IR (Inconclusive Reason)** and **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
