For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task IDA into specific steps) to classify the statement "Because cases spiked rapidly in New York City back in March, it justified us closing down the whole country.", we need to break down this classification into clear and specific steps.

**Step 1: Identify the Type of Argument**
- **Proposition (<P>)**: This is the main statement that is being put forth. 
  - In this case, the proposition is: "it justified us closing down the whole country."
- **Reason (<R>)**: This is the causal basis given for the proposition.
  - In this case, the reason is: "Because cases spiked rapidly in New York City back in March."

**Step 2: Analyze the Nature of the Argument for Defects**
Now we will check if the given reason fits any of the defective argument types:
- **Generalization (<G>)**: Is the conclusion based on an insufficient generalization?
  - This might be the case if the argument concludes a general policy (closing down the whole country) based on a specific case (New York City).
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Did the argument fail to consider other possibilities?
  - The argument does not enumerate other factors or locations outside New York City that would justify the closure.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
  - The rapid spike in one city does not conclusively justify nationwide action without considering other regions' situations.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Is the causal basis inadequate to support the proposition?
  - The causal link between the spike in cases in a single location and nationwide lockdown may be weak.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Is the reason simply a restatement of the proposition?
  - In this case, the reason and the proposition are not merely restating each other.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Is the proof assuming consensus that is still disputed?
  - This defect does not seem applicable here.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Is there ambiguous language that can be misinterpreted?
  - The language here seems fairly clear and unambiguous.

**Step 3: Determine the Most Appropriate Defective Argument Type**
- Based on our analysis, the likely defective argument types could be Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), and Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).

**Step 4: Evaluate Each Candidate Defective Argument Type**
1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement generalizes the situation in New York City to the whole country. This fits the definition since it implies that one city's spike justifies a national response.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The justification does not consider other factors or regions, thus fitting this category as well.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The link between one city's data to nationwide action is not necessarily conclusive.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis (spike in New York City) might be insufficient to justify the nationwide policy.

Given the statement provided and considering the argument context, the strongest classifications would likely be:
- **Generalization (<G>)**: The primary flaw seems to be generalizing from the New York City data to justify a national policy.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: There's also a lack of complete consideration for other data or factors.

**Step 5: Conclusion**
The decomposition completed, we can classify the provided statement as primarily type **<G> (Generalization)** with a strong indication of **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)** as well.
