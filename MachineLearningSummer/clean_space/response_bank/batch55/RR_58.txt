For 
To apply the process of IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as a defective argument type) to the statement "Affirmative Action can never be fair or just. You cannot remedy one injustice by committing another," we will break down the task of analyzing and classifying this statement into specific steps.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify Proposition (P):**
   - Extract the main claim or proposition being made.
   
2. **Identify Reason (R):**
   - Determine what reason is being given in support of the proposition.

3. **Analyze Argument for Defects:**
   - Compare the identified parts of the argument to known types of defective arguments (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

4. **Classification:**
   - Classify the argument based on the most fitting defective argument type.

### Detailed Application

#### Step 1: Identify Proposition (P)

**Proposition (P):** "Affirmative Action can never be fair or just."
This is the main claim or assertion the argument is making.

#### Step 2: Identify Reason (R)

**Reason (R):** "You cannot remedy one injustice by committing another."
This is the causal basis or rationale given to support the proposition that affirmative action can never be fair or just.

#### Step 3: Analyze Argument for Defects

- **Generalization (G):** This involves taking one part or a majority of cases and applying it to all. The statement doesn't seem to generalize in this way; rather, it presents a categorical denial of the fair or just nature of affirmative action.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This type involves claiming a complete enumeration while missing some possibilities. The statement does not enumerate possibilities but rather makes an absolute claim, so this does not apply.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason given must conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. The reason "You cannot remedy one injustice by committing another" is more of a moral assertion and does not logically or conclusively demonstrate why affirmative action can never be fair or just. It assumes a moral equivalence without providing concrete argumentation.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** If the reason is weak or uncompelling in its causality, it falls under this type. As the reason given seems to rely on asserting a moral equivalence (without in-depth reasoning or evidence), it may fit here as the causal basis is not compelling or fully explained.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This type involves the reason simply repeating the proposition. The reason here does not repeat the proposition verbatim but rather asserts a related moral idea instead.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This type assumes a reason to be true based on alleged universal agreement. The statement does not appeal to a consensus.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** This involves using language that can be interpreted in multiple ways. The language here is relatively clear, asserting a specific moral stance rather than ambiguous terminology.

#### Step 4: Classification

By the process of elimination and analysis, the statement appears to suffer from **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** as the most fitting candidates. However, since "the reason given must conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition" and the given reason relies on an assumed moral principle without detailed argumentation or evidence, it is best classified under:

**Classification (Type):** <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)

Thus, the statement "Affirmative Action can never be fair or just. You cannot remedy one injustice by committing another." is classified as having the defect of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
