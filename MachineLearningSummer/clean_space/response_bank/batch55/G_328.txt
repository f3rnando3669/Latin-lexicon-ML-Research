To apply the `IDAA` process to the given argument "If we put limits on the right to bear arms, soon all of our Constitutionally-given rights will be taken away," we will decompose the classification task (IDA) into specific steps (D) and process each step accordingly. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (`P`)
Proposition (`P`): "If we put limits on the right to bear arms, soon all of our Constitutionally-given rights will be taken away."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (`R`)
Reason (`R`): This is an implicit or unstated part that we must infer. In this case, it can be stated as: "Putting limits on one right will lead to limits on all rights."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (`PR`)
Proof of Reason (`PR`): There seems to be a lack of specific additional supporting arguments presented in the statement. It appears more as a bare assertion without proof.

### Step 4: Analyze whether the argument falls into any of the defective argument categories

1. **Generalization (`G`)**: The argument does not generalize based on one part or majority individuals.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (`FE`)**: The argument does not claim a complete enumeration of possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (`IR`)**: This argument could fall into this category if the reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the validity of the proposition. The leap from limiting one right to losing all rights is a significant one and requires substantial evidence to be conclusive.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (`WCB`)**: The causal connection between limiting one right leading to the loss of all rights seems weak without additional supporting evidence.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (`RR`)**: The argument does not merely repeat the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (`FU`)**: The argument does not claim "it is universally agreed upon."
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (`DEP`)**: There does not seem to be ambiguous language that can be taken in another sense than intended.

### Step 5: Match the findings to a defective argument type

Based on the analysis above, the argument appears to fit primarily into the **Inconclusive Reason** (`IR`) category because the reasoning provided (limiting one right leads to losing all rights) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition without substantial evidence.

### Conclusion
Apply `IDAA` to the argument "If we put limits on the right to bear arms, soon all of our Constitutionally-given rights will be taken away":
- **Classification (`IDA`)**: `IR` (Inconclusive Reason)
