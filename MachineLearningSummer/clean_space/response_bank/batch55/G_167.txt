For 
To apply the process of IDAA (the decomposition of IDA into specific steps for classifying the argument as of a certain defective type) to the given string "All engineers are introverts who would rather relate to computers than people," we'll proceed with the following steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)

Here, the proposition is:
- "All engineers are introverts who would rather relate to computers than people."

### Step 2: Examine the Reason (<R>)

The string provided does not explicitly include a separate reason. It is making a generalized assertion without providing a causal basis.

### Step 3: Check for a Proof of Reason (<PR>)

The string also does not supply additional support or proof for the reason, further reinforcing that it is primarily a standalone proposition.

### Step 4: Compare with Defective Argument Types

Let's compare the string with the definitions of defective argument types:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: The proposition is based on an assertion about "all engineers" based on a stereotype. It is a generalization because it attributes a characteristic to all members of a group without evidence that the characteristic applies universally.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This doesn't apply here because no enumeration of possibilities is presented.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This doesn't apply as there is no separate reason presented.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This doesn't apply since no causal basis is presented.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This doesn't apply as the reason is not simply a repetition of the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This doesn't apply because the assertion isn't claimed to be true based on supposed universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: This doesn't seem to apply as the language used in the proposition is quite clear and unambiguous.

### Step 5: Determine the Classification

Based on the comparison with defective argument types, the best fit for this string is:

- **Generalization (<G>)**

### Summary

The statement "All engineers are introverts who would rather relate to computers than people" is classified as a Generalization (<G>). This is because it makes a broad assertion about an entire group based on an insufficient basis and is not necessarily applicable to all individuals in the group.
