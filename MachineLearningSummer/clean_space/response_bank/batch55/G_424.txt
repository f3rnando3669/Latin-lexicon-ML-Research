For 
To apply IDAA, which involves decomposing the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types into specific steps and then carrying out those steps, let's follow this process for the given string "If we allow euthanasia, the next thing you know, murder will be legal."

**Step 1: Identify the components of the argument**

1. **Proposition (<P>):** "If we allow euthanasia, the next thing you know, murder will be legal."
2. **Reason (<R>):** N/A (the argument is implicit, but it implies that allowing euthanasia would lead to a widespread disregard for the value of human life, eventually leading to the legalization of murder).

**Step 2: Analyze the components for defects**

We need to determine if the argument fits any of the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

**Step 3: Match the argument to defective argument types**

- **Generalization (<G>):** This argument does not seem to be a case of generalizing from a part to a whole.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This argument does not provide a list of possibilities, so it is not a case of incomplete enumeration.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Since the reason provided (that allowing euthanasia leads to murder being legalized) does not conclusively establish the correctness of the proposition, this could be a potential match. The argument relies on a slippery slope, which is often an inconclusive reason.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** There is no repetition here, so it does not match this type.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This type fits well as well. The causal link between allowing euthanasia and the eventual legalization of murder is not compelling or logically justified.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The argument does not claim that the assertion is universally agreed upon.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The language does not appear ambiguous in this context.

**Step 4: Final Classification**

Two defective argument types seem to apply here: **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**. 

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The string lacks a demonstration that specifically shows how allowing euthanasia will directly lead to the legalization of murder, hence making the reasoning inconclusive.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal connection suggested by the argument is weak and not compelling enough to establish the stated consequence.

**Step 5: Conclusion**

Given the analysis, the most fitting classification for the argument "If we allow euthanasia, the next thing you know, murder will be legal." is:
- <IR>: Inconclusive Reason
- <WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis
