Sure, let's apply the methodology of IDAA (decomposition of the task of classifying the argument into specific steps) to the statement "One day robots will enslave us all. It's true. My computer science teacher says so."

### Decomposition (D) Steps:
1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Determine what is being claimed or asserted.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Determine the causal basis for the Proposition.

3. **Determine if there is Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - Check if there is additional support provided for the Reason.

4. **Classify the Argument:**
   - Analyze the identified Proposition, Reason, and any Proof of Reason to classify the argument as one of the defective argument types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

### Application to the String (IDA):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - **Proposition (P):** "One day robots will enslave us all."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - **Reason (R):** "It's true."

3. **Determine if there is Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - **Proof of Reason (PR):** "My computer science teacher says so."

4. **Classify the Argument:**
   - **Generalization (G):** Not applicable. The argument is not broadening from a subset to a whole.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable. The argument is not listing possibilities or cases.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Applicable. The Reason ("It's true") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition ("One day robots will enslave us all").
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Also applicable. The Reason provided ("It's true") is weak and not compelling. Saying something is true without supporting evidence is insufficient.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Not applicable. The argument does not simply restate the Proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Potentially applicable. The supporting claim is an appeal to authority ("My computer science teacher says so") which implies an assumed consensus or expertise without substantial evidence.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Not applicable. The language is clear enough in terms of intention and meaning.

Thus, the string "One day robots will enslave us all. It's true. My computer science teacher says so." can primarily be classified under:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** because the reason provided doesn't conclusively support the Proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** because the causal basis for the Proposition is weak.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** because it presumes its validity based on an authority's statement without substantial evidence.

### Conclusion:
The statement "One day robots will enslave us all. It's true. My computer science teacher says so." exhibits multiple defective argument types primarily Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), and potentially Presumptuous Consensus (FU).
