To apply the process of IDAA (decomposition of the classification task IDA into specific steps) to the argument provided, "The Bible is the Word of God because God tells us it is... in the Bible. X is true because of Y. Y is true because of X.", we will break down the classification task into a step-by-step procedure.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition (P) and Reason (R) in the argument:**
    - **P:** "The Bible is the Word of God."
    - **R:** "Because God tells us it is... in the Bible."

2. **Analyze the Reason for its quality as a causal basis:**
    - Does the Reason effectively establish the truth of the Proposition?
    - The Reason given is that God tells us in the Bible itself. This forms a circular structure: "The Bible is the Word of God because the Bible says so."
  
3. **Check for any Proof of Reason (PR):**
    - Is there an additional argument or evidence presented to corroborate the Reason?
    - No additional arguments or evidence are presented beyond the circular reasoning.

4. **Classify the Argument by matching the analysis to defective argument types:**
    - Given the circular nature of the reasoning, where R repeats P, it looks similar to returning back to the proposition without providing an independent reason.

### Types of Defective Arguments to Consider:

- **Generalization (G):** This is not making a sweeping generalization from a part to the whole.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** No enumeration of possibilities is being claimed.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason does not establish the Proposition independently.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis relies solely on itself in a circular way.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The Reason is essentially the same as the Proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** No consensus is being claimed.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language is not ambiguous, but rather circular.

### Final Classification:

Based on the steps, we classify the defective argument as:

**RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** The Reason (R) "God tells us it is... in the Bible" is essentially the same as repeating the Proposition (P) "The Bible is the Word of God."

### Conclusion:

The argument "The Bible is the Word of God because God tells us it is... in the Bible. X is true because of Y. Y is true because of X." fits the category of **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)** due to the circular reasoning where the reason simply restates the proposition without providing an independent basis.
