To apply the IDAA methodology to the task of classifying the provided string as one of the defective argument types, we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)

First, we need to identify what the main assertion or proposition in the string is. The proposition is what the speaker is aiming to prove or discuss summarily.

**Identified Proposition:**
"My roommate wants to talk about cleaning out the garage."

### Step 2: Evaluate the Reason (<R>)

Next, identify the reason given to support the proposition. The reason sets forth the causal basis for the proposition.

**Presented Reason:**
"So I asked her what she wants to do with our patio furniture."

### Step 3: Examine the Proof of Reason (<PR>)

Identify any proof or additional arguments provided to corroborate the reason.

**Proof of Reason:**
"Now she's shopping for new patio furniture and not asking me about the garage."

### Step 4: Classify the Argument Type

Now, we need to examine the defective argument types and determine which type(s) might apply:

- **Generalization (<G>):** Does the argument unfairly generalize from a part to the whole?
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Does the proposition claim completeness but overlook some items?
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Does the reason provided fail to conclusively establish the proposition?
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Is the causal basis weak or not compelling?
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Does the reason merely repeat the proposition?
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Is the proof resting on an assumed but disputed consensus?
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Is there any ambiguous language or double meaning?

Let's analyze the string more closely:

**Step 4a: Generalization (<G>)**
- No, the argument doesn't seem to be generalized from a part to the whole.

**Step 4b: Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
- No, the argument doesn't claim completeness by overlooking items.

**Step 4c: Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- Possibly. The reason "So I asked her what she wants to do with our patio furniture" doesn’t conclusively establish why the roommate now focuses on shopping for new patio furniture instead of discussing the garage.

**Step 4d: Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
- Potentially. The reason given ("asking her about the patio furniture") may not form a compelling causal basis for why the proposition about discussing the garage was deflected. 

**Step 4e: Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**
- No, the reason doesn't repeat the proposition.

**Step 4f: Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
- No, it doesn’t rely on a disputed consensus.

**Step 4g: Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**
- No, there isn't any evident ambiguous language.

### Step 5: Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the most likely classifications for the defective argument are:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Because the reason doesn’t conclusively establish any logical flow back to the main proposition.
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal connection between asking about the patio furniture and deflecting from discussing the garage seems weak.

**Final Conclusion:**
The string "My roommate wants to talk about cleaning out the garage, so I asked her what she wants to do with our patio furniture. Now she's shopping for new patio furniture and not asking me about the garage." is classified as a defective argument type primarily of **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and possibly **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
