For 
Sure, let's apply the process of IDAA to the given string ", rather than on his arguments or opinions."

### Decomposition of IDA (D):

1. **Understand and isolate the proposition \( <P> \)**: Examine the given string to identify what the proposition is.
2. **Identify the Reason \( <R> \)**: Determine the causal basis that supports the proposition.
3. **Examine the Proof of Reason \( <PR> \)**: Check for additional arguments that corroborate the reason.
4. **Compare against defective argument types**:
   - Generalization \( <G> \)
   - Incomplete Enumeration \( <FE> \)
   - Inconclusive Reason \( <IR> \)
   - Insufficient Causal Basis \( <WCB> \)
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition \( <RR> \)
   - Presumptuous Consensus \( <FU> \)
   - Ambiguous Language Use \( <DEP> \)

### Application to the string:

#### Step 1: Understanding and isolating the proposition \( <P> \)
The given string ", rather than on his arguments or opinions," is actually a fragment and does not, by itself, contain a complete proposition. It acts more like a dependent clause suggesting preference or an alternative focus but lacks a main assertion.

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason \( <R> \)
Given that the string is incomplete, it lacks an associated reason \( <R> \). Normally, we would look for a justification that supports the \( <P> \). 

#### Step 3: Examine the Proof of Reason \( <PR> \)
This does not apply here since we do not have a clear \( <R> \) to begin with. Without \( <R> \), there can be no \( <PR> \).

#### Step 4: Compare against defective argument types

1. **Generalization \( <G> \)**: This doesn’t apply as the string does not make any generalized assertions.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration \( <FE> \)**: This might be a candidate since the phrase suggests an omission or incomplete analysis of arguments. However, we don't have a context that claims completeness.
3. **Inconclusive Reason \( <IR> \)**: Not applicable, as there is no reason given.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis \( <WCB> \)**: Not applicable, as there is no reason given.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition \( <RR> \)**: Not applicable, there is no repetition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus \( <FU> \)**: This could be relevant if the clause implied a presumed consensus on something unproved, but the fragment does not provide this context.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use \( <DEP> \)**: This could potentially apply if the phrase is taken out of context, making it susceptible to misunderstanding. The term "rather than on his arguments or opinions" could be ambiguous if it’s not clear what the alternative focus is.

#### Conclusion:
Given the available information and context, the most applicable defective argument type for ", rather than on his arguments or opinions," appears to be **Ambiguous Language Use \( <DEP> \)**. This inference is based on the ambiguity that arises when the phrase is detached from its main clause.

Therefore, the classification \( <IDAA> \) for the string is \( <DEP> \).
