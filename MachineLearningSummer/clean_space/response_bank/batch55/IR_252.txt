For 
To apply the decomposition of the advanced task \(<t>\) into specific steps, now labeled as \(<D>\), to the task of classifying the defective argument \(<IDA>\), let's take it step by step:

1. **Understand the Task \(<IDA>\):**
   The task at hand is to classify the given string as one of the defective argument types: \(<G>\), \(<FE>\), \(<IR>\), \(<RR>\), \(<WCB>\), \(<FU>\), or \(<DEP>\).

2. **Analyze the Given String:**
   The string provided is: "I can't trust that doctor's advice on how to raise my child. He has never been a mother."

3. **Identify the Proposition \(<P>\):**
   The proposition in the given string seems to be: "I can't trust that doctor's advice on how to raise my child."

4. **Identify the Reason \(<R>\):**
   The reason provided for the proposition is: "He has never been a mother."

5. **Evaluate the Reason \(<R>\) in Context of Defective Arguments:**
   We now need to examine whether the reason \(<R>\) supports \(<P>\) and, if not, identify what kind of defective argument it represents.

6. **Compare with Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization \(<G>\)**: This doesn't appear to be a generalization.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration \(<FE>\)**: There's no enumeration of possibilities here.
   - **Inconclusive Reason \(<IR>\)**: The reason does not necessarily conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition that the doctor's advice is untrustworthy (Just because the doctor isn't a mother does not necessarily mean his advice is unsound).
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis \(<WCB>\)**: The reason provided for not trusting the advice is not compelling.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition \(<RR>\)**: The reason isn't repeating the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus \(<FU>\)**: No appeal to universal agreement here.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use \(<DEP>\)**: The language is not ambiguous in its intent.

7. **Match the Argument with Defective Types:**
   The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition and is an insufficient causal basis for dismissing the doctor's advice. Therefore, the string seems to fall under both \(<IR>\) and \(<WCB>\).

8. **Conclusion:**
   The string "I can't trust that doctor's advice on how to raise my child. He has never been a mother." is an example of:
   - **Inconclusive Reason \(<IR>\)**: because the reason provided does not conclusively support the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis \(<WCB>\)**: because the rationale provided is not a compelling reason to dismiss the advice.

Thus, the specified string is correctly classified as \(<IR>\) and \(<WCB>\).
