For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of the decomposition task <D> to the task of classifying a defective argument <IDA>) to the given string, we will break down the advanced task of classifying the argument into specific steps and execute them.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Determine what is being set forth as the main point or claim of the argument.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Determine the causal basis given for the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Determine if any additional arguments are presented to support the reason.
4. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types:** Check for any types of defective arguments in the identified components.

Now applying these steps to the given string:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The main point being made:
- **Proposition (<P>):** "The Covid vaccine will cause genetic mutations."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The causal basis given for the proposition:
- **Reason (<R>):** "My minister says so, and he has a college degree and is a holy man."

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>) 
Determine if there are any additional arguments supporting the reason:
- In this case, there is no additional argument presented beyond the statements about the minister's credentials. The proof of reason is implicitly the appeal to the minister's authority.

#### Step 4: Analyze for Defective Argument Types
Check the components for any type of defective arguments:

1. **Generalization (G):** Not applicable here, as no generalization is being made.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable, as no enumeration of possibilities is involved.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** May apply if the reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Likely applicable, as the causal basis (the minister's authority) is not scientifically compelling for a medical claim.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Not applicable, as the reason provided is not a simple repetition of the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Not applicable, as there is no reference to a universal agreement.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Not clearly applicable, as the language used seems intended specifically.

#### Conclusion:
The argument can be classified based on the identified defective types:

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reason given is that the minister has a college degree and is a holy man, which is not a compelling causal basis to support the medical claim about the vaccine causing genetic mutations.

Thus, the argument "My minister says the Covid vaccine will cause genetic mutations. He has a college degree, and is a holy man, so he must be right." is classified as having the defective argument type <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
