For 
To apply the concept of IDAA (Decomposition of an advanced task into specific steps and applying this to the task of identifying defective argument types (IDA)), we will proceed step by step according to the definitions and framework provided.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of the Task (IDA) 

1. **Identify components within the given string.**
2. **Analyze the Proposition (P).**
3. **Analyze the Reason (R).**
4. **Analyze the Proof of Reason (PR).**
5. **Identify the defective argument type.**

#### Applying these steps to "It is what it is!":

### Step 1: Identify Components Within the Given String
The given string is "It is what it is!". This is a complete statement but lacks depth and context.

### Step 2: Analyze the Proposition (P)
- **Proposition Analysis:** The Proposition here (P) seems to be "It is what it is." This statement aims to assert something but in a very tautological and non-informative manner.

### Step 3: Analyze the Reason (R)
- **Reason Analysis:** There is no additional causal basis or support given for the proposition. The statement does not provide a reason beyond its own repetition.

### Step 4: Analyze the Proof of Reason (PR)
- **Proof of Reason Analysis:** There is no evidence or additional argument provided that supports the reason (which is absent) for the proposition.

### Step 5: Identify the Defective Argument Type
- **Generalization (G):** The given statement does not attempt to generalize based on a sample size, so it does not fit this type.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This statement does not make an incomplete list of possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** There is no reason given, so we cannot classify it directly under inconclusive reason.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The statement does not provide a causal basis at all.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The statement simply repeats the proposition ("It is what it is.") without adding any new information or reasoning. This fits the definition of Faulty Repetition of Proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The statement does not imply any universal consensus or agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The statement is straightforward and not ambiguous in its meaning but tautological.

By going through these steps:
- The given proposition repeats itself without offering any further reasoning or proof.

Thus, applying **IDAA to "It is what it is!"**, we classify it as:
**<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**.
