For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task IDA into specific steps) to the given string "Don't ever steal! Once you start, you won't be able to stop, and you'll end up bankrupt," we'll follow a structured approach to analyze and classify the argument type. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Parse the Argument Structure
**Proposition (<P>):** "Don't ever steal!"
**Reason (<R>):** "Once you start, you won't be able to stop, and you'll end up bankrupt."

### Step 2: Analyze the Reason (<R>)
The reason given is a causal claim stating that starting to steal leads to an uncontrollable habit and eventually results in bankruptcy.

### Step 3: Identify Potential Defective Argument Types

- **Generalization (<G>):** This does not seem to be a case where a general rule is being wrongly applied from a specific instance or majority; it is more about cause and effect.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument does not seem to miss considering different possibilities; it is presenting a straightforward causal chain.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason provided might be considered inconclusive if it fails to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition, i.e., not everyone who begins stealing becomes unable to stop and ends up bankrupt.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal basis might be weak if the linkage between starting to steal and becoming bankrupt is not compelling or universally applicable.

- **Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason provided does not repeat the proposition; it introduces a new idea about stopping and bankruptcy.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The argument does not seem to rely on presumptive consensus as justification.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** There doesn't appear to be any ambiguous language in the reason given.

### Step 4: Apply Definition to Classify the Argument

- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** The reason stating that stealing will lead to an inability to stop and bankruptcy does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. This causal connection is not necessarily strong or universally true for all cases.
  
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The argument may also fall under this type since the causal basis provided ("once you start, you won't be able to stop, and you'll end up bankrupt") is not necessarily compelling or universally applicable. There are certainly instances where someone might steal once without falling into a chronic habit or ending up bankrupt.

Ultimately, this argument could be classified under both **<IR>** and **<WCB>** due to the inconclusive reasoning and insufficient causal basis provided.

**Final Classification:** The argument can be classified as **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** and **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
