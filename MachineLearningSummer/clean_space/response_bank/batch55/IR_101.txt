For 
To apply IDAA (application of task decomposition to the classification of a string as a defective argument type) to the statement "ghosts must exist, because nobody has been able to prove that they don't," we will take it step by step as follows:

1. **Understand the task (IDA):** 
   - The task is to classify a given string (s) as one of the defective argument types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

2. **Decompose the task (D):** 
   - **Step 1:** Identify and understand the parts of the given argument: Proposition (P), Reason (R), Proof of Reason (PR).
   - **Step 2:** Examine the given argument for defects according to the definitions provided for types of defective arguments.
   - **Step 3:** Classify the argument based on the identified defect.

3. **Step-by-step application (IDAA):**

   **Step 1:** Identify and understand the parts:
   - **Proposition (P):** "Ghosts must exist"
     - This is the statement that the argument intends to prove.
   - **Reason (R):** "because nobody has been able to prove that they don't"
     - This is the causal basis provided to support the proposition.

   **Step 2:** Examine the argument for defects:
   - **Generalization (G):** The assertion is not based on a generalization of individuals or cases.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument does not claim a complete enumeration of possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Check if the reason provided conclusively demonstrates the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Assess if the causal basis is compelling enough to support the proposition.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The Reason does not simply repeat the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument does not rely on a presumed universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)::** The language used in the reason appears clear without ambiguity.

   **Step 3:** Classify the argument:
   - The reason provided, "because nobody has been able to prove that they don't," is not a compelling causal basis to assert the proposition "Ghosts must exist." It fails to conclusively demonstrate the proposition because the inability to disprove something is not adequate evidence of its existence.
   - This fits the definition of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, where the reason is weak and the causal basis provided is not compelling enough to establish the proposition.

**Conclusion:** The argument "ghosts must exist, because nobody has been able to prove that they don't" is an example of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
