Sure, I can help break down and classify the argument "Circular definition: a definition that is circular" step by step using the defined defective argument types.

### Step 1: Understanding the Argument 
We start by understanding the sentence: "Circular definition: a definition that is circular." A circular definition is one in which the term being defined appears in the definition, thus not providing any additional explanatory information.

### Step 2: Identify Possible Defective Argument Types
Next, we identify the defective argument types and their definitions:
- <G> Generalization
- <FE> Incomplete Enumeration
- <IR> Inconclusive Reason
- <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis
- <RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition
- <FU> Presumptuous Consensus
- <DEP> Ambiguous Language Use

### Step 3: Analyze the Sentence
The proposition in the argument is that a circular definition defines a term by using the term itself. Essentially, this gives no new information.

### Step 4: Match with Defective Argument Type
Given the argument's nature, it seems to repeat the proposition without offering a new insight or reasoning.

### Conclusion: Determine Defective Argument Type
From the definitions provided:
- <RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition: a <R> is weak when it appears to be presented as the <R>, but says precisely the same as was said in the <P>.

This accurately describes the situation where the definition repeats the term being defined, without providing additional information or rationale.

Thus, the classification of the argument "Circular definition: a definition that is circular" is:
- <RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition

This completes the decomposition and classification process.
