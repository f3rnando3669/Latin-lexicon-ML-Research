To apply the concept of <IDAA> (application of <D> to <IDA>) to classify the given string as one of the defective argument types, we will decompose the task of classification into specific steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the components of the argument: Propositions and Reasons**
2. **Analyze the Proposition (P) and Reason (R):**
   - Determine what is being asserted (P).
   - Determine the reason or evidence being provided (R).
3. **Evaluate the argument against each defective argument type (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP):**
   - Check for Generalization (G).
   - Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE).
   - Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR).
   - Check for Weak Causal Basis (WCB).
   - Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR).
   - Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU).
   - Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

### Applying IDAA to the Argument:

**Given Argument:**
"My professor, who has a Ph.D. in Astronomy, once told me that ghosts are real. Therefore, ghosts are real."

#### Step 1: Identify the Components

- **Proposition (P):** "Ghosts are real."
- **Reason (R):** "My professor, who has a Ph.D. in Astronomy, once told me that ghosts are real."

#### Step 2: Analyze P and R

- **P:** The assertion that "ghosts are real."
- **R:** The reason given is the professor's statement, with the professor's authority and expertise in Astronomy being implied as supporting the truth of P.

#### Step 3: Evaluate Against Defective Argument Types

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - **Assess:** This argument isn't making a generalization based on a number of individuals.
   - **Conclusion:** Not G.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - **Assess:** This argument isn't claiming to enumerate possibilities.
   - **Conclusion:** Not FE.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - **Assess:** The reason does not logically or scientifically demonstrate the correctness of the proposition "ghosts are real." The expertise of a professor in Astronomy does not conclusively prove the existence of ghosts.
   - **Conclusion:** This matches IR because the reason given does not conclusively prove the proposition.
   
4. **Weak Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - **Assess:** The causal basis (the professor's expertise in a different field) is not compelling to establish the truth of the proposition.
   - **Conclusion:** This also matches WCB as the causal basis provided is insufficient.
   
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - **Assess:** The reason does not merely repeat the proposition.
   - **Conclusion:** Not RR.
   
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - **Assess:** The argument does not claim consensus.
   - **Conclusion:** Not FU.
   
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - **Assess:** There is no ambiguous language in the reason provided.
   - **Conclusion:** Not DEP.

### Final Classification:

The argument "My professor, who has a Ph.D. in Astronomy, once told me that ghosts are real. Therefore, ghosts are real." involves:

- **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**: The reason provided (the professor's statement) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **WCB (Weak Causal Basis)**: The causal basis (the professor's expertise in Astronomy) is not sufficiently compelling to establish the proposition.

Therefore, the defective argument can be classified primarily as **IR (Inconclusive Reason)** and **WCB (Weak Causal Basis)**.
