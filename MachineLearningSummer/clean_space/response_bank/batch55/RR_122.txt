For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task <IDA> into specific steps) to the statement, "John Green is a wonderful writer because he writes so well," let's break down the process step-by-step.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\<P\>)

- **Proposition (\<P\>):**
  - In this statement, the proposition is: "John Green is a wonderful writer."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\<R\>)

- **Reason (\<R\>):**
  - The reason provided is: "because he writes so well."

### Step 3: Classify the Defective Argument Type

Next, we need to analyze whether the reason (\<R\>) sufficiently supports the proposition (\<P\>), or if the argument falls into one of the defective argument types (\<G\>, \<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<RR\>, \<WCB\>, \<FU\>, \<DEP\>).

1. **Generalization (\<G\>):**
   - Not applicable here, as there is no broad assertion based on limited observation.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>):**
   - Not applicable here, as there is no mention of complete enumeration of possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>):**
   - The provided reason "he writes so well" does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition that "John Green is a wonderful writer," because "writing well" is subjective and can be argued from different perspectives. However, it may be closer to another category.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>):**
   - This seems to be a case where the reason (\<R\>) is essentially restating the proposition (\<P\>) in different words. Saying "he writes so well" is almost a restatement of "he is a wonderful writer," making this argument circular.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>):**
   - While the causal basis is weak, this particular defect is more about the causal link being weak rather than repetitive.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>):**
   - Not applicable here, as there is no presumptuous assumption of universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>):**
   - Not applicable here since there is no ambiguity in the terms used.

### Step 4: Conclusion

Based on our analysis, the defective argument type in this case is:

- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** The reason provided ("he writes so well") is essentially repeating the proposition ("John Green is a wonderful writer") in different terms without providing any additional supporting evidence.

Hence, the classification \( IDA("John Green is a wonderful writer because he writes so well.") \) yields:

```<RR>```
