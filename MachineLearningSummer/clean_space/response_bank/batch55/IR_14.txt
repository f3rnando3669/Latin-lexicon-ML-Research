To apply IDAA to the given string, we need to systematically break down the task of classifying the argument into recognizable defective types. Let's proceed step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Argument Components

Given the string:
"Andy states that a Scotsman would never put sugar on his porridge. Dougal replies that he is a Scotsman and he does put sugar on his porridge. Andy counters that no true Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge. Andy thus changes the terms of the argument, implying that Dougal is not a "true" Scotsman in order to support his own position."

1. **Proposition (P)**: Andy's initial assertion "a Scotsman would never put sugar on his porridge."
2. **Reason (R)**: Andy's reason is implied, supporting the idea that being a Scotsman entails not putting sugar on porridge.
3. **Proof of Reason (PR)**: Andy attempts to support his reasoning by redefining what it means to be a "true" Scotsman.

### Step 2: Determine the Type of Defective Argument

We need to evaluate Andy’s response to classify it among the defective argument types defined earlier:

1. Analyze Andy’s Counter:
   - Dougal provides a counter-example to Andy's claim by stating he is a Scotsman and he does put sugar on his porridge.
   - Andy shifts the argument by modifying the definition of a "true" Scotsman to exclude those who put sugar on porridge.

### Step 3: Match with Defective Argument Definitions

Now, we need to check which defect applies based on the definitions:
   
1. **Generalization (G)**: Andy’s argument was initially a generalization but not necessarily the final flaw we are observing.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable, as the argument does not enumerate possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided (implicit in the cultural purity idea) does shift, but the central issue is not about conclusive demonstration of P.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Andy's argument isn’t based on causal connections; it’s based on definitional shift.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Andy’s new definition effectively restates his initial proposition, but injected with an excluding criterion.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Not applicable, as there is no assumption of universal agreement.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Andy introduces a new ambiguity by redefining "true" Scotsman.

### Step 4: Assign the Defective Argument Type

Based on the evaluation, the key issue is that Andy is redefining the term "true Scotsman" to exclude contradictory evidence:
- This shifts the argument premise without resolving it in a logical manner.
  
The argument seems closest to **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**, with ambiguous language (redefining "true" Scotsman element being reminiscent of the **No True Scotsman fallacy**).

### Final Conclusion

The most appropriate classification for Andy's argument is **RR** (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), as Andy's reasoning says essentially the same thing as his original proposition by moving the goalposts on what defines a Scotsman without addressing Dougal’s counter-example concretely.

Thus, the defective argument type for the provided string is **RR**: Faulty Repetition of Proposition.
