For 
To apply **IDAA** to the conversation between Ken and Rob, we need to:
1. **Decompose** the task of classifying the argument(s) presented in the text into specific steps.
2. **Identify and Analyze** each assertion and reasoning presented by Ken and Rob using the defective argument types.

### Decomposition of Task (D)

1. **Identify statements by each speaker** to recognize each part of the argument.
2. **Categorize each statement** as <P>, <R>, or <PR> where possible.
3. **Evaluate each reasoning** to determine if it exhibits one of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

### Identification and Analysis (IDA)

1. **Ken: There has to be an objective morality because otherwise terms like “right” and “wrong” would be meaningless since they have no foundation for comparison.**
   - Proposition (P): There has to be an objective morality.
   - Reason (R): Terms like "right" and "wrong" would be meaningless without objective morality.
   - **Defective Argument**: This could be explored for <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) since the connection between objective morality and meaningful language may not conclusively demonstrate the claim.

2. **Rob: The terms “right” and “wrong” are based on cultural norms, which do have a subjective foundation -- one that changes as the moral sphere of the culture changes. The term “heavy” does not have an objective standard, yet we have no problem using that term in a meaningful way. In fact, very few relational terms have any kind of objective foundation.**
   - Proposition (P): Terms like “right” and “wrong” are based on cultural norms.
   - Reason (R): Cultural norms provide a subjective foundation; relational terms can be meaningful without objective standard.
   - **Defective Argument**: No apparent defective argument here as it reasons with analogy and explanation.

3. **Ken: But without an objective morality, we would all be lost morally as a race.**
   - Proposition (P): Without an objective morality, we would all be lost morally as a race.
   - Reason (R): It is implied but not explicitly given.
   - **Defective Argument**: This could be <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) or <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) where the reason for why we’d be lost is not sufficiently robust or compellingly explained.

4. **Rob: Many would say that we are.**
   - This is a response rather than a complete argument.
   - **Defective Argument**: Could be <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus) because it refers to what many would say, assuming agreement without proving it.

5. **Ken: But how can you say that torturing children for fun is morally acceptable in any situation?**
   - Proposition (P): Torturing children for fun is not morally acceptable in any situation.
   - Reason (R): Implied as a form of objective moral claim.
   - **Defective Argument**: This may not fall under any clear defect unless we consider the implied reason for it being acceptable given the context.

6. **Rob: Personally, I wouldn’t, but you are implying that anything that is not objective must necessarily be seen in all possible ways. A feather may not be seen as “heavy” to anyone, but that doesn’t mean its “lightness” is still not relative to other objects.**
   - Proposition (P): Not everything that is not objective must be viewed in all possible ways; relativity can exist.
   - Reason (R): Example of feather and relativity.
   - **Defective Argument**: No apparent defective argument; using analogy to support reasoning.

7. **Ken: But God is the standard of objective morality. Prove that wrong!**
   - Proposition (P): God is the standard of objective morality.
   - Reason (R): Implies divine authority.
   - **Defective Argument**: Could be <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus) assuming universal agreement on God being the standard without proving it, or <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) if the basis for God as the standard is not robustly established.

8. **Rob: That I cannot do.**
   - Acknowledgement rather than a complete argument.

### Summary

The classification of each segment of the dialogue:
- **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**: Ken's premise that objective morality must exist for "right" and "wrong" to be meaningful.
- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: Ken's assertions lacking robust reasons, like "Without objective morality, we would be lost morally."
- **FU (Presumptuous Consensus)**: Rob's appeal to "many would say" and Ken’s assumption about God being universally accepted as the standard.

By following this structured decomposition and analysis, we classify and examine the robustness and potential defects in the arguments presented.
