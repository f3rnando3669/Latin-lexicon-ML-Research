For 
Let's break down the task of applying the decomposition of the argument classification task (IDA) into specific steps (D). We'll go step by step to classify the string "news organizations are Fake News" into one of the defective argument types.

### Decomposition (D) Steps

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Examine the string to extract the main assertion or claim being made.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Determine if there is a causal basis or reasoning provided for the main assertion.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - Look for any evidence or additional arguments that support the reason given.

4. **Check for Defective Argument Types:**
   - Analyze whether the claim fits any of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Application of IDAA to "news organizations are Fake News"

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - The main assertion here is "news organizations are Fake News."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - There is no explicit causal reason provided in the string. The statement is made without justification or reasoning.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - There is no evidence or additional argument provided to support the reason (since the reason itself is not provided).

4. **Check for Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (G):** Could this be an assertion based on some part or majority of news organizations, but not necessarily all? Yes. The statement "news organizations are Fake News" could be a sweeping generalization based on a part and trying to apply it to the whole group of news organizations.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** There is no indication that the string is claiming a complete list of all possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Since no reason is provided, this would not apply.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** No causal basis is given, so this type does not apply.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This instance does not repeat the proposition as the reason, since it doesn't give a reason at all.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There is no claim of universal agreement here, so this type does not apply.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The phrase "Fake News" might have ambiguity, but the classification fits better under Generalization.

### Conclusion:
- The string "news organizations are Fake News" primarily fits the classification of **Generalization (G)**. It makes a broad assertion that may be based on a part of news organizations and applies it to all, without providing concrete evidence or reasoning.
