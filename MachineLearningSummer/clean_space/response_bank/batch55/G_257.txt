For 
To apply \(IDAA\) (Decomposition and application of the advanced task \(IDA\)) to the string "men don’t cry," we will proceed in a step-by-step manner to classify \(s\) as one of the defined defective argument types.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\(P\))
- **Proposition (\(P\)):** "men don’t cry"
  - This statement is a summary assertion that the speaker aims to establish as true or valid.

### Step 2: Examine Potential Defective Argument Types
  - We will now analyze the proposition "men don’t cry" under each type of defective argument: \(G\), \(FE\), \(IR\), \(RR\), \(WCB\), \(FU\), and \(DEP\).

1. **Generalization (\(G\)):** 
   - Does the proposition "men don’t cry" make an assertion based on a part or a majority but apply it to all?
   - **Analysis:** The statement applies the behavior of some men (or perhaps a stereotypical view) to all men.
   - **Conclusion:** This fits the description of a Generalization (\(G\)), as it asserts a behavior for all men based on a potentially limited observation of some men.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\(FE\)):**
   - Does the proposition claim completeness in possibilities but miss some?
   - **Analysis:** The statement does not list possibilities but makes a blanket assertion.
   - **Conclusion:** Inapplicable.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (\(IR\)):**
   - Does the reason provided fail to conclusively prove the proposition?
   - **Analysis:** There is no explicit reason provided in the statement.
   - **Conclusion:** Inapplicable.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(RR\)):**
   - Is the reason merely a repetition of the proposition?
   - **Analysis:** There is no reason provided to check for repetition.
   - **Conclusion:** Inapplicable.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(WCB\)):**
   - Is the reason weak and not compelling enough to establish the proposition?
   - **Analysis:** There is no reason provided.
   - **Conclusion:** Inapplicable.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\(FU\)):**
   - Is the proposition assumed true on the basis of supposed universal agreement?
   - **Analysis:** There is no mention of universal agreement in the statement.
   - **Conclusion:** Inapplicable.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\(DEP\)):**
   - Can the proposition be taken in a different sense than intended?
   - **Analysis:** The phrase "men don’t cry" is not inherently ambiguous in this context.
   - **Conclusion:** Inapplicable.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Based on our analysis under step 2, the best classification for the string \(s\) "men don’t cry" is as a **Generalization (\(G\))**, as it makes an all-encompassing assertion from a possibly limited observation, fitting the definition of \(G\) provided.

Thus, applying \(IDAA\) to "men don’t cry" results in:
\[ \(s\) = "men don’t cry" \rightarrow \text{Type: Generalization (\(G\))} \]
