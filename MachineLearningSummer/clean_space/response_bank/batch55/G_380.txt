For 
To apply the process of <IDAA> to the task of classifying the given string "Major in English in college, start reading poetry, and next thing you know, you will become an unemployed pot-smoking loser." into one of the defective argument types, we need to decompose the task into specific steps. Let's proceed step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- **Proposition (P)**: The assertion being made is: "If you major in English in college and start reading poetry, you will become an unemployed pot-smoking loser."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- **Reason (R)**: The causal basis given for the Proposition is implicit: Majoring in English and reading poetry will lead to unemployment and substance abuse.

### Step 3: Check Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- **Proof of Reason (PR)**: There is no additional argument or evidence provided to support the Reason. It's essentially a claim without further substantiation.

### Step 4: Examine the Argument for Defects
Next, we need to classify the argument into one of the defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: Does the argument make a broad assertion based on limited data?
   - Yes. It asserts that anyone who majors in English and reads poetry will end up as an unemployed pot-smoking loser. This is a faulty generalization.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Does the argument claim to have made a complete enumeration of possibilities but miss out on pertinent ones?
   - No. The argument does not enumerate all possibilities explicitly.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition?
   - It could be considered inconclusive since there's no evidence linking the majoring in English and reading poetry causally to becoming an unemployed pot-smoking loser.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Does the Reason merely restate the Proposition?
   - No. The Reason does not just repeat the Proposition.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Is the supposed causal basis weak or unconvincing?
   - Yes. The causal basis provided is weak and does not compellingly link majoring in English and reading poetry to the stated outcome.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Does the argument assume consensus where none exists?
   - No. There is no appeal to universal agreement presented.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Does the argument contain ambiguity in the language used?
   - No apparent ambiguity in the language is detected.

### Step 5: Determine the Most Appropriate Classification
Considering steps 4.1 to 4.7, the most appropriate classifications for the given argument are:

- **Generalization (G)**: The argument makes a broad and unfounded generalization about individuals who major in English and read poetry.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument also suffers from having an insufficient causal basis.

### Conclusion
Therefore, the argument "Major in English in college, start reading poetry, and next thing you know, you will become an unemployed pot-smoking loser." can be classified as both **Generalization (G)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
