To apply IDAA to the given string, we'll decompose the advanced task of classifying the string as a defective argument type into specific steps, and then execute those steps systematically. Let's follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Extract Proposition <P>:** Identify the primary assertion made in the argument.
2. **Extract Reason <R>:** Identify the causal basis or reasoning provided to support the proposition.
3. **Determine Proof of Reason <PR>:** Check if there's any additional evidence or argument provided to support the reason.
4. **Classify Based on Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Check for Generalization (G)**
   - **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
   - **Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
   - **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
   - **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
   - **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
   - **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**
5. **Assign Classification:** Based on the checks, classify the argument according to one of the defective argument types.

### Applying IDAA to the Given String:

**String:** "The economy continues to grow as the number of 'likes' on my Instagram account continue to increase. Clearly, the two are linked."

#### Step 1: Extract Proposition <P>
- Proposition (P): "The economy continues to grow as the number of 'likes' on my Instagram account continue to increase. Clearly, the two are linked."

#### Step 2: Extract Reason <R>
- Reason (R): "The number of 'likes' on my Instagram account continues to increase."

#### Step 3: Determine Proof of Reason <PR>
- Proof of Reason (PR): There is no additional evidence provided. The argument starts with the assumption that the increase in 'likes' and the economic growth are causally linked without further proof.

#### Step 4: Classify Based on Defective Argument Types

- **Generalization (G):** Nothing suggests that the argument generalizes from a sample to a whole population. It's more concerned with correlation and causation.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This isn't about possibilities being enumerated.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. The link between the number of 'likes' and economic growth is not established.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The argument assumes a correlation between Instagram 'likes' and economic growth without a compelling basis for this causation. This seems relevant.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason isn't just a repetition of the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There's no universal agreement being cited as evidence.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language isn't ambiguous, but rather the causality is incorrectly assumed.

#### Step 5: Assign Classification
- The most fitting classification here is **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**. The reason provided (increase in Instagram 'likes') is not a compelling basis to assert the proposition (economy growth linked to Instagram 'likes').

**Classification:** The argument is best classified as **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
