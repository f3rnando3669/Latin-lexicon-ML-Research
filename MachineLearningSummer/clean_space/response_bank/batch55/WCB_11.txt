For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of <IDA> into specific steps) to classify the given string as one of the defective argument types, we will follow a systematic approach:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) in the string:**
   - The proposition is the main statement or claim being made.
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>) in the string:**
   - The reason is the causal basis provided to support the proposition.
   
3. **Analyze the Proof of Reason (<PR>) if provided:**
   - Additional arguments or evidence to support the reason can be found here.
   
4. **Evaluate the argument against the defined defective argument types:**
   - Determine if the argument matches any of the defective argument classifications: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

Now, we'll apply these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
In the given string:
   
   "I. The Ganges river is flooded due to large sheets of ice coming down from the Himalayas."
   
   The proposition (<P>) is:
   - "The Ganges river is flooded."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
   
   The reason (<R>) provided for the proposition is:
   - "due to large sheets of ice coming down from the Himalayas."

### Step 3: Analyze the Proof of Reason (<PR>) if provided
   
   In the given string:
   
   "II. Many people in the Himalayan ranges lost their houses under huge sheets of ice."
   
   This is the proof of reason (<PR>):
   - "Many people in the Himalayan ranges lost their houses under huge sheets of ice."

### Step 4: Evaluate the Argument Against Defective Argument Types
   - **<G> Generalization:** The proposition does not appear to be a generalization based on a sample that doesn't represent the whole.
   - **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:** There's no enumeration of possibilities here, so this does not apply.
   - **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** Analyze if the reason conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the proposition. 
     - The reason does not conclusively demonstrate that the Ganges is flooded due to the ice since it states that people lost their houses, which is a different consequence and does not directly link to the Ganges' flooding.
   - **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** Check if the reason given (huge sheets of ice) is a compelling causal basis for the flooding.
     - The reason given might be weak in establishing a compelling basis for flooding directly.
   - **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** Check if the reason simply repeats the proposition.
     - The reason given is different from the proposition.
   - **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** Check for assumed consensus.
     - There is no mention of universal agreement.
   - **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:** Check for ambiguous language that can be interpreted differently.
     - The language is not ambiguous but rather specific.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the argument seems to have issues with **<IR> Inconclusive Reason** because the reason (<R>) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (<P>). The reason given that people in the Himalayas lost their houses does not directly establish that the flooding in the Ganges is caused by those large sheets of ice.

Therefore, the defective argument type for the given string is: **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**.
