For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the classification task IDA) to the string "Do you still beat your wife?", we need to follow a systematic approach to break down and analyze the argument type. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Identify the Parts of the Argument
First, identify if the string exhibits signs of a Proposition (P), Reason (R), or Proof of Reason (PR).

- **Proposition (P)**: What is being set forth to prove?
- **Reason (R)**: What is the causal basis being argued to support the proposition?
- **Proof of Reason (PR)**: What additional arguments or evidence are being used to strengthen the reason?

In the case of "Do you still beat your wife?":
- The **Proposition (P)** is implied rather than explicitly stated; it's assuming the fact that the subject has been beating his wife.
- There is no detailed **Reason (R)** or **Proof of Reason (PR)** provided as it is framed as a question rather than a full argument.

### Step 2: Analyze Potential Defects in the Argument

#### <G> Generalization:
- Is the statement assuming something general based on insufficient evidence?
  - Not applicable here because "Do you still beat your wife?" is not a generalization.

#### <FE> Incomplete Enumeration:
- Is the statement claiming completeness but missing some possibilities?
  - Not applicable here, since it doesn’t enumerate possibilities.

#### <IR> Inconclusive Reason:
- Is there a reason (R) provided that does not conclusively support the proposition?
  - Not directly applicable, as no explicit reason is provided.

#### <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:
- Is the causality for the proposition weak or uncompelling?
  - No reasoning presented to evaluate causal basis.

#### <RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:
- Is the reason simply a repetition of the proposition?
  - Not applicable here.

#### <FU> Presumptuous Consensus:
- Is there an unfounded assumption that a proof is universally agreed upon?
  - Not applicable directly, as it's not using "universally agreed upon" as support.

#### <DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:
- Can the argument be taken in another unintended sense?
  - This is a strong candidate. The string "Do you still beat your wife?" assumes that the subject has been beating his wife and even without a response, it implies guilt. It's a classic example of a loaded question, leading to confusion and an inherent presumption of guilt.

### Step 3: Determine the Classification
Based on the analysis:

The correct defective argument type for "Do you still beat your wife?" is:

- **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):** The question is crafted in a way that implies guilt regardless of the answer, making it a misleading and ambiguous way to frame the question. The presumption embedded in the question itself fits into the category of a defective argument based on ambiguous and leading language.

### Conclusion
Thus, according to the IDAA process, the string "Do you still beat your wife?" is classified as type **<DEP>** (Ambiguous Language Use).
