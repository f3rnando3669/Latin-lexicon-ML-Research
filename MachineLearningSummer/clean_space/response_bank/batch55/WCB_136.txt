For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of an advanced task into specific steps) to the task of classifying the given string (David and Pete's conversation about police presence) as one of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, or DEP), we first need to break down the process into understandable steps. Here's how we can proceed:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - Determine what assertion or statement is being proposed.

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - Determine the causal basis or reasoning being provided to support the Proposition (P).

3. **Check for Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   - Look for any additional arguments or evidence provided to support the Reason (R).

4. **Classify Defective Argument Type**:
   - Compare the identified components (P, R, PR) against the definitions of defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP) to classify the argument.

### Application to Given Conversation:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - **David's Proposition (P)**: "We have way too much police presence in this city."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - **David's Reason (R)**: This is not explicitly provided to support the Proposition (P). Instead, the response includes an implied dissatisfaction without clear reasoning.

3. **Check for Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   - **David's PR**: There isn’t a clear Proof of Reason presented in the statements.

4. **Classify Defective Argument Type**:
   - Since David does not provide a clear Reason (R) to support his Proposition (P) but instead suggests actions (“Vandalize, loot, and perhaps a little arson”), we need to examine the nature of the argument.

   Based on the steps:
   - **Generalization (G)**: This doesn’t apply as there isn’t a generalization based on a partial sample.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This doesn’t apply as there isn’t an incomplete list of possibilities presented.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This is a possible type since the reasoning (actions suggested) doesn’t conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (P).
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This also applies partially since the reasoning does not provide a sufficiently convincing causal basis.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This doesn’t apply as the reasoning isn’t a repetition of the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This doesn’t apply as there is no assumption of universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: This doesn’t apply since the language used isn’t ambiguous in a way that it could be taken in another sense.

### Conclusion:
David’s statement is classified as **IR** (Inconclusive Reason) with an element of **WCB** (Insufficient Causal Basis), because he does not provide a conclusive or sufficient reason to support his proposition of "having too much police presence" in the city.

So, the final classification for this conversation string would be predominantly **IR**.
