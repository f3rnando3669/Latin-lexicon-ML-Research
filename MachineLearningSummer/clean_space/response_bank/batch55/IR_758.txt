For 
To apply IDAA (application of decomposition of task to classifying a string as a defective argument), we need to follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D)

1. **Identify Proposition (P) and Reason (R):**
   - Determine what is being asserted (Proposition, P).
   - Identify the Reason (R) given for believing the Proposition.

2. **Analyze the Reason (R):**
   - Examine whether the Reason properly supports the Proposition.
   - Determine if the Reason falls short in any way.

3. **Classify the Defect:**
   - Use the definitions of defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP) to classify the specific type of defect in the argument.

### Application of IDAA to the Given String

Given String: 
"You can't prove that mermaids actually don't exist and therefore it's reasonable to say that they do" IS an example of this fallacy.

1. **Identify Proposition (P) and Reason (R):**
   - **Proposition (P):** "It's reasonable to say that mermaids do exist."
   - **Reason (R):** "You can't prove that mermaids actually don't exist."

2. **Analyze the Reason (R):**
   - The Reason provided is the inability to disprove the existence of mermaids.
   - The Reason does not provide direct evidence or support for the existence of mermaids but rather relies on the lack of disproof.

3. **Classify the Defect:**
   - **Generalization (G):** Not applicable here; no assertion based on parts or the majority.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable; we are not dealing with a defective enumeration.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Not applicable; the Reason provided is not about failing to conclusively demonstrate correctness directly.
   - **Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Not applicable here; the Reason and Proposition are not the same statement.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This does not perfectly fit since the Reason provided is not a weak causal basis but rather a lack of disproof.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** No consensus appeal is made here.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Not applicable; language ambiguity is not part of the argument here.

The reasoning falls under a well-known fallacy called **Argument from Ignorance (also known as Argumentum ad Ignorantiam)**, which asserts that a proposition is true because it has not yet been proven false.

Therefore, while the argument type from the given defections list doesn't fit neatly, the fallacious reasoning aligns with **the Argument from Ignorance** in which the Reason (R) is that no one has disproven the existence of mermaids, thereby falsely supporting the Proposition (P) that they do exist.

**Conclusion:**

"This string exemplifies the Argument from Ignorance fallacy."
