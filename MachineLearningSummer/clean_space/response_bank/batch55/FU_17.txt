For 
To apply the IDAA (the application of task decomposition to the task of classifying a defective argument) to the string "The majority of people believe advertisers should spend more money on billboards, so billboards are objectively the best form of advertisement," we first need to decompose the task of classifying this defective argument. Here are the steps for task decomposition (D):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine the main claim or assertion the argument intends to prove.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the causal basis or reasoning offered to support the proposition.
3. **Evaluate Potential Defects (<IDA>)**: Analyze the argument to classify the defective argument type by matching the identified defects with the definitions provided.

Now, let's apply these steps to the given string:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition in the string is the main claim that the argument intends to prove. In this case:

- **Proposition (<P>)**: "Billboards are objectively the best form of advertisement."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason is the justification or causal basis provided to support the proposition. In this case:

- **Reason (<R>)**: "The majority of people believe advertisers should spend more money on billboards."

### Step 3: Evaluate Potential Defects (<IDA>)
Now, we will analyze the argument to determine which type of defective argument (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>) it represents.

- **Generalization (G)**: The argument does not seem to generalize from one part or a majority to all without evidence, so it is not a case of Generalization.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not claim complete enumeration of possibilities, so it is not a case of Incomplete Enumeration.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided ("The majority of people believe advertisers should spend more money on billboards") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition ("billboards are objectively the best form of advertisement"). The majority opinion does not necessarily establish an objective fact.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis for the proposition is the majority opinion, which is not a compelling or strong enough reason to prove that billboards are the best form of advertisement.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason does not simply repeat the proposition using different words, so it is not a case of Faulty Repetition of Proposition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument does not assume consensus on a matter still in dispute, but relies on the majority opinion to establish the proposition.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: There does not appear to be ambiguity in the language used in the argument.

Considering the definitions and the reasoning provided above, the string exemplifies the defective argument type:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.

Thus, the classification of the string as a defective argument is:

**Type: <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**
