For 
To apply the process of IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying defective arguments) to the statement "Every time I go to sleep, the sun goes down. Therefore, my going to sleep causes the sun to set," we can break down the task into specific steps. Hereâ€™s how we can approach it:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition here is "My going to sleep causes the sun to set."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason provided is "Every time I go to sleep, the sun goes down."

### Step 3: Analyze the Reason (<R>)
We need to check if the reason is:
1. **Conclusive:** Does it conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
2. **Sufficient:** Is the causal basis sufficient and compelling for the proposition?
3. **Appropriately Different:** Is the reason simply a repetition of the proposition?

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
Using the definitions of defective argument types, we classify the given argument as follows:

1. **Generalization (G):** Not applicable here, as the argument is not generalizing a characteristic to all instances based on some or majority of instances.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable since it doesn't relate to enumerating possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The argument falls under this category because the reason "every time I go to sleep, the sun goes down" does not conclusively demonstrate that "my going to sleep causes the sun to set." Correlation does not imply causation.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This argument can also be classified under WCB because the causal basis provided (the concurrent occurrence of going to sleep and the sun setting) is not compelling enough to establish causation. 

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Not applicable since the reason and proposition are different in content, although interconnected.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Not applicable as no consensus or universal agreement is cited.

7. **Ambiguous Language Us (DEP):** The language used here is not ambiguous; it is clear in its meaning and intent.

### Step 5: Final Classification
Considering the analysis, the defective argument types that fit this statement are:
- Inconclusive Reason (IR)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)

### Conclusion
"Every time I go to sleep, the sun goes down. Therefore, my going to sleep causes the sun to set." is classified as both IR (Inconclusive Reason) and WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis). The causal reasoning provided is weak and does not conclusively prove the proposition.
