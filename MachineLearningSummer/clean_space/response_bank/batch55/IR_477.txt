For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the argument "Maria drives a car. She must be wealthy." we will follow the steps of decomposition and specific steps as outlined:

### Step 1: Decomposition of the Advanced Task (<t>, here <IDA>)

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Identify the main assertion or claim in the argument.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the causal basis or reason provided to support the proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Reason**:
   - Check if the reason conclusively supports the proposition.
   - Assess the strength and relevance of the causal basis.
4. **Identify any Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Look for any additional arguments or evidence supporting the reason.
5. **Classify the Argument as Defective or Non-Defective**: Determine if the argument fits into any of the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step 2: Applying <IDAA> to "Maria drives a car. She must be wealthy."

#### 2.1 Identify the Proposition (<P>):

- **Proposition (<P>)**: "She must be wealthy."

#### 2.2 Identify the Reason (<R>):

- **Reason (<R>)**: "Maria drives a car."

#### 2.3 Evaluate the Reason:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason "Maria drives a car" does not conclusively demonstrate that "She must be wealthy". There are many people who drive cars but are not necessarily wealthy. The reason provided is not sufficient to determine the correctness of the proposition.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis (driving a car) submitted for the proposition (she must be wealthy) is not a compelling one. Driving a car does not necessarily imply wealth, as there are many economic variables and levels of car affordability.

We analyze if there might be any other applicable defects:
- It is not a **Generalization (<G>)**, as it does not claim an assertion about all or a majority based on only one part.
- It is not an **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**, as it does not claim to cover all possibilities.
- It is not a **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**, as the reason and proposition differ.
- It is not a **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**, as it does not assume consensus.
- It does not involve **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)** as the terms are clear.

### Step 3: Classify the Argument

Based on the evaluation, the argument "Maria drives a car. She must be wealthy." fits the types:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**

### Conclusion of <IDAA> Application

The argument "Maria drives a car. She must be wealthy." is classified under the defective argument types:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**

This concludes the step-by-step decomposition and analysis of the defective argument, resulting in its classification.
