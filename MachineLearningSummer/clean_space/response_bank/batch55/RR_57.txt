For 
To apply IDAA to the task of classifying the argument "The Bible is the Word of God because God tells us it is... in the Bible," we will decompose the task (IDA) into specific steps (D).

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Classification:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Proposition: "The Bible is the Word of God."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Reason: "God tells us it is... in the Bible."

3. **Formulate the Argument Structure**:
   - Proposition: "The Bible is the Word of God."
   - Reason: "God tells us it is... in the Bible."

4. **Evaluate the Reason (<R>) Against Each Defective Argument Type**:
   - **Generalization (<G>):** Does the argument generalize from a part to a whole improperly?
     - No, this does not seem to involve generalizing a specific or partial observation to the entire Bible.
  
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Does the argument fail by not considering other possibilities?
     - No, it does not appear to involve an enumeration of possibilities.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
     - Potentially, but we need further clarification on why the reason might be inconclusive.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the causal basis for the reason weak or not compelling?
     - Yes, the reason "God tells us it is... in the Bible" seems weak because it relies on a circular logic. The assertion that the Bible is the Word of God because it says so in the Bible is not a compelling causal basis.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Does the reason say the same thing as the proposition?
     - Yes, the reason merely repeats the proposition in different words. The statement "The Bible is the Word of God because God tells us it is... in the Bible" is a circular argument, where the reason is effectively the same as the proposition: both center on the Bible declaring itself to be the Word of God.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Is the reason assumed to be certain because it is supposedly universally agreed upon while still in dispute?
     - No, the argument does not rely on presumed universal consensus for its validity.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Can the reason be taken in another sense than the speaker intended?
     - No, there appears to be no ambiguity in the language used.

5. **Classify the Argument**:
   - Upon evaluating the reason against the defective argument types, it matches the criteria for both **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. However, the most apparent issue is the circularity where the proposition is merely repeated within the reason.

6. **Final Classification**:
   - The argument "The Bible is the Word of God because God tells us it is... in the Bible" is best classified as **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**.

By systematically breaking down the argument and analyzing it against the list of defective argument types, we classify it as <RR>.
