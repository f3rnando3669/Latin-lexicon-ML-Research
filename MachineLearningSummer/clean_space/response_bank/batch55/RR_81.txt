For 
To apply \(<IDAA>\) to the statement "You must obey the law, because it's illegal to break the law," we will decompose the task of identifying the defective argument into specific steps and then classify the argument according to the given definitions. Here’s how we can proceed:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDA (Identification of Defective Argument):

1. **Identify the Proposition (\(P\))**:
   - The \(P\) in the statement is: "You must obey the law."

2. **Identify the Reason (\(R\))**:
   - The \(R\) given for \(P\) is: "because it's illegal to break the law."

3. **Determine the type of defective argument**:
   - Compare \(R\) with \(P\) to see if \(R\) actually supports \(P\) or if it falls into one of the defective argument types specified.

#### Analysis:

- The statement seems to be circular in nature because the reason for the proposition basically restates the proposition itself. Here’s the comparison:

   - **Proposition (P)**: "You must obey the law."
   - **Reason (R)**: "because it's illegal to break the law."

   - The \(R\) is that it's illegal to break the law, which is essentially saying the same thing as \(P\)—that you must follow the law because it's the law. This doesn't add any new information as a justification but merely restates the initial claim in a different form.

Given this analysis, the argument falls under the type:

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(RR\))**: where \(R\) is weak when it appears to be presented as the reason, but says precisely the same as was said in the \(P\).

### Conclusion:

The logical fallacy used in the statement "You must obey the law, because it's illegal to break the law" is classified as \(<RR>\) (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
