To apply the decomposition of the task of classifying the defective argument (<IDA>) to the given string, we will break down the advanced task into specific steps (<IDAA>).

### Step 1: Analyze the Proposition `<P>`
- **Identify `<P>`**: The proposition is "Robert Downey Jr. thinks everyone should vote."

### Step 2: Analyze the Reason `<R>`
- **Identify `<R>`**: The reason given is "Robert Downey Jr. once went to prison for drug use."

### Step 3: Analyze the Proof of Reason `<PR>`
- **Identify `<PR>`**: The proof of reason is implied as "So, he's obviously wrong."

### Step 4: Evaluate the Argument
- **Assess `<R>` and its relation to `<P>`**:
  - The reason ("Robert Downey Jr. once went to prison for drug use") does not logically connect to the proposition ("Robert Downey Jr. thinks everyone should vote"). The fact that someone went to prison for drug use doesn't inherently invalidate their opinion on civic duties like voting.

### Step 5: Classify the Defective Argument Type
1. **Generalization `<G>`**: The argument is not asserting a generalization based on a part to the whole.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration `<FE>`**: There's no enumeration or list in this argument.
3. **Inconclusive Reason `<IR>`**: The reason does not conclusively affect the proposition. The past behavior of Robert Downey Jr. is irrelevant to the validity of his opinion on voting.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis `<WCB>`**: While there is an insufficient causal basis, the type of insufficiency is specific in this argument.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition `<RR>`**: The reason doesn't just repeat the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus `<FU>`**: There's no mention of universal agreement or consensus here.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use `<DEP>`**: There is no ambiguity in language use in this argument.

### Step 6: Determine the Defective Argument Type
Based on the analysis, the reason (`<R>`) given does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness or incorrectness of the proposition (`<P>`). This falls under the type **Inconclusive Reason (`<IR>`)**.

### Conclusion
The given string “Robert Downey Jr. thinks everyone should vote. However, Robert Downey Jr. once went to prison for drug use. So, he's obviously wrong.” is classified as a defective argument of type **Inconclusive Reason (`<IR>`)**.
