For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying the argument into specific steps) to the string "Thousands of pets are left homeless and hungry because lousy people turn them out on the streets instead of taking care of them.", we will proceed step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
**Proposition (P):** "Thousands of pets are left homeless and hungry."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
**Reason (R):** "because lousy people turn them out on the streets instead of taking care of them."

### Step 3: Identify the Potential Classification Categories
We need to classify this argument into one of the defective argument types:
- Generalization (G)
- Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
- Inconclusive Reason (IR)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
- Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
- Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)

### Step 4: Analyze the Argument for Each Category

#### Generalization (G)
We have an assertion that "Thousands of pets are left homeless and hungry." This is based on the observation of some pets and how they are treated by people described as "lousy." The argument implicitly generalizes that all or most pets are left homeless and hungry due to such treatment.

#### Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
There is no claim of a complete enumeration of all possible reasons for pets being homeless and hungry. So, this defective argument type does not seem applicable.

#### Inconclusive Reason (IR)
We need to determine whether the reason provided ("because lousy people turn them out on the streets instead of taking care of them") conclusively connects to the proposition. If there are other significant reasons pets might be homeless and hungry that are not addressed, the reasoning might be considered inconclusive.

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
The reason given ("because lousy people turn them out on the streets instead of taking care of them") might be insufficient as it does not account for all factors that could lead to pets being homeless (e.g., economic hardship, natural disasters).

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
The reason provided is not just a repetition of the proposition.

#### Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
The argument does not rely on a universally agreed-upon statement for its proof.

#### Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)
There is no ambiguity discernible in the language used in the proposition and reason provided.

### Step 5: Determine the Most Applicable Defective Argument Type

Based on the analysis, the argument primarily falls into the category of **Generalization (G)**:

**Reason:** The argument generalizes the behavior of "lousy people" causing homelessness and hunger of pets to be the sole or primary reason affecting "thousands of pets," without sufficient evidence that this is universally applicable.

### Final Classification
After decomposing our task (<D>) and applying it to the given string (<IDA>), we conclude that the argument "Thousands of pets are left homeless and hungry because lousy people turn them out on the streets instead of taking care of them." is best classified as a **Generalization (G)**.
