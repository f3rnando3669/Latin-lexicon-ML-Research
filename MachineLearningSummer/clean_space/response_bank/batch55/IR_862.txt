For 
To apply the advanced task of <IDAA> to classify the given string "Holly said that vaccinations caused autism in children, but her scientifically well-read friend Caleb said that this claim had been debunked and proven false. Their friend Alice offered a compromise that vaccinations must cause some autism, just not all autism." into one of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>), we proceed with the following steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Propositions and Reasons in the String

- **Proposition (P1)**: "Vaccinations caused autism in children." (Holly’s claim).
- **Reason (R1)**: Holly does not provide a reason in the given text.
  
- **Proposition (P2)**: "Vaccinations causing autism has been debunked and proven false." (Caleb's rebuttal).
- **Reason (R2)**: Caleb implies scientific consensus.

- **Proposition (P3)**: "Vaccinations must cause some autism, just not all autism." (Alice’s compromise).
- **Reason (R3)**: Alice suggests a middle ground but provides no causal basis.

### Step 2: Analyze Each Argument for Defectiveness

**Holly’s Argument**:
- Lacks a Reason and Proof of Reason, making it challenging to classify directly under the given defect types.

**Caleb’s Argument**:
- The claim rests on appeal to scientific debunking. We don't have more context to critique the actual reasons or proof.

**Alice’s Argument**:
- Lacks definitive evidence and relies on the presumption of moderation.

### Step 3: Match Each Part to Defective Argument Types

**Alice's Argument (P3 with R3)**:
1. **Generalization (G)**: Alice suggests a middle ground without substantiating evidence, assuming some autism is caused despite Caleb’s claim of falseness. It partially generalizes—suggesting that not all but some autism must be caused by vaccinations based on no new evidence.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This does not claim complete enumeration explicitly.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Alice’s reason provides no definitive proof or strong causal basis since it assumes a compromise without evidence.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Alice fails to give a compelling causal link—it primarily asserts an unvalidated middle ground.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: There is no repetition of the proposition in Alice's reasoning.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Alice vaguely presumes a controversial compromise without proof.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: There’s no evident ambiguous language leading to misinterpretation.

### Step 4: Final Classification

Based on the analysis:
- Alice’s argument (“vaccinations must cause some autism, just not all autism”) appears to fall primarily under **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** and **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**. It provides a "compromise" view that does not conclusively validate her stance by any strong causal reasoning or evidence.
  
Selected Classification: **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**.

This outcome best fits the provided description as it highlights the weakest points in Alice's argument, as she does not conclusively establish the correctness of the proposition and fails to substantiate her moderated claim with compelling evidence.
