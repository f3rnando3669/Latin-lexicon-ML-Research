For 
To apply the advanced task <IDAA> to the given string "There are no good restaurants in New York; I tried two in Times Square, and they were awful," we need to decompose the task of classifying the defective argument into specific steps and then follow those steps one by one. 

Here's the decomposition (<D>) of the task of identifying defective arguments (<IDA>):

1. **Identify the <P> (Proposition):** Determine the main assertion or claim in the argument.
2. **Identify the <R> (Reason):** Identify the causal basis or justification provided for the <P>.
3. **Determine the type of defective argument:** Using the definitions provided, classify the argument as one of the defective types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) based on the characteristics identified.

### Step-by-Step Application:

1. **Identify the <P>**
   - Proposition: The main assertion in the argument is "There are no good restaurants in New York."

2. **Identify the <R>**
   - Reason: The justification given for the proposition is "I tried two in Times Square, and they were awful."

3. **Determine the type of defective argument**
   - Evaluate the reason provided: The reason "I tried two in Times Square, and they were awful" is based on a very small sample size (only two restaurants in a specific area of a large city) and generalizes this limited negative experience to the entire city.
   - Given the small sample size and the broad conclusion, this argument seems to exhibit the characteristic of generalizing from insufficient evidence.

Based on the characteristics identified, we can classify the argument as follows:

- **<G> (Generalization):** The argument generalizes the poor quality of two restaurants in one specific area to the entire city of New York, which is not necessarily representative of all restaurants in the city.

Therefore, after applying the decomposition of the task to the given string, we classify it as type <G> (Generalization).
