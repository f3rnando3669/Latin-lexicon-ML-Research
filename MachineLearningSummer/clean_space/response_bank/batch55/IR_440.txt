To apply the method of decomposition and classification to the task of identifying the type of defective argument in the given string, "Dismissing someone's viewpoint on an issue because he himself is inconsistent in that very thing," we will break down IDAA into specific steps. By working through each step, we'll determine which defective argument category, if any, applies to the given string.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of IDA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine the main statement or assertion being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Determine the rationale provided for the main statement.
3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (PR)**: If applicable, determine any supporting evidence or further arguments provided to back up the Reason.
4. **Classify the Type of Defective Argument (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP)**: Based on the identified Proposition, Reason, and Proof of Reason, classify the argument as one of the defective types.

Let's apply this step-by-step decomposition to the given string.

---

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)

The main statement or assertion being made is:
- "Dismissing someone's viewpoint on an issue."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)

The rationale provided for dismissing the viewpoint is:
- "Because he himself is inconsistent in that very thing."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Proof of Reason (PR)

There does not appear to be any further supporting evidence or arguments provided in the given string. The Reason stands on its own without additional corroboration.

### Step 4: Classify the Type of Defective Argument (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP)

We need to determine which category of defective argument this falls into:

- **Generalization (G)**: This is not making an over-generalized claim based on a sample.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This argument does not present an incomplete list of possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided does not address the correctness of the viewpoint, it instead focuses on the consistency of the person holding the viewpoint.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This might apply if the reason given (inconsistency) does not have a compelling causal connection to the validity of the viewpoint.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The Reason is not a mere repetition of the Proposition; it introduces a different point (the person's inconsistency).
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There is no appeal to universal agreement or consensus here.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: There is no ambiguity in the language concerning the reason provided.

The most fitting classification for this argument, with the steps taken into account, appears to be **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. The rationale given for dismissing the viewpoint (the person's inconsistency) does not conclusively demonstrate whether the viewpoint itself is valid or invalidâ€”it merely attacks the person rather than the argument.

### Conclusion

Applying IDAA, the given string "Dismissing someone's viewpoint on an issue because he himself is inconsistent in that very thing," classifies as an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
