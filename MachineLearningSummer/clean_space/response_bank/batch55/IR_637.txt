For 
To apply the decomposition <D> to the task <IDA> (identifying the type of defective argument in the given string), we need to break down the process into specific steps. Here is a step-by-step approach:

1. **Understand the Proposition (P):**
   - Identify what is being claimed or what proposition (P) is being set forth.
   
2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Determine if the reason (R) given is supposed to support the proposition (P).

3. **Check for Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - Verify if there is a proof or some further argument that supports the reason (R).

4. **Identify any possible defective arguments:**
   - Compare the construction of the argument to the types of defective arguments defined (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) to see if it matches any of them.

Now, let's decompose the task <IDA> for the given string, "Do you think that we should convict this criminal?"

### Step 1: Understand the Proposition (P)
- The question implies a proposition (P) which is "we should convict this criminal."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
- The given string does not provide an explicit reason (R) to support the proposition (P). It is simply a question asking for an opinion or judgment.

### Step 3: Check for Proof of Reason (PR)
- Since there is no explicit reason presented, there is also no proof of reason (PR).

### Step 4: Identify possible defective arguments
- To identify any defective argument types from the defined list (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>), we would examine if the structure or lack of structure fits any of these categories:

  1. **Generalization (G):**
     - Is the proposition based on a generalization? There is no explicit generalization in the question, so this does not apply.

  2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
     - Is the proposition presenting itself as a complete enumeration but missing possibilities? The question does not do this either.

  3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
     - Is there a reason presented that does not conclusively support the proposition? There is no reason presented at all.

  4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
     - Is the reason simply a repetition of the proposition? Since there is no reason presented, this does not apply.

  5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
     - Is the reason weak or not compelling enough? There is no reason to evaluate, so this does not apply.

  6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
     - Is there an assumption that something is universally agreed upon? Since there's no argument or reason presented, this does not apply.

  7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
     - Is there ambiguity in the language that could lead to multiple interpretations? The question itself is straightforward and does not have ambiguous language.

### Conclusion
The string "Do you think that we should convict this criminal?" does not present a complete argument with a proposition, reason, or proof of reason. It does not match any of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) because it is merely a question without an underlying argument. Therefore, it cannot be classified under any of the defined defective argument types.
