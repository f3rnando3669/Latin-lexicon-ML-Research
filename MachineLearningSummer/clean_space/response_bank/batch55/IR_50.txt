For 
To apply IDAA to "I have no intention of stopping the use of somatostatin on patients suffering from acute pancreatitis. I consider it to be a very reasonable choice. After all, it has been standard practice in our department for many years and we’ve been quite satisfied with the results we’ve had," we need to decompose the task of classifying a defective argument (IDA) into specific steps (D). 

Let's start with the definition of IDA: classifying the string as type <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>. Here is the step-by-step process (D) to achieve IDAA:

### Step-by-Step Process (D) for IDAA

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Extract the main claim or assertion that needs to be established or proved.
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Extract the causal basis or reason provided to support the Proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Extract any corroborating arguments or evidence meant to strengthen the Reason.

4. **Compare with Defective Arguments:**
   - Compare the structure of the argument against the types of defective arguments (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).
   
5. **Classify the Argument's Defect:**
   - Based on the comparison, classify the argument under one of the defective types.

### Application of Process (D) to the Given String

**Given String:**
"I have no intention of stopping the use of somatostatin on patients suffering from acute pancreatitis. I consider it to be a very reasonable choice. After all, it has been standard practice in our department for many years and we’ve been quite satisfied with the results we’ve had."

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)

- **Proposition (<P>):** "I have no intention of stopping the use of somatostatin on patients suffering from acute pancreatitis."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)

- **Reason (<R>):** "I consider it to be a very reasonable choice."
  (Actually, this statement doesn't provide a substantial reason, but we'll evaluate it further in context.)

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)

- **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** "After all, it has been standard practice in our department for many years and we’ve been quite satisfied with the results we’ve had."

#### Step 4: Compare with Defective Arguments

- **Generalization (<G>):** It doesn't broadly apply characteristics of a part to the whole.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Doesn't claim complete enumeration of all scenarios for its conclusion.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason given ("consider it reasonable") doesn't conclusively prove the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Relies on longevity and satisfaction without direct causal proof.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The Reason essentially repeats the Proposition, just stating it's considered reasonable.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** No mention of universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Doesn't seem ambiguous in language.

#### Step 5: Classify the Argument's Defect

The most fitting defective argument appears to be:

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The Reason given ("I consider it to be a very reasonable choice") is not substantially different from the Proposition ("I have no intention of stopping the use of somatostatin"). 

**Conclusion:**

The string "I have no intention of stopping the use of somatostatin on patients suffering from acute pancreatitis. I consider it to be a very reasonable choice. After all, it has been standard practice in our department for many years and we’ve been quite satisfied with the results we’ve had." contains a defective argument type <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition). The reason provided does not effectively support the proposition, as it essentially repeats the same assertion without adding a substantial causal basis.
