For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given argument, we will decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
- **Proposition (<P>)**: "Free trade will be good for this country."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
- **Reason (<R>)**: "The reason is patently clear."

### Step 3: Examine the Proof of Reason <PR>
- **Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: "Isn't it obvious that unrestricted commercial relations will bestow on all sections of this nation the benefits which result when there is an unimpeded flow of goods between countries?"

### Step 4: Check for Defective Argument Types
Now, we will evaluate the argument against each of the defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)** - This doesn't seem like a Generalization because it doesn't claim to be based on a sample of some parts or individuals and then applied to all.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** - The argument does not make an enumeration of possibilities, complete or incomplete.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** - The reason provided ("The reason is patently clear.") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. The reason is vague and does not provide evidence or a convincing rationale.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** - The causal basis submitted by the reason is weak since it merely asserts that the reason is "patently clear" without actually providing a compelling reason.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)** - The reason does not merely repeat the proposition but fails to provide a substantial reason.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)** - The proof of reason relies on the question "Isn't it obvious," which suggests a consensus that may not actually exist because what is being questioned is still in dispute.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)** - The proof of reason could possibly be taken in another sense; terms like "obvious" and "benefits" are subject to interpretation but this is less clear than the other issues.

### Step 5: Classify the Defective Argument
Based on the analysis, the argument is mainly affected by:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Because the reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Because the reason given is weak ("The reason is patently clear"), it does not provide a compelling basis for the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Because the proof of reason relies on assumed consensus which is still in dispute.

### Conclusion
Classify the argument as primarily <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis), and <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).

Thus, the argument "Free trade will be good for this country. The reason is patently clear. Isn't it obvious that unrestricted commercial relations will bestow on all sections of this nation the benefits which result when there is an unimpeded flow of goods between countries?" is defective due to <IR>, <WCB>, and <FU>.
