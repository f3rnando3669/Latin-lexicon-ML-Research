For 
To apply IDAA to the argument, we need to decompose the task of classifying the defective argument string into specific steps. Here’s how we can do it step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)

First, identify the main claim or proposition made in the argument. In this case:

- Billy’s Proposition (<P>): "Spanish is easy."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)

Next, identify the causal basis or reasoning provided to support the proposition. In this case:

- Bobby’s Reason (<R>): "Don't listen to Billy; he failed Spanish class last year."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Reasoning against the Defective Argument Types

Evaluate the reason provided against the definitions of defective argument types:

- **Generalization (<G>):** Proposition based on a part or a majority, applied to all.
  - The focus here isn't about generalizing from a part to a whole.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Proposition claims complete enumeration but misses some possibilities.
  - Not applicable since this reasoning does not involve enumeration.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
  - Bobby’s argument relates to discrediting Billy rather than conclusively disproving "Spanish is easy."

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Reason has a weak causal basis.
  - Bobby’s reasoning could be seen as insufficient because failing a class doesn't inherently make the subject not easy.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Reason is the same as the proposition (restatement).
  - Not applicable since Bobby’s statement is not a repetition of Billy’s proposition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Assumed certain because of universal agreement which is in dispute.
  - Not applicable; no universal consensus is being claimed.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Argument taken in another sense than intended.
  - No significant ambiguous language used in this context.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument

Based on the evaluations above, Bobby's attack on Billy uses the strategy of discrediting Billy's personal experience rather than providing a logical rebuttal. This means it demonstrates an **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:

Bobby’s reason does not conclusively demonstrate that Spanish is not easy. Instead, Bobby's statement that Billy failed Spanish class last year is irrelevant to whether Spanish is easy for others in general.

### Conclusion

The argument "Billy - 'Spanish is easy.' Bobby - 'Don't listen to Billy; he failed Spanish class last year.' " can be classified under the defective argument type **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, as Bobby's reasoning does not conclusively disprove Billy's proposition.
