For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of IDA into specific steps) to classify the string "the claim, as evidence for an idea, that many people believe it, or used to believe it or do it" as one of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP), we will break down the task systematically:

### Step 1: Understand the given string

The string mentions "the claim, as evidence for an idea, that many people believe it, or used to believe it or do it." 

### Step 2: Identify and define the components of the string

- **Claim:** A proposition or assertion made.
- **Evidence for an idea:** The reason offered to support the claim.
- **Many people believe it, or used to believe it or do it:** An appeal to the belief or actions of many people.

### Step 3: Determine if the string matches any defective argument type

Given:
- <G> Generalization: Assertion based on a limited number of cases applied to all.
- <FE> Incomplete Enumeration: Incomplete listed possibilities.
- <IR> Inconclusive Reason: Reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
- <RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition: Reason repeats the proposition.
- <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis: Weak causal basis.
- <FU> Presumptuous Consensus: Assumed certainty based on supposed universal agreement.
- <DEP> Ambiguous Language Use: Reason can be misinterpreted.

### Step 4: Match the string to the most fitting defective argument type

In this string:
- The claim is supported by the fact that many people believe or used to believe it, implying its validity based on common belief.
- This does not fall under <G> as no specific part or majority is generalized to all.
- It does not fit <FE> as it's not about missing possibilities.
- It's not <IR> since the reason provided (many people's belief) is being used directly.
- It's not <RR> because the reason isn’t a repetition of the proposition.
- It's not <WCB> as it's about many people's belief rather than an insufficient causal basis.
- It’s not ambiguous, ruling out <DEP>.

Thus, the most fitting defective argument type is:

### Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)

The argument assumes certainty based on the claim that many people believe or used to believe it, which can be seen as arguing "it is universally agreed upon" although the idea is still in dispute.

### Conclusion

The string "the claim, as evidence for an idea, that many people believe it, or used to believe it or do it" is best classified under Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>).
