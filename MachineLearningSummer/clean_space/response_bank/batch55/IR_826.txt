To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the advanced task IDA, the task of classifying a string as a specific type of defective argument) to the given exchange, we need to break down the task step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Exchange
Analyze the conversation to comprehend its context and key elements:

**Jon:** "Go easy on the scotch; you've had three shots already now."  
**Jeff:** "Oh sure, I'll put down my scotch when you put down that tequila. Lay off, man."

### Step 2: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition here refers to what each speaker is trying to convey or argue.

- **Jon's Proposition (P1):** "Go easy on the scotch; you've had three shots already now."

### Step 3: Identify Possible Reasons (<R>)
Consider if they provide reasoning for their propositions.

- **Jon's Reason (R1):** The implied reason for asking Jeff to go easy on the scotch is that Jeff has already had three shots (implicit context: drinking too much is harmful).

### Step 4: Examine the Response
Jeff's response can give clues about the nature of the argument:

- **Jeff's Counter Argument (P2):** "Oh sure, I'll put down my scotch when you put down that tequila. Lay off, man."

### Step 5: Analyze for Defective Argument Types
Now we apply the defective argument types to see if any fit the conversation:

- **Generalization (G):** The argument does not appear to make broad generalizations.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Does not mention exhaustive possibilities incorrectly.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Look at Jon's reason. Jon’s reasoning can be seen as valid; the issue lies more with Jeff's counterargument and its form.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Jon’s reason seems sufficient with the implied context, but Jeff's counterargument does not address Jon’s original concern directly.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Jon and Jeff’s arguments do not repeat the same proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** No universal agreement is used as an argument.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** No ambiguity in the language. Both are clear in their statements.

### Step 6: Determine the Specific Defective Argument
Focus on Jeff's response:

- Jeff's response is **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** since he does not confront Jon’s reason for why three shots are problematic. Instead, he deflects by referencing Jon’s tequila consumption, leading to an irrelevant comparison.

### Conclusion
The string exhibits the defective argument type **INCONCLUSIVE REASON (IR)**.

**Summary:**
By decomposing IDA into steps (IDAA), we determined that Jeff's response to Jon's concerned proposition about his drinking does not directly deal with the reason given and instead shifts the topic. Thus, it falls under the category of an Inconclusive Reason (IR).
