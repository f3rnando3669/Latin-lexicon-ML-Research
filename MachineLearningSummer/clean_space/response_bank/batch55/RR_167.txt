For 
To apply IDAA (the application of the task decomposition to the classification task of IDA), let's break down the advanced task of identifying the specific type of defective argument into a series of steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D)
1. **Identify the Proposition (P) in the statement.**
2. **Identify the Reason (R) provided for the Proposition.**
3. **Analyze whether the Reason (R) suitably supports or demonstrates the Proposition (P).**
4. **Check for specific signs of defective arguments (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP).**
5. **Classify the string (s) based on the identified defects in the argument.**

### Applying IDAA to "Tik Tok is popular among teens because so many of them use it."

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
- **Proposition (P)**: "Tik Tok is popular among teens."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
- **Reason (R)**: "because so many of them use it."

#### Step 3: Analyze whether the Reason (R) supports the Proposition (P)
- The Reason provided highlights usage as evidence of popularity. The Argument implies that the high usage of Tik Tok among teens itself proves its popularity.

#### Step 4: Check for Specific Signs of Defective Arguments
Let's evaluate the Reason (R) against potential defects:
   - **G (Generalization)**: The statement does not attempt to generalize a small sample to a larger population.
   - **FE (Incomplete Enumeration)**: The statement doesn’t enumerate possibilities; it's a single causal claim.
   - **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**: The Reason given (high usage) is the same as the claim of popularity, so it doesn't provide additional evidence but states the same point in different words.
   - **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The Reason given seems circular because it doesn’t establish an independent basis.
   - **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: This seems to be a prime candidate since the Reason (many using it) is somewhat repeating the Proposition (popular among teens) without providing new evidence.
   - **FU (Presumptuous Consensus)**: The statement doesn’t rely on universally agreed upon beliefs.
   - **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use)**: The wording in the Reason doesn’t seem ambiguous or have multiple interpretations.

#### Step 5: Classify the string based on the identified defects in the argument
- Based on the analysis, the statement fits best under **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)** because the Reason provided (high usage) merely reiterates the Proposition itself (popularity) without truly establishing an independent, corroborative basis for the claim.

### Conclusion
The argument "Tik Tok is popular among teens because so many of them use it." falls under the defective argument type **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**.
