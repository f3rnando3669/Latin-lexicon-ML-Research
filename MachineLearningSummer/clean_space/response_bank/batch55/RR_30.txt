For 
Certainly! Let's take the task of classifying the string "smoking cigarettes is deadly because cigarettes can kill you" as one of the defective argument types and break it down step by step. This involves decomposing the task into specific steps and then applying those steps to identify any defects in the argument. 

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**
3. **Analyze the structure of the argument for defects**
4. **Classify the argument as one of the defect types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>)**

### Application of <D> to "<s>" ("smoking cigarettes is deadly because cigarettes can kill you"):
  
#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- **<P>: "smoking cigarettes is deadly"**

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- **<R>: "because cigarettes can kill you"**

#### Step 3: Analyze the structure of the argument for defects
- We need to determine if the reason (R) provides proper support for the proposition (P) or if it falls into any of the defective categories.

#### Step 4: Classify the argument as one of the defect types

   Let's compare the structure to each defective argument type:
   
   - **<G> Generalization**: This isn't a generalization of the argument based on limited instances.
   
   - **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: This argument does not list any possibilities, so incomplete enumeration isn’t applicable.
   
   - **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: This could be relevant if the reason given does not adequately support the proposition.
   
   - **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: This may fit if the reason provided is essentially restating the proposition without new supporting detail.
   
   - **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: This may apply if the given reason is not a compelling causal basis for the proposition.
   
   - **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: This isn't claiming consensus as the reason for belief.
   
   - **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: This argument doesn’t use ambiguous language that can be interpreted in different ways.

The main issue with the argument is that the proposition and the reason provided are saying essentially the same thing without adding new information. The reason "because cigarettes can kill you" does not provide additional support beyond restating that cigarettes are deadly. This indicates a case of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**.

### Final Classification:
- **Type <RR>**: "smoking cigarettes is deadly because cigarettes can kill you" repeats the proposition without providing new causally supportive evidence.
