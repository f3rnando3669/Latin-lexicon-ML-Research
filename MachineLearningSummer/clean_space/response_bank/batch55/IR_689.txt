For 
To apply the task <IDAA> to the given string, we will need to decompose the task <IDA> (the classification of the string into one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>) into specific steps and systematically execute them. Here is the step-by-step decomposition and application:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   Look for the primary assertion or set of assertions presented in the statement.

   Proposition (<P>):
   - "I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan."
   - "I will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts."
   - "I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression."
   - "I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease."
   - "I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   Look for the causal basis or reasons given to establish the truth of the Proposition.

   Reason (<R>):
   - The statement includes various actions the speaker intends to take, which serve as underlying reasons. However, these reasons are largely implied and not explicitly stated in terms of concrete evidence or causal basis within the provided text.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   Look for any additional arguments or evidence corroborating the Reason.

   Proof of Reason (<PR>):
   - The statement does not provide specific empirical evidence or additional arguments to corroborate the reasons. It relies more on asserting the intention to achieve objectives.

4. **Check for Defective Argument Types**:
   Evaluate the text against each defective argument type to see which, if any, apply.

   - **Generalization (<G>)**:
     The statements cover various broad topics and issues but are not necessarily overly generalizing specific points about them all. This does not predominantly fit Generalization.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
     The strategies for addressing the issues may not entirely cover all possibilities, but the statement does not claim to provide an exhaustive list. Hence, it does not fit Incomplete Enumeration.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
     The reasons given (e.g., strategies and actions) do not concretely prove that these actions will achieve the desired outcomes. This seems to fit Inconclusive Reason since the effectiveness of the actions is not conclusively demonstrated.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
     There could be a weak causal link, as reasons for actions are vague. This overlaps with Inconclusive Reason, but we can consider it as a potential fit.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
     The reasons do not merely repeat the propositions. Hence, this does not fit.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
     There isn't an appeal to universal agreement or unchallenged consensus. Hence, this does not fit.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
     Some terms could be interpreted in different ways (e.g., "responsibly," "renew diplomacy"), indicating that Ambiguous Language Use is also a potential fit.

Based on the evaluation, we find that:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**

are the defective argument types that could apply to the statement.

**Primary Appeal Used**:
Analyzing the overall tone and approach, the primary appeal is likely an emotional appeal (pathos) to the audience's desire for peace, security, and moral leadership, rather than a purely logical or evidence-based appeal.
