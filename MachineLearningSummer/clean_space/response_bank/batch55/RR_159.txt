To apply the task IDAA (the application of D, decomposition of the task, to IDA, classifying a string as a type of defective argument) step by step, let's proceed as follows:

### Decomposition of IDA (Classification) into Steps (D):
1. **Identify the Proposition (\<P\>):** Clearly state the main point or assertion being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (\<R\>):** Find the causal basis or reasoning that supports the proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Reason (\<R\>):** Determine if the reason adequately supports the proposition.
4. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\<PR\>):** Look for any additional arguments or evidence that corroborate the reason.
5. **Classify the Defective Argument:** Based on the evaluation of the reason and proof of reason, classify the argument as one of the known defective types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, or DEP).

### Application to the Given String
Let's apply these steps to the given string:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\<P\>)
"We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people."

- Proposition (\<P\>): "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\<R\>)
In this statement, the reason is implied rather than explicitly stated, but we can infer it:

- Implied Reason (\<R\>): "Electing new people will fix the broken judicial system."

#### Step 3: Evaluate the Reason (\<R\>)
Does the reason conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition? 

- Evaluation: The reason assumes that electing new people will necessarily fix the broken judicial system, but it does not provide evidence or explanations as to why this would be the case. Given that complex systems like the judicial system may require more than just electing new people to fix structural issues, this reason is not conclusively demonstrated.

#### Step 4: Identify the Proof of Reason (\<PR\>)
Check for any additional arguments or evidence:

- In this statement, there is no additional corroborative evidence or detailed argument indicating why electing new people would fix the system.

#### Step 5: Classify the Defective Argument
Based on our evaluation of the reason and the lack of additional proof:

- **Type: Inconclusive Reason (IR)**

The argument type seems to fit the description of an Inconclusive Reason:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** where the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
  
By electing new people, it is not necessarily the only or a conclusive way to fix the judicial system; more evidence and reasoning are required to substantiate this claim.

### Conclusion
The given string "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people." contains a logical fallacy best classified as an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** according to our detailed analysis.
