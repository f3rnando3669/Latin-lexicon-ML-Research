To apply IDAA to the given string, we need to decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps. Here's the step-by-step decomposition and classification:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of the Task (IDAA):

**Step 1: Identify the Parts of the Argument.**
- Determine if there is a clear **Proposition (P)** and **Reason (R)** in the argument provided.

**Step 2: Analyze Each Part for Defective Argument Types.**
- Check if the argument exhibits characteristics of each defective argument type (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>).

**Step 3: Compare the Identified Defective Argument Type with Definitions.**
- Match the identified argument type with the definitions of the defective argument types provided.

### Applying the Steps to the Example String:

The example string is: "But this here research must go on. This space effort must go on."

**Step 1: Identify the Parts of the Argument.**
- **P (Proposition):** "This research must go on. This space effort must go on."
- **R (Reason):** The argument actually lacks an explicit reason; it merely repeats the proposition.

**Step 2: Analyze Each Part for Defective Argument Types.**
- **Generalization (G):** This does not seem to involve an assertion based on a part/majority referred to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** There is no indication that it claims a complete enumeration of possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** There is no conclusive reasoning presented; in fact, no reasoning is explicitly provided.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason ("This research must go on") is directly repeated in the proposition without additional justification.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** There is no causal basis presented at all.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument does not claim universal agreement as its proof of reason.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language is clear and direct, but there's no alternative sense implied.

**Step 3: Compare the Identified Defective Argument Type with Definitions.**
- The argument can be classified as **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** since the reason given is simply a repetition of the proposition.

### Conclusion:
Applying IDAA to the given string, we classify it as a type <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
