For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) (the decomposition of the task of classifying defective arguments step by step) to the string "Boy, those sound like pretty terrible, epicly fascist (hint) robots," we need to break down the process into clear and manageable steps. Here's the step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Parsing the String
First, let's understand and parse the string:
"Boy, those sound like pretty terrible, epicly fascist (hint) robots."

### Step 2: Identify the Proposition (\( \text{P} \))
Determine if there's a clear statement or proposition in the sentence:
- The proposition appears to be that "those robots" are "pretty terrible" and "epicly fascist."

### Step 3: Check for Generalization (\( \text{G} \))
- Is there an assertion based on one part or the majority of individuals but applied to all?
  - The statement does seem to generalize all "robots" as "pretty terrible" and "epicly fascist." So, it could be a case of over-generalizing all robots based on the given observation.

### Step 4: Analyze for Incomplete Enumeration (\( \text{FE} \))
- Does the argument claim to have considered all possibilities but missed out on some?
  - The statement does not enumerate possibilities or claim completeness, so it doesn't fall under \(\text{FE}\).

### Step 5: Examine for Inconclusive Reason (\( \text{IR} \))
- Does the reason given not conclusively support the proposition?
  - The statement does not provide any reasons, so \(\text{IR}\) is not applicable.

### Step 6: Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( \text{RR} \))
- Does the reason simply repeat the proposition?
  - There is no reason provided that repeats the proposition, so \(\text{RR}\) is not applicable.

### Step 7: Inspect for Insufficient Causal Basis (\( \text{WCB} \))
- Is the causal basis insufficient to support the proposition?
  - There is no causal basis given, hence \(\text{WCB}\) is not applicable.

### Step 8: Assess for Presumptuous Consensus (\( \text{FU} \))
- Is the proof assumed as certain based on "universal agreement" which is still in dispute?
  - There is no claim of universal agreement presented, so \(\text{FU}\) is not applicable.

### Step 9: Review for Ambiguous Language Use (\( \text{DEP} \))
- Could the language be taken in another sense than intended?
  - The language used could be seen as informal or slang, but not necessarily ambiguous to the point of causing a defective argument. Thus, \(\text{DEP}\) is less likely.

### Conclusion
Given these steps, the most fitting category is \( \text{G} \) for Generalization. The assertion that "those robots" are "pretty terrible" and "epicly fascist" seems to generalize all robots based on a singular perception without specificity or evidence.

Therefore, the classification for the string "Boy, those sound like pretty terrible, epicly fascist (hint) robots" under \( \text{IDA} \) is \( \text{G} \) for Generalization.
