For 
To apply **<IDAA>** (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument into specific steps) to the argument "Bill says Jenny would make a good class president, but Bill makes bad grades, so we shouldn’t vote for Jenny," we should follow these steps:

### Step 1: Decompose the Argument into its Components

1. **Proposition (<P>)**: Identify what is being set forth to prove.
   - In this case, the proposition is: "We shouldn’t vote for Jenny."

2. **Reason (<R>)**: Identify the causal basis that supports the <P>.
   - The reason provided is: "Bill makes bad grades."

3. **Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Identify if there is any corroborating proof of the reason given.
   - In this argument, there doesn't appear to be an additional argument or proof provided to support the reason (<R>).

### Step 2: Identify the type of defective argument in the components

1. **Check for Generalization (<G>)**: Is the <P> an assertion based on one part, but generalized to all?
   - No, this does not seem to fit <G> because the argument does not make a general assertion applying to all from one part.

2. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Is the <P> defective due to missing out on some pertinent possibilities?
   - No, the argument does not seem to claim a complete enumeration of possibilities.

3. **Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Does the <R> not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the <P>?
   - Yes, "Bill makes bad grades" does not conclusively demonstrate why "We shouldn’t vote for Jenny." Jenny's capability as a class president is not logically connected to Bill's grades.

4. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Is <R> weak because the causal basis it submits for <P> is not compelling?
   - Yes, the reason "Bill makes bad grades" is not a compelling or sufficient reason to conclude that Jenny would not be a good class president. Bill's academic performance is irrelevant to Jenny's qualifications.

5. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Does the <R> repeat the <P>?
   - No, the reason does not repeat the proposition in this case.

6. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Is the <PR> assumed as certain based on a disputed consensus?
   - There is no discussion of consensus or universal agreement on the matter in this argument.

7. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Can the <PR> be taken in another sense than intended?
   - No, the language does not seem ambiguous in this particular argument.

### Step 3: Determine the most fitting type of defective argument

After analyzing the argument against the provided defective argument types and corresponding to the defined components:

- The <R> "Bill makes bad grades" does not provide a conclusive or compelling basis to establish the <P> "We shouldn’t vote for Jenny."
- Therefore, the most fitting defective argument classifications are **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.

### Conclusion

Based on the application of **<IDAA>** to the argument, we identify the defective argument as both **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** because the reason provided does not effectively support the conclusion.
