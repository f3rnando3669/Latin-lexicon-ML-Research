For 
To apply the process of decomposing the advanced task (IDAA) to classify the argument "My car broke down yesterday. Cars are worthless." as one of the defective argument types, we can break it down into the following specific steps (D):

### Steps to Decompose and Classify (D):
1. **Identify the Proposition (P)** in the argument.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)** in the argument.
3. **Analyze the Proposition and Reason** to determine if it matches any defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, or DEP).
4. **Assign the Classification** based on the analysis.

### Step-by-Step Application (IDAA):

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
- The statement "Cars are worthless" is the Proposition (P).
  
#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
- The statement "My car broke down yesterday" is being used as the Reason (R) to support the proposition.

#### Step 3: Analyze the Proposition and Reason
- We need to examine how "My car broke down yesterday" functions as a reason to support the proposition "Cars are worthless."

- In this context, the argument seems to be a generalization from a specific instance. The person is taking one specific event (their car breaking down) and extrapolating it to make a broad claim about all cars.

#### Step 4: Assign the Classification
- Considering the nature of the reasoning, the defective argument type that best matches is **Generalization (G)**. This type occurs when an assertion about some individuals (like one car breaking down) is incorrectly generalized to apply to all individuals (all cars being worthless).

### Conclusion
Based on the steps and analysis, the argument "My car broke down yesterday. Cars are worthless." is an instance of a **Generalization (G)** defective argument type.
