For 
To apply the task of classifying the argument string "You tell me it's unpatriotic to cheat on federal income tax reports. Well, you should know. You've never once listed your huge bonuses." as one of the defective argument types defined, we need to decompose the advanced task (IDA).

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of Task (IDA)

1. **Identify the components of the argument:**
   - **Proposition (P):** The main assertion or claim being made.
   - **Reason (R):** The causal basis offered in support of the proposition.
   - **Proof of Reason (PR):** Supporting arguments or evidence provided for the reason.

2. **Evaluate the type of defects in the argument:**
   - **Generalization (G)**: Is the claim based on an assertion applicable to only some individuals but generalized to all?
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Does the claim pretend to have considered all possibilities but misses some?
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Does the reason provided fail to conclusively establish the proposition?
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Is the causal basis (reason) weak or not compelling?
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Does the reason simply restate the proposition without adding any substantial new support?
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Is a proof assumed to be certain because "it is universally agreed upon," though it's still in dispute?
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Could the proof be taken in a different sense than intended?

### Application of (IDAA) to the Given String

1. **Identify the components of the argument:**
   - **Proposition (P):** "It's unpatriotic to cheat on federal income tax reports."
   - **Reason (R):** "You've never once listed your huge bonuses."
   - **Implicit Reasoning:** The speaker is suggesting that the person they are speaking to is a hypocrite and therefore not credible in asserting the patriotism of tax reporting honesty.

2. **Evaluate the defects:**
   - **Generalization (G):** This does not appear to be a case of generalization.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** There is no listing of possibilities here.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason (R) here attacks the credibility of the person making the proposition rather than providing a direct reason related to patriotism. The argument is ad hominem, focusing on the character of the person rather than the issue at hand.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This could apply since the reason is not directly causally compelling regarding the proposition (it attacks the person rather than addressing the patriotic aspect of tax reporting).
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason is not just a repetition of the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There is no claim of universal agreement here.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** No ambiguous language use is evident here.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the defective argument type is most closely aligned with **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. The reason provided ("You've never once listed your huge bonuses") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition ("It's unpatriotic to cheat on federal income tax reports"). Instead, it constitutes an ad hominem attack, which weakens the argumentâ€™s reasoning rather than supporting it.
