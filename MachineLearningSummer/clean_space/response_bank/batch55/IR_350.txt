Sure, let's apply the decomposition method <IDAA> to classify the string "Just give me a chance to prove it to you. I can’t live this life if you will leave me. My world will stop to turn around. I will not be able to eat nor drink."

Step 1: Identify the components of the argument.
- Proposition (\<P>): "Just give me a chance to prove it to you."
- Reason (\<R>): "I can’t live this life if you will leave me."
- Proof of Reason (\<PR>): "My world will stop to turn around. I will not be able to eat nor drink."

Step 2: Examine the Proposition (\<P>).
- The Proposition (\<P>) "Just give me a chance to prove it to you" is a summary of what the speaker intends to prove.

Step 3: Examine the Reason (\<R>).
- The Reason (\<R>) "I can’t live this life if you will leave me" sets forth the causal basis for establishing the truth of what the speaker urges.

Step 4: Examine the Proof of Reason (\<PR>).
- The Proof of Reason (\<PR>) "My world will stop to turn around. I will not be able to eat nor drink" provides additional arguments supporting the Reason.

Step 5: Check for defective argument types.

- Generalization (\<G>): The argument does not involve making an assertion based on one part or the majority of individuals, so it is not a Generalization.
- Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE>): The argument does not make a claim of complete enumeration of possibilities, so it is not an Incomplete Enumeration.
- Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>): The Reason given is highly emotional and not necessarily logically rigorous. It doesn't conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition. Thus, it may be identified as an Inconclusive Reason.
- Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB>): The causal basis (the speaker can't live without the other person's presence) is subjective and not compelling in a logical sense, indicating an Insufficient Causal Basis.
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR>): The reason given does not merely repeat the Proposition.
- Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU>): The argument does not appeal to a universal agreement.
- Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP>): The language used does not appear to have inherent ambiguity that could be interpreted in another sense than intended by the speaker.

Step 6: Make a final classification.
- The argument can be classified as both \<IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and \<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) because the Reason given is emotional and subjective without being logically compelling.

Thus, the string "Just give me a chance to prove it to you. I can’t live this life if you will leave me. My world will stop to turn around. I will not be able to eat nor drink." can be classified under defective argument types <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
