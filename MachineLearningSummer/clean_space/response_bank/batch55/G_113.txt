For 
Certainly! Let's apply the decomposition task \( <IDAA> \) to the task of classifying the argument given by "All of those who hate the Duterte administration are CPP-NPA supporters." This process will involve breaking down the classification task \( <IDA> \) into specific steps.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The given statement is "All of those who hate the Duterte administration are CPP-NPA supporters."
   - In this case, the Proposition \( <P> \) is that everyone who hates the Duterte administration is a CPP-NPA supporter.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The Reason \( <R> \) for the argument is implicit. However, we can infer that the argument suggests a causal connection or correlation that those who oppose the administration are aligned with the CPP-NPA by definition.

3. **Classify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - To determine the type of defective argument, we examine the nature of the Proposition and the structure of the argument. 

4. **Evaluate Potential Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** The Proposition seems to be based on a sweeping assertion without sufficient evidence, implying that a characteristic observed in some (or even many) individuals applies universally to all members of a group.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This doesn't seem to be about enumeration or listing possibilities, so it doesn't fit here.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The Reason provided (either implicit or explicit) doesn't seem to conclusively support the Proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** There is a weak causal basis for claiming all critics of the Duterte administration are CPP-NPA supporters, as no such compelling evidence is provided.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The statement doesn't merely repeat the Proposition in the Reason.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** There is no explicit appeal to universal agreement in the presented statement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The statement doesn't appear to hinge on ambiguous terms.

5. **Determine the Most Appropriate Defective Argument Type:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** This type of defective argument seems the most plausible because the Proposition is a sweeping generalization not supported by evidence. It takes an attribute observed in some individuals (hatred of Duterte) and erroneously applies it to every individual in the opposition.

### Conclusion:
The argument "All of those who hate the Duterte administration are CPP-NPA supporters" is classified as a Generalization (\<G\>).

By following the decomposition of \( <IDA> \) into specific steps, we identified the Proposition, inferred the Reason, evaluated potential defective argument types, and determined that the argument fits the category of Generalization (\<G\>).
