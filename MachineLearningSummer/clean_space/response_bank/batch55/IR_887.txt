For 
Let's proceed with step-by-step decomposition of the task <IDA> into specific steps to classify the given string. This is the application of <IDAA> to the string provided.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D):

1. **Identify the Proposition (if present)**:
    - Look for a statement setting forth what is intended to be proven (P).

2. **Identify the Reason (if present)**:
    - Look for a causal basis or reasoning behind the Proposition (R).

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (if present)**:
    - Look for any additional arguments that corroborate the Reason (PR).

4. **Assess for Defective Argument Types**:
    - Determine if the identified parts fall into any of the defective argument types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

### Application of Decomposition to Classify the String (IDAA):

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)

In the given string, a key proposition can be identified as:
- "we weren't helping women - we were destroying them."

This is what the speaker intends to prove.

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)

The reason provided for the proposition is:
- "Then we had a death. A 32-year-old woman hemorrhaged to death as a result of a cervical laceration."

This incident is used as the causal basis for the conclusion in the proposition.

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)

No explicit additional argumentation is presented to corroborate the reason given. The statement relies on a single instance to make the case.

#### Step 4: Assess for Defective Argument Types

Now, let's evaluate if the argument falls into any defect categories:

- **Generalization (G):** The argument generalizes from one instance (a single case of a woman's death) to support a broad conclusion ("we weren't helping women - we were destroying them"). This is an instance of Generalization.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument does not seek to list all potential occurrences or possibilities but relies on one example to support its claim, which can be seen as missing out on the full enumeration of all situations.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reasoning provided (one death) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition that they were destroying women rather than helping them. It’s insufficient to reach such a broad conclusion.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The sole instance provided does not offer a compelling causal basis for the sweeping general conclusion.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** There is no repetition of the proposition itself within the reason.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There is no invocation of a universal agreement as proof.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language used is not particularly ambiguous in the context given.

### Classification of the String

Given the evaluations:
- The primary defective argument types present seem to be **Generalization (G)** and **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. Additionally, it might also fall into **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** due to the weak causal claim.

Therefore, the given string “Then we had a death. A 32-year-old woman hemorrhaged to death as a result of a cervical laceration. I finally realized, we weren't helping women - we were destroying them.” can be primarily classified under the defective argument types:
1. **Generalization (G)**
2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
