For 
To apply the decomposition of the task "classifying a string as one of the defective argument types" (<IDAA>) to the given string "There was a fight at school today. Violence is a growing problem in school.", we need to break down the task into specific steps and apply those steps to identify the type of defective argument being used.

### Decomposition (<D>) of the Task (<IDA>):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
    - Determine the main assertion or statement intended to be proven.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
    - Determine the causal basis provided to support or establish the proposition.
3. **Analyze the Quality of the Reason (<R>)**:
    - Evaluate the strength and validity of the reason in supporting the proposition.
4. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>) if applicable**:
    - Determine any additional arguments provided to corroborate the reason.
5. **Classify the Defective Argument**:
    - Based on the analysis, classify the argument as one of the defective types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step-by-Step Application of <IDAA>:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**
- Proposition in the given string: "Violence is a growing problem in school."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**
- Reason provided: "There was a fight at school today."

**Step 3: Analyze the Quality of the Reason (<R>)**
- Evaluate whether the reason provided conclusively supports the proposition.

**Step 4: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>) if applicable**
- In this case, there is no additional argument provided beyond the initial reason.

**Step 5: Classify the Defective Argument**

We need to determine which type of defective argument applies to the relationship between the proposition (<P>) and the reason (<R>).

- **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument takes a single instance (a fight at school) and generalizes it to a broader claim (violence is a growing problem in school).
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not applicable here as it does not claim to list all possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason may not conclusively prove the proposition, but this applies more to the strength rather than the type of reasoning.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reason provided would need to show the cause-effect relation between a single fight and a growing trend, but this is more about the strength of causality rather than a type per se.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The reason is not merely a repetition of the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The reason does not assume consensus.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The language in the reasoning does not seem ambiguous.

The most fitting classification here would be: **Generalization (<G>)**.

**Final Classification**: The string "There was a fight at school today. Violence is a growing problem in school." exemplifies a **Generalization (<G>)** defective argument.

This concludes the step-by-step application of <IDAA> to the argument in question.
