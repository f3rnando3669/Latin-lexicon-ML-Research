For 
Applying **IDAA** to the statement "You're with us or you're against us" involves decomposing the task **IDA** of classifying this statement into specific steps. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
We need to clearly identify the proposition presented in the statement.

**Proposition:** "You're with us or you're against us."

### Step 2: Analyze the Reason (<R>)
Since the statement is a categorical assertion and doesn't provide a causal basis explicitly, let’s proceed to classify it based on defective argument types.

### Step 3: Evaluate for Types of Defective Arguments
Now, we will systematically evaluate which defective argument type this statement belongs to:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**
   - Does the proposition assert something about all cases based on only some cases?
   - No, this doesn't apply as the statement is about a dichotomy, not a generalization.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
   - Does the proposition claim a complete enumeration but miss out on other possibilities?
   - Yes. The statement presents only two options when, in reality, there may be other stances one could take that are not just "with us" or "against us." For example, being neutral or undecided.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
   - Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the proposition?
   - There's no explicit reason given in the statement that could be evaluated for conclusive demonstration.
   
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
   - Is the reason weak due to a lack of compelling causal basis?
   - Again, there's no explicit causal basis to evaluate in this case.
   
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**
   - Does the reason merely repeat the proposition without adding new information?
   - No repetition is provided in the statement.
   
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
   - Does the proof rest on the assumption of universal agreement, which is still in dispute?
   - The statement does not reference a presumption of consensus.
   
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**
   - Could the language be taken in another sense than intended?
   - The binary nature of the statement doesn’t suggest ambiguity in language use, only an oversimplification.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type
Given the analysis, the most fitting defective argument type is **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** because it erroneously limits the possibilities to only two, ignoring any other potential stance.

### Conclusion
The statement "You're with us or you're against us" most closely aligns with the defective argument type **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**. The proposition is defective as it claims a binary choice while potentially overlooking other relevant possibilities.
