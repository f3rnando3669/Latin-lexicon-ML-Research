Alright, let's apply the process of identifying the type of defective argument used in the statement "Everyone is buying the new iPhone that’s coming out this weekend. You have to buy it too" by decomposing the task into specific steps.

### Decomposition of the IDA Task (D):
1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine the main assertion being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Determine the causal basis or justification provided for the Proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Reason (R)**: Assess the strength and relevance of the Reason in supporting the Proposition.
4. **Classify the Defective Argument (IDA)**: Based on the evaluation, classify the argument according to the predefined types of defective arguments.

### Application of IDAA to the Statement:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**
- The main assertion is: "You have to buy the new iPhone."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)**
- The justification provided is: "Everyone is buying the new iPhone that’s coming out this weekend."

**Step 3: Evaluate the Reason (R)**
- Determine if the Reason effectively supports the Proposition.
  - The argument implies that because "everyone" is buying the new iPhone, you should too. This suggests the Reason is attempting to use the popularity or consensus as a basis for the Proposition.
  - Assess whether the Reason is logically compelling.

**Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument (IDA)**
- Based on the evaluation, classify the argument:

1. **Generalization (G)**: The Proposition is based on a potentially exaggerated assertion about the behavior of "everyone."
   - The statement "Everyone is buying the new iPhone" may not be true for literally everyone but refers to a general behavior.
   
2. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The Proposition relies on the Reason assuming it is certain because it is "universally agreed upon."
   - The statement tries to leverage the presumed consensus to compel the action.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The Reason may not conclusively demonstrate that the action (buying the iPhone) is necessary based solely on what others are doing.

In this case, the defective argument type of the statement "Everyone is buying the new iPhone that’s coming out this weekend. You have to buy it too" aligns most closely with:
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The statement assumes that because it is a widely held opinion or action (everyone buying the new iPhone), you must do the same, overlooking individual judgment or other factors.

Therefore, the statement is classified as **<FU>**.
