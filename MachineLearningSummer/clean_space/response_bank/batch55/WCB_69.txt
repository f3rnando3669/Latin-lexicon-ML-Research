For 
To apply the IDAA (application of decomposition to the task of identifying defective argument types), we first break down the task IDA (Identifying Defective Arguments) and then apply it to the provided argument step-by-step. 

Here is the decomposition of task IDA into specific steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   Extract the main assertion that the argument aims to establish.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   Determine the causal basis or rationale given for the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   Look for corroborative elements or additional arguments provided to support the reason.

4. **Analyze the types of defections (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP):**
   Compare each step of the argument with the definitions of defective argument types to classify the argument correctly.
   - Generalization (G)
   - Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
   - Inconclusive Reason (IR)
   - Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
   - Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
   - Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)

Let's apply these steps to the given argument: "Every time that rooster crows, the sun comes up. That rooster must be very powerful and important!"

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The proposition is the main assertion aiming to be established:
- **P:** That rooster must be very powerful and important!

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason given for the proposition is the causal basis or rationale:
- **R:** Every time that rooster crows, the sun comes up.

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
Look for any corroborative elements or additional arguments. In this case:
- **PR:** There isn't any explicit additional corroborative element provided in the argument. 

### Step 4: Analyze the types of defections
Now, compare this argument to the definitions of defective arguments:
- **Generalization (G):** This doesn't seem to fit since weâ€™re not generalizing from a part or majority to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This isn't about enumeration.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason cited does not logically demonstrate the proposition. It assumes a causal relationship based merely on correlation.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis (rooster crows leading to sun rising) is not compelling or sufficient. Correlation does not imply causation.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason is not merely a repetition of the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** No claim of universal agreement is made.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** There is no ambiguous language misinterpretation here.

The analysis suggests that the argument fails primarily due to:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason given does not conclusively establish the correctness of the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal link between the rooster crowing and the sun rising is not compelling and is based on a misunderstanding of correlation versus causation.

### Conclusion
The defective argument type in the given string can be classified as:
- **IR (Inconclusive Reason)** 
- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**

Thus, the final classification of the given argument "Every time that rooster crows, the sun comes up. That rooster must be very powerful and important!" falls into multiple categories: primarily **IR** and **WCB**.
