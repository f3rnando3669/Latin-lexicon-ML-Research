Sure, let's proceed with the application of <IDAA> to the string "This is why a woman shouldn’t do a man's job" using the defined defective argument types. We'll decompose the task into specific steps and then classify the string according to the identified argument defects, if any.

### Decomposition (<D>) of <IDA> into Specific Steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):** Examine the string to determine the proposition being asserted.
2. **Identify the Reason (R):** Determine the causal basis or reason being given for the proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (PR):** Look for any support or evidence provided to corroborate the reason.
4. **Classify the Defect:** Using the definitions of defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>), classify the defect based on the identified P, R, and PR.

### Step-by-Step Application of <IDAA>:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
- **Proposition (P):** "A woman shouldn’t do a man's job."

This is the main assertion being made in the string.

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
- **Reason (R):** "This is why."

The string is incomplete as it refers to some unstated reason ("this") to justify the proposition. Therefore, we do not have an explicit R provided within the string itself.

#### Step 3: Evaluate the Proof of Reason (PR)
- **Proof of Reason (PR):** None provided.

Since the string does not offer any additional arguments or evidence for the reason, there is no proof of reason (PR) to evaluate.

#### Step 4: Classify the Defect

Given the identified P and the lack of explicit R and PR:

- **Generalization (G):** The proposition seems to make a sweeping statement about what women can or cannot do based on the job being "man's job" without specific evidence.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The proposition does not attempt to enumerate possibilities or exceptions; it makes a blanket statement.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason ("This is why") is unspecific and lacks detail, making it inconclusive.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Due to the absence of a clear reason, we cannot directly classify it as having an insufficient causal basis, but the absence of reasons makes it weak in general.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason "This is why" does not appear to repeat the proposition but is too vague to determine conclusively.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The statement does not appeal to a consensus; it simply asserts a proposition without claiming universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The reasoning is ambiguous because "This is why" does not clearly articulate the underlying reason.

### Final Classification:
Based on the analysis:

- **IR (Inconclusive Reason):** The reason provided ("This is why") is unspecific and lacks sufficient detail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use):** The string's implied reason is vague, making the language ambiguous.

Thus, the string "This is why a woman shouldn’t do a man's job" is classified under **IR (Inconclusive Reason)** and **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use)**.
