For 
To apply IDAA (decomposition to classify defective arguments) to the given statement, let's break down the steps and apply them systematically.

### Step 1: Identify Components of the Argument
1. **Proposition:** Cats like to go to windows and watch sunsets.
2. **Reason:** Because that is what her cat does.

### Step 2: Classify the Type of Defective Argument
Given the types of defective arguments, we'll compare the provided argument against each type to determine which one is applicable.

1. **Generalization <G>:** This occurs when an assertion based on one part or majority of individuals is referred to all. 
   - In this case, the friend is making a general statement about all cats based on the behavior of her own cat.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>:** This occurs when a complete list of possibilities is claimed but not all pertinent options are included.
   - This does not seem applicable because the argument does not involve listing all possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason <IR>:** This occurs when the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
   - While the reason might not be conclusive, other types need to be considered more closely first.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>:** This happens when the causal basis for the proposition is not compelling.
   - Her reasoning might be compelling in other contexts, but it still generalizes from a single experience.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>:** This happens when the reason appears to repeat the proposition.
   - The reason provided here is not just a repetition of the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>:** This happens when an argument assumes a consensus that isn't actually proven.
   - The argument does not claim that the statement is universally agreed upon.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>:** This happens when the argument uses language that can be interpreted in a different sense.
   - The language of this argument is quite clear and does not display ambiguity.

### Step 3: Conclusion
After analyzing the components of the argument and comparing them to the types of defective arguments, we find the closest and most fitting type:

- The argument "Cats like to go to windows and watch sunsets because that is what her cat does" is a **Generalization (<G>)**. She is generalizing the behavior of her individual cat to apply to all cats.

### Final Classification
The fallacy committed is **Generalization (<G>)**.
