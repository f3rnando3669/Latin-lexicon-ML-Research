For 
To apply the process of decomposing the task of classifying the string "to define a person based on faulty opinions derived by judgments made about a group, a class, or race of people" (IDA) into specific steps (D), we can follow these steps in order:

1. **Identify the specific proposition (P)** in the provided statement.
2. **Identify the reason (R)** given for the proposition.
3. **Determine if the reason (R) provides sufficient and valid causal basis for the proposition (P)**.
4. **Identify if there's a proof of reason (PR)** that supports the reason (R).
5. **Classify the entire argument as one of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>)** based on the deficiencies identified.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the specific proposition (P)**:
   - The <P> in this statement seems to be: "to define a person."
   
2. **Identify the reason (R)**:
   - The reason provided is: "based on faulty opinions derived by judgments made about a group, a class, or race of people."

3. **Determine if the reason (R) provides sufficient and valid causal basis for the proposition (P)**:
   - The reason implies that definitions are based on preconceived opinions and judgments about specific groups, classes, or races of people. The sufficiency and validity are questionable because it mixes individual attributes with general group characteristics without substantiating each individual case.

4. **Identify if there's a proof of reason (PR)**:
   - The statement does not provide an explicit proof of reason. It makes a broad generalization and doesn't offer additional arguments to support the rationale.

5. **Classify the entire argument as one of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) based on the deficiencies identified**:

   - Considering the argument type definitions, this argument falls under <G> (Generalization):
     - The <P> "define a person" based on judgments about a group fits the definition of a generalization because it extrapolates individual traits or faults to general group characteristics without substantiation.
     - The conclusion is drawn about an individual from opinions about a group, a classic case of overgeneralization.

Thus, applying IDAA to "to define a person based on faulty opinions derived by judgments made about a group, a class, or race of people":

- Step 1: Proposition (P) - "to define a person."
- Step 2: Reason (R) - "faulty opinions derived by judgments made about a group, a class, or race of people."
- Step 3: Validity and sufficiency of R - Weak and not substantiated.
- Step 4: Proof of Reason (PR) - None provided.
- Step 5: Classification of argument - <G> (Generalization).

### Conclusion:
The analysis shows that the defective argument type for the statement "to define a person based on faulty opinions derived by judgments made about a group, a class, or race of people" is <G> (Generalization).
