To apply the decomposition approach (IDAA) to classify the string "This fallacy assumes something is true (or right, or good) because other people agree with it." as one of the defective argument types, let's break it down systematically:

### Step 1: Understand the Argument in the Given String
First, we need to interpret the statement to understand the kind of defect it is highlighting in the argument.

The statement identifies a fallacy based on the assumption that something is true, right, or good merely because other people agree with it. This implies that the correctness of the proposition is determined by a consensus, rather than solid reasoning or evidence.

### Step 2: Identify the Core Defect Highlighted by the Statement
Next, we need to match this understanding to the definitions of defective argument types provided:

**Generalization (G):** This is about incorrectly applying a characteristic of a part or majority as applicable to all.

**Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This occurs when possibilities are incorrectly claimed as complete without considering all pertinent ones.

**Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Here, the reason given does not conclusively prove the proposition.

**Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This is when the causal reason for the proposition is weak.

**Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason repeats the proposition without adding new information.

**Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This is when something is assumed true based on the belief that it is universally agreed uponâ€”a consensus is considered sufficient to establish the proposition.

**Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The proposition or reason can be interpreted in multiple ways, not as the speaker intended.

### Step 3: Match the Defect to Its Type
Based on the definition and the interpreted argument, the statement "This fallacy assumes something is true (or right, or good) because other people agree with it." clearly matches:

**Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The statement explicitly describes a defect where an argument's validity is assumed based on the belief that there is a consensus or universal agreement about its truth, which is still in dispute.

### Step 4: Validate and Confirm the Classification
We can re-read the statement and the definitions to ensure that our classification is correct:

- The argument defect is based on universal agreement.
- The fallacy described relies on consensus as the primary reason for the proposition's correctness.

Given the steps and validation, we can conclusively classify the string as a type of defective argument:

**Classification: FU (Presumptuous Consensus)**

Thus, applying IDAA to the given string results in classifying it under the defective argument type "Presumptuous Consensus (FU)."
