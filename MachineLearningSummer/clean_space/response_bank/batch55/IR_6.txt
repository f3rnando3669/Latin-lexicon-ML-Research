For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string into specific steps) to the given string "We're going to celebrate New Year's Eve this way because that's how we've always done it. This is an example of ...," we need to follow a systematic process. Hereâ€™s how we can break it down:

1. **Identify the Proposition <P> and Reason <R> in the given string:**
   - Proposition <P>: "We're going to celebrate New Year's Eve this way."
   - Reason <R>: "because that's how we've always done it."

2. **Analyze the Reason <R> to determine if it matches any of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP):**
   - **Generalization (G)**: Does not apply, as this statement is not making a broad claim based on a single part or majority without universal applicability.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Does not apply, as no enumeration or listing of possibilities is mentioned or implied.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Could apply if the reason given does not conclusively support the claim. We need to consider if "that's how we've always done it" is a sufficient reason for the proposition.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Applicable because the reason essentially restates the proposition without adding new information. The reason is basically saying that we should do it this way because we do it this way.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Could also apply, as the reason "that's how we've always done it" is not a compelling basis for the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Does not apply as there's no claim of universal agreement in the statement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Does not apply, as the language used is clear and unambiguous.

3. **Classify the string within the defective argument types based on the analysis:**
   - The predominant classification for this example is **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** because the reasoning given is simply a restatement of the proposition.

Thus, for the string "We're going to celebrate New Year's Eve this way because that's how we've always done it. This is an example of ...", the classification (IDA) is:

**"This is an example of Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)."**
