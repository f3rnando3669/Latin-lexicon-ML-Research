For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument into specific steps) to the given string "My parents are democrats, and they are good people. Therefore, all democrats must be good people," we need to follow a step-by-step process. Hereâ€™s how we can do it:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The Proposition (P) is the main claim that is being made, which we intend to prove.
- In this case, the Proposition is: "**all democrats must be good people**."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The Reason (R) is the causal basis or the support provided for the Proposition.
- Here, the Reason is: "**My parents are democrats, and they are good people**."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
The Proof of Reason (PR) is additional support that corroborates the Reason.
- In this argument, there is no additional support beyond the initial Reason. So the Proof of Reason is not explicitly provided.

### Step 4: Evaluate the Argument
Now, we need to determine which type of defective argument the given statement falls into. We will examine each type to find a match:

- **Generalization (G)**: This occurs when an assertion based on one or a few cases is applied to all. 

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This happens when a claim of complete enumeration of possibilities is made, but some possibilities are missed.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This occurs when the Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This happens when the causal basis for the Reason is not compelling.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This occurs when the Reason is essentially a repetition of the Proposition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This happens when a Proof of Reason is assumed to be certain because it is claimed to be universally agreed upon.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: This occurs when the Proof of Reason can be interpreted in a different way than intended by the speaker.

### Step 5: Classify the Defective Argument
We need to compare the given argument to each defective type to find the best match.

- **Generalization (G)**: The Proposition "all democrats must be good people" is based on a specific instance that the speaker's parents are good people. This is a generalization made from one instance to an entire group.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This does not apply as there is no claim that all possibilities have been considered.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition, but this is already covered by generalization in this case.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The Reason provided does not have a compelling causal connection to the Proposition.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The Reason is not merely a restatement of the Proposition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There is no appeal to a supposed universal agreement.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: There is no evident ambiguity in language.

The best classification for the defective argument here is:
- **Generalization (G)**

### Conclusion
The statement "My parents are democrats, and they are good people. Therefore, all democrats must be good people," is an example of a defective argument of type **Generalization (G)**.
