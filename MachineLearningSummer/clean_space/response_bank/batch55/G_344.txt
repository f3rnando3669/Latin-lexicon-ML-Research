For 
Certainly! To apply the process of decomposing the task of classifying the given argument into specific steps and then identifying its type step-by-step, we can follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of IDA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Determine the main assertion or conclusion of the argument.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Find the causal basis or reasoning used to support the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR), if any:**
   - Look for additional arguments that corroborate the reason provided.

4. **Analyze the Argument for Defects:**
   - Check if the argument exhibits any of the known defective argument types such as:
     - Generalization (G)
     - Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
     - Inconclusive Reason (IR)
     - Weak Causal Basis (WCB)
     - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
     - Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
     - Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)

### Application of IDAA to the Given Argument:

**Given Argument:**
*“Four out of five dentists recommend Happy Glossy toothpaste. Therefore, it must be great.”*

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**
- **Proposition (P):** "Happy Glossy toothpaste must be great."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)**
- **Reason (R):** "Four out of five dentists recommend Happy Glossy toothpaste."

**Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR), if any**
- In this argument, there doesn't seem to be an additional Proof of Reason (PR); the Reason itself is directly supporting the Proposition.

**Step 4: Analyze the Argument for Defects**
- The Reason (R) provided is: "Four out of five dentists recommend Happy Glossy toothpaste."
- This seems to be an assertion based on the opinion of a part of a particular group (dentists), but it extends this recommendation to assert the inherent quality of the toothpaste (it must be great).

Upon analysis, this argument seems to fall into the following defective argument category:

**Generalization (G):**
- The argument generalizes the opinion of four out of five dentists to claim that the toothpaste is great. However, this recommendation doesn’t conclusively prove the inherent quality of the toothpaste for everyone. This is an example of overgeneralizing based on a subset of a group.

Thus, the argument is classified as a:
- **<G> Generalization**

### Conclusion of IDAA:
The string "Four out of five dentists recommend Happy Glossy toothpaste. Therefore, it must be great." is classified as a **Generalization (G)**.
