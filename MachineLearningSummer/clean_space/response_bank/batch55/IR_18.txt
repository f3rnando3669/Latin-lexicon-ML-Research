For 
To apply IDAA to the given string "I am only slightly obese. That is perfectly normal here in America," we must first decompose the task of classifying the defective argument (IDA) into specific steps (D).

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
Examine the statement to identify what is being asserted or claimed.

Proposition (P): "I am only slightly obese."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Determine the causal basis or reason given to support the proposition.

Reason (R): "That is perfectly normal here in America."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Proposition and Reason
Assess whether the Proposition and Reason fall into any of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP).

#### a) Generalization (<G>)
Consider if the proposition is based on an inappropriate generalization.
- The proposition here is not a generalization, but a personal statement about the speaker's weight status.

#### b) Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
Determine if the proposition claims complete enumeration but misses pertinent possibilities.
- There is no enumeration involved in the statement.

#### c) Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
Check if the reason provided does not conclusively support the proposition.
- The reason given ("That is perfectly normal here in America") does not actually address the health status or acceptability of being obese. It touches on societal norms rather than a logical basis for validating personal health status. This could be considered inconclusive.

#### d) Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
Evaluate if the reason provided is not compelling for the proposition.
- The causal basis ("That is perfectly normal here in America") is weak as it merely states a societal observation without providing medical or health-related evidence to support that being slightly obese is inconsequential. This is also a candidate for this category.

#### e) Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
Check if the reason is simply a repetition of the proposition.
- The reason and the proposition contain different information; there is no direct repetition.

#### f) Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
Assess if the proof of reason is assumed based on universal agreement.
- The reason could be seen as suggesting normalcy due to assumed societal consensus, but it doesn't directly say it is "universally agreed upon." It implies it.

#### g) Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)
Determine if the reason can be taken in a different sense than intended.
- There is some ambiguity in what is "perfectly normal," but it generally aligns with societal norms rather than the speaker's intent being misinterpreted.

### Conclusion
The given argument can most fittingly be classified under:
- *Inconclusive Reason* (IR) because the reason provided does not conclusively support the proposition regarding the individual's health status.
- *Insufficient Causal Basis* (WCB) because the reason does not compellingly validate the health aspect of being "slightly obese," only commenting on societal norms.

Since both "Inconclusive Reason" (IR) and "Insufficient Causal Basis" (WCB) apply and may overlap slightly in this context, a primary classification choice must be made. Given that the reason provided is more about societal normalcy rather than health:

**Final Classification: Inconclusive Reason (IR)** 

This is the most fitting defective argument type for the given string.
