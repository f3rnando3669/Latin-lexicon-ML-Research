Sure, let's apply the process of <IDAA> to classify the given argument as one of the defective argument types.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
First, identify the main assertion or Proposition of the argument:
- "Allowing overnight guests in the dorm rooms will lead to nothing but trouble: promiscuity, teen pregnancy, and eventually, a bunch of unwed mothers on campus, trying to complete their degrees while raising a child."

**Proposition (<P>):** Allowing overnight guests in the dorm rooms will lead to nothing but trouble, including promiscuity, teen pregnancy, and unwed mothers on campus.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Next, identify the causal basis or Reason supporting the Proposition:
- The Reason appears to be implied in the sequence: promiscuity leading to teen pregnancy, which then leads to unwed mothers on campus.

**Reason (<R>):** The allowance of overnight guests will cause promiscuity, which will lead to teen pregnancy and result in unwed mothers trying to complete their degrees while raising a child.

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
Determine if there is any additional argument or evidence presented to corroborate the Reason. It appears there is no further evidence or additional corroborative argument provided.

### Step 4: Analyze for Defective Argument Types
We'll go through each defective argument type to see which one fits best.

**Generalization (<G>):** This argument could be a generalization if it assumes that allowing overnight guests will inevitably lead to the stated outcomes, without considering the variability in individual behavior and other moderating factors.
  
**Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This does not seem to be enumerating all possible outcomes but rather focusing on a specific negative chain of events.

**Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The Reason given does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition. It assumes a direct causal link between allowing guests and the stated negative outcomes without substantiation.

**Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This seems very fitting as the Reason provided (overnight guests causing promiscuity leading to teen pregnancy and unwed mothers) lacks a compelling causal basis. The claim presents a slippery slope fallacy without much evidence.

**Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The Reason does not merely repeat the Proposition.

**Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** There is no appeal to universal agreement here; it is more a causal claim without substantiation.

**Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The terms and language used are quite direct and not particularly ambiguous in their sense here.

### Conclusion: Classification
Based on the analysis, the defective argument type that fits best is:

**Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The Reason provided lacks a compelling causal basis. The argument assumes a slippery slope from allowing overnight guests to all the negative consequences without providing substantial evidence to back up this causal link.

Thus, the argument "Allowing overnight guests in the dorm rooms will lead to nothing but trouble: promiscuity, teen pregnancy, and eventually, a bunch of unwed mothers on campus, trying to complete their degrees while raising a child." can be classified as a **<WCB>** type defective argument.
