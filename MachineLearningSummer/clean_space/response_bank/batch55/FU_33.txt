Sure, we'll apply the IDAA procedure, which involves decomposing the task of classifying the defective argument into specific steps. Here's the step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\<P\>)
The Proposition (\<P\>) is the main statement or the intended belief to be established. 

In this case, the proposition is:
"If you were a true American you would support the rights of people to choose whatever vehicle they want."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\<R\>)
The Reason (\<R\>) is the causal basis for the proposition, providing justification or support.

In this case, the reason can be extracted as:
"True Americans support the rights of people to choose whatever vehicle they want."

### Step 3: Identify the nature of the argument (Is it defective?)
Now we need to figure out if the argument is defective and, if so, classify its type. We'll analyze the given statement to match it with one of the defective argument types (\<G\>, \<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<RR\>, \<WCB\>, \<FU\>, \<DEP\>).

1. **Generalization (\<G\>)**:
   - This would apply if the argument assumes that being a "true American" has certain attributes that apply universally without proper justification.
   - The statement implies a generalization that all true Americans support the rights to choose any vehicle, which might not be justified.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)**:
   - This would apply if the argument missed considering all possibilities.
   - This doesn't seem to directly apply.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**:
   - This applies if the reason doesn't conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
   - The claim about "true Americans" and vehicle choice is an assertion that doesn't necessarily follow from being a "true American," making the reason inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**:
   - If the causal basis for supporting the proposition is weak, this would apply.
   - The causal basis ("true American") doesn't strongly justify support for vehicle choices since being a "true American" doesn't inherently relate to vehicle choice.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)**:
   - This would be the case if the reason merely repeats the proposition in different words.
   - The argument does not simply restate itself.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)**:
   - This applies if the argument assumes it's universally agreed upon or that it is indisputable.
   - This doesn't seem to directly apply, as the argument doesn't appeal to universal consensus explicitly.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)**:
   - This occurs if the proof can be taken in another sense than intended.
   - "True American" could be ambiguous, but this is more about a weak causal relationship than taking the argument in different senses.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument
Based on the above analysis, the statement primarily exhibits the following defective argument types:
- **Generalization (\<G\>)**: It makes a broad generalization about what it means to be a "true American" without substantiating this claim.
- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**: The reason provided doesn't conclusively support the proposition because the connection between being a "true American" and supporting vehicle choice rights isn't inherently conclusive.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**: The reason provided does not strongly support the proposition, as the notion of being a "true American" doesn't directly relate to the specific viewpoint on vehicle choice.

#### Conclusion:
The given statement "If you were a true American you would support the rights of people to choose whatever vehicle they want" is primarily defective due to types **\<G\> Generalization**, **\<IR\> Inconclusive Reason**, and **\<WCB\> Insufficient Causal Basis**.
