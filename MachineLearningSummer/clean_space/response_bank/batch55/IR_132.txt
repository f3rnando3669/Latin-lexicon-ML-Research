To apply the decomposition method (IDAA) to the task of classifying the given argument string "Oprah Winfrey's diet advice is useless; she has had problems with maintaining her weight for most of her life, bouncing back and forth between being overweight and slender," we will follow the steps outlined below:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
The Proposition (P) is what the argument is intending to prove.

In this case, the proposition is:
- "Oprah Winfrey's diet advice is useless."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
The Reason (R) is the causal basis for the Proposition, which is supposed to establish the truth of what is being urged.

In this case, the reason given is:
- "She has had problems with maintaining her weight for most of her life, bouncing back and forth between being overweight and slender."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Reason <R>
Next, evaluate whether the Reason (R) effectively supports the Proposition (P). For a Reason to be conclusive, it must logically and effectively establish the Proposition.

In this case, we need to assess how well "having problems with maintaining weight" supports the assertion that her diet advice is useless.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type
Based on the definitions provided, we need to classify the defective argument type if the Reason (R) does not adequately support the Proposition (P).

- **Generalization (G)**: The Proposition applies a general trait based on insufficient evidence.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Assumes all possibilities are covered when they are not.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The Reason does not conclusively support the Proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Causal basis is weak or not compelling.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Reason restates the Proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assumes universal agreement falsely.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Uses ambiguous language leading to misinterpretation.

In this case, the Reason (R) "She has had problems with maintaining her weight" does not logically or conclusively demonstrate that "her diet advice is useless." This suggests that the Reason does not sufficiently or compellingly support the Proposition.

### Step 5: Conclusion - Classify the Argument
By applying the evaluation, the argument "Oprah Winfrey's diet advice is useless; she has had problems with maintaining her weight for most of her life, bouncing back and forth between being overweight and slender" seems to fall under:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The Reason (R) given does not conclusively establish the correctness of the Proposition (P).

Therefore, the classification of the argument string based on IDAA is **<IR>**.
