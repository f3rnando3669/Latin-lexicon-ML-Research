For 
To apply the decomposition of classifying the string (IDA) into specific steps (D), we'll break down the process to identify which defective argument is at play in the given statement "Everyone is getting tattoos in college, so you might as well do it too."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) in the statement:**
   - The statement suggests that the listener should get a tattoo too. Let's extract the proposition.
   - Proposition (<P>): "You might as well do it too."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>) supporting the Proposition:**
   - The statement provides a reason as to why the listener should get a tattoo.
   - Reason (<R>): "Everyone is getting tattoos in college."

3. **Evaluate the Type of Reason Provided:**
   - Here, we examine the nature of the reason to see if it's a strong, compelling reason that would logically support the proposition.

4. **Identify the Classification of the Defective Argument:**
   - Based on the structure of the statement and the nature of the reason provided, classify the type of defect in the argument.

### Application to "Everyone is getting tattoos in college, so you might as well do it too."

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition (<P>): "You might as well do it too."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason (<R>): "Everyone is getting tattoos in college."

3. **Evaluate the Type of Reason Provided:**
   - The reason provided is an assertion that what everyone else is doing should be a cause for you to do it as well. This is a type of reasoning that appeals to popular action or consensus.

4. **Identify the Classification of the Defective Argument:**

   - **Generalization (G)**: The statement does use a form of generalization by saying "everyone," but it leans more towards the influence of popular opinion rather than making an outright generalization.
   
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This doesn't seem to be the issue, as the statement doesn't attempt to enumerate possibilities.
   
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: While the reason may be seen as weak, it is not inherently inconclusive but rather aligns with another known faulty reasoning.
   
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis (doing something because everyone else is doing it) could be viewed as insufficient.
   
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason "everyone is doing it" is different from the proposition "you should do it too."
   
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This faulty argument fits well here since it relies on the idea that if "everyone" (an assumed consensus) is doing it, the listener should do it too. The consensus is presumed without proof.
   
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: There doesn't appear to be an ambiguous language issue here.

### Conclusion

The argument "Everyone is getting tattoos in college, so you might as well do it too" falls under the classification of **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**, where the argument assumes that a behavior is correct or desirable just because it is said to be universally practiced.

Thus, the string <s> "Everyone is getting tattoos in college, so you might as well do it too" is of type **<FU>**.
