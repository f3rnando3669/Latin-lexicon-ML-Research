To apply the task IDAA (which involves decomposing the task of classifying the argument type into specific steps), we need to identify the relevant properties of the given string and categorize it based on the defective argument types. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Identify and Understand the Proposition (P) and Reason (R) in the String:**
   - The given string is: "Conclude that because A happens then B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L… will inevitably happen."
   - Here, the proposition (P) seems to be an assertion that a series of events (B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L) will inevitably happen.
   - The reason (R) provided for this proposition is that A happens.

2. **Evaluate the Relation between Proposition (P) and Reason (R):**
   - Determine if the reason (R) sufficiently supports the proposition (P).
   - Analyze if there is a direct causal link between A happening and the inevitable occurrence of B, C, D, etc.

3. **Cross-Check with Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (G):** Check if the proposition is being made based on an unrepresentative sample or only a part of the scenario.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** See if there are other possibilities or outcomes that have not been considered in the enumeration of consequences.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Assess if the reason provided is insufficient to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Evaluate if the causal basis (R) for the proposition (P) is compelling.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Check if the reason simply restates the proposition in different words without adding new information.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Determine if the proof of reason relies on an assumed consensus that isn’t actually established.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** See if any terms used can be interpreted in multiple ways that might lead to misunderstanding the argument.

4. **Classify the Argument:**
   - Given the string "Conclude that because A happens then B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L… will inevitably happen," the argument suggests a domino effect without sufficient proof or reasoning.
   - It implies inevitability for multiple outcomes solely based on one event (A happening).

5. **Determine the Most Fitting Defective Argument Type:**
   - The assertion of inevitability based on a singular event without concrete evidence indicates that the reason (R) does not conclusively support the proposition (P).
   - The argument does not sufficiently demonstrate causation between A and the long list of events.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The most appropriate classification for this given string is **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, since the causal link provided (A happening leads to B, C, D, etc.) does not convincingly establish the correctness of the proposition that these events will inevitably happen.

**Final Result:** The provided string "Conclude that because A happens then B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L… will inevitably happen" is classified under the defective argument type **<IR>** for Inconclusive Reason.
