Sure, let's apply the method of decomposition (<D>) to the task of classifying a defective argument (<IDA>) for the given string. The process involves breaking down the classification task (<IDA>) into specific steps, as defined by <IDAA>.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Analysis

#### Step 1: Identify and Extract the Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), and Proof of Reason (<PR>)
1. **Proposition (<P>):**
   - The assertion or the thing to be proven.
   - In this case: "I'm gonna get an iPhone."

2. **Reason (<R>):**
   - The causal basis for the proposition.
   - Here: "because everybody else has an iPhone."

3. **Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Corroboration of the Reason, if any.
   - In this case: "and they're cool."

#### Step 2: Match the Identified Components to Defective Argument Types
1. **Check for Generalization (<G>):**
   - Is the proposition based on a majority or some parts but generalized to all?
   - Not applicable here.

2. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Does the argument claim a complete enumeration of possibilities and miss some pertinent ones?
   - Not applicable here.

3. **Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Does the reason given conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
   - The reason "because everybody else has an iPhone" does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of getting an iPhone.

4. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Is the causal basis for the proposition compelling or weak?
   - The causal basis "because everybody else has an iPhone" and "they're cool" are weak reasons for justifying the action.

5. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - Does the reason restate the proposition without adding new information?
   - Not applicable here.

6. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - Is a universally agreed upon issue used as proof for the reason?
   - The reason assumes that "everybody else" having an iPhone makes it right to get one, a form of assuming consensus on the coolness or correctness.

7. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - Can the proof of reason be taken in another sense than intended?
   - The phrase "they're cool" can have subjective interpretations, but not clearly ambiguous in this context.

#### Step 3: Classify (<s>)
- From the analysis above, the argument seems to primarily exhibit characteristics of the following defective argument types:
  - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reasons provided do not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
  - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The reasons "because everybody else has an iPhone" and "they're cool" are weak and not compelling.
  - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Assumption that getting an iPhone is justified because it is presumably "cool" and universally agreed upon by the majority.

Therefore, the string "I'm gonna get an iPhone because everybody else has an iPhone and they're cool." can be classified mainly under the defective argument types:
- **<IR>:** Inconclusive Reason
- **<WCB>:** Insufficient Causal Basis
- **<FU>:** Presumptuous Consensus

This completes the <IDAA> application.
