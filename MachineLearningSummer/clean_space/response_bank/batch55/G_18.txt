For 
To apply the task of IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types), we will break down the analysis of the given statement step by step.

### Given String:
"Don't ever gamble! Once you start, you won't be able to stop, and you'll end up bankrupt."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D):

1. **Identify and Extract the Proposition (P):**
    - First, identify the central claim of the statement.
    - Proposition (P): "Don't ever gamble!"

2. **Identify and Extract the Reason (R):**
    - Determine the reason given to support the proposition.
    - Reason (R): "Once you start, you won't be able to stop, and you'll end up bankrupt."

3. **Analyze the Reason (R) for Defects:**
    - Compare the reason against the definitions of the defective argument types to classify the defect.

4. **Classify the Statement (IDA):**
    - Determine which defective argument type best fits the given reason.

### Step 1: Identify and Extract the Proposition (P):
Proposition (P) in the statement: "Don't ever gamble!"

### Step 2: Identify and Extract the Reason (R):
Reason (R) in the statement: "Once you start, you won't be able to stop, and you'll end up bankrupt."

### Step 3: Analyze the Reason (R) for Defects:
- **Generalization (G):** Does the reason claim that what happens in some or most cases will happen in all cases?
    - Yes, the reason asserts that starting to gamble will inevitably lead to an inability to stop and bankruptcy for everyone who starts gambling.
   
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Is the reason based on an enumeration that overlooks other possibilities?
    - The statement doesn't provide a complete enumeration or list of other outcomes of gambling, such as controlled or recreational gambling.
   
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
    - The reason is not conclusive; while it presents a possible negative outcome, it does not conclusively prove that everyone who gambles will go bankrupt or be unable to stop.
   
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the causal basis weak or unconvincing?
    - The causal link between starting to gamble and eventual bankruptcy is not universally compelling or substantiated. Many people gamble without going bankrupt.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Does the reason merely restate the proposition without adding new information?
    - No, the reason does provide additional information beyond just restating the proposition.
   
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Is the reason based on an assumed consensus that is disputed?
    - The statement doesn't explicitly invoke a universal consensus, but implies a certain inevitability that isn't universally true.
   
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Is the reason ambiguous or capable of being interpreted in another way?
    - The language in the reason is not particularly ambiguous, though it is deterministic and absolute.

### Step 4: Classify the Statement (IDA):
The reason contains elements of overgeneralization and might also be viewed as weak due to insufficient causal basis or incompleteness:

- **Generalization (G):** The statement generalizes that everyone who starts gambling won't be able to stop and will go bankrupt.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis provided is not universally compelling.

Between these options, Generalization (G) seems the most fitting, as the argument attributes a universal outcome to an action based on partial evidence or assumptions.

### Final Classification:
Based on the analysis, the string "Don't ever gamble! Once you start, you won't be able to stop, and you'll end up bankrupt." is classified as a defective argument of type **Generalization (G)**.
