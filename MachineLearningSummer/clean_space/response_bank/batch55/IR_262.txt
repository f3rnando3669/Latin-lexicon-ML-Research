For 
To apply the process of **<IDAA>** (the decomposition of a classification task into specific steps) to determine what type of defective argument the string "Big deal! Lots of people cheat too." represents, let's follow these steps:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**
- The proposition (<P>) here seems to be implied rather than explicitly stated. However, based on the sentence, the implicit proposition is likely something like "Cheating is not a big deal."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**
- The reason (<R>) given for the proposition is "Lots of people cheat too."

**Step 3: Determine if the Reason (<R>) is Defective**
- We need to assess whether the given reason fits any of the defective argument types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

**Step 4: Match the Reason (<R>) to a Defective Argument Type**

- **Generalization (G)**: This occurs when an assertion is applied to all based on some part or the majority. In this case, claiming that "lots of people cheat" might be a form of overgeneralization; however, cheating being widespread doesn't directly imply cheating is morally acceptable.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This is when we claim a complete list of possibilities but miss pertinent ones. The reason here does not attempt to list possibilities, so it does not fit this category.
  
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This is when the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. The reason "lots of people cheat" does not truly address whether cheating is right or wrong or trivialize the act of cheating itself. Therefore, it could be considered inconclusive.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Insufficient causal basis is when the reason provided is weak and not compelling. The reason provided ("lots of people cheat") is weak in justifying why cheating should not be considered a big deal.
  
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This is when the reason simply repeats the proposition in other words. Here, the reason does not simply restate "cheating is not a big deal."
  
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This involves assuming a reason is valid because "it is universally agreed upon." The argument here does not rely on presumed universal agreement.
  
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: This occurs when the proof of reason can be taken in another sense than intended. The language here does not appear ambiguous.

**Step 5: Conclusion**
- The argument seems to fall under **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The reason provided does not conclusively justify the proposition nor provide a compelling causal basis for stating that cheating is not a big deal.

**Classification:**
- The argument "Big deal! Lots of people cheat too." can be classified as **<IR> Inconclusive Reason** and **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**.
