For 
Let's apply the IDAA to the given string: "Why must you always take such a stupid and uninformed approach to ethics?"

### Step 1: Decompose the Task (D)
The specific steps to decompose the task of <IDA> into actionable steps are:
1. **Identify the proposition (P)** - Determine the primary claim or assertion made by the string.
2. **Identify the reason (R)** - Look for the causal basis that supports the proposition.
3. **Identify the proof of reason (PR)** - Check for any additional argument that corroborates the reason.
4. **Classify into defective argument types** - Using the identified <P>, <R>, and <PR>, examine if the string fits into any of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step 2: Application to the Specific String (IDAA)
Let's break down the string and classify it based on the defined defective argument types.

#### Identify Proposition (P)
The string "Why must you always take such a stupid and uninformed approach to ethics?" implies the proposition (P) that:
- "You always take a stupid and uninformed approach to ethics."

#### Identify Reason (R)
The string does not explicitly offer a reason (R) for the proposition. The rhetorical question serves more as an accusation rather than providing a basis for why the proposition is true.

#### Identify Proof of Reason (PR)
Similarly, the string does not provide any proof of reason (PR). There is no additional argument given to corroborate the claim that the approach to ethics is "stupid and uninformed."

### Classification into Defective Argument Types
Based on the classification criteria:
1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - The use of "always" suggests a generalization that may not necessarily apply to all situations.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - No attempt at enumeration is made.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - No reason is given, so there is no inconclusive reason.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - No causal basis is presented, so there is no weak causal basis.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - There is no repetition of the proposition as a reason.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - There is no appeal to "universal agreement," so this does not apply.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
   - The language used, "stupid and uninformed approach," is somewhat ambiguous but this ambiguity is secondary to the generalization issue.

The dominant defective argument type among the options is the **Generalization (G)** due to the implication that the subject always takes a "stupid and uninformed" approach, which likely generalizes specific instances to all instances without sufficient basis.

### Conclusion
The string "Why must you always take such a stupid and uninformed approach to ethics?" is classified as **Generalization (G)** according to the IDAA framework.
