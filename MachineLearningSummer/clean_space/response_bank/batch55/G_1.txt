For 
Applying the IDAA process to the argument "Four out of five dentists recommend Happy Glossy Smiley toothpaste brand. Therefore, it must be great.", we proceed with the following steps to classify the argument type:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The proposition in this argument is: "Happy Glossy Smiley toothpaste brand must be great."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason given for this proposition is: "Four out of five dentists recommend Happy Glossy Smiley toothpaste brand."

3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - In this case, there is no additional corroboration or proof provided beyond the reason itself.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:**
   - We now need to check the provided argument types to determine which one best describes this argument. 

     - **Generalization (<G>):** This type involves applying a conclusion about some individuals to all. Here the argument is making a strong claim ("must be great") based on the recommendation of four out of five dentists, but not necessarily all dentists.
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This type involves omitting some possibilities. In this context, the argument does not seem to be listing possibilities but rather presenting a recommendation.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This is where the reason does not conclusively support the proposition. While "four out of five dentists recommend" the toothpaste, it does not necessarily mean it is objectively great for all individuals.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This involves a weak causal basis for the proposition. The causal link between the recommendation of dentists and the product being objectively "great" is weak.
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This would be if the reason repeats the proposition. Here, the reason and the proposition are distinct.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This involves assuming something is true because "it is universally agreed upon." The argument does not claim universal agreement but cites a high percentage of dentists.
     - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** This would involve the proof being taken in another sense. The language in the argument does not seem ambiguous.

After evaluating the details:

- **Generalization (<G>)** fits well because the argument generalizes the recommendation of four out of five dentists to mean the toothpaste is universally great without sufficient evidence for all scenarios.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** also applies because the recommendation of a subset of dentists does not necessarily prove the toothpasteâ€™s greatness.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** applies since the causal relationship being assumed (dentist recommendation -> product greatness) is not strong enough.

Given these points, the argument primarily fits the classification of **<G> (Generalization)**, but it also has aspects of **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** and **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.

Therefore, the defective argument type most prominently is **<G> (Generalization)**, with noted elements of <IR> and <WCB>.
