Certainly! Applying the decomposition process (D) to the task of classifying the string (IDA), we can follow these steps to classify the given argument:

### Step 1: Identify the components of the argument
Examine the given string and break it down to see if it includes a Proposition (P), Reason (R), or Proof of Reason (PR).

*Proposition (P)*: This should be the main statement or claim that is intended to be proved.
*Reason (R)*: This should give the causal basis for the proposition, explaining why the proposition holds true.
*Proof of Reason (PR)*: This should provide additional arguments to support the reason.

Given string: "My opponent suggests that lowering taxes will be a good idea -- this is coming from a woman who eats a pint of Ben and Jerry’s each night!"

- Proposition (P): "Lowering taxes will be a good idea" (implied as stated by the opponent)
- Reason (R): "This is coming from a woman who eats a pint of Ben and Jerry’s each night!"
- Proof of Reason (PR): Not directly present in this string.

### Step 2: Determine the type of defective argument
Analyze the identified components (P and R) to match one of the defective argument types:

- **Generalization (G)**: The argument is not generalized based on incomplete data.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: There's no claim of having covered all possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason given (consumption of ice cream) does not logically support or refute the proposition about lowering taxes; it's irrelevant.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal relationship between eating ice cream and lowering taxes is not even weakly implied.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason does not repeat the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There is no claim of consensus being used as proof.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language used is clear and not ambiguous.

### Step 3: Formulate conclusion
The reason given ("this is coming from a woman who eats a pint of Ben and Jerry's each night") does not logically follow to support the proposition about lowering taxes. It’s a type of argument where the reason does not prove or disprove the proposition because it’s based on irrelevant personal attack rather than a causal basis.

### Final Classification
The given string represents an instance of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, as the reason (eating ice cream) is irrelevant and does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness or incorrectness of the proposition (lowering taxes).

### IDAA Applied Conclusion
The string "My opponent suggests that lowering taxes will be a good idea -- this is coming from a woman who eats a pint of Ben and Jerry’s each night!" is classified as an instance of **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**.
