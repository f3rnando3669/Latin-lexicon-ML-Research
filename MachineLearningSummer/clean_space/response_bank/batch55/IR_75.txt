To apply IDAA to the given string, first we need to decompose IDA into specific steps and then apply those steps to classify the string systematically.

### Step-by-step Decomposition (D) of IDA:
1. **Identify the Propositions (<P>):** Determine the main claims made in the arguments.
2. **Identify the Reasons (<R>):** Determine the causal bases or reasons supporting the propositions.
3. **Identify any Proofs of Reason (<PR>):** Determine additional arguments used to corroborate the reasons.
4. **Evaluate for Defective Argument Types:** Check if any of the propositions, reasons, or proofs fall into the categories of defective arguments: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Applying this Decomposition to Analyze the String:

Given String:
```plaintext
Mom: Remember, dear. Nobody's going to buy the cow if they get the milk for free.
Daughter: You are only saying that because you are my mother.
Daughter: Wait... did you just call me a cow?
```

#### Step 1: Identify the Propositions (<P>):

1. **Mom's Proposition (P1):** 
   - "Nobody's going to buy the cow if they get the milk for free."

2. **Daughter's Propositions (P2 and P3):**
   - (P2) "You are only saying that because you are my mother."
   - (P3) "Did you just call me a cow?"

#### Step 2: Identify the Reasons (<R>):

1. **Reason for P1:**
   - This reason is implied and culturally grounded; it suggests that providing something for free devalues it to the extent that no one would invest in it.

2. **Reason for P2:**
   - The implied reason is that the mom is biased due to her maternal relationship.

3. **P3 is a question, not an argument with a reason.**

#### Step 3: Identify any Proofs of Reason (<PR>):

1. **PR for P1:**
   - There is no specific proof given for the reason behind P1 within the provided string.

2. **PR for P2:**
   - There is no additional corroborative argument provided for P2 within the string.

#### Step 4: Evaluate for Defective Argument Types:

1. **Analyze P1:**
   - **P1's Reason** could fall under <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) because it's an analogy that might not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. The saying may or may not apply universally to all scenarios.

2. **Analyze P2:**
   - **P2's Reason** might potentially be <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) because suggesting that the mother's statement is only due to her being a mother might not be a compelling enough reason to dismiss the proposition as biased.

3. **Analyze P3:**
   - **P3** might be considered under <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use), because the phrase about the cow and milk is colloquial and can be taken literally as an insult, which was likely not the intention of the speaker.

### Conclusion:
By following IDAA, we classify the original string as involving at least:
- **P1**: Potentially demonstrating <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
- **P2**: Potentially demonstrating <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
- **P3**: Potentially demonstrating <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use).

So, applying IDAA concludes that this argument contains elements of Inconclusive Reasoning, Insufficient Causal Basis, and Ambiguous Language Use.
