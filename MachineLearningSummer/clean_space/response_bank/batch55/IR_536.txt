For 
To apply IDAA (decomposition of the task IDA) to the given string "Why would you lend money to someone who looks like they don't have a job?", we need to follow a structured approach to classify the argument as one of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, or DEP). Here is the step-by-step decomposition and classification:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
**Proposition (P):** The statement implies that lending money to someone who appears unemployed is unjustified.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
**Reason (R):** The visual appearance of the person suggests that they are unemployed and, implicitly, unworthy of being lent money.

### Step 3: Analyze the Reason to Determine if It Conclusively Establishes the Proposition (P)
Examine if the reason provided conclusively supports the proposition. The reason relies heavily on the assumption that appearance is a reliable indicator of employment status and, by extension, one's credibility in repaying a loan.

### Step 4: Check for Indicative Signs of Defective Argument Types
We systematically assess if the argument falls into any defective argument categories.

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - The argument seems to assume that because this specific individual looks unemployed, all individuals who appear unemployed are a poor choice for lending money, which is a form of generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - Not necessarily applicable here since the argument isn't about listing possibilities or options.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - The appearance of someone does not conclusively establish their financial reliability or employment status. Itâ€™s based on a subjective judgment rather than concrete evidence.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - The causal link (visual unemployment suggesting unreliability) is weak. There is no compelling evidence that appearance is a reliable determinant of someone's ability to repay.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - The reason doesn't merely repeat the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - Not applicable here since there's no mention of universal agreement or consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - The language used ("looks like they don't have a job") is somewhat ambiguous and relies heavily on subjective interpretation, which can lead to different meanings.

### Step 5: Classify the Specific Defect
Based on the analysis:

- **Primarily, the argument qualifies as a Generalization (G):** It makes a broad assumption about a group based on the appearance of an individual.
- **The argument also fits Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The Reason (appearance) does not conclusively support the Proposition.
- **It can further be described as Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The Reason provided is not a strong causal basis for reaching the conclusion.

### Conclusion
The argument "Why would you lend money to someone who looks like they don't have a job?" fits primarily as a **Generalization (G)**, and also showcases elements of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
