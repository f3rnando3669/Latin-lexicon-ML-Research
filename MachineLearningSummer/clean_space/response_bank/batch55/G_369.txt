For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the argument type of the statement "I believe one should never deliberately hurt another person, that’s why I can never be a surgeon.", we need to decompose the task into specific steps and then systematically carry out each step. Here’s how we can do it:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for IDA Task:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>) in the Statement:**
   - **Proposition (<P>):** "I believe one should never deliberately hurt another person."
   - **Reason (<R>):** "that’s why I can never be a surgeon."

2. **Determine the Type of Defective Argument:**
   - Review definitions of each defective argument type.
   - Analyze the criteria for each type in relation to the given statement.

### Applying the Steps:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>) in the Statement:**

- **Proposition (<P>):** "I believe one should never deliberately hurt another person."
  - This is the core principle or assertion being presented.
  
- **Reason (<R>):** "that’s why I can never be a surgeon."
  - This explains the causal basis or reasoning behind the Proposition.

**Step 2: Determine the Type of Defective Argument:**

- **Generalization (G):** The statement does not attempt to generalize from a part to all.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The statement is not claiming a complete enumeration of possibilities.
  
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. Needs further analysis.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reason provided might not be a compelling one. Needs further analysis.
  
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason is not a mere repetition of the proposition.
  
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The statement does not assume something based on universal agreement.
  
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The statement does not involve ambiguous language.

### Further Analysis for <IR> and <WCB>:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
  - The reason "that’s why I can never be a surgeon" may not conclusively demonstrate that not becoming a surgeon is the only or necessary consequence of believing one should never deliberately hurt another person. It lacks consideration of the context of medical ethics, where surgeons do not intend to harm but to heal.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
  - The causal basis might be weak because the profession of a surgeon involves a professional context where the intention is not to hurt but to heal, suggesting that the causal link made in the reason might not be sufficiently strong.

### Conclusion:
The defective argument type for the given statement is best classified as **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. This is because the reason given ("that’s why I can never be a surgeon") is based on a principle, but it does not present a compelling rationale given the overarching goals and ethics in the surgical profession.

By following these steps, we have systematically decomposed the task and identified the most appropriate classification for the defective argument in the statement provided.
