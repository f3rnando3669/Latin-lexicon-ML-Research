For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string, "Last week, the Cowboys played the Texans in Houston. Mrs. Gibson was excited to go to the game because she is a huge Cowboys fan. Because everyone in Houston cheers for the Texans, Mrs. Gibson decided to cheer for the Texans too.", we perform a decomposition of the task of classifying it into specific steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition <D> of <IDA> Applied to the String

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**

    - **Step 1.1:** Read through the text to identify the main proposition or claim made.
    - **Step 1.2:** "Mrs. Gibson decided to cheer for the Texans too."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**

    - **Step 2.1:** Identify the reason given to support the proposition.
    - **Step 2.2:** "Because everyone in Houston cheers for the Texans"

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**

    - **Step 3.1:** Look for any additional arguments or proofs that support the reason.
    - **Step 3.2:** There are no additional arguments presented in the text to support the reason.

4. **Evaluate for Defective Arguments (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>)**

    - **Step 4.1:** Consider if the proposition is a generalization (<G>).
        - The proposition does not appear to be based on generalizing a specific part to a whole.
    - **Step 4.2:** Consider if the proposition involves an incomplete enumeration (<FE>).
        - The proposition does not present an enumeration of possibilities.
    - **Step 4.3:** Consider if the reason is inconclusive (<IR>).
        - Evaluate if "everyone in Houston cheers for the Texans" conclusively supports "Mrs. Gibson decided to cheer for the Texans."
        - This reason is not necessarily conclusive as it assumes uniform behavior among all individuals in Houston.
    - **Step 4.4:** Consider if the reason provides an insufficient causal basis (<WCB>).
        - The causal basis that everyone else cheers for the Texans may not be compelling enough as Mrs. Gibson might have personal allegiance to the Cowboys.
    - **Step 4.5:** Consider if the reason repeats the proposition (<RR>).
        - The reason does not repeat the proposition; it provides a different statement.
    - **Step 4.6:** Consider if the proof of reason assumes a presumptuous consensus (<FU>).
        - The reason assumes everyone in Houston cheers for the Texans without solid evidence. This fits with the presumptuous consensus.
    - **Step 4.7:** Consider if there might be ambiguous language usage (<DEP>).
        - The language used is straightforward without any ambiguity in terms of different possible interpretations.

Based on the decomposition steps, the defective argument type for the given string is <FU> â€” Presumptuous Consensus. This is because the reason assumes that "everyone in Houston cheers for the Texans," which is a sweeping generalization that implicitly purports consensus without evidence.
