For 
To apply IDAA to the statement "Two of my best friends are really introverted, shy people, and they both have cats. That leads to me believe that most cat lovers are really shy," we will decompose the task (t) into specific steps (D) to classify the given string (s) according to the types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>. Here's the step-by-step decomposition and classification:

### Step 1: Identify the components of the argument
- **Proposition (P):** "most cat lovers are really shy."
- **Reason (R):** "Two of my best friends are really introverted, shy people, and they both have cats."

### Step 2: Analyze the Reason (R) in relation to the Proposition (P)
- **Reason (R):** The basis for believing the proposition is the observation that two friends are shy and have cats.

### Step 3: Determine if the Reason (R) adequately supports the Proposition (P)

### Analysis:
- **Type <G> (Generalization):** The Reason is making a generalization based on a small sample (two friends).
    - **R:** "Two of my best friends are really introverted, shy people, and they both have cats."
    - **P:** "most cat lovers are really shy."
    - **Classification:** The Reason (R) is using the experience of just two people to generalize about most cat lovers.
    - This fits <G> because the assertion is generalized from a small, unrepresentative sample.

### Step 4: Rule out other defective types of arguments
- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):** Not applicable, as the enumeration claim is not a complete set, but an insufficient sample.
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** The argument might be inconclusive, but it is more specifically defective due to generalization.
- **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** The reason is not merely a repetition of the proposition.
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The causal link is weak, but the main issue is that it is a generalization from very few cases.
- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):** There is no claim of universal agreement in this statement.
- **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):** There is no ambiguous language in the proof reason.

### Conclusion:
The classified defective argument type is **<G> (Generalization)**.

### IDAA Applied Result:
The string "Two of my best friends are really introverted, shy people, and they both have cats. That leads to me believe that most cat lovers are really shy." is an example of a defective argument of type **<G> (Generalization)**.
