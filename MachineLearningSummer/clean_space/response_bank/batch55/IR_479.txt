For 
To apply the process of <IDAA> to the task of classifying the given string "or group in order to discredit an idea with which the person or group is associated; distracts the reader from the real issue" as one of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>), we need to decompose the task into specific steps for identification. Here is the step-by-step decomposition and application:

### Step 1: Understand the given string
The string provided is "or group in order to discredit an idea with which the person or group is associated; distracts the reader from the real issue."

#### Analysis:
- "or group in order to discredit an idea with which the person or group is associated": This part suggests attacking a person or a group to undermine their ideas.
- "distracts the reader from the real issue": This indicates a diversion from the primary argument or topic.

### Step 2: Match the string to defective argument types
Next, we need to compare the characteristics of the given string to the definitions of the defective argument types to find the best match.

#### Types and Characteristics:
- **<G> - Generalization**: Applying a characteristic of some individuals to all.
- **<FE> - Incomplete Enumeration**: Missing out on some pertinent possibilities.
- **<IR> - Inconclusive Reason**: Providing an insufficient reason for a proposition.
- **<RR> - Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: Repeating the proposition as the reason.
- **<WCB> - Insufficient Causal Basis**: Weak causal basis for the proposition.
- **<FU> - Presumptuous Consensus**: Assuming something is universally agreed upon without proof.
- **<DEP> - Ambiguous Language Use**: Using language that can be interpreted in another sense.

### Step 3: Identify features in the string and map to defective argument types
Evaluate the string for similarities to each defective argument type found in Step 2:

- The string involves a tactic of discrediting a person or group ("discredit an idea with which the person or group is associated") and consequently diverting attention ("distracts the reader from the real issue").

### Step 4: Determine the best fit based on identified features
The string aligns with "diverting attention" away from the real issue, suggesting it might not be addressing the argument itself but rather using a tactic to discredit something by association.

### Conclusion
Given the features of the given string, it is best classified as of type **<IR> - Inconclusive Reason**. This is because the string implies using a tactic to divert attention and discredit a person or group rather than providing a conclusive reason for or against the actual issue. The focus on discrediting and distraction suggests an insufficient reason for addressing the real argument at hand.
