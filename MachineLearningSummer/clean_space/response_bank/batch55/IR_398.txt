Sure, let's apply IDAA (the decomposition of IDA) to the given string "It is an outrage that the school wants to remove the vending machines. This is taking our freedom away!" step-by-step:

### Step 1: Understand and Identify the Proposition
First, identify the main proposition <P> of the argument. This is generally the claim or statement that the argument aims to support.

In the given string:
- **Proposition (P):** "It is an outrage that the school wants to remove the vending machines."
- **Further Assertion (R):** "This is taking our freedom away!"

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
Next, identify the causal basis or reason <R> given to support the proposition.

- Here, the causal basis given is: "This is taking our freedom away!"

### Step 3: Define Reasonable Proof <PR>
Often this step would involve identifying additional arguments or evidence that support <R>. In the string given, there is no additional argument or evidence provided to support the reason <R>.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument Type
Now classify the argument as one of the defective types described:
- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**

To classify:
- The reason "This is taking our freedom away!" does not strongly demonstrate why removing vending machines equates to taking away freedom. 
- It also seems to conflate a relatively minor decision (removing vending machines) with a significant concept (taking away freedom) without a detailed causal explanation.

### Step 5: Determine the Specific Defective Argument Type
Assess the nature of the reason and proposition based on the classifications:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis submitted for the proposition does not seem compelling.
  
The classification that best fits here is **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because the statement "This is taking our freedom away!" does not provide a compelling reason that strongly supports the proposition that removing vending machines is an outrage.

### Conclusion
Therefore, the given argument "It is an outrage that the school wants to remove the vending machines. This is taking our freedom away!" can be classified as <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
