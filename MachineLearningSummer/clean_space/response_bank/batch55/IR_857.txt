For 
To apply IDAA to the given string "But, Dad, I know you had no curfew when you were my age, so how can you give me a curfew?", we need to decompose the task into specific steps and classify the argument type according to the definitions provided. Below are the steps for IDAA:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
We start by identifying what the speaker intends to prove; this is the Proposition (\<P\>).

#### Proposition (P):
"But, Dad, I know you had no curfew when you were my age, so how can you give me a curfew?"

In simpler terms, the argument can be summarized as:
- The speaker argues they should not have a curfew because their father did not have one at the same age.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
Next, we determine the Reason (\<R\>) given to support the Proposition (\<P\>).

#### Reason (R):
"You had no curfew when you were my age."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
Now, we need to identify any Proof of Reason (\<PR\>) that corroborates the Reason (\<R\>\).

#### Proof of Reason (PR):
There is no additional argument provided that corroborates the Reason (\<R\>).

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
Using the definitions of the defective argument types (\<G\>, \<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<RR\>, \<WCB\>, \<FU\>, \<DEP\>), we classify the argument.

#### Analysis:
- The proposition relies on a comparison between the father's past experience and the current circumstances of the speaker.
- The Reason (R) is a historical fact about the father's experience.

Given these points, letâ€™s assess the likely defects:

- **Generalization (<G\>)**: The argument assumes that because the father did not have a curfew, the same should apply to the speaker without considering any contextual differences.
    - Implication is that one instance (father's past) is being applied to all similar cases (current situation).

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB\>)**: The Reason (R) that the father had no curfew does not necessarily provide a strong causal basis for why the speaker should not have a curfew.
    - The Reason does not compellingly justify the present situation.

#### Conclusion:
The argument primarily falls under **Generalization (<G\>)** since it overgeneralizes the father's past experience to the speaker's current situation without regard to other relevant factors or changes over time.

### Step 5: Summary
Applying IDAA to "But, Dad, I know you had no curfew when you were my age, so how can you give me a curfew?" leads to the classification of the argument as Generalization (\<G\>).

### Final Classification:
**<G>**
