To apply the decomposition of the task of classifying <s> into specific steps (IDAA) to the given argument, we need to follow a methodical approach. Below are the steps for IDAA:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of the Task (D)

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine the main assertion or claim being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the causal basis provided to support the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Determine any additional arguments that support the reason.
4. **Classify Defective Arguments**: Match the identified parts of the argument to the types of defective arguments.

### Apply the Steps to Classify <s> (IDA)

Let's break down the given conversation.

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
Dave's main proposition (claim) is that it is his duty to become a doctor: 
- **Proposition (<P>)**: "Therefore, it is my duty to become a doctor."

#### Step 2 & 3: Identify the Reason (<R>) and the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
Dave provides a reason for his claim based on family tradition:
- **Reason (<R>)**: "For five generations, the men in our family went to Stanford and became doctors, while the women got married and raised children."

He does not provide additional separate arguments to support his reason, thus a separate **Proof of Reason (<PR>)** is absent:
- **Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Not explicitly provided.

#### Step 4: Classify Defective Arguments
We need to evaluate the statements and identify if they fit into any categories of defective arguments:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Dave's argument is based on a generalization that "for five generations, men became doctors." He seems to imply that because this has been the tradition in the majority of cases, it's applicable to him too. However, this might not necessarily apply universally or to his own wishes and individual circumstances.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Dave does not consider all possibilities for his future or discuss alternative career paths. He fixates on one possibility - becoming a doctor, ignoring other paths (which Kaitlin hints at by asking, "Do you want to become a doctor?").

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided by Dave doesn't conclusively demonstrate that he must become a doctor; it merely shows a family trend without a compelling argument why he specifically must follow it.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis ("family tradition") is weak because it doesn't provide a compelling reason why the tradition should determine Dave's personal career choice.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Not present in Daveâ€™s argument. He doesn't repeat the proposition as a reason.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Not present in the statements. There is no reliance on disputable consensus or belief.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Not present in the statements. The language used is clear and unambiguous.

Based on this analysis, the primary defective arguments present in Dave's reasoning are:

- **Generalization (<G>)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**

### Conclusion
Dave's argument exemplifies several types of defective arguments, most notably **Generalization (G)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
