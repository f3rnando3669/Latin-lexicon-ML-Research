For 
To apply IDAA (which involves decomposing IDA into specific steps) to the sentence "(Ignoring the Question): when a rebuttal doesn't address the question," we'll follow a step-by-step approach. Let's start by identifying the steps necessary to classify the string into one of the defective argument types.

1. **Understand the Definition of Each Defective Argument Type**:
    - **G (Generalization)**: Proposition based on some or a majority but not applicable to all.
    - **FE (Incomplete Enumeration)**: Proposition claims complete enumeration of possibilities but misses some.
    - **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**: Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.
    - **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: Weak Reason where the causal basis submitted for the Proposition is not compelling.
    - **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: Reason is weak when it merely repeats the Proposition.
    - **FU (Presumptuous Consensus)**: Proof of Reason presumed certain based on “universal agreement,” which is disputable.
    - **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use)**: Proof of Reason can be taken in another sense than intended.

2. **Identify the Components of the Given String**:
    - **s**: "(Ignoring the Question): when a rebuttal doesn't address the question."

3. **Analyze the Content of s**:
    - The phrase "Ignoring the Question" implies that the rebuttal (Reason or Proof of Reason) does not address the Proposition directly.
    - "When a rebuttal doesn't address the question" suggests that the rebuttal provided is not related to the actual Proposition.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**:
    - **G (Generalization)**: Not applicable as it doesn't involve generalizing from some to all.
    - **FE (Incomplete Enumeration)**: Not applicable as it’s not claiming complete enumeration.
    - **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**: This could be a possibility if the reason provided does not substantially address the Proposition.
    - **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: This could be considered if the rebuttal provided is a weak causal link.
    - **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: Not applicable, the rebuttal seems different, just off-topic.
    - **FU (Presumptuous Consensus)**: Not applicable as it doesn't rely on a presumed consensus.
    - **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use)**: Not applicable, it's clear but off-topic.

5. **Determine the Most Fitting Defective Argument Type**:
    - Given the analysis, a rebuttal that doesn't address the question most closely aligns with **IR** (Inconclusive Reason), because the provided Reason (rebuttal) fails to address the Proposition directly, thus not conclusively demonstrating the correctness or incorrectness of the Proposition.

**Conclusion**:
The given string "(Ignoring the Question): when a rebuttal doesn't address the question" is classified as **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**.
