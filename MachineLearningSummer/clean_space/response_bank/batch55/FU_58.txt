For 
Sure, let's apply IDAA to evaluate the argument "Everybody is late coming back from lunch, so it shouldn't matter if I'm late."

1. **Identify** the <P>, <R>, and <PR>:
   - **Proposition (<P>)**: "It shouldn't matter if I'm late."
   - **Reason (<R>)**: "Everybody is late coming back from lunch."

2. **Determine** if the identified <P> and <R> adhere to the structure of a complete argument:
   - Check if the Reason (<R>) provides a causal basis for the Proposition (<P>).
   - In this case, <P> is being justified using <R>: "Everybody is late coming back from lunch" is used to support "It shouldn't matter if I'm late."

3. **Classify** the argument using the definitions of defective argument types:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: Is <P> a broad assertion based on part or majority but not necessarily all?
     - No, <P> is speaking only about the speaker, not a broader population.
   
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Does <P> miss out on some pertinent possibilities?
     - No, <P> is not an enumeration of possibilities.
   
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Does <R> fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of <P>?
     - Yes, saying "Everybody is late coming back from lunch" doesn't conclusively demonstrate "it shouldn't matter if I'm late." The reason given does not have a direct link to the propositionâ€™s correctness or validity.
   
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Is the causal basis submitted for the <P> weak?
     - Yes, the reason provided ("Everyone is late") does not strongly support the proposition ("It shouldn't matter if I'm late"). The mere fact that others are late does not justify the individual being late in a compelling manner.
   
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Does <R> simply repeat <P> using different words?
     - No, <R> and <P> are distinct claims.
   
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Is <PR> assumed as certain due to it being "universally agreed upon"?
     - No, <PR> is not reliant upon a supposed universal agreement.
   
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Is there ambiguous language that could be taken differently than intended?
     - No, the language used in the argument is clear and not ambiguous.

4. **Select** the most fitting defective argument types:
   - The most fitting defective argument types are <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).

In conclusion, the argument "Everybody is late coming back from lunch, so it shouldn't matter if I'm late" is primarily classified under <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
