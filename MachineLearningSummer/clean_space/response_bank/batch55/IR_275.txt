For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to the string "Why should merely cracking down on terrorism help to stop it, when that method hasn't worked in any other country?", we follow the steps for \( \text{D} \) in the context of \( \text{IDA} \).

### Decomposition of Task \( \text{IDA} \) (i.e., \( \text{D} \)):

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( \text{P} \)) within the string.**
2. **Identify the Reason (\( \text{R} \)) associated with the Proposition (\( \text{P} \)).**
3. **Attempt to correlate the Reason (\( \text{R} \)) with the Proposition (\( \text{P} \)) as a Proof of Reason (\( \text{PR} \)).**
4. **Classify the argument based on the identified defective argument types (\( \text{G} \), \( \text{FE} \), \( \text{IR} \), \( \text{RR} \), \( \text{WCB} \), \( \text{FU} \), \( \text{DEP} \)).**
5. **Analyze and finalize the classification by matching the argument structure to the definitions of defect types.**

### Step-by-Step Application:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\( \text{P} \))

In the string, the Proposition (\( \text{P} \)) is:
- "Cracking down on terrorism helps to stop it."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\( \text{R} \))

The Reason (\( \text{R} \)) attempting to support the Proposition is:
- "That method hasn't worked in any other country."

#### Step 3: Correlate the Reason (\( \text{R} \)) with the Proposition (\( \text{P} \)) to identify the Proof of Reason (\( \text{PR} \))

Here, the Proof of Reason (\( \text{PR} \)) suggests:
- Cracking down on terrorism should generally lead to its mitigation, but this has not been observed in practice in other countries.

#### Step 4: Classify the argument based on identified structures:

- **Generalization (\( \text{G} \)):** No, the argument isn't making a claim based on a single instance or small group and applying it to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\( \text{FE} \)):** Yes, the argument is claiming implicitly that all relevant cases of cracking down on terrorism have been considered, but it may overlook some pertinent cases.
- **Inconclusive Reason (\( \text{IR} \)):** Yes, the argument might be seen as failing to conclusively prove that cracking down on terrorism will be ineffective everywhere because such a conclusion isn't definitively supported by current evidence.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( \text{RR} \)):** No, the Reason doesn't merely restate the Proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( \text{WCB} \)):** Yes, the Reason might be seen as weak because the causal basis (i.e., other countries' failures) doesn't necessarily compel one to believe the same will happen in all other scenarios.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (\( \text{FU} \)):** No, the argument does not rely on presumed universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (\( \text{DEP} \)):** No, the argument doesn't hinge on ambiguous language.

#### Step 5: Finalize the classification:

After analyzing, the argument string most closely matches three defect types: \( \text{FE} \) (Incomplete Enumeration), \( \text{IR} \) (Inconclusive Reason), and \( \text{WCB} \) (Insufficient Causal Basis), with a stronger alignment toward Incomplete Enumeration and Insufficient Causal Basis.

### Conclusion:

Applying \( \text{IDAA} \) to "Why should merely cracking down on terrorism help to stop it, when that method hasn't worked in any other country?" leads to classifying it as primarily:
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\( \text{FE} \))**: It implies a completeness of evidence that is not justified.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( \text{WCB} \))**: It provides a weak causal connection from other countries' failures to the universal claim.

Thus, the string reflects mainly \(\text{FE}\) and \(\text{WCB}\) defective argument types.
