For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition and detailed application of the task of classifying a defective argument), we need to follow a step-by-step strategy to identify any defects in the argument "We should abolish the death penalty. Even Judge Judy is opposed to it." 

Here's the breakdown of the process:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - "We should abolish the death penalty."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - "Even Judge Judy is opposed to it."

3. **Determine the Type of Defective Argument by Analyzing the Reason (R):**
   - Check for each type of defective argument to see if it fits.

4. **Check for Generalization (G):**
   - Does the argument over-generalize based on insufficient evidence? 
   - No, the argument does not generalize from one or a few instances to all instances.

5. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - Does the argument claim to enumerate all possibilities but miss some pertinent ones?
   - No, it doesn't enumerate possibilities.

6. **Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
   - "Even Judge Judy is opposed to it" doesn’t conclusively demonstrate why the death penalty should be abolished. It relies on an authority’s opinion rather than proving the point with factual or logical evidence.

7. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - Is the causal basis weak or not compelling?
   - While related, insufficient causality is more about weak connections between cause and effect, which is not strictly the case here.

8. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - Does the reason just restate the proposition?
   - No, it presents an additional point, but not a restatement of the proposition.

9. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - Is the proof of reason assumed to be certain just because it’s widely agreed upon?
   - No, it does not claim universal agreement, just an individual's opinion.

10. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - Is the reason ambiguous, leading to possible misinterpretation?
   - No, the language is clear but not ambiguous.

Therefore, the argument "We should abolish the death penalty. Even Judge Judy is opposed to it" most closely fits the defective argument type <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), because the reason given does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. The statement relies on appeal to authority, which is not a strong causal basis, thereby making the reason inconclusive.
