For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "Andanar is unfit for the position because he seems unqualified for it," we need to follow the decomposition process to classify the defective argument within the string. Here are the steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Review the statement to find the proposition. A proposition sets forth what we intend to prove.
   - In the given string, the proposition is "Andanar is unfit for the position".

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Identify the causal basis for the proposition that establishes the truth of what is being urged.
   - In the given string, the reason is "because he seems unqualified for it".

3. **Check for Defective Argument Types:**
   - Determine if the reason (R) has any of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP).

4. **Classification:**
   - Evaluate the reason to figure out which defective argument applies.
   - The reason "he seems unqualified for it" is essentially a restatement of the assertion "he is unfit for the position". There is no additional causal basis provided; the reason simply repeats the claim in slightly different words.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the evaluation, classify the defective argument type.

Taking it step by step:

- **Step 1:** The proposition (P) is "Andanar is unfit for the position".
- **Step 2:** The reason (R) is "because he seems unqualified for it".
- **Step 3 and 4:** These steps check the reason against the defective argument types:
  - **Generalization (G):** Not relevant since it doesn't involve overgeneralizing.
  - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable as there is no enumeration.
  - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Partially applicable since the reason does not add conclusive evidence.
  - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Potentially relevant as the causality provided is weak.
  - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The most relevant since the reason repeats the proposition.
  - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Not applicable as there is no consensus mentioned.
  - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Not applicable as there is no ambiguity in language.

**Step 5: Conclusion:**
- The argument "Andanar is unfit for the position because he seems unqualified for it" is classified as <RR>, Faulty Repetition of Proposition. The reason provided does not add new information or causal basis but merely repeats the proposition in different terms.

By following these steps, we determine that the defective argument type for the given string is <RR>.
