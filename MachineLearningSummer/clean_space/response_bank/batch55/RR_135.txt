For 
To apply the process IDAA (decomposition of the task IDA into specific steps) to the statement "Nike's are great because they're awesome," we'll systematically break down the classification task as follows:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>):**
   - **Proposition (<P>):** "Nike's are great."
   - **Reason (<R>):** "because they're awesome."

2. **Evaluate the Reasoning: Does <R> effectively establish the truth of <P>?**

3. **Classify based on defective arguments types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** Is the proposition based on insufficient data but applied to all?
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Does the proposition claim completeness but misses critical parts?
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Does the reason fail to conclusively support the proposition?
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Is the causal basis provided weak?
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Is the Reason just a restatement of the Proposition?
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Is there an assumption of universal agreement that is still in dispute?
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Is the language ambiguous or can it be misinterpreted?

4. **Examine the details for each type to classify the argument:**
   - Let's analyze each type one by one:
     - **<G>:** This doesn't seem to be about generalizing from insufficient data to a general statement.
     - **<FE>:** This doesn’t involve claiming a complete set of possibilities and missing out on some.
     - **<IR>:** This might be relevant, but let’s hold off for a moment.
     - **<WCB>:** Is the reason "because they're awesome" compelling? Not necessarily, it’s very subjective.
     - **<RR>:** The reason "because they're awesome" says essentially the same thing as the proposition "Nike's are great" without adding new information or evidence.
     - **<FU>:** The argument does not assume a universal consensus.
     - **<DEP>:** The term "awesome" here is subjective but not necessarily ambiguous.

5. **Make a determination based on the best matching defective argument type:**
   - The most fitting classification is **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**, because the Reason simply restates, in other terms, what the Proposition is claiming without providing new evidence or compelling causal basis.

**Therefore, the argument "Nike's are great because they're awesome" is an example of a defective argument type <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).**
