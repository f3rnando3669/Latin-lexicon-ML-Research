Alright, let's apply the decomposition of the task IDAA (decomposing the task of classifying into steps) to the given statement:

Statement: "How can you tell me I should exercise to lose weight? All you do is sit behind a desk all day. I've never seen you do a lick of exercise."

Step 1: Understand and extract the components of the argument.
- Proposition (P): "You should exercise to lose weight."
- Reason (R): The speaker is discrediting the advice based on the behavior of the person giving the advice.
- Proof of Reason (PR): The statement made to support the Reason is "All you do is sit behind a desk all day."

Step 2: Identify the type of defective argument.
- Since the argument is questioning the authority or credibility of the advice based on the behavior of the person giving it (ad hominem), we need to assess which defective argument this falls under.

Step 3: Compare with defined defective argument types.
- Generalization (G): Does not fit because the argument does not involve applying something true for a part to the whole.
- Incomplete Enumeration (FE): Does not fit as this argument is not about missing pertinent possibilities.
- Inconclusive Reason (IR): Fits as the reason given doesn't conclusively address the proposition's truth about exercising and weight loss.
- Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB): Partially fits as the reasoning (behavior of the adviser) is not a compelling causal basis for the proposition.
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR): Does not fit as the reason does not just repeat the proposition.
- Presumptuous Consensus (FU): Does not fit since there is no appeal to universal agreement.
- Ambiguous Language Use (DEP): Does not fit as there is no ambiguous language use detected in the argument.

Step 4: Select the most fitting defective argument type.
- The argument seems to most closely fit the definitions of Inconclusive Reason (IR) and Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB) because:
   - Inconclusive Reason (IR): The reason ("All you do is sit behind a desk all day") is inconclusive concerning the proposition about exercise and weight loss.
   - Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB): The behavior of the adviser is not a strong, compelling basis to reject the exercise advice.

Therefore:

Based on the steps, "How can you tell me I should exercise to lose weight? All you do is sit behind a desk all day. I've never seen you do a lick of exercise." most closely demonstrates the defective arguments of type <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis). More precisely, because the argument focuses on discrediting the source rather than addressing the validity of the exercise advice, it is labeled as <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
