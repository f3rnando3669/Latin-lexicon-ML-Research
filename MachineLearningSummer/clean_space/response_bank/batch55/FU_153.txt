For 
To apply the procedure <IDAA> to the task of classifying the argument "“Everyone else is doing it, so should you”" into one of the defective argument categories, we need to follow a systematic decomposition process. Here are the steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition <P>:**
   - The claim being made here is "you should do it."

2. **Identify the Reason <R>:**
   - The reason given is "because everyone else is doing it."

3. **Analyze the Reason <R> for Defects:**
   - Check if the reason is a generalization (*<G>*): It doesn't generalize to all from some or a majority.
   - Check if the reason involves incomplete enumeration (*<FE>*): It doesn't claim completeness of possibilities.
   - Check if the reason is inconclusive (*<IR>*): This could be an avenue of interest; whether the fact that others are doing it conclusively demonstrates that "you should do it."
   - Check if the reason involves insufficient causal basis (*<WCB>*): The reason seems weak because "everyone else is doing it" might not be a compelling basis for the claim.
   - Check if the reason is a faulty repetition (*<RR>*): The reason doesn't repeat the proposition in the same terms.
   - Check if the reason involves presumptuous consensus (*<FU>*): It relies on the consensus of "everyone else is doing it", which presumes universal agreement on an action.
   - Check if the reason involves ambiguous language use (*<DEP>*): The language is clear and not ambiguous.

4. **Evaluate Specific Steps:**
   - Given the reasons above (particularly inconclusive reason and insufficient causal basis), further inspect <IR> and <WCB>.
   - <IR> involves examining if the reason logically supports the proposition: "Everyone else is doing it" does not provide a conclusive reason why you specifically should do it.
   - <WCB> focuses on the strength of the causal basis: The reason presented is not compelling; just because others are doing it doesn't necessarily imply you should too.

5. **Final Classification:**
   - From the steps discussed, the argument "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" most closely aligns with <WCB>:
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis**: The reason provided ("everyone else is doing it") is not a compelling enough reason to establish the proposition ("so should you").

Thus, the argument "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" is classified as:
```<WCB>```
