For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given sentence, we need to decompose the task of classifying the defective argument into specific steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The main assertion or claim being made.
   
2. **Determine the Reason (<R>):**
   - The causal basis provided for the Proposition.

3. **Analyze the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Any additional arguments presented to support the Reason.

4. **Compare and Contrast with Defective Arguments:**
   - Check the identified <P>, <R>, and <PR> against the types of defective arguments <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

5. **Classify the Defective Argument (<IDA>):**
   - Assign the argument to one of the defective argument types based on the analysis.

### Step-by-Step Application:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- Proposition: "They immediately banned all people from Abu Dhabi from entering the hospital."

#### Step 2: Determine the Reason (<R>)
- Reason: "The Omani hospital tested three patients from Abu Dhabi and found they had the disease."

#### Step 3: Analyze the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- In this case, there is no further Proof of Reason presented. The Reason itself is just given as the causal basis for the Proposition.

#### Step 4: Compare and Contrast with Defective Arguments
- We need to determine if the Reason provided adequately supports the Proposition and if there are any faults based on the provided types of defective arguments.

#### Step 5: Classify the Defective Argument (<IDA>)

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The proposition here generalizes the finding based on testing only three patients from Abu Dhabi to all people from Abu Dhabi. This is indeed an assertion based on some one part or a minority, not necessarily applicable to all.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Not applicable here, as the argument doesn't claim to list all possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - It can be argued the Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of banning all people from Abu Dhabi.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The Reason does not provide a compelling causal basis for the Proposition. Testing just three patients is not strong enough evidence to ban all individuals from a large area.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - Not applicable here, as the Reason does provide new information rather than repeating the Proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - Not applicable since there is no mention of universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - Not applicable here, as the PR is not taken in another sense than intended.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the argument is best classified as a **Generalization (<G>)**. The Proposition "They immediately banned all people from Abu Dhabi from entering the hospital" generalizes from the data of only three patients.

Therefore, the classification <IDA> for the string "The Omani hospital tested three patients from Abu Dhabi and found they had the disease. They immediately banned all people from Abu Dhabi from entering the hospital." is <G>.
