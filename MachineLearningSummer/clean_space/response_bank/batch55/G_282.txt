For 
To apply the process of <IDAA> to the task of classifying the given string "Never be kind and generous to the poor. They’ll come to expect your help always and never learn to contribute to society." into one of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>), we will decompose the task into specific steps and follow them sequentially. Here is the step-by-step decomposition:

### Decomposition Steps for <IDA>:
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine what the main assertion or claim is in the argument.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Find the causal basis provided for the Proposition.

3. **Analyze the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Check if there are any additional arguments that support the Reason.

4. **Classify the Argument:**
   - Based on the definitions of defective argument types, decide which type applies to the given argument.

### Step-by-Step Application to the Argument:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The main assertion in the string is: "Never be kind and generous to the poor."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason given for this assertion is: "They’ll come to expect your help always and never learn to contribute to society."

3. **Analyze the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - In this case, there doesn't seem to be any additional evidence or arguments provided to support the Reason. The Reason given stands without additional backing.

4. **Classify the Argument:**
   - Let's evaluate the Reason and see whether it fits any of the defective argument categories:
     - **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument may not apply since it doesn’t clearly assert a generalization based on a part or a majority applied to all.
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This isn't claiming a complete list of possibilities.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Yes, this could be a fit. The Reason provided ("They’ll come to expect your help always and never learn to contribute to society") does not conclusively prove the Proposition. It lacks clear evidence or connection.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This fits well. The causal basis (that kindness and generosity lead to perpetual dependence and lack of societal contribution) is not compelling or strongly supported.
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This is not the case here since the Reason is different from the Proposition.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This isn’t assuming universal agreement or consensus to support the Reason.
     - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The language is clear and specific in its intent.

Upon analyzing the argument, we find that the most fitting classifications are <IR> and <WCB>:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis provided for the Proposition is not compelling or well-supported.

### Conclusion:
The classification of the given argument string is:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**

These categorizations highlight the flaws in the reasoning and the weakness of the causal basis presented in the argument.
