For 
To apply \(\text{IDAA}\) to the string "It is ridiculous to have spent thousands of dollars to rescue two whales trapped in the ice. Why, look at all the people trapped in jobs they don't like," we need to decompose \(\text{IDA}\) into specific steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\(\text{P}\))
1. **Identify the main assertion or claim:**
   - The main assertion or claim in the string is: "It is ridiculous to have spent thousands of dollars to rescue two whales trapped in the ice."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\(\text{R}\))
1. **Identify the causal basis or reason set forth for the proposition:**
   - The reason given in the string is implied by the second sentence: "Why, look at all the people trapped in jobs they don't like."
   - The implied reasoning is that spending money on rescuing whales is less justified because many people are trapped in undesirable jobs.

### Step 3: Classify the defective argument type (\(\text{IDA}\))
1. **Compare the reason against the defined defective argument types:**
   - **Generalization (\(\text{G}\)):** The reasoning isn't asserting something about a whole based on a part.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (\(\text{FE}\)):** The reasoning doesn't enumerate possibilities and miss some.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (\(\text{IR}\)):** The reasoning doesn't conclusively support the propositionâ€”there isn't a direct causal link between people's job dissatisfaction and the spending on whale rescue.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(\text{WCB}\)):** The given reason doesn't provide a compelling causal link between the two different issues (whale rescue and job dissatisfaction).
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(\text{RR}\)):** The reason doesn't merely repeat the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (\(\text{FU}\)):** There is no assumed universal agreement in the given statement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (\(\text{DEP}\)):** There isn't ambiguity in the language usage.

### Step 4: Determine the most fitting defective argument classification
1. **Evaluate the type of defect:**
   - The reason provided ("people stuck in jobs they don't like") does not provide sufficient causal basis to label the expenditure on whale rescue as ridiculous.
   - The best match for the defect is the weakness or insufficiency of the causal basis.

Thus, the classification for the string is \(\text{WCB}\) (Insufficient Causal Basis).

### Conclusion
Applying \(\text{IDAA}\) to the string "It is ridiculous to have spent thousands of dollars to rescue two whales trapped in the ice. Why, look at all the people trapped in jobs they don't like," we've classified it as:

\[
\boxed{\text{WCB}}
\]
