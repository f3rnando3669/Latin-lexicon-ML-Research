For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "When a statement falsely claims or assumes an 'either / or' situation, when in fact there is at least one additional logically valid option, it is called...", we need to decompose the task of classifying the string into specific steps and then execute those steps.

Step 1: Understand the content and intent of the statement.
- The given statement describes a scenario where an argument falsely limits the situation to two options when there is at least one more valid option.

Step 2: Identify the core proposition <P> in the statement.
- The core proposition <P> is: "A statement that claims or assumes an 'either / or' situation, when in fact there is at least one additional logically valid option."

Step 3: Determine if the statement matches the definition of any defective argument types.
- Review the criteria for each defective argument type:
  - <G>: Generalization
  - <FE>: Incomplete Enumeration
  - <IR>: Inconclusive Reason
  - <RR>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition
  - <WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis
  - <FU>: Presumptuous Consensus
  - <DEP>: Ambiguous Language Use

Step 4: Evaluate if the given statement fits any of these defective argument types.

- **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement does not generalize from a part to the whole, so this type does not fit.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement talks about falsely assuming an 'either / or' without considering additional valid options, which fits well here. The argument is defective because it falsely claims to have made a complete enumeration of possibilities but omits some pertinent ones.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Not applicable as it does not discuss the conclusiveness of a reason.
  
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Not applicable as it does not repeat the proposition.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Not applicable as it does not discuss the sufficiency of a causal basis.
  
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Not applicable as it does not assume a consensus.
  
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Not applicable as the language is clear and unambiguous.

Step 5: Conclude the classification.
- The statement fits the definition of an **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** because it assumes that there are only two options when there are actually more, thus missing out on pertinent possibilities.

**Conclusion**: The string "When a statement falsely claims or assumes an 'either / or' situation, when in fact there is at least one additional logically valid option, it is called..." can be classified as type <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration).
