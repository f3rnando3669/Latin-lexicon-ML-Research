Sure, let's apply the process as outlined. The task <IDAA> involves decomposing the task <IDA> into specific steps to classify the given string "You can’t prove your candidate will win, so I assume he won’t."

### Step 1: Understand and Interpret the Argument
First, let's interpret the argument presented in the string:

- **Proposition (<P>)**: "Your candidate will win."
- **Reason (<R>)**: "You can’t prove it."

The argument essentially states that since proof cannot be provided for the candidate's win, it is assumed that the candidate will not win. 

### Step 2: Identify the Structure of the Argument
Here, the structure can be summarized as follows:

1. **Proposition**: The candidate will win (implicit in the speaker's assumption).
2. **Reason**: Lack of proof that the candidate will win.

### Step 3: Compare Against Defective Argument Types
Now we compare this structure against the types of defective arguments:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: Not applicable as it does not try to generalize from a part to a whole.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not applicable as it does not involve enumeration of possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This could be applicable, as the <R> ("You can’t prove it") does not actually provide a solid causal basis for concluding the candidate will not win.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This could also be applicable because the causal basis (lack of proof) does not necessarily support the conclusion regarding the candidate's win.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Not applicable. The <R> is not merely a repetition of <P>.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Not applicable here, there is no appeal to universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Not applicable as there is no ambiguous language in the presented context.

### Step 4: Determine the Most Fitting Defective Argument Type

Based on the above analysis, the most fitting defective argument types seem to be:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**

### Step 5: Final Classification
Among these, let's choose the one which fits best with the given context. "You can’t prove your candidate will win, so I assume he won’t," is weak primarily because the reason (lack of proof) is inconclusive and does not logically lead to the conclusion (he won’t win).

Thus, the classification of the argument "You can’t prove your candidate will win, so I assume he won’t," is:

**<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason)

By following these steps, we have decomposed the advanced task of classifying the given string into identifying its argument structure, comparing it against defined defective argument types, and making a reasoned judgment about which type it fits.
