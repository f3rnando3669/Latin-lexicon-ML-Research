For 
To apply IDAA (decomposition of the task of classifying the argument into specific steps), we can break down the task IDA (classifying the argument string for defective arguments) step by step. Here, we will classify the given string: "President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up. Jones is responsible for the rise in crime," and determine which type of defective argument it is.

Step-by-step decomposition:

### Step 1: Identify the components of the argument
- **Proposition (P):** Jones is responsible for the rise in crime.

### Step 2: Identify the reason (R) supporting the proposition
- **Reason (R):** President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up.

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
- In this argument, there isn't an explicit separate PR beyond the R.

### Step 4: Evaluate the reason (R) and the causal basis for its strength and completeness
Here we evaluate whether the reason provided (R) sufficiently supports the proposition (P).

### Step 5: Classify the argument based on identified components and evaluation
We review the types of defective arguments to find which one best fits the evaluation:

1. **Generalization (G):** The argument is not a generalization based on a small sample or majority.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument is not citing a supposedly complete list but missing elements.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** We should determine if R conclusively demonstrates P.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Check if the causal relationship established in R sufficiently supports P.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** R does not reiterate P.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument does not rely on assumed consensus.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)::** The language in R and P is clear, not ambiguous.

### Analysis:
- **Is R conclusive?** The fact that one event follows another (taxes were raised and then crime went up) does not on its own conclusively prove that the former caused the latter.
- **Does R provide a sufficient causal basis?** The argument suggests causality solely based on temporal succession without additional proof of a direct link between tax increase and crime rise, which constitutes weak causal reasoning.
  
### Conclusion:
The argument falls under **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because it lacks sufficient evidence to conclusively link the rise in crime directly to the action of raising taxes.

Thus, applying IDAA to the given argument classifies it as type <WCB>.
