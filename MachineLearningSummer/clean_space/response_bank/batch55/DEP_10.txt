For 
Let's take the advanced task \( t \) of classifying the string \( s \) "Every society is, of course, repressive to some extent – as Sigmund Freud pointed out, repression is the price we pay for civilization." according to the defective argument types \( G \), \( FE \), \( IR \), \( RR \), \( WCB \), \( FU \), and \( DEP \). We will decompose \( t \) into specific steps (\( D \)) and apply it step-by-step to achieve the classification. 

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (\( D \)):

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( P \))**: Determine what the string sets out to prove or claim.
2. **Identify the Reason (\( R \))**: Determine the causal basis or reason given for \( P \).
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\( PR \))**: Check if there is any additional argument that corroborates \( R \).
4. **Analyze potential defects**: Assess the defective argument types \( G \), \( FE \), \( IR \), \( WCB \), \( RR \), \( FU \), and \( DEP \) in relation to the identified \( P \), \( R \), and \( PR \).
5. **Classify the string \( s \)**: Assign the appropriate defective argument type(s) to \( s \).

### Application of \( IDAA \) to the Given String:

#### 1. Identify the Proposition (\( P \))
The string makes the claim:
- "Every society is, of course, repressive to some extent."

This is the proposition set forth summarily to be proven.

#### 2. Identify the Reason (\( R \))
The causal basis given for \( P \) is:
- "As Sigmund Freud pointed out, repression is the price we pay for civilization."

This statement is presented as a justification for the proposition.

#### 3. Identify the Proof of Reason (\( PR \))
There isn’t any additional argument in the string that further corroborates the reason. The \( R \) itself is based on an appeal to authority (Freud), but there isn't an additional proof provided here.

#### 4. Analyze Potential Defects
Now we examine if the string fits any of the defective argument types:

- **Generalization (\( G \))**: The proposition asserts a characteristic of all societies based on the idea that repression is a universal condition. Since it doesn’t specify if this is based on an observation of one, most, or all societies, it might be broadly generalizing.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (\( FE \))**: Not applicable here, as there is no enumeration of possibilities attempting to be complete.

- **Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \))**: The reason provided hinges on Freud's assertion. The string assumes Freud’s statement conclusively demonstrates the correctness of \( P \), but that itself may be disputable or inconclusive.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \))**: The reason provided ("repression is the price we pay for civilization") might be argued to not compellingly or sufficiently explain why "every society is repressive." It relies on the authority of Freud but lacks a deep causal analysis.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( RR \))**: Unauthorized repetitions are not present. The reason and proposition are not the same statement.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (\( FU \))**: The string implies universal validity of Freud's statement without presenting it as universally accepted, so this does not strictly apply.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (\( DEP \))**: There’s no clear use of ambiguous language that could be interpreted in another sense than intended.

#### 5. Classify the String \( s \)
Based on the analysis above, the string most strongly fits two defective argument types:

- **Generalization (\( G \))**: The proposition generalizes about "every society" without backing the universality of the claim.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \))**: The causal basis provided (Freud's assertion) may not compellingly or sufficiently support the proposition that all societies are repressive.

### Final Classification
The string "Every society is, of course, repressive to some extent – as Sigmund Freud pointed out, repression is the price we pay for civilization." can be classified as both:

- \( G \) (Generalization)
- \( WCB \) (Insufficient Causal Basis)
