To apply the advanced task of classifying the given string into one of the defective argument types using a step-by-step decomposition approach, let's break down the IDAA task:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
First, we need to find the main claim or assertion in the statement.

**Proposition**: 
"We have to stop the tuition increase!"

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Next, we should identify the reasoning or causal basis provided to support the proposition.

**Reason**:
"The next thing you know, they'll be charging $40,000 a semester!"

### Step 3: Evaluate the Argument Types
Now, we will assess whether the identified argument falls into any of the known defective argument types.

### Step 4: Compare with Defective Argument Types Definitions
1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Involves making a broad assertion based on limited data.
   - The statement does not appear to broadly generalize from a single instance or a non-representative sample. 

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Claims complete enumeration of possibilities but misses pertinent ones.
   - The statement does not involve discussing a complete list of possible outcomes or alternatives.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
   - The reason provided is speculative ("The next thing you know"), suggesting a slippery slope argument, which does not conclusively establish that tuition will indeed reach $40,000 a semester.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reason lacks a compelling causal basis.
   - There is no strong causal basis linking the current tuition increase to an eventual charge of $40,000. The statement is speculative and assumes an inevitable drastic rise. 

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The reason merely restates the proposition.
   - The reason given does not simply restate the proposition but introduces a speculative outcome.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Assumes something is certain because it is "universally agreed upon."
   - The argument does not rely on the notion of a universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Argument can be taken in another sense than intended.
   - The language of the statement is clear in its intent and concern, not ambiguous.

### Step 5: Concluding the Classification
Comparing the statement against the identified defective argument types, the most appropriate classifications would be:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason, "The next thing you know, they'll be charging $40,000 a semester!" does not conclusively prove the need to stop the tuition increase.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reason presented ("they'll be charging $40,000 a semester!") lacks a compelling causal basis and is highly speculative.

Given these considerations, we can classify the statement as involving both defective argument types **<IR>** and **<WCB>**.

---

### Summary
By applying IDAA to the given string, we have identified it contains both **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** argument defects.
