Applying the process of decomposition to identify the defective argument (IDAA) for the given string involves the following steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The first step is to pinpoint the central assertion or proposition that the argument is attempting to establish.

- **Proposition (P):** Dan blames himself for Joe being hit by a car because he made a negative comment during their argument.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The next step is to identify the reason or causal basis provided for the proposition.

- **Reason (R):** Dan believes that his negative words during the argument had a causal effect on Joe being hit by a car.

### Step 3: Check for Proof of Reason (PR)
Next, identify whether any additional arguments or evidence are presented to substantiate the reason.

- **Proof of Reason (PR):** No additional arguments or evidence are given; Dan's belief is based purely on a sense of guilt and emotional reasoning.

### Step 4: Analyze for Defective Argument Types
Now, we'll analyze the argument for potential defects. 

1. **Generalization (G):** Does the argument make a sweeping generalization not applicable to all instances?
   - No generalization is made. The argument is specific to Dan and Joe.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Does the argument miss out on other pertinent possibilities?
   - The argument overlooks other possible factors for Joe being hit by a car, such as traffic conditions or Joe's own behavior.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
   - The reason (Dan's comment) does not conclusively demonstrate a direct cause-effect relationship to Joe's accident.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the causal basis weak or not compelling?
   - Yes, the causal basis is weak. Dan's comment does not have a scientifically or logically compelling connection to the accident.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Does the reason merely repeat the proposition?
   - No repetition is apparent here. The reason provided is distinct from the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Is something assumed as certain without it being undisputed?
   - No, Dan does not appeal to a universal agreement to support his belief.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Can any part of the argument be interpreted differently than intended?
   - The argument is clear and doesn’t use ambiguous language.

### Step 5: Classify the String (s)
Based on the analysis above, the defects in the argument are:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Dan’s belief that his comment is the cause neglects other possible causes of the accident.
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal link between Dan’s comment and Joe’s accident is weak and not compelling.

### Conclusion
After decomposing and analyzing the argument, we classify "Siblings Dan and Joe had a serious argument, and Dan told Joe that he hated him and wished that he would get hit by a car. Two days later, Dan was told that Joe had been struck by a car. Dan blamed himself and thought that if he hadn’t made the comment during their fight, Joe would not have been hit." as containing defects of types:

- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**
