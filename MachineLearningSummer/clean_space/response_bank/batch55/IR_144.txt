For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument into specific steps) to the string "What she says about Kepler's astronomy theory of the 1600's must be just so much garbage. Do you realize she's only fifteen years old?" we need to break down the task of classification into specific steps. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step decomposition (D):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   Analyze the statement to locate the main assertion or claim.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   Determine the causal basis provided to support the Proposition.

3. **Evaluate the Reason (R):**
   Examine whether the Reason conclusively supports the Proposition, and identify any potential defects.

4. **Classify the Defect (IDA):**
   Assign the specific type of defective argument based on the analysis.

Let's apply these steps to the given string:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The main assertion or claim in the string can be identified as:
- "What she says about Kepler's astronomy theory of the 1600's must be just so much garbage."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The causal basis provided to support the proposition appears to be:
- "Do you realize she's only fifteen years old?"

### Step 3: Evaluate the Reason (R)
Analyze whether the Reason (R) is a valid and strong support for the Proposition (P):

- The relationship between being fifteen years old and the validity of her statements about Kepler's astronomy theory is not logically sound. The Reason (R) does not address the content or evidence of her statements but instead attacks her age.

### Step 4: Classify the Defect (IDA)
Classify the type of defective argument based on the evaluation:

- The Reason (R) provided does not directly challenge the validity of the statement about Kepler's theory. Instead, it diverts attention to the speaker's age. This kind of argument falls under the category where the Reason fails to conclusively establish the truth of the Proposition.

This pattern is known as a classic example of a **fallacy of personal attack (ad hominem)**. Given the definitions provided, this closest matches the defective argument type:
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** The Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.

### Conclusion
The string "What she says about Kepler's astronomy theory of the 1600's must be just so much garbage. Do you realize she's only fifteen years old?" is classified as an <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) because the causal basis (the speaker's age) does not conclusively establish the correctness or incorrectness of the criticism of Kepler's astronomy theory.
