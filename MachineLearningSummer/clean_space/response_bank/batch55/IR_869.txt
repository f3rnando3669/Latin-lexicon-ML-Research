Alright, let's apply the decomposition approach (IDAA) to classify the given string as one of the defective argument types defined earlier. We'll break this task down step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Statement

First, let's thoroughly read and understand the given statement:

"Sure, we haven't given raises to our employees in more than ten years. However, we do pride ourselves on providing customer service in over seven different languages."

### Step 2: Identify the Proposition (P) and Reason (R)

Next, we identify the core elements of the argument:
- **Proposition (P):** This is the assertion or claim.
- **Reason (R):** This is the causal basis or justification for the proposition.

In this statement:
- **P:** "We haven't given raises to our employees in more than ten years."
- **R:** "We do pride ourselves on providing customer service in over seven different languages."

### Step 3: Assess the Relationship Between P and R

Now, we need to determine if the Reason (R) logically supports the Proposition (P):
- The proposition is about the company's failure to give raises.
- The reason provided mentions the company's pride in providing customer service in seven different languages.

### Step 4: Determine the Type of Defective Argument

Next, we classify the given argument into one of the defective argument types:
- **Generalization (G):** Broad assertion not applicable to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Missing out on some possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Reason does not conclusively demonstrate correctness.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Weak cause for the proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Reason and Proposition are the same.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Assumed as universally agreed upon.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Ambiguity in language.

In this case:
- The Reason (R) ("We do pride ourselves on providing customer service in over seven different languages") does not logically support or explain the Proposition (P) ("We haven't given raises to our employees in more than ten years"). There is no clear causal relationship between providing customer service in multiple languages and the failure to give raises.

Therefore, this argument suffers from an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, since the reason given does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness or relevance of the proposition.

### Step 5: Conclusion

We conclude that the statement "Sure, we haven't given raises to our employees in more than ten years. However, we do pride ourselves on providing customer service in over seven different languages." is an example of a defective argument of type **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
