For 
To apply IDAA (the application of the decomposition of a task into specific steps) to the task of classifying the given argument as one of the defective argument types, we can break it down systematically:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) for Identifying Defective Arguments (IDA)

#### Step 1: Understanding the Proposition (P)
First, identify the proposition Dana is making in her statement.

#### Step 2: Understanding the Reason (R)
Next, identify the reason Dana is providing to support her proposition.

#### Step 3: Determining the Proof of Reason (PR)
Identify any proof or evidence that Dana offers to strengthen her reason.

#### Step 4: Matching the Proposition, Reason, and Proof of Reason with Defective Arguments
Compare the identified proposition, reason, and proof within the framework of described defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP) to classify the string.

### Application of <IDAA> to the Argument

#### Step 1: Proposition (P)
Dana's proposition is:
"We must raise tuition to cover the cost of new books."

#### Step 2: Reason (R)
The reason Dana provides is:
"Otherwise the library will be forced to close."

#### Step 3: Proof of Reason (PR)
In this case, Dana does not provide any additional arguments or evidence, she implies the consequence directly.

#### Step 4: Matching with Defective Argument Types

1. **Generalization (G)**:
    - **Not applicable**. This does not generally refer a characteristic of one or a few to a whole.
    
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
    - **Not applicable**. This does not involve listing all possibilities and missing some.
    
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
    - **Possible match**. The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate that raising tuition is the only solution to prevent the library from closing.
    
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
    - **Possible match**. The reason provided does not appear to be a compelling, sufficient causal basis for the proposition.
    
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
    - **Not applicable**. The reason is not merely restating the proposition.
    
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
    - **Not applicable**. There is no suggestion that "it is universally agreed upon."
    
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
    - **Not applicable**. The language used is not ambiguous or open to multiple interpretations.

#### Conclusion:
Dana's argument falls under the defective argument type:
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

The reason given does not establish a sufficient and compelling causal relationship that raising tuition will prevent the library from closing. There could be other solutions or causes for the problem at hand.

Thus, the fallacy in the argument is an example of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
