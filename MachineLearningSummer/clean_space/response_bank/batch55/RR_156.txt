For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "I know that what I experience is real because I can see, hear, smell, touch and taste everything," we must first decompose the task of classifying the string (i.e., performing <IDA>) into specific steps. Let's break it down:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
Identify the main assertion or proposition within the given string.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
Determine the reasoning that is provided to support the main assertion or proposition.

### Step 3: Analyze the Argument
Evaluate if the argument provided suffers from any of the defined defective argument types (i.e., <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
Classify the argument according to the defective argument types if any defects are found.

### Application of Steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
**Proposition (P):** "I know that what I experience is real."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
**Reason (R):** "because I can see, hear, smell, touch, and taste everything."

### Step 3: Analyze the Argument
We need to evaluate if the given argument suffers from any defects based on the defined types:
- **Generalization (G):** The argument does not seem to overextend an observation about a subset to all cases.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument does not claim to enumerate all possibilities but rests on sensory experiences.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason provided (perception through senses) does not conclusively support the proposition of reality because sensory perceptions can be deceptive and subjective.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The sensory experiences are not a compelling basis for establishing objective reality.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason does not repeat the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The reason does not appeal to universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The terms used are not ambiguous in a way that changes the intended meaning.

The argument specifically appears to lean towards <IR> and <WCB>.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
Since the reason provided ("because I can see, hear, smell, touch, and taste everything") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition ("I know that what I experience is real") and does not provide a compelling causal basis, we can classify this argument as both <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).

### Conclusion:
The string "I know that what I experience is real because I can see, hear, smell, touch and taste everything" is best classified under the defective argument types:
- **<IR>:** Inconclusive Reason
- **<WCB>:** Insufficient Causal Basis
