For 
To apply <IDAA> (which is the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as one of several defective argument types), we follow the specified steps and break it down methodically.

### Step-by-Step Application:

#### Step 1: Identify the Argument's Proposition (<P>)
Tasha's Proposition could be:
- **P: The tropical climate has the same temperature year-round, unlike the polar climate where temperatures differ greatly.**

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Tasha's Reason possibly is:
- **R: This difference is affected by factors such as how much solar energy each region receives throughout the year.**

#### Step 3: Analyze the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
There doesn't seem to be a clearly formulated Proof of Reason in the statement provided. We will have to consider that the original context might have included further discussion or examples, but letâ€™s proceed with the given information.

#### Step 4: Classify the Argument as Defective (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>)
To evaluate the classification of the argument, we'll check it against each defective argument type definitions:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The argument does not assert a generalization based on a limited group to the whole group. It simply points out a specific observed difference.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - It does not claim to have enumerated all possibilities, rather it states a specific comparative observation.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Without extra context, the reason might seem inconclusive because it doesn't fully explain the specifics of why solar energy distribution causes such differences in climate temperatures. But it's leaning closer to providing a rationale than some other forms of defective arguments.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - The reason provided does not simply repeat the proposition. It attempts to explain the cause (solar energy).

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The causal basis that different amounts of solar energy contribute to differing temperatures is a biologically known fact, but if the reasoning lacks specifics to fully support the argument, it could be seen as potentially weak.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - The reason is not justified by claiming universal agreement on the issue. 

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - There may be some ambiguity about what precisely results in these temperature differences, but it's not explicit in the phrasing presented.

Given that the argument lacks specific context and depth, the most prominent categorization would be:

#### Conclusion: 

The argument in the text provided most closely matches **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** -- because while Tasha hints at solar energy as a reason, there isn't sufficient depth to strongly establish this as an indisputable cause without further detail.

Therefore:
- The task <IDA> applied to the string results in: **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
