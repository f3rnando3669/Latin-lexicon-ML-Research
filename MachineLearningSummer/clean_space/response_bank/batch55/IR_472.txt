For 
To apply IDAA to the given string "I don't know about you, but I would never take the word of a woman who never finished school," we'll follow the outlined steps for decomposing and classifying the defective argument type. Here are the specific steps for decomposition (D) and the application (IDAA):

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) for IDAA:
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Extract the main claim or assertion.
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Determine the causal basis or justification provided for the proposition.
   
3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - Look for additional arguments supporting the reason.
   
4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**:
   - Determine which of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP) best matches the defects in the identified proposition, reason, or proof of reason.

### Application of IDAA to the Given String:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Proposition (P): "I would never take the word of a woman who never finished school."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Reason (R): The statement implies that the reason for not taking the woman's word seriously is because she never finished school.

3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - In this case, the statement does not present any additional arguments or evidence that further support the reason. There is no proof provided beyond the initial reason.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: The statement takes a specific characteristic (not finishing school) and generalizes its significance to the overall credibility of any woman. However, the statement doesn't extend this to all individuals universally.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement doesn't attempt to list possibilities, so this type doesn't apply.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason given (not finishing school) does not conclusively justify the proposition (discrediting the woman's word). There may be multiple reasons why someone might still be credible despite not finishing school.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal connection given (not finishing school) is weak and not compelling enough to universally discredit someone's word.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason is not a repetition of the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The statement does not rely on a consensus.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language used is not particularly ambiguous.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evaluation steps:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason (not finishing school) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (discrediting the woman's word).
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal link between not finishing school and the credibility of someoneâ€™s word is weak.

Therefore, the string most closely fits the type <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
