For 
To classify the given string "Either go to the party or spend the night in your room crying." using the defined defective argument types, we will decompose the advanced task <IDA> into specific steps, as defined in <IDAA>.

### Decomposition of <IDA> into Steps (<D>)

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
    - Determine the main assertion or statement that is being made.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
    - Determine the causal basis or reason provided to support the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
    - Look for any additional arguments that support the reason.

4. **Identify the Defective Argument Type**:
    - Classify the argument as one of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP> based on the definitions provided.

### Application of <IDAA> to the Given String

Let's break down the given string "Either go to the party or spend the night in your room crying." step by step:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
    - The proposition seems to be an implicit choice or warning.
    - In this case, it implies that not going to the party will result in spending the night crying.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
    - The reason presented is that not going to the party will lead to a negative emotional response (crying).

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
    - There is no additional argument provided to support the reason. The reason itself is taken at face value, with no further evidence or detail.

4. **Identify the Defective Argument Type**:
    - From the given definitions, the argument seems to fit the category of an <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration). The argument presents only two possibilities: either go to the party or end up crying in your room.
    - This overlooks other potential outcomes or activities that could be done instead of going to the party or crying.

By going through these steps, we see that the string "Either go to the party or spend the night in your room crying." is an example of the defective argument type <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration), as it incorrectly limits the possible outcomes to only two choices without considering other viable options.
