For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types) to the given string, we need to first break down the task into specific steps. Below is the detailed process:

1. **Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>) in the string.**
2. **Step 2: Determine if the Reason (<R>) provided supports the Proposition (<P>) effectively.**
3. **Step 3: Analyze the argument for specific defects by comparing it to each defective argument type (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).**

Let's apply these steps to the given string: "We should move to the Midwest because Mujtaba from the Wall Street Journal says the cost of living is cheaper there."

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>)

- Proposition (\( <P> \)): "We should move to the Midwest."
- Reason (\( <R> \)): "Mujtaba from the Wall Street Journal says the cost of living is cheaper there."

### Step 2: Determine if the Reason (<R>) supports the Proposition (<P>)

To evaluate if the Reason effectively supports the Proposition, consider:

- **Causal Basis:** Does citing Mujtaba's statement from the Wall Street Journal provide a strong causal basis for the claim that moving to the Midwest is a good idea?

### Step 3: Analyze the Argument for Specific Defects

We will now compare the Reason given to each defective argument type:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** Does the Reason generalize from insufficient data?
   - Not applicable directly. "Mujtaba" is cited specifically, not a generalized statement.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Does the Proposition claim completeness without covering all possibilities?
   - Not applicable directly. The statement doesn't enumerate possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Does the Reason fail to conclusively support the Proposition?
   - Applicable. The reason given ("Mujtaba...says cost of living is cheaper") may not conclusively demonstrate that moving to the Midwest is a good idea for everyone. There may be other factors to consider.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Does the Reason merely restate the Proposition?
   - Not applicable. The Reason provides different information (cost) rather than simply repeating "move to the Midwest."

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Does the Reason fail because the causal basis is weak?
   - Applicable. Mujtaba's statement might not be sufficiently persuasive as it relies on one person's claim without additional evidence. This could be considered insufficient causal basis.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Does the Proof of Reason wrongly assume universal agreement?
   - Not applicable here as there's no indication of assumed universal agreement in the Reason.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Can the Proof of Reason be interpreted in another sense than intended?
   - Not clearly applicable. The language seems straightforward without obvious ambiguity.

Given this thorough analysis, we can classify "We should move to the Midwest because Mujtaba from the Wall Street Journal says the cost of living is cheaper there." predominantly as a defective argument of type:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reason given is weak because it relies on the authority of a single source without presenting compelling evidence or addressing other potential factors that might influence the decision to move to the Midwest.

Thus, we have decomposed the task and identified the defective argument type as \( <WCB> \).
