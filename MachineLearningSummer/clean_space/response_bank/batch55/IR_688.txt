For 
Sure, I'll apply <IDAA> to the given statement: "Homosexuality is / ought to be morally wrong (moral property) because it is not normal (natural property). or Homosexuality is not normal (natural property); therefore, it is / ought to be morally wrong (moral property)."

**Step 1: Decomposition of <t> into specific steps (<D>) for the identification task <IDA>.**

1. **Extract Propositions and Components**: Identify the proposition (P), reason (R), and proof of reason (PR) in the given statement.
2. **Examine for Defective Argument Types**: Check each part (P, R, and PR) for possible defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

**Step 2: Apply Decomposition Steps**

1. **Extract Propositions and Components**:

   - **Proposition (<P>)**: "Homosexuality is / ought to be morally wrong (moral property)."
   - **Reason (<R>)**: "because it is not normal (natural property)."
   
2. **Examine for Defective Argument Types**:

   - **Generalization (<G>)**: Does the argument make a generalization that is not necessarily applicable to all individuals? 

     The statement does not seem to rely on a specific generalization of a subgroup to the whole group; it makes an overall claim about morality based on the notion of normality.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Does the argument fail to consider all possibilities? 

     The statement does not involve an enumeration of possibilities; it makes a direct causative link.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Does the reason provided conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition? 

     The reason "it is not normal" does not logically demonstrate that "it is/ought to be morally wrong.” There are numerous natural behaviors that are not morally wrong. This suggests an inconclusive reason, indicating an <IR> defect.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Is the causal basis weak? 

     The link between "not normal" and "morally wrong" is not compelling or logically sound, indicating a weak causal basis.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Does the reason merely repeat the proposition in different terms? 

     The reason introduces a new term “not normal” which is not a mere repetition of "morally wrong".

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Does the argument rely on a claim that it is universally agreed upon?

     The argument does not base its reason on a presumptive consensus.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Does the argument use language that can be taken in another sense?

     The term "normal" is subjective and can be interpreted in various ways—biologically normal, socially normal, or statistically normal. This ambiguity can lead to misinterpretation.

**Conclusion**:

The primary defective argument types present in the statement are:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason "because it is not normal" does not conclusively establish the moral proposition.
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The cause provided for the moral judgment is weak and unsubstantiated.
3. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The term "normal" is ambiguous and can be interpreted in different senses.

Therefore, by applying <IDAA> to the given statement, we identify the defective argument types as <IR>, <WCB>, and <DEP>.
