For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given phrase "Ninety percent of all people surveyed said that McDonalds is better than Burger King so it must be true.", we need to first decompose the task <IDA> into specific steps and then proceed step by step.

### Step 1: Understand and parse the string <s>

- **s**: "Ninety percent of all people surveyed said that McDonalds is better than Burger King so it must be true."

### Step 2: Identify the components of the argument

- **Proposition (P)**: McDonalds is better than Burger King.
- **Reason (R)**: Ninety percent of all people surveyed said so.

### Step 3: Examine and match the argument against the defective argument types

1. **Generalization (G)**: An assertion based on some individuals but applied to all.
   - The assertion is that McDonald's is better than Burger King based on a survey (some individuals).

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Claim of a complete enumeration, but missing some possibilities.
   - There's no enumeration of possibilities here.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason doesn't conclusively demonstrate the Proposition's correctness.
   - The reason provided (survey result) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the assertion.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis for the Proposition is not compelling.
   - The survey result is not a compelling causal basis for the assertion of one being better than the other.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The Reason is essentially a repetition of the Proposition.
   - This does not seem to be repeating the same point in different words.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assuming the correctness based on the assertion of universal agreement.
   - The assertion "so it must be true" based on "Ninety percent of all people surveyed" presumes a universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The Proof of Reason can be taken in another sense than intended.
   - There does not appear to be ambiguity in language use.

### Step 4: Classify the argument as one of the defective argument types

From the analysis above, the given argument mainly fits under:

- **G (Generalization)**: The argument assumes a general conclusion based on the survey of some individuals and applies it universally.
- **FU (Presumptuous Consensus)**: The argument asserts that it "must be true" based on a survey, presuming universal agreement to support the proposition.

### Conclusion

The phrase "Ninety percent of all people surveyed said that McDonalds is better than Burger King so it must be true." primarily represents the fallacies of **Generalization (G)** and **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**. Thus, the correct classification via <IDAA> would be:

- **G (Generalization)**
- **FU (Presumptuous Consensus)**
