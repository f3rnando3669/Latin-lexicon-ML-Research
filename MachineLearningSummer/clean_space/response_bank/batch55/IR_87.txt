To apply IDAA (the decomposition of IDA into specific steps) to the provided string, we need to classify the string according to the defective argument types defined earlier. For effective execution of IDAA, we can break down the process into the following steps:

### Step 1: Read and Understand the Proposition
First, carefully read and understand the proposition or the main assertion in the string.

- **String**: "I’m know Joe Bob’s my boss, but I’m not going to take orders from someone who can’t even dress professionally for work."

### Step 2: Identify the Parts of the Proposition
Identify the specific components (Proposition, Reason, and Potential Proof of Reason) within the string.

- **Proposition (P)**: "I’m not going to take orders from someone who can’t even dress professionally for work."
- **Reason (R)**: The reason given is that Joe Bob "can’t even dress professionally for work."
- **Implicit PR**: There doesn't appear to be an explicit Proof of Reason in this statement. It’s implied that the speaker believes dressing professionally is a necessary condition for giving orders.

### Step 3: Analyze the Reason
Check if the Reason logically supports the Proposition and if it could fit into any defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

### Step 4: Match Defective Argument Types
Compare the structure of the string against the definitions of defective argument types:

- **Generalization (G)**: This type isn’t applicable as the claim does not generalize based on a small or partial sample.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable, as there is no enumeration of possibilities in this argument.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Potentially applicable. The reason provided ("can’t even dress professionally for work") might not conclusively support the proposition of not taking orders, as dressing professionally might not be a necessary condition for giving orders.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Strongly applicable. The causal basis that dressing unprofessionally weakens the authority to give orders is weak and not compelling.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Not applicable. The statement provided does not simply restate the proposition as its reason.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Not applicable. No assumption is made about universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Not directly applicable. The language used is not ambiguous in a way that misleads the argument.

### Step 5: Conclude with Classification
Based on the analysis, identify the most fitting defective argument type(s).

- The most likely classifications for this defect are **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

Thus, applying IDAA step-by-step to the provided string, we find that it can be classified as an argument type **IR (Inconclusive Reason)** and **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**, with WCB being a stronger classification.
