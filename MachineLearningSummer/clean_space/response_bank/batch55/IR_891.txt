For 
To apply the process <IDAA> to the given statement "A commercial claims that a specific brand of cereal is the best way to start the day because athlete Michael Jordan says that it is what he eats every day for breakfast," we need to decompose the task into specific steps and then classify the argument into one of the defective argument types.

### Decomposition of <IDA>:
Step 1: Identify and extract the Proposition (<P>).
Step 2: Identify and extract the Reason (<R>).
Step 3: Evaluate the Reason (<R>) in the context of the Proposition (<P>) to determine any deficiencies.
Step 4: Classify the deficiencies according to the provided defective argument types.

### Applying <IDAA>:

#### Step 1: Identify and extract the Proposition (<P>).
The proposition (<P>) in the commercial is:
- "A specific brand of cereal is the best way to start the day."

#### Step 2: Identify and extract the Reason (<R>).
The reason (<R>) provided by the commercial is:
- "Athlete Michael Jordan says that it is what he eats every day for breakfast."

#### Step 3: Evaluate the Reason (<R>) in the context of the Proposition (<P>).
- The argument suggests that because Michael Jordan, a famous athlete, eats this cereal every day, it is the best way to start the day. 

#### Step 4: Classify the deficiencies according to the provided defective argument types.
- **Generalization (G)**: The argument attributes the personal preference of Michael Jordan to a universal claim without sufficient evidence that it applies to everyone.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable because there's no claim of exhaustiveness regarding all possible breakfast options.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason does not conclusively justify the proposition; Jordan's subjective preference does not universally validate the superiority or effectiveness of the cereal.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal link between Michael Jordan eating the cereal and it being the best choice for everyone is weak because the claim relies on celebrity endorsement rather than nutritional evidence.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Not applicable as the reason goes beyond merely repeating the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Not applicable as the argument does not claim universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Not applicable as the language use is straightforward and clear.

Considering the argument deficiencies identified, the given argument most closely aligns with:
- **Generalization (G)**: It takes an example (Michael Jordan's preference) and makes a broad assertion about the universal applicability.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The provided reason (Michael Jordan's endorsement) does not conclusively prove the proposition.

Thus, the argument can be classified as containing both:
- **Generalization (G)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
