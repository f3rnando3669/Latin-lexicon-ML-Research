Applying the decomposition approach of <IDAA> to the task of classifying the argument "Quinoa is a delicious, plant-based source of protein because it tastes so darn good." into one of the defective argument types requires breaking down the process into specific steps. Here's the step-by-step decomposition and analysis:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <D> for <IDA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Identify the main statement or claim that is intended to be proven.
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Identify the causal basis or reason given to support the proposition.
   
3. **Evaluate the Reason (<R>) in Relation to the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Assess whether the reason directly supports and conclusively proves the proposition.
   
4. **Classify the Argument Type:**
   - Determine if the argument falls into any of the defective argument types given (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Applying <D> to the Given Argument:

Let's analyze the statement "Quinoa is a delicious, plant-based source of protein because it tastes so darn good."

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition (<P>): "Quinoa is a delicious, plant-based source of protein."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason (<R>): "because it tastes so darn good."

3. **Evaluate the Reason (<R>) in Relation to the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The reason provided for why quinoa is a delicious, plant-based source of protein is that "it tastes so darn good."
   - This evaluation raises the question of whether the reason ("it tastes so darn good") logically supports the claim that quinoa is "a plant-based source of protein."

4. **Classify the Argument Type:**
   - The reason here is based on taste, which is a subjective quality related to deliciousness but not directly relevant to whether quinoa is a plant-based source of protein.
   - Therefore, the reason does not support the proposition in any substantial, causative manner, making the argument potentially defective.

### Classification:

The argument falls into the category of **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The causal basis for the proposition (the reason) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
  - In this case, the taste ("it tastes so darn good") does not conclusively establish that quinoa is a plant-based source of protein, even though it may support the idea that quinoa is delicious.

Hence, the argument "Quinoa is a delicious, plant-based source of protein because it tastes so darn good." should be classified as <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
