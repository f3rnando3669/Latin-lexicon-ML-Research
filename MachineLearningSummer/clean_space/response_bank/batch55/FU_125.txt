For 
To apply **IDAA (the application of task decomposition onto the task of classifying a string as a defective argument type)** to the given string "Ninety percent of all people surveyed said that McDonalds is better than Burger King so it must be true.", we first need to break down the task into specific steps. 

These steps will involve understanding the elements of the argument presented in the string and then determining which category of defective argument it falls into.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition: McDonalds is better than Burger King.
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason: Ninety percent of all people surveyed said so.
   
3. **Examine whether the Reason (<R>) conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Here, the argument is based on what a majority of surveyed people think.

4. **Evaluate for each type of defective argument:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):**
     - The argument might rely on a broad generalization based on survey results. Survey results often generalize opinions, but it doesn't mean it's necessarily applicable to all people.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
     - This doesn't directly apply since the argument isn't about enumerating possibilities completely or incompletely.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
     - The reason provided (survey results) doesn't conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition; opinions do not constitute factual proof.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
     - The reason might not provide a strong enough causal basis (it's based on opinions rather than objective criteria).
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
     - The reason isn't just repeating the proposition; it adds a new element (survey results).
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
     - This doesn't apply. The argument doesn't assume something is universally agreed upon without dispute.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
     - Nothing suggests ambiguity in the language use.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis:

- Primarily the argument is committing the **Generalization (G)** fallacy. It's generalizing the opinion of the surveyed group (which is only a subset, not the entirety of the population) to make a broad assertion about McDonald's being better than Burger King.

Therefore, "the phrase 'Ninety percent of all people surveyed said that McDonalds is better than Burger King so it must be true.'" represents the fallacy of **Generalization (<G>)**.
