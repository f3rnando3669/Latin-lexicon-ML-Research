For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as one of several defective argument types) to the given statement ("Let’s go buy the iPhone X in spite of the $999 price tag--all of our friends have one already!"), we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
The Proposition (<P>) is the summary of what is intended to be proven.

**Proposition (P):** We should buy the iPhone X despite its $999 price tag.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
The Reason (<R>) sets forth the causal basis for <P>.

**Reason (R):** All of our friends have one.

### Step 3: Examine Additional Elements of the Argument 
If the argument has further elaboration or proof of reason, they should be identified here, but in this instance, none are explicitly stated.

### Step 4: Analyze the Argument for Defective Types

#### Generalization (G)
- **Definition:** <P> is an assertion based on some one part or on a majority of individuals, but it is referred to all.
- **Analysis:** This doesn't apply since the argument doesn't generalize a property from a few instances to everyone universally.

#### Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
- **Definition:** <P> is defective when we claim to have made a complete enumeration of the possibilities, but actually miss out on some pertinent ones.
- **Analysis:** This doesn’t apply as the argument isn’t based on an enumeration of possibilities.

#### Inconclusive Reason (IR)
- **Definition:** <R> does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of <P>.
- **Analysis:** While having all friends owning an iPhone may not be a compelling reason to justify a $999 purchase, this issue closely matches the concept of faulty logic but still needs further refinement of a matching category.

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
- **Definition:** A <R> is weak if the causal basis which it submits for the <P> is not a compelling one.
- **Analysis:** The reason ("all of our friends have one") isn’t a compelling enough reason to justify the decision to buy an iPhone X. This is a weak causal basis.

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
- **Definition:** A <R> is weak if it says precisely the same thing as was stated in the <P>.
- **Analysis:** The reason doesn’t merely restate the proposition.

#### Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
- **Definition:** A <PR> is assumed as certain, on the ground that "it is universally agreed upon," a thing which is still in dispute.
- **Analysis:** This does not apply since the argument here does not claim "universal agreement."

#### Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)
- **Definition:** A <PR> can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended.
- **Analysis:** This does not have ambiguity in terms of language use.

### Step 5: Conclude with Classification
The argument "Let’s go buy the iPhone X in spite of the $999 price tag--all of our friends have one already!" suffers from a **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)** because the reason given (friends owning the iPhone) is not a compelling justification for the proposed action (buying an expensive iPhone X). 

Thus, the string can be classified as **<WCB>**.
