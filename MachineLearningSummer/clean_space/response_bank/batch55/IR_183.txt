For 
To apply the advanced task decomposition (D) to the task of classifying the argument type (IDA) for the string "Falsely requiring an opponent to “disprove” instead of you “proving” your argument," we will follow a step-by-step approach. Here is the breakdown:

### Step 1: Identify the elements of a complete argument in the given string
- **Proposition (P)**: What is being asserted?
- **Reason (R)**: What is the justification provided for the assertion?
- **Proof of Reason (PR)**: Is there any additional argument provided to corroborate the reason?

**Observation**: The string appears to describe a faulty reasoning technique rather than laying out an actual argument with P, R, and PR components. 

### Step 2: Analyze the nature of the flaw in the reasoning
- **Generalization (G)**: Is the assertion incorrectly applied to all cases based on a subset?
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Does the argument overlook some possibilities?
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Does the reason fail to demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Is the reasoning not compelling?
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Does the reason repeat the proposition in different words?
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Does the argument presuppose unanimous agreement on a disputed matter?
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Is there ambiguity that leads to misinterpretation?

### Step 3: Compare the identified flaw with the definitions of defective arguments
The string "Falsely requiring an opponent to 'disprove' instead of you 'proving' your argument" describes a scenario where the onus of proof is improperly shifted. This is a common logical fallacy known as "shifting the burden of proof."

### Step 4: Match the flaw to the specific types of defective arguments defined
1. **Generalization (G)**: Not applicable since it's not about extrapolating a specific case to generality.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable as it doesn't involve missing possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Relevant, as the flaw involves an expectation of demonstrating the correctness which is inconclusive.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Relevant, since expecting the opponent to disprove without providing a compelling reason yourself implies a weak causal basis.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Not applicable since the reason isn't just repeating the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Not applicable since there’s no assumption about universal agreement.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Not applicable as there’s no indication of language ambiguity.

### Step 5: Conclude with the classification
The argument is primarily characterized by **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. However, it most closely relates to **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** since the core issue is failing to demonstrate the correctness of the proposition by improperly shifting the burden of proof.

### Final Classification
The string "Falsely requiring an opponent to 'disprove' instead of you 'proving' your argument" should be classified as **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**.

### Summary:
In this detailed decomposition, we have analyzed and classified the given string by following a systematic approach to identify the nature of the flaw in reasoning and match it with the defined types of defective arguments.
