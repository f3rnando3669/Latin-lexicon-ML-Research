For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposition to the classification task) to the statement "You can tell that guy's Mexican - he's wearing a sombrero," we need to break down the classification task (IDA) into specific steps and work through them systematically. Here is a step-by-step decomposition:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The Proposition (<P>) is the assertion that forms the basis of the argument. In this case:
**P:** "That guy's Mexican."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The Reason (<R>) provides the causal basis for the Proposition. In this case:
**R:** "He's wearing a sombrero."

### Step 3: Determine the type of defective argument
Now, we need to analyze the argument to see if it fits into one of the defective argument types defined earlier. Let's review them to find the best match for this case.

- **Generalization (<G>):** Does the argument take an attribute of a part (or majority) and incorrectly apply it to the whole group?
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Does the argument claim a complete list of possibilities but miss some out?
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Does the Reason not conclusively demonstrate the Proposition?
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Is the causal basis for the Reason not compelling?
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Does the Reason merely restate the Proposition?
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Is the Proof of Reason assumed certain because it is "universally agreed upon"?
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Is the Proof of Reason ambiguous or interpretable in a different way than intended?

### Step 4: Evaluate the argument against each defective type
- **Generalization (<G>):** The argument takes the observation that the person is wearing a sombrero, which may be commonly associated with Mexicans, and generalizes it to claim that the person must be Mexican.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This does not apply here as there is no list or enumeration involved.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Although related, the main issue seems to be more about generalizing from a stereotype rather than merely having a weak Reason.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal basis (wearing a sombrero) is weak because it is not a compelling reason to conclude that someone is Mexican.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The Reason is not a mere repetition of the Proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** There is no appeal to a universally agreed-upon idea.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The language is not ambiguous in a way that a Proof of Reason could be taken differently.

### Step 5: Conclude the classification
The most fitting type of defective argument for "You can tell that guy's Mexican - he's wearing a sombrero" appears to be a combination of:

- **Generalization (<G>):** The argument incorrectly generalizes from the observation of wearing a sombrero, implying that this one attribute is sufficient to categorize someone as Mexican.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The Reason given (wearing a sombrero) is not a compelling causal basis for concluding that the person is Mexican.

### Conclusion
Primarily, the argument is an instance of **Generalization (<G>)** because it takes a specific attribute (wearing a sombrero) and incorrectly generalizes it to the entire group (being Mexican). There is also an element of **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**, but the primary classification in this context is **<G>**.
