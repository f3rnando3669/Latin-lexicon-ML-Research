To apply the IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types) to the string "You visit a new country and the first person you meet in the airport is rude. You send a message to a friend back home that everyone in this new country is rude," let's follow the decomposition steps systematically:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - The assertion being made here is that "everyone in this new country is rude."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - The causal basis for the assertion is that "the first person you meet in the airport is rude."

3. **Classify any Defective Arguments:**
   Based on the definitions provided for the defective argument types:
   
   - **Generalization (G):** 
     - This occurs when an assertion is based on some part or majority but not necessarily applicable to all.
     - In this case, the string "You visit a new country and the first person you meet in the airport is rude. You send a message to a friend back home that everyone in this new country is rude," generalizes the rudeness of one person to the entire population of the country.
     
     Since the string meets the criteria of making a broad assertion based on the behavior of a single individual, it fits the definition of a Generalization (G).

We conclude that the string "You visit a new country and the first person you meet in the airport is rude. You send a message to a friend back home that everyone in this new country is rude" is classified as a defective argument type <G> (Generalization).
