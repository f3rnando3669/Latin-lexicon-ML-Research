For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the IDA task into specific steps) to the statement "Believing that the cause of the Reformation was simply Martin Luther posting his theses," we need to follow a structured approach to classify this statement into one of the defective argument types: G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, or DEP. Here's the step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
Identify the main proposition (assertion) that the statement is making.

**Proposition <P>:** "The cause of the Reformation was simply Martin Luther posting his theses."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
Identify the causal basis or reason provided to support the proposition.

**Reason <R>:** Implicit in the statement is the reason that Luther's posting of his theses directly and solely caused the Reformation.

### Step 3: Evaluate the Reason for Validity
Determine if the reason given (<R>) sufficiently supports the proposition (<P>).

### Step 4: Check for Defective Argument Types
Examine the defective argument types and determine which, if any, may apply to the statement based on its structure, reasoning, and evidentiary support.

#### Analysis:

1. **Generalization (G):** Does the proposition make an unfounded generalization based on an insufficient sample?
    - No, this type seems inapplicable because the statement is specific about the cause.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Does the proposition assume a complete enumeration of possibilities but actually misses pertinent ones?
    - Yes, this seems to apply. The statement simplifies the cause of the Reformation to a single event (Luther posting his theses), neglecting other contributing factors (e.g., political, economic, cultural factors).

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the proposition?
    - This could apply if the reason provided is not enough to fully substantiate the statement that the Reformation was simply due to the theses. 

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the causal basis weak or not compelling?
    - This may apply because attributing such a complex historical event to one single cause does not appear compelling enough.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Does the reason repeat the proposition in different words?
    - No, the reason does not repeat the proposition verbatim.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Does it assume something as certain because it is universally agreed upon, despite it being in dispute?
    - No, the statement does not rely on a presumptuous consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Can the proof be taken in another sense than what was intended?
    - No, the language in the statement does not appear ambiguous in context.

### Conclusion:
After evaluating the statement with the listed defective argument types, it is determined that **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** are applicable. The statement simplifies the cause of a very complex historical event to a single individual action, missing other significant contributing factors and presenting an insufficient causal basis.

Therefore, applying IDAA to the statement "Believing that the cause of the Reformation was simply Martin Luther posting his theses," it is classified as:
- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**

Both classifications highlight the simplification and inadequacy in attributing the Reformation to a single cause without acknowledging other significant causes.
