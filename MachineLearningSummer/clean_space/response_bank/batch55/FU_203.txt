For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string, "In the court trial deliberations, Juror Seven says, 'There are still eleven of us who think he's guilty. You're alone.' His attempt to use numbers to persuade Eight is:", we begin by breaking down the task of classifying the argument into specific steps. Let's proceed step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Context and Proposition
First, comprehend the context and identify the proposition (<P>).

**Context:** A court trial deliberation where Juror Seven appeals to the number of jurors who think the defendant is guilty in an attempt to persuade Juror Eight.

**Proposition (<P>):** The defendant is guilty.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason
Identify the reason (<R>) given to support the proposition.

**Reason (<R>):** Eleven out of twelve jurors believe the defendant is guilty.

### Step 3: Analyze the Proof of Reason
Determine if any proof of reason (<PR>) is provided to support the reason.

In this case, Juror Seven does not provide additional arguments or proof beyond the appeal to the majority opinion, so there is no specific <PR> given.

### Step 4: Identify Potential Defective Arguments
Now, classify the defective argument based on the definitions provided:

#### <G>: Generalization
- The argument does not appear to generalize from one part or a majority to all individuals in a broader context.

#### <FE>: Incomplete Enumeration
- No claim to provide a complete list of possibilities is made.

#### <IR>: Inconclusive Reason
- The reason alone does not necessarily demonstrate the correctness of the proposition because consensus does not equal truth.

#### <RR>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition
- The reason is not merely a repetition of the proposition in disguise.

#### <WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis
- The basis provided (majority opinion) is not necessarily compelling evidence of the proposition’s truth.

#### <FU>: Presumptuous Consensus
- The argument leverages the idea of “it is universally agreed upon.” This fits because it implies that the majority's opinion should be accepted as conclusive without further proof.

#### <DEP>: Ambiguous Language Use
- There is no indication of ambiguity in the language used by Juror Seven.

### Step 5: Classification
Given the analysis above, the argument is classified as:

**<FU>: Presumptuous Consensus** - because it relies on the notion that the majority’s belief should be accepted as truth, without addressing the actual merits of the case.

**Conclusion:** The attempt by Juror Seven to persuade Eight by citing the numbers falls into the category of <FU>: Presumptuous Consensus.
