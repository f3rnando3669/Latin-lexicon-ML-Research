For 
To apply IDAA to the given string "Everyone is against child pornography. I asked Mrs. Smith and Mr. Jones at the PTA meeting and they are definitely against it.", we first need to decompose the task (IDA) of classifying the string into the steps required for classification. The steps might include analysis of the proposition, the reason, the proof, and the identification of any defective argument pattern. Here's how we can decompose and apply IDAA step-by-step:

### Decomposition of IDA into Steps (D):
1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine what the argument is intending to prove.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Identify the causal basis provided for the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**: Determine any additional arguments supporting the reason.
4. **Analyze for Defective Argument Patterns**: Check the argument against the definitions of defective argument types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), and Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

### Application of IDAA to the Given String:
#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
- **Proposition (P)**: "Everyone is against child pornography."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
- **Reason (R)**: "I asked Mrs. Smith and Mr. Jones at the PTA meeting and they are definitely against it."

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
- **Proof of Reason (PR)**: There doesn't seem to be additional arguments supporting the reason.

#### Step 4: Analyze for Defective Argument Patterns
1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - The argument is asserting that a universal condition (everyone is against child pornography) based on the opinions of a few individuals (Mrs. Smith and Mr. Jones).
   - **Conclusion**: Matches G (Generalization).

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - The argument does not enumerate all possibilities, but the proposition doesnâ€™t claim a complete enumeration, so this is not necessarily applicable.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The Reason (R) does not conclusively establish the Proposition (P). The opinions of two individuals are not sufficient to conclusively demonstrate the opinion of everyone.
   - **Conclusion**: Could also be considered as IR (Inconclusive Reason).

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - The causal basis (opinion of two individuals) is weak for a universal claim.
   - **Conclusion**: Also aligns with WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis).

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - The Reason (R) is not merely repeating the Proposition (P).

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - The argument does not assume a conclusion based on universal agreement inaccurately; it wrongly infers universal agreement based on limited examples.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
   - The language does not appear ambiguous or taken in multiple senses.

### Summary of IDAA:
Based on the analysis, the argument most strongly aligns with:
- **G (Generalization)**: As it generalizes the opinion of a few to everyone.
- Additionally, it could also fit into **IR (Inconclusive Reason)** and **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)** as supplementary defective patterns.

With the primary classification:
- **G (Generalization)** being the most fitting classification for the given string.
