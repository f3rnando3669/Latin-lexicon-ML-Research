For 
To apply \(\text{IDAA}\) to the statement "President Kumail raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up. Kumail is responsible for the rise in crime," we'll decompose the task of classifying the argument (labeled as \(\text{IDA}\)) into specific steps (\(\text{D}\)). Hereâ€™s the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition \(\langle P \rangle\)
Identify the main assertion or proposition of the argument.

**Proposition (\(\langle P \rangle\)):**
"Kumail is responsible for the rise in crime."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason \(\langle R \rangle\)
Identify the causal basis or reason given for the proposition.

**Reason (\(\langle R \rangle\)):**
"President Kumail raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up."

### Step 3: Classify \(\langle R \rangle\) in Terms of Defective Arguments
Analyze if the reason (\(\langle R \rangle\)) demonstrates a defect as classified by any of \(\text{G}\), \(\text{FE}\), \(\text{IR}\), \(\text{RR}\), \(\text{WCB}\), \(\text{FU}\), or \(\text{DEP}\).

1. **Generalization (\(\text{G}\))**: Does the argument make a broad assertion based on a limited set of observations?  
   \(\text{No}\)

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\(\text{FE}\))**: Does the argument fail because it misses out on possible other factors?  
   \(\text{Possible}\): The argument does not consider other possible causes of the increase in violent crime rates.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (\(\text{IR}\))**: Does the reason (\(\langle R \rangle\)) fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (\(\langle P \rangle\))?  
   \(\text{Yes}\): Raising taxes and the coincidental rise in crime rates do not conclusively prove causation.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(\text{WCB}\))**: Is the causal basis for the proposition weak or unconvincing?  
   \(\text{Yes}\): The reason only suggests a correlation, not a compelling causal link.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(\text{RR}\))**: Does \(\langle R \rangle\) merely repeat \(\langle P \rangle\) in different words?  
   \(\text{No}\)

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\(\text{FU}\))**: Does \(\langle PR \rangle\) assume a consensus that is disputed or not established?  
   \(\text{No}\)

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\(\text{DEP}\))**: Could \(\langle PR \rangle\) be taken in another sense than intended?  
   \(\text{No}\)

### Step 4: Make the Final Classification
After analyzing the argument based on the criteria of defective arguments, determine which (if any) defective argument applies.

Considering both \(\text{IR}\) and \(\text{WCB}\) might apply, we determine the prevailing defect:

- \(\text{IR}\) because the reason does not conclusively prove the proposition.
- \(\text{WCB}\) as the causal link provided is weak and unconvincing.

**Final Classification**: The statement primarily exhibits an **Inconclusive Reason (\(\text{IR}\))**, and potentially also an **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(\text{WCB}\))**. 

However, \(\text{IR}\) is the most prominent defect, as it directly addresses the logical gap in proving causation from correlation. 

Thus, the dominant classification of the argument is \(\text{IR}\).
