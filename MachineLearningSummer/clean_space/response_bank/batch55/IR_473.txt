To apply the process of IDAA to the given string "a lifelong Republican who was against Obamacare until it saved his life," we need to decompose the advanced task of classifying the argument into specific steps. Here’s how we can break it down:

### Step 1: Understanding the Proposition
First, we need to extract the proposition (\<P>) from the string. The proposition in this context is:
- "Obamacare is beneficial or valuable."

### Step 2: Identifying the Reason
Next, identify the reason (\<R>) presented for the proposition. The reason provided here is:
- "It saved the life of a lifelong Republican who was initially against it."

### Step 3: Extracting the Proof of Reason
Look for any Proof of Reason (\<PR>) in the argument. However, in this case, the argument as presented does not include an additional proof of the reason. 

### Step 4: Classifying the Defective Argument
Now, we need to classify the argument based on the defective argument types defined:

1. **Generalization (G)**: The argument does not attempt to generalize the value of Obamacare based on the experience of one individual. Therefore, this category does not fit.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: There is no claim of complete enumeration of possibilities. The argument does not list various potential benefits of Obamacare or claim to cover all cases.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided (anecdotal evidence of one person's experience) does not conclusively prove the overall correctness of the proposition that Obamacare is beneficial. While compelling, it is insufficient alone to demonstrate the broader value of the policy.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis (someone’s life was saved) is indeed a strong and emotionally compelling reason. However, it only provides a single case and does not address broader statistical evidence or data.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason presented is distinct from the proposition and does not simply repeat it.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There is no appeal to universal agreement in the given argument.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The statement does not rely on ambiguous language; its meaning is clear.

### Step 5: Conclusion
Given the analysis, the most fitting classification for the argument is:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason given does not conclusively establish the truth of the proposition that Obamacare is beneficial in a broader context, as it relies on an isolated instance.

Therefore, applying IDAA to the given string, the argument "a lifelong Republican who was against Obamacare until it saved his life" can be identified as of type **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
