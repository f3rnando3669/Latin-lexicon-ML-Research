For 
To apply IDAA to the string "People who wear glasses are smarter," we will break down the task into specific steps to classify the argument:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - The proposition in this argument is: "People who wear glasses are smarter."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - There seems to be an implicit reason based on a stereotype or general perception that wearing glasses is associated with higher intelligence.

3. **Classify the Argument Type:**
   - Now, we will classify the argument as one of the defective argument types defined.

**Step 1: Check for Generalization (G)**
   - Does the proposition make an assertion based on some individuals or a majority, but incorrectly applies it to all?
   - Yes, it assumes that because some people who wear glasses may be perceived as smarter, this is true for all people who wear glasses.
   - Therefore, this argument is a Generalization (G).

**Step 2: Double-check for Other Possible Defective Argument Types**

**Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - This type involves claiming to have listed all possibilities but missing some.
   - The argument doesn’t enumerate possibilities at all, so (FE) is not applicable.

**Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition.
   - The argument doesn't provide a clear reason, so it’s more aligned with a faulty generalization rather than an inconclusive reason.

**Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - The causal basis provided is not compelling.
   - Since no clear causal basis is laid out, it again points to a generalization.

**Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - The reason is the same as the proposition.
   - No reason is stated clearly, so (RR) is not applicable.

**Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - Proposition assumes consensus without proof.
   - The argument doesn’t rely on assumed universal agreement.

**Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - The argument uses ambiguous language that could be interpreted differently.
   - The language is clear and not ambiguous.

Based on this analysis, the most fitting classification for the argument "People who wear glasses are smarter" is:

**Generalization (G)**

So, the application of IDAA to the string results in the classification: **G**
