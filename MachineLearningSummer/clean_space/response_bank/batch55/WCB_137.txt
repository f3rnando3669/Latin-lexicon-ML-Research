For 
Applying the decompositional task (D) to classify the given string "The time that children are vaccinated and the time they're diagnosed do closely correlate, however, leading upset parents to assign blame to the immunizations, for lack of a better explanation" as one of the defective argument types (IDA) step by step:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P) in the string:**
   - The proposition (P) here appears to be the statement: "upset parents ... assign blame to the immunizations."

2. **Identify the Reason (R) provided in support of the Proposition (P):**
   - The reason (R) given is: "The time that children are vaccinated and the time they're diagnosed do closely correlate."

3. **Classify the identified Reason (R) under one of the defective argument types (IDA):**
   - Let's see if the reason fits any of the defective argument types defined:

      a) **Generalization (G)**: This does not seem to be a sweeping statement generalizing from a few cases.
      b) **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This argument does not appear to be listing possibilities and missing some.
      c) **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Whether this reason conclusively demonstrates the proposition (P) is doubtful. Correlation does not imply causation, so the reason (R) given does not conclusively prove that immunizations cause the diagnosis time to correlate.
      d) **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This reason might argue weakly based on correlation, which doesn't necessarily provide a strong causal link.
      e) **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason (R) is not merely repeating the proposition (P) using different words.
      f) **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument doesn’t claim that everyone universally agrees on this conclusion.
      g) **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The use of language doesn’t seem ambiguous enough to be interpreted in multiple ways contrary to the intended meaning.

4. **Determine the best match:**
    - Given the analysis, the primary flaw seems to be the logical fallacy of assuming correlation implies causation, which aligns with both **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

    - The stronger classification here is insufficient causal basis (**WCB**), as it highlights that the correlation between vaccination time and diagnosis time is not a compelling causal argument.

Therefore, the string "The time that children are vaccinated and the time they're diagnosed do closely correlate, however, leading upset parents to assign blame to the immunizations, for lack of a better explanation." is best classified as **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
