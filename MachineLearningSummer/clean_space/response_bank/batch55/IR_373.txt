To apply **<IDAA>** to the string provided by decomposing the task of classifying the string as a defective argument type, we need to break it down into specific steps and then execute each step systematically.

1. **Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>):**
   - **Charlie’s Proposition (P):** Fast food is filled with salt, fat, and added sugars. We need better regulation of the industry.
   - **Bob’s Response (R):** That may be, but you're such a hypocrite! I saw you devour a Triple-Baconator, super-sized fries, and 64oz of soda yesterday!

2. **Step 2: Analyze Bob's Response as a (Potentially) Defective Argument Type:**
   - Bob’s response seems to involve an ad hominem fallacy (attacking Charlie’s character rather than addressing the actual argument), but we need to classify it as one of the defined defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

3. **Step 3: Determine if the Identified Defective Argument Type Fits Any Categories:**
   - **<G> (Generalization):** Not applicable. Bob isn’t making a generalization.
   - **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):** Not applicable. Bob isn’t enumerating possibilities.
   - **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** Bob’s statement doesn’t offer a reason to directly refute Charlie’s proposition but rather attempts to undermine his credibility.
   - **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** Not applicable. Bob isn’t repeating the proposition.
   - **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** Not applicable. No causal basis presented.
   - **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):** Not applicable. Bob doesn’t use a consensus argument.
   - **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):** Not applicable. There is no ambiguous language in Bob’s statement.

4. **Step 4: Match to the Closest Defective Argument Type:**
   - Since none of the defective argument types precisely fit, we can denote the response as essentially an ad hominem, which might align most closely with:
     - **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** Bob’s response fails to provide a conclusive reason against Charlie’s proposition. Instead, it attempts to deflect by attacking Charlie's behavior.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Bob’s response can be classified under **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** because it does not address Charlie’s argument about the regulation of the fast food industry itself but instead focuses on an irrelevant point about Charlie's personal actions.

Thus, applying **<IDAA>**:
   - **Bob’s response to Charlie’s proposition is identified as <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**.
