For 
To apply the process of identifying defective arguments (IDA) to the given string step by step (IDAA), let's decompose the task into specific steps (D). Hereâ€™s how we can proceed:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
Identify the main assertion or claim intended to be proven in the string.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
Identify the causal basis or the reason provided to support the Proposition.

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
Identify any additional arguments or evidence provided to corroborate the Reason.

### Step 4: Classify the argument based on defects (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP)
Determine if the argument contains any of the listed types of defects based on the definitions.

Now, let's apply these steps to the given string:
"Senator Jones wants a strong national defense, but I will not vote for him because he moved to Canada to avoid being drafted for war when he was in college."

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
**P**: "I will not vote for Senator Jones."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
**R**: "He moved to Canada to avoid being drafted for war when he was in college."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
In this case, there does not seem to be an additional argument or evidence explicitly provided to corroborate the Reason in the given string.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument Based on Defects (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP)
Let's evaluate the provided Reason and the Proposition for the types of defective arguments defined.

- **Generalization (G)**: Does not apply since the reason is specific to Senator Jones.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Does not apply because the argument does not attempt to enumerate possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This applies because the reason provided (avoiding the draft) does not conclusively relate to the decision of voting against him merely because of a historical personal action. It fails to show why this specific past behavior is a valid reason to disqualify him from receiving a vote.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This applies as well, since the reason (R) does not present a compelling causal link to the Proposition (P). Avoiding the draft in college does not necessarily show why Senator Jones would be a poor choice for achieving a strong national defense currently.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Does not apply; the Reason is distinct from the Proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Does not apply since it does not claim universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Does not apply because there is no apparent ambiguity in the language used.

### Conclusion:
The given string exhibits the defective arguments of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition, nor does it offer a compelling causal basis for not voting for Senator Jones based on his historical action of avoiding the draft.
