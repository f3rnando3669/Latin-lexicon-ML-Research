For 
To apply \( IDAA \) to the string "If you don't pass this quiz, you will get a low grade. This will affect your score in the gradebook, you will fail Eng II. You will not graduate Highschool. You will not get a good job.", we need to decompose the task of classifying the string into specific steps. Here’s how to do it step by step:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (\( D \)):

1. **Identify and Segment Propositions (\( P \)):**
   - Break down the argument into its individual propositions.

2. **Identify Reasons (\( R \)):**
   - Determine the causal basis given for each proposition.

3. **Evaluate the Proof of the Reason (\( PR \)):**
   - Examine how each reason is corroborated by additional arguments.

4. **Classify Defective Arguments:**
   - Compare each part against the definitions of defective argument types (\( G \), \( FE \), \( IR \), \( RR \), \( WCB \), \( FU \), and \( DEP \)).

### Applying \( IDAA \):

#### Step 1: Identify and Segment Propositions (\( P \))

1.1. Proposition 1 (\( P_1 \)): "If you don't pass this quiz, you will get a low grade."
1.2. Proposition 2 (\( P_2 \)): "This will affect your score in the gradebook."
1.3. Proposition 3 (\( P_3 \)): "You will fail Eng II."
1.4. Proposition 4 (\( P_4 \)): "You will not graduate Highschool."
1.5. Proposition 5 (\( P_5 \)): "You will not get a good job."

#### Step 2: Identify Reasons (\( R \))

2.1. Reason for \( P_1 \): The absence of an explicit reason. The reason may be implied as the quiz being important for a grade.
2.2. Reason for \( P_2 \): The impact of the low grade on the overall score in the gradebook.
2.3. Reason for \( P_3 \): Failure to achieve sufficient grades in Eng II leading to failing the subject.
2.4. Reason for \( P_4 \): Failure in Eng II leading to not meeting graduation requirements.
2.5. Reason for \( P_5 \): Failure to graduate resulting in poor job prospects.

#### Step 3: Evaluate the Proof of the Reason (\( PR \))

3.1. \( PR \) for \( P_1 \): The reasoning hinges on the assumption that the quiz significantly influences the grade.
3.2. \( PR \) for \( P_2 \): Assumption that every low grade heavily impacts the overall score significantly.
3.3. \( PR \) for \( P_3 \): It assumes that failing one subject guarantees failing the secondary level.
3.4. \( PR \) for \( P_4 \): It assumes graduation is solely dependent on one subject.
3.5. \( PR \) for \( P_5 \): It generalizes that failing to graduate guarantees poor job prospects without other opportunities.

#### Step 4: Classify Defective Arguments

**Generalization (\( G \))**:
- "You will not get a good job." This might be a generalization because not graduating high school doesn't mean one won't get a good job necessarily.

**Incomplete Enumeration (\( FE \))**:
- The structure doesn’t seem to miss possible scenarios directly unless we consider the holistic failure approach (might miss areas where support could result in passing).

**Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \))**:
- Most reasons given (low grade leading to failing, failing course leads to not graduating) are conclusive within context but are rather a chain reaction hypothesis.
- The critical proposition would be around whether a low grade truly correlates absolutely with failing and non-graduation without addressing mitigating scenarios.
  
**Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \))**:
- Several reasons (not graduating leading to unemployment, etc.) rely on a presumed cascade of failures without considering potential interventions, second chances, or support structures.

**Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( RR \))**:
- Not discernible at first glance that any of the reasons just repeat propositions.

**Presumptuous Consensus (\( FU \))**:
- None of the statements hinge on presumed consensus but rather factual consequence chains.

**Ambiguous Language Use (\( DEP \))**:
- Language seems direct without much ambiguity, though "good job" can be subjective.

### Conclusion:
The string primarily falls under **Generalization (G)** due to claiming a blanket job scenario from not graduating high school and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** as it presumes complete causality through a cascade without recognizing other influencing factors or support.
  
Hence, **IDA:** "If you don't pass this quiz, you will get a low grade. This will affect your score in the gradebook, you will fail Eng II. You will not graduate Highschool. You will not get a good job." is primarily of type **\( G \) and \( WCB \)**.
