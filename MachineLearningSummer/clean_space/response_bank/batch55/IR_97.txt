For 
To apply IDAA to the string "That's what you'd expect someone like him/her to say," we need to break down the process of identifying the type of defective argument it represents step by step.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of IDA
1. **Identify if Proposition Applies (P):** Determine if there's a proposition (statement) intended to be proven or supported within the given string.
2. **Identify Reason (R):** Determine if there's a reason given which sets forth the causal basis for the proposition.
3. **Identify Proof of Reason (PR):** Check if there's any additional argument corroborating the reason.
4. **Identify Defective Argument Type (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP):** Compare the string with the definitions of defective arguments to identify which one it most closely aligns with.

### Application of Decomposition (IDAA) to String
#### Step 1: Identify if Proposition Applies (P)
- **String Analysis:** "That's what you'd expect someone like him/her to say."
- **Observation:** The statement implies that the person mentioned has made some claim or statement. However, the string itself is a response rather than a direct proposition. For the sake of analysis, we can infer that the context involves a preceding proposition made by "him/her."

#### Step 2: Identify Reason (R)
- **String Analysis:** The string provides a reason which infers that the statement made by the person is not reliable because it aligns with what one might stereotypically expect from them.
- **Observation:** The reason here is based on an assumed understanding of the person's character or role.

#### Step 3: Identify Proof of Reason (PR)
- **String Analysis:** There doesn't appear to be an additional argument given to bolster or corroborate the reason presented.
- **Observation:** It appears to be lacking any further proof or additional argument to support the reason.

#### Step 4: Identify Defective Argument Type
Analyze based on defective argument types:
- **Generalization (G):** This argument doesn't necessarily generalize a trait of a group to the individual in a way that fits <G>.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument isn't about an incomplete list of possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason given ("what you'd expect...") might be considered insufficiently conclusive since it dismisses the validity of what was said purely based on expectations/prejudices, rather than the content's truthfulness.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The argument doesn't repeat the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reason provided might categorize under <WCB> as it lacks a compelling causal basis for asserting the unreliability of the person's statement.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There's no universal agreement in play here.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** This isn't about ambiguous language; itâ€™s an implication based on characterization.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis:
- The string lacks a compelling causal basis (WCB) and also gives a reason that does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of dismissing the person's statement (IR).

Given these observations, the most fitting defective argument types for "That's what you'd expect someone like him/her to say" would be:
- **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**
- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**

This string can be classified under both IR and WCB, but IR appears to be the primary classification considering the reason provided does not conclusively establish the proposition.
