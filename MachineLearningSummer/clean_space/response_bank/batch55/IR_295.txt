For 
To apply \( IDAA \) to the provided string "Everyone in our family has gone to the University of Tennessee, so you need to apply to UT," we need to follow the process of decomposing the advanced task \( IDA \) into specific steps and then applying this decomposition to classify the string. Here’s how we can go about it step-by-step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition \( P \) and Reason \( R \) in the statement.
- **Proposition (\( P \))**: (implied) "You need to apply to UT."
- **Reason (\( R \))**: "Everyone in our family has gone to the University of Tennessee."

### Step 2: Determine if there is a Proof of Reason \( PR \).
- In this particular statement, there is no additional corroboration or \( PR \). The \( R \) is directly given without further evidence.

### Step 3: Analyze the identified Reason (\( R \)) to see if it fits any defective argument types.
We'll examine the types one by one:
- **Generalization (\( G \))**: This type refers to making a broad assertion based on a small sample or incomplete data. In this case, the reason given ("Everyone in our family...") is a generalization applied to the necessity of applying to UT.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\( FE \))**: This type does not apply here as there’s no enumeration of possibilities provided.
- **Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \))**: While the reason might lack compelling force, it isn’t necessarily unrelated. However, the completeness and relevance of the claimed causal link are crucial.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \))**: This could apply if the causal relationship is weak or not compelling. The family history is not a strong basis for the necessity of applying to UT.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( RR \))**: \( R \) doesn't repeat \( P \) in this argument. They are distinct.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (\( FU \))**: The argument doesn't claim a universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (\( DEP \))**: The language in the given statement is clear and not subject to multiple interpretations.

### Step 4: Determine the most applicable defect type from the analysis.
- The most applicable defect type seems to be **Generalization (\( G \))**. The argument generalizes from the family experience to the necessity for an individual to apply to UT.

### Conclusion
The string "Everyone in our family has gone to the University of Tennessee, so you need to apply to UT" is classified as type **\( G \)** (Generalization).

The sequence followed can be summarized as follows:
1. Identify \( P \) and \( R \): \( P \)("You need to apply to UT."), \( R \)("Everyone in our family has gone to the University of Tennessee.")
2. Check for \( PR \): None found.
3. Analyze \( R \) against defective types.
4. Apply the most fitting classification: Generalization (\( G \)).
