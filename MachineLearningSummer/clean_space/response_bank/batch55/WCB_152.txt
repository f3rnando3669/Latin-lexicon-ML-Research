For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of decomposing a task into specific steps to the task of classifying an argument as one of the defective argument types) to the given statement "1. 'Michael Jordan wore his UNC shorts during every game he played in the NBA and he won 6 championships.'", we need to follow a structured approach to determine which specific defective argument type it belongs to.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA> (IDAA):

1. **Identify the Proposition <P>:**
   - The statement's implied proposition is: "Wearing UNC shorts during games is a contributing factor to winning championships."

2. **Identify the Reason <R>:**
   - The reason presented is: "Michael Jordan wore his UNC shorts during every game he played in the NBA."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason <PR>:**
   - The proof of reason appears to be: "He won 6 championships."

4. **Evaluate the Argument for Defective Types:**
   - We will now systematically check for each defective argument type <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

5. **Check for Generalization (<G>):**
   - Is the <P> a broad assertion based on one or a few instances rather than the entirety?
   - Yes. The argument generalizes a specific behavior of Michael Jordan to imply causal efficacy without sufficient evidence across different cases.

6. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Does the argument claim completeness without considering all possibilities?
   - No. This argument does not claim a complete enumeration of factors that led to the championships.

7. **Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Does the <R> fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of <P>?
   - Yes. Wearing shorts is not conclusively demonstrated to be the reason for winning championships.

8. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Is the causal basis weak or not compelling?
   - Yes. Suggesting that wearing shorts led to winning championships lacks a compelling, logical basis.

9. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - Does the <R> merely restate the <P> without adding substantial new information?
   - No. There is a separate reason provided (wearing shorts) distinct from the proposition (winning championships).

10. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - Does the <PR> rely on a universally accepted but disputable claim?
   - No. The argument does not rely on consensus but on a specific example.

11. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - Is there ambiguity in how <PR> can be interpreted?
   - No. The language used in the argument is clear but possibly misguided.

### Conclusion from Decomposition:

The argument does not definitively fall into a single defective type but is most strongly characterized by a combination of:
- **Generalization (<G>):** Broadly asserting a causal relationship based on one example.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Failing to conclusively establish causality.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Providing a weakly supported causal link.

The most prominent flawed types in this argument are **<G> (Generalization)** and **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
