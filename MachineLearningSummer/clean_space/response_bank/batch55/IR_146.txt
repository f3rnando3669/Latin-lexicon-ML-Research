For 
To perform IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types), we need to break down the task step by step. Here are the steps for this specific instance:

### Step 1: Understand the Proposition and Reason
1. **Identify the proposition (P) and reason (R) in the argument:** 
   - Proposition (P): "We must legalize weed."
   - Reason (R): "It is tearing families apart."
   
   The proposition states what needs to be done (legalizing weed), and the reason offers the causal basis (because it is tearing families apart).

### Step 2: Identify the Response and its Structure
2. **Identify the response and analyze its structure:** 
   - Response: "But look at all those druggies getting arrested, they are obviously criminals."
   
   The response seems to counter the argument by introducing another angle on the issue.

### Step 3: Examine Defectiveness in the Response
3. **Analyze the response for any defective argument types:**
   
   Let's break down the response ("But look at all those druggies getting arrested, they are obviously criminals.") and see which defective argument type it could fall under:

   - **Generalization (G):** Does the response make a sweeping statement based on limited evidence? 
     - Yes, it generalizes all individuals arrested for drug use as being "criminals."
   
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Does the response miss out on some possibilities?
     - Possibly, but less clearly applicable than Generalization.
   
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does the reason given in the response fail to conclusively support the counter-proposition?
     - Yes, it fails to conclusively address why legalizing weed should or shouldn't happen.
   
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Does the reason provide a weak causal basis?
     - Arguably, by equating arrest with criminality without a nuanced analysis of reasons.
   
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Is the reason merely a repetition of the proposition?
     - No, the response introduces new information.
   
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Is there an assumed consensus that may not exist?
     - Not clearly applicable here.
   
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Is there ambiguity in the language that can be misinterpreted?
     - Less clearly applicable than Generalization and Inconclusive Reason.

### Step 4: Determine Primary Defective Argument Type
4. **Select the most prominent defective argument type:**
   - While multiple defective types might tangentially apply, the most prominent ones are:
     - Generalization (G): The response generalizes all arrested drug users as criminals.
     - Inconclusive Reason (IR): The reason fails to conclusively counter the argument about legalizing weed.
   
   - The response most clearly exemplifies **Generalization (G)**: 
     - It assumes all those arrested for drug use are inherently criminals without considering other facets and factors behind the arrests or the argument for legalization.

### Conclusion
Based on the step-by-step decomposition (IDAA) applied to the given string, the defective argument type for the response "But look at all those druggies getting arrested, they are obviously criminals." is classified as **Generalization (G)**.
