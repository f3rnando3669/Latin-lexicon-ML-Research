For 
To apply the decomposition of the task \(<t>\) into specific steps (\(<D>\)) to classify the given argument string \(<s>\) into one of the defective argument types (\(<IDA>\)), we will follow a structured approach. Here are the steps we will take:

1. **Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\(<P>\))**:
   - **Proposition (\(<P>\))**: "Y is better than X."

2. **Step 2: Identify the Reason (\(<R>\))**:
   - **Reason (\(<R>\))**: "X has been around for years now. Y is new."

3. **Step 3: Analyze the Reason for its validity**:
   - The argument provided claims that the newness of Y is a valid reason to conclude that Y is better than X, whereas merely stating that something is new doesn't necessarily substantiate it as being better.

4. **Step 4: Compare the Reason (\(<R>\)) against the list of defective argument types**:
   - **Generalization (\(<G>\))**: Not applicable as it does not generalize from specific instances.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (\(<FE>\))**: Does not attempt to enumerate possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (\(<IR>\))**: \(R\) does not conclusively demonstrate that \(P\). \(R\) simply presents newness as a factor without showing how it conclusively proves "better."
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(<WCB>\))**: The provided reason has a weak causal basis, as newness alone is insufficient to justify that something is better.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(<RR>\))**: \(R\) does not merely repeat \(P\).
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (\(<FU>\))**: Does not assume that \(PR\) is universally agreed upon.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (\(<DEP>\))**: There is no ambiguity in the language used in \(PR\).

5. **Step 5: Conclude and classify**:
   - The provided reason for the proposition is inadequate and does not logically prove the proposition due to insufficient causal basis.

**Final Classification**:
- The defective argument type (\(<IDA>\)) for the given argument string "X has been around for years now. Y is new. Therefore, Y is better than X." is best classified as **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(<WCB>\))**.

So, applying \(<IDAA>\) to the argument "X has been around for years now.\nY is new.\nTherefore, Y is better than X." results in recognizing it as an instance of the defective argument type **\(<WCB>\)**.
