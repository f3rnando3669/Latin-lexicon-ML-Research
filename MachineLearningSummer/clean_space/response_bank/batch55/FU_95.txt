For 
To apply the process of <IDAA> to the string "Everyone is doing it. You should too.", we'll need to decompose the advanced task (<t>) of classifying the argument (<s>) into specific steps and then execute those steps. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown to classify the argument:

### Step 1: Understand the Argument Structure
First, we need to clearly understand what the argument "Everyone is doing it. You should too." is implying and identify the components such as the Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), and Proof of Reason (<PR>).

#### - Proposition (<P>):
"You should too." This is what the argument is urging or trying to prove.

#### - Reason (<R>):
"Everyone is doing it." This is the causal basis given to support the Proposition.

### Step 2: Identify the Type of Defective Argument
Given the definitions of defective argument types, we need to determine which one (if any) applies to this argument.

- **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument does not rely on generalizing from a subset to a whole.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not claim a complete list of possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided ("Everyone is doing it.") may not be a conclusive reason why "You should too."
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis ("Everyone is doing it.") might be seen as insufficient for compelling you to do the same.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The Reason does not simply restate the Proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The Reason relies on the assumption that the consensus ("Everyone is doing it.") is a valid reason without further substantiating it.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The language here isn't particularly ambiguous or open to alternate interpretations.

### Step 3: Classify the Argument
Based on the analysis above, the argument "Everyone is doing it. You should too." can be classified primarily in two ways:

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reason given for why you should do something is "everyone is doing it," which does not independently establish why you should join in.
   
2. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The assumption that what everyone is doing is necessarily the correct course of action is being taken as a given without further examination.

### Conclusion
After the step-by-step application of <IDAA> to "Everyone is doing it. You should too.," we classify the argument as follows:
   
- The primary classification is **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** because the provided causal basis (people's actions) is weak.
- Additionally, it can also be considered under **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)** as it presumes the correctness of the consensus without additional proof.

The most suitable classification given the definitions and structure would be <WCB> as it directly points to the weakness in the causality presented in the argument.
