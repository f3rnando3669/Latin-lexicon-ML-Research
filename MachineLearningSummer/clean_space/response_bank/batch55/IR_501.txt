For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "If we allow cadets to apply for encampment online, we’d save everyone lots of headaches. REPLY: No. We’ve always made cadets apply using a paper form," we need to break down the advanced task <IDA> (classifying the string into one of the defective argument types) into specific steps <D>. Here is the detailed decomposition:

**Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>):**

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), and Proof of Reason (<PR>) if present:**
   - Proposition (<P>): "If we allow cadets to apply for encampment online, we’d save everyone lots of headaches."
   - Reason (<R>): "We’ve always made cadets apply using a paper form."
   - There doesn’t appear to be a separate Proof of Reason (<PR>) in the string provided.

2. **Examine <P> and determine if it falls under any defective argument types:**
   - <P> (the proposition) asserts that switching to an online application process will save headaches based on current issues with the paper form. 

3. **Examine <R> and determine if it falls under any defective argument types:**
   - <R> states that the process should remain on paper because it has always been done that way.

4. **Compare <P> against defective argument types:**
   - It does not seem to be a **Generalization (<G>)** as it doesn’t claim that the online process is suitable because many people find online forms better.
   - It does not seem to be Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>); <P> doesn't claim to cover all possibilities.
   - It is not an Inconclusive Reason (<IR>); <P> stands alone.

5. **Compare <R> against defective argument types:**
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The reason given ("We’ve always made cadets apply using a paper form") does not address the new proposition's merits but rather repeats the historical norm as justification. It does not provide new information or causation but merely states tradition, which does not logically counter the proposition's benefits.

6. **Check for other possible defective arguments:**
   - It does not fall under Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>) because <R> does not present a compelling causal link.
   - It is not Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>); the argument does not appeal to universal agreement.
   - There is no indication of Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

**Conclusion:**

Classify the argument as a **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**. The reply presented (“No. We’ve always made cadets apply using a paper form”) is a repetition of the existing procedure rather than a logical reason against the proposition that introducing an online application could save headaches.

So, applying <IDAA> to the string yields that the argument type is <RR>.
