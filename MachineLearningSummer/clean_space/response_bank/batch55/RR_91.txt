For 
Let's apply the decomposition of <IDA> to the statement, "Smoking pot is against the law because it's wrong; I know it's wrong because it is against the law." This involves classifying the string as one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>. We'll take it step by step.

### Step-by-Step <IDAA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition here is: "Smoking pot is against the law because it's wrong."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason given is: "It's wrong."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - The statement "I know it's wrong because it is against the law" is given as the proof of the reason.

4. **Examine the Relationship between <P>, <R>, and <PR>:**
   - **<P>:** "Smoking pot is against the law because it's wrong."
   - **<R>:** "It's wrong."
   - **<PR>:** "I know it's wrong because it is against the law."

5. **Classify the Argument:**
   - The reason essentially repeats the proposition in different terms. The argument is circular. The reason "It's wrong" is supported by "it is against the law," which refers back to the original proposition of the law. Thus, the reason does nothing more than restate the proposition in other words.

6. **Determine the Defective Argument Type:**
   - The relationship between <P> and <R> involves <RR> where the <R> is essentially a repetition of <P>. The reason "It's wrong" is simply a rephrased version of "against the law."

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the defective argument type for the statement "Smoking pot is against the law because it's wrong; I know it's wrong because it is against the law." is **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)** since the reason provided does not add new information and merely restates the proposition.

Thus, we have applied <IDAA> and classified the argument as **<RR>**.
