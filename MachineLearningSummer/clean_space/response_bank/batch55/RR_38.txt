For 
To apply IDAA (the application of task decomposition to the identification of defective argument types) to the statement "Cell phones, high-tech devices that cause severe distractions and cyberbullying should be banned in schools," we need to break down the given statement and then evaluate it against the definitions of defective argument types. Here are the steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition is a part of the argument where the intent of what is to be proved is set forth summarily. In this case, the proposition is:
- "Cell phones should be banned in schools."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason sets forth the causal basis for the proposition. In this case, the reasons provided are:
- "Cell phones cause severe distractions."
- "Cell phones cause cyberbullying."

### Step 3: Identify if there is a Proof of Reason (<PR>)
The proof of reason corroborates the reason through additional arguments. In this case, there doesn't appear to be an explicit proof of reason provided within the statement.

### Step 4: Evaluate the Argument for Defective Types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>)
Now we will evaluate the statement against each of the defective argument types.

#### Generalization (<G>)
- For <G>, we need to see if the assertion is overly general based on specific instances.
- The statement does not seem to generalize from a few specific instances to all instances. 

#### Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- For <FE>, we need to check if it claims an exhaustive list but misses other possibilities.
- The statement does not list all possible reasons for banning cell phones nor claims to enumerate them all, so <FE> does not apply here.

#### Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- For <IR>, we need to check if the reasons given do not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- The reasons provided ("cause severe distractions" and "cause cyberbullying") are relevant but may not conclusively establish that cell phones should be entirely banned, as more context or evidence could be required.

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- For <WCB>, we need to see if the reasons are not compelling enough to support the conclusion.
- One could argue that while distractions and cyberbullying are serious issues, the causal basis might be considered insufficient without further evidence or consideration of other factors like educational benefits of cell phones.

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
- For <RR>, the reason should not be simply a rephrasing of the proposition.
- The provided reasons are not a mere repetition of the proposition; they offer specific issues like distractions and cyberbullying as reasons.

#### Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
- For <FU>, a reason should not be assumed to be universally agreed upon if it is still in dispute.
- The statement does not explicitly claim a universal consensus on the issues of distraction and cyberbullying; it merely states them as reasons.

#### Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)
- For <DEP>, we need to determine if there is ambiguity in the language.
- "Severe distractions" and "cyberbullying" could be interpreted ambiguously without more context, leading to different understandings.

### Step 5: Determine the Defective Argument Type
Based on this analysis, we identify that the statement may suffer from:

1. **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** The reasons provided may not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
2. **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The causal basis provided (distractions and cyberbullying) might be considered insufficient without further evidence or broader consideration.
3. **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):** Terms like "severe distractions" and "cyberbullying" may be interpreted ambiguously, lacking specific definitions or context.

### Conclusion:
The statement "Cell phones, high-tech devices that cause severe distractions and cyberbullying should be banned in schools" can be classified under defective argument types <IR>, <WCB>, and potentially <DEP>.
