To apply the process of decomposing the task of classifying the argument as any of the defective argument types, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Determine the main assertion that is intended to be proven.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Determine the causal basis or reason supporting the proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Verify if there are additional arguments or corroborative elements backing the reason.
4. **Check for Defective Argument Types:** See if the argument fits any of the defective types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).
5. **Classify the Argument:** Based on the evaluation, classify the given string into one of the defective argument types.

Let's apply these steps to the given argument:

**Argument:**
P1. Smoking has been empirically proven to cause lung cancer.
C. Therefore, if we eradicate smoking, we will eradicate lung cancer.

**Step-by-Step Application:**

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - **Proposition (P):** "If we eradicate smoking, we will eradicate lung cancer."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - **Reason (R):** "Smoking has been empirically proven to cause lung cancer."

3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - There is no additional corroborative evidence or press release backing the reason outside of the empirical proof statement.

4. **Check for Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** The argument is not an over-extrapolation based on a non-representative sample.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument does not enumerate all potential causes of lung cancer.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason states that smoking causes lung cancer. However, it does not consider that there are other causes of lung cancer besides smoking.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal basis that smoking causes lung cancer is empirically solid, but it is weak in concluding that eradicating smoking will eradicate all lung cancer cases.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason (R) does not merely repeat the proposition (P).
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The argument does not rely on a universal but disputable consensus assertion.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The language of the reason and proposition is clear with no evident ambiguity.

5. **Classify the Argument:**
   
   - The given argument primarily fails due to an insubstantial causal link between the eradication of smoking and the complete eradication of lung cancer, ignoring other causes of lung cancer. Therefore, it fits:
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Because it incorrectly assumes eradicating smoking equates to eradicating lung cancer without considering other causative factors.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Because the reasoning does not conclusively demonstrate that eradicating smoking will eradicate all lung cancer.

Therefore, the argument can be classified under both **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** and **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
