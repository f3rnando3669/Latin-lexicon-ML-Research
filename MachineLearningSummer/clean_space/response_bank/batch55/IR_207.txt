To apply the <IDAA> (the application of the advanced task <D> to the task <IDA>), let's break down the task of classifying the given string "Don't listen to her advice about math. She doesn't even know how to tie her own shoes!" into specific steps and then proceed accordingly.

### Decomposition (<D>):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Determine the main claim being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Determine the reason given for the proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Reason (<R>):** Assess if the reason supports the proposition.
4. **Check for Corroboration (<PR>):** See if there's any additional supporting evidence.
5. **Classify the Defective Argument:** Compare identified parts (<P>, <R>, <PR>) against defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) to classify the argument.

### Step-by-step Decomposition Applied:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The main claim being made here is "Don't listen to her advice about math."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason given for the proposition is "She doesn't even know how to tie her own shoes!"

3. **Evaluate the Reason (<R>):**
   - Assess whether this reason logically supports the proposition:
     - The ability to tie one's own shoes is unrelated to providing advice about math, so the reason does not logically support the claim about not listening to her math advice.

4. **Check for Corroboration (<PR>):**
   - There is no additional supporting evidence provided. The argument relies solely on the incongruous reason given.

5. **Classify the Defective Argument:**
   - Based on the evaluation, the reason ("She doesn't even know how to tie her own shoes!") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition ("Don't listen to her advice about math.").
   - This falls under the category of <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), as the reason provided is irrelevant to the proposition.

### Conclusion:
The given string "Don't listen to her advice about math. She doesn't even know how to tie her own shoes!" is classified as an argument type <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
