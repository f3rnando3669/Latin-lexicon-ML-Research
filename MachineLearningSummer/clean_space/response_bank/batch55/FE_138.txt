For 
To classify the string "Dad, either you let me go to the party or you're a bad dad" using the person-defined classifications for defective argument types (IDA), we need to decompose the advanced task (D) into specific steps. Letâ€™s apply IDAA step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
A proposition is a summary of what is intended to be proved. 
In the given string, the proposition can be split into possible outcomes that the speaker is trying to establish. The key parts of the proposition are:
- "You let me go to the party"
- "You're a bad dad"

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
A reason is the causal basis for establishing the proposition's truth.
In this case, the reason provided is the forced choice between the two outcomes. The implicit reason here is that the only way to avoid being a "bad dad" is by letting the speaker go to the party.

### Step 3: Identify the type of defective argument based on given definitions
Now, let's match the identified components against the defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G):** The proposition is not a generalization based on a part or majority of individuals.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The proposition does not attempt to enumerate all possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. Here, the reason given does not logically prove why not allowing the speaker to go to the party would make the dad "bad."
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reason submitted is weak because it does not compellingly establish the causal basis. The causal link between not going to the party and being a bad dad is tenuous at best.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The proposition and the reason are essentially the same.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There is no mention of universal agreement on the ground of the claim in the string.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language used is not ambiguous in the sense defined.

Given the definitions and reasoning provided, the string primarily demonstrates **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The reason given is weak because it does not compellingly establish why not allowing to go to the party would result in the dad being labeled as "bad."

### Conclusion
By applying IDAA step by step to the given string "Dad, either you let me go to the party or you're a bad dad," we classify it as a defective argument type <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
