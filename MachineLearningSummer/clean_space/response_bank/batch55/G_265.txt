For 
To apply the process of IDAA to the given string "If I raise you, I must raise everyone, and then the company goes bankrupt," we will follow the steps of decomposing the task of classifying this string into specific steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (\<P\>) in the Argument**: Determine what is being asserted or intended to prove.
    - In this case, the proposition (\<P\>), is "If I raise you, I must raise everyone."

2. **Identify the Reason (\<R\>) Provided**: Examine the causal basis that is provided for the proposition.
    - The reason (\<R\>) provided is "then the company goes bankrupt."

3. **Identify any Potential Proofs of Reason (\<PR\>)**: Look for additional arguments that corroborate the reason.
    - In this particular string, there are no additional arguments provided as proofs of reason (\<PR\>).

4. **Analyze Each Component for Defective Arguments**: Classify the components (\<P\>, \<R\>, and potentially \<PR\>) against the list of defective argument types: 

Let's consider the specific defective argument types:

- **Generalization (\<G\>)**: The proposition might be a generalization of only a part or a majority.
    - The proposition "If I raise you, I must raise everyone" assumes that raising one individual's salary necessitates raising everyone's salary. This is a sweeping generalization.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)**: When some possibilities pertinent to the proposition are missed out.
    - The reason "then the company goes bankrupt" suggests an incomplete enumeration. It does not consider other outcomes or the potential incremental salaries that might not lead to bankruptcy.

- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**: The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
    - The reason to the proposition does not directly show that raising everyoneâ€™s salary will indeed lead to bankruptcy. More data or evidence is needed to show such causation.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**: The reason is weak if the causal basis is not compelling enough.
    - The reason given seems to be a potentially weak causal basis. There may be other factors that would contribute to bankruptcy, and it doesn't conclusively show that salary increases alone will cause it.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)**: The reason repeats the proposition.
    - The reason provided does not merely repeat the proposition, so this does not apply here.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)**: Assuming universal agreement on a disputed thing.
    - The string does not appeal to a presumptuous consensus.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)**: The proof of reason can be misinterpreted.
    - The reason in the string is not particularly ambiguous but could lead to different interpretations on the causes of bankruptcy.

#### Classification:
Given the detailed analysis, the string "If I raise you, I must raise everyone, and then the company goes bankrupt," seems to primarily fall under:
1. **Generalization (\<G\>)**: The assertion that raising one person means raising everyone.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)**: Missing out other pertinent possibilities like incrementing salaries for selective individuals or considering other fiscal strategies to mitigate bankruptcy.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**: The reason provided doesn't conclusively demonstrate that the company will indeed go bankrupt.

Therefore, based on the given definitions and detailed analysis, the most fitting primary classifications for the argument are Generalization (\<G\>), Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>), and Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>).
