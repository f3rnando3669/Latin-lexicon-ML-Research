For 
Certainly! Let's apply the process of <IDAA>—decomposing the task of classifying the string "You must obey the law, because it's illegal to break the law."—as follows:

### Step 1: Understand the Propositions and Reasons
First, identify the parts of the argument:
- **Proposition (<P>)**: "You must obey the law."
- **Reason (<R>)**: "because it's illegal to break the law."

### Step 2: Check for Defective Arguments
Next, we will examine if the argument fits any of the defective types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Is the <P> based on asserting something about parts or a majority but not applicable to all?
    - No, this argument is not making a generalization about a subset applied to the whole.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Is the <P> based on an enumeration of possibilities but missing out on pertinent ones?
    - No, this argument does not enumerate possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Does the <R> fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the <P>?
    - No, the reason given (while potentially weak) does try to explain the proposition.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Does the <R> provide a weak causal basis for the <P>?
    - Potentially, but we need to check for other more applicable defective arguments.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Does the <R> simply repeat what was stated in the <P>?
    - Yes, the reason here ("because it's illegal to break the law") essentially repeats the proposition ("You must obey the law"). This is a clear case where the reason doesn't add any new information but simply restates the proposition in different words.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Is the <PR> assumed certain based on universal agreement?
    - No, this argument doesn't rely on presumed consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Can the <PR> be taken in another sense than intended?
    - No, the language here is not ambiguous but rather repetitive.

### Step 3: Conclude the Classification
After evaluating the argument against each defective type, the most fitting classification for "You must obey the law, because it's illegal to break the law." is:

**Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**

### Step by Step Conclusion:

1. Identify <P>: "You must obey the law."
2. Identify <R>: "because it's illegal to break the law."
3. Evaluate against defective argument types:
    - Not <G>
    - Not <FE>
    - Not <IR>
    - Possibly <WCB> but more specifically fits <RR>
    - Not <FU>
    - Not <DEP>
4. Conclude classification: The argument fits **<RR>** (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).

Thus, the string "You must obey the law, because it's illegal to break the law." is classified as type **<RR>**.
