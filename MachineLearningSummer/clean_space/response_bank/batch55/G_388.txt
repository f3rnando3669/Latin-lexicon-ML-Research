For 
To apply <IDAA> to classify the given string "I hope the art mural at 34th and Habersham will not be allowed. You open the gate for one, you open it for all and you'll have it all over the city. A person wanting to paint on buildings is nothing more than upscale graffiti. More than likely it will go too far.", we must follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
A proposition (P) sets forth what the speaker intends to prove.

In this case, the proposition is:
- "I hope the art mural at 34th and Habersham will not be allowed."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
A reason (R) sets forth the causal basis for the proposition.

Here, the reasons provided are:
- "You open the gate for one, you open it for all and you'll have it all over the city."
- "A person wanting to paint on buildings is nothing more than upscale graffiti."

### Step 3: Classify the Defective Argument Types
Evaluate if the reasons provided fall under any of the predefined defective argument types.

#### Reason Analysis:

1. **"You open the gate for one, you open it for all and you'll have it all over the city."**
    - This appears to be a type of slippery slope argument, where allowing one mural will lead to an uncontrolled spread of murals across the city.
    - This might be classified under **Generalization (G)**, as it assumes that allowing one instance will inevitably lead to many other instances without sufficient evidence. 

2. **"A person wanting to paint on buildings is nothing more than upscale graffiti."**
    - This equates all mural paintings to graffiti without accounting for different contexts or quality, making a sweeping assertion.
    - This might also be considered as a form of **Generalization (G)** because it does not justify why all murals should be considered graffiti.

3. **"More than likely it will go too far."**
    - This statement restates the fear that the situation will get out of hand without providing new evidence.
    - This could fall under **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** since it only expresses worry or conjecture without solid proof.

### Step 4: Summarize the Findings
Based on the analysis, categorize the string according to the appropriate defective argument types:

- The argument contains **Generalization (G)** twice, for reasons 1 and 2.
- The argument contains **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** for reason 3.

Therefore, the argument "I hope the art mural at 34th and Habersham will not be allowed. You open the gate for one, you open it for all and you'll have it all over the city. A person wanting to paint on buildings is nothing more than upscale graffiti. More than likely it will go too far." can be classified primarily as <G> due to multiple over-generalizations, and also has elements of <IR> due to the inconclusive nature of one of the reasons given.
