For 
To analyze ("We have no evidence that the Illuminati ever existed. They must have been so clever that they destroyed all the evidence.") using the steps of decomposing and classifying defective arguments, we will now apply <IDAA> to this statement.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Classification

Step 1: **Identify and Extract Proposition (<P>)**

The proposition (<P>) is the main point or claim that is being made in the argument. Here, the proposition seems to be:
- "The Illuminati must have been so clever that they destroyed all the evidence."

Step 2: **Identify and Extract the Reason (<R>)**

The reason (<R>) is the causal or logical basis provided to support the proposition. In this case:
- "We have no evidence that the Illuminati ever existed."

Step 3: **Determine if there is any Proof of Reason (<PR>)**

The proof of reason (<PR>) usually consists of additional arguments that support the reason set forth in step 2. Here, there's no additional argument or proof provided beyond the core reason, so we move to the next step without identifying a <PR>.

Step 4: **Identify the Defective Argument Type**

Now that we have the proposition and the reason, we need to determine why the argument is defective. Let's map the observed structure to our defined defective types:

- **<G>**: Generalization - This statement does not generalize based on a part or majority.
- **<FE>**: Incomplete Enumeration - The argument doesn't falsely claim an exhaustive listing of possibilities.
- **<IR>**: Inconclusive Reason - The reason given ("We have no evidence") does not logically lead to the proposition ("They destroyed all the evidence") because a lack of evidence can be due to various reasons, not necessarily because the Illuminati were clever.
- **<WCB>**: Insufficient Causal Basis - The causal basis that the Illuminati destroyed evidence directly from a lack of evidence is not compelling.
- **<RR>**: Faulty Repetition of Proposition - The reason presented is different from the proposition, so this is not simply repeated.
- **<FU>**: Presumptuous Consensus - There is no suggestion here of universal agreement on this point.
- **<DEP>**: Ambiguous Language Use - The language isn't inherently ambiguous but rather reaches a conclusion that isn't supported by the premise.

Given these definitions, the applicable defective argument types here would be **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason) and **<WCB>** (Insufficient Causal Basis). The reasoning provided does not conclusively establish the truth of the proposition, and the causal relationship posited is not compelling.

### Conclusion

Based on our decomposition method (<IDAA>), sentence "We have no evidence that the Illuminati ever existed. They must have been so clever that they destroyed all the evidence." includes both <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis). This analysis shows that the argument provided lacks a definitive logical basis and makes an insufficient causal connection between the lack of evidence and the supposed cleverness of the Illuminati in destroying it.
