For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a string as a type of defective argument) to the statement "Every time I wash my car, it rains. Me washing my car has a definite effect on the weather," let's break down the steps required to classify the argument:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D)
1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine what is being asserted or claimed.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Determine what causal basis is set forth to support the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**, if present: Determine any additional arguments provided to corroborate the reason.
4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type (IDA)**:
    1. Check if it is a **Generalization (G)**.
    2. Check if it is an **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**.
    3. Check if there is an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
    4. Check if there is an **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
    5. Check if there is a **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**.
    6. Check if there is a **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.
    7. Check if there is an **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**.

### Application of Decomposition to the Given Statement

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
- Proposition (P): "Me washing my car has a definite effect on the weather."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
- Reason (R): "Every time I wash my car, it rains."

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
- There does not appear to be a distinct additional argument or proof provided beyond the given reason. The statement seems self-contained within its causal assertion.

#### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type (IDA)

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - The argument does not seem to generalize a subset to a whole class; it deals with a specific pair of events related to the speaker.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - This does not involve listing possibilities, so it's not a case of incomplete enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The reason given ("Every time I wash my car, it rains") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition ("Me washing my car has a definite effect on the weather"). The correlation mentioned does not adequately prove causation, making this match the type.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - The causal basis ("Every time I wash my car, it rains") is weak because correlation does not imply causation, fitting this type as well. 

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - The reason does not merely repeat the proposition; they are distinct. 

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - There is no claim of universal agreement here.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
   - The language does not seem ambiguous or taken in another sense than intended.

### Conclusion
The defective argument type most appropriate here appears to be:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, because the reason given does not conclusively prove the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, because the causal link asserted is weak.

Therefore, the argument in the string "Every time I wash my car, it rains. Me washing my car has a definite effect on the weather." can be classified as both an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and an **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
