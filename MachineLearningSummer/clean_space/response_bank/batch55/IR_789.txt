For 
To apply IDAA (Decomposition and Application to the Classification of Defective Arguments) to the statement "You can't be my partner in class because you didn't donate to the Hurricane Sandy fundraiser," let's break down the task into specific steps to identify which defective argument type it might belong to.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D):
1. **Identify the Proposition (P) and the Reason (R):**
   - **P:** "You can't be my partner in class."
   - **R:** "Because you didn't donate to the Hurricane Sandy fundraiser."

2. **Evaluate the Reason (R) for potential defects:**
   - Determine if the Reason (R) sufficiently supports the Proposition (P).
   - Check for any common defective argument types: Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Presumptuous Consensus, Ambiguous Language Use.

3. **Classify the defective argument type:**
   - Compare the Reason (R) against the defective argument types to see which it best matches.

### Step-by-Step Evaluation and Classification:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P) and the Reason (R):**
   - **P:** "You can't be my partner in class."
   - **R:** "Because you didn't donate to the Hurricane Sandy fundraiser."

2. **Evaluate the Reason (R) for potential defects:**

3. **Classify the defective argument type:**

- **Generalization (G):** This doesn't seem to be a Generalization as it is a specific instance rather than an assertion based on insufficient data applied universally.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This isn't incomplete enumeration because there is no list of possibilities being claimed as exhaustive here.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Let's consider this: The reason given does not directly explain why not donating would prevent being a class partner. The lack of a donation appears unrelated to the ability to partner in class activities, making it not a conclusive reason.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reason provided does not appear strong or relevant enough to establish the proposition. There is no compelling connection between not donating and class participation, supporting the classification as WCB.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason is not a mere repetition of the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** It does not assume universal agreement on a point that is still in dispute.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The reason is clear and unambiguous in its intended meaning.

The Reason offered does not compel belief in the Proposition because there is no strong logical connection between the two; therefore, 

### Classification:
The argument "You can't be my partner in class because you didn't donate to the Hurricane Sandy fundraiser" most closely resembles **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The causal link between not donating to the fundraiser and being a class partner is weak and insufficient to establish the truth of the proposition.
