For 
To apply the process of <IDAA> to the given dialogue, we need to perform the following steps, which represent the specific steps involved in the decomposition of the advanced task <t> (in this case, classifying the argument as of a specific type of defective argument <IDA>).

### Step 1: Break Down the Argument

First, decompose the dialogue to understand the propositions and reasons stated by each speaker.

1. **Mike's Proposition (P):** "It is morally wrong to cheat on your spouse."
2. **Ken's Challenge:** "But what is morality exactly?"
3. **Mike's Reason (R):** "It’s a code of conduct shared by cultures."
4. **Ken's Further Challenge:** "But who creates this code?"

### Step 2: Evaluate Each Component

Next, evaluate each identified component of the argument for potential defects based on the definitions provided.

#### Check for Generalization (G)
- Generalization is where the proposition is based on some part or majority but not all, and it's taken to mean all.
- There is no evidence of Mike generalizing in his initial proposition.

#### Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
- Incomplete Enumeration occurs when claiming completeness while missing possibilities.
- There are no multiple possibilities listed that Mike is claiming to be complete.

#### Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR)
- Inconclusive Reason is when the reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
- Mike's reason ("It’s a code of conduct shared by cultures") does not conclusively establish the claim "morally wrong to cheat," as this is more an assertion of what morality is rather than why it's wrong to cheat.

#### Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
- Insufficient Causal Basis is where the causal basis is weak or not compelling.
- "It’s a code of conduct shared by cultures" might be considered an insufficient causal basis because it does not deeply explain why cheating is morally wrong; it assumes that shared codes are inherently correct without proof.

#### Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition is when the reason (R) says the same thing as the proposition (P).
- Mike’s reason (R) does not merely restate the proposition (P); it attempts to define "morality."

#### Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
- Presumptuous Consensus is assuming that something is universally agreed upon though it's still in dispute.
- There is no specific proposition assumed as certain based on universal agreement in Mike's statements.

#### Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)
- Ambiguous Language Use is when a proof or reason can be interpreted in another sense than intended.
- The term "morality" can be ambiguous, but no specific use seems ambiguous in a compelling way in Mike's statements.

### Step 3: Classify the Dialogue

Based on the analysis, we identify that the most applicable defective argument type is related to inconclusive reasoning. 

### Conclusion
The classification task <IDA> applied to the given string:
"Mike: It is morally wrong to cheat on your spouse, why on earth would you have done that?
Ken: But what is morality exactly?
Mike: It’s a code of conduct shared by cultures.
Ken: But who creates this code?..."

**Result:** <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)

Mike's reasoning does not conclusively demonstrate why it is morally wrong to cheat on one's spouse; it only generically states what morality might entail without linking it solidly to the specific action of cheating.
