For 
To apply the task of identifying a defective argument (\<IDA>) to the statement "Everyone is doing the Low-Carb Diet," we need to decompose this task (\<D>) into specific steps. Here is the step-by-step process for the application of \(\<D>\) to \(\<IDA>\) (which is \(\<IDAA>\)):

### Step-by-Step Process for \(\<IDAA>\):

1. **Identify the Proposition (\<P>)**: Determine the core assertion or claim made in the statement.

2. **Analyze the Reasoning (\<R>)**: Examine the causal basis or reason if provided for the proposition.

3. **Examine the Proof of Reason (\<PR>)**: Check for any additional arguments that support the reason.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**: Based on the definitions provided, classify the argument into one of the defective argument types: Generalization (\<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP>).

Now, let's apply this process to the provided string "Everyone is doing the Low-Carb Diet."

### Application of \(\<IDAA>\):

1. **Identify the Proposition (\<P>)**:
   - The proposition (\<P>) in the statement is: "Everyone is doing the Low-Carb Diet."
   - This is the core assertion being made.

2. **Analyze the Reasoning (\<R>)**:
   - In this specific case, the statement does not provide reasoning or a causal basis for the proposition. It is merely stating a claim.

3. **Examine the Proof of Reason (\<PR>)**:
   - There is no additional proof or argument provided to support the reasoning. The statement stands alone without further corroboration.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**:
   - The proposition (\<P>) "Everyone is doing the Low-Carb Diet" is making a broad and sweeping assertion about the behavior of an entire population.
   - This type of argument fits the definition of Generalization (\<G>), which states that the proposition is based on some part or majority but not necessarily applicable to all and is erroneously referred to all.
   - There is no evidence provided to support that literally "everyone" is doing the Low-Carb Diet, which makes the claim an overgeneralization.

### Conclusion:

The string "Everyone is doing the Low-Carb Diet" is classified as a Generalization (\<G>) defective argument type.

This classification is made because the proposition asserts something about all individuals based on the possible behavior of a subset or without sufficient evidence to substantiate the claim about "everyone."
