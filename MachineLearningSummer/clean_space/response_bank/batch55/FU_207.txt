For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given argument "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. You can't give me a ticket for doing what every other driver on the road was also doing.", we need to decompose the classification task <IDA> into specific steps <D>. Here's the step-by-step decomposition:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
Identify what the speaker intends to prove.
- **Proposition (P)**: "You can't give me a ticket for driving as fast as everyone around me."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
Identify the reason provided for why the Proposition is true.
- **Reason (R)**: "I was only driving as fast as everyone around me."

### Step 3: Analyze the Reason <R>
Determine if the Reason supports the Proposition in a valid manner or if it's defective.

### Step 4: Classify the Potential Defective Argument Type (if any)
Using the definitions of defective arguments, classify the Reason <R> if it falls under any of the types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step 5: Match the Argument to the Defective Argument Type
Compare <R> to the definitions and classify accordingly:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: <P> applies an assertion about one or some to all.
   - Not applicable here.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: <P> claims a complete list but misses pertinent possibilities.
   - Not applicable here.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: <R> does not conclusively demonstrate <P>.
   - This could be applicable. The reason "everyone else was doing it" does not conclusively justify that one cannot get a ticket.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis for <P> is not compelling.
   - This could also be applicable as simply following others does not provide a compelling legal reason against the ticket.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Reason <R> is the same as <P>.
   - Not applicable here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: <PR> is assumed as certain because "it is universally agreed upon."
   - Not exactly applicable here.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: <PR> is ambiguous.
   - Not applicable here.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the given argument "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. You can't give me a ticket for doing what every other driver on the road was also doing." can be classified as either <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) or <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).

- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: The reason provided does not conclusively justify that one cannot get a ticket.
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The fact that everyone was doing it is not a compelling reason to avoid a ticket.

In summary, the argument can primarily be classified as <IR> with a secondary possibility of <WCB>.
