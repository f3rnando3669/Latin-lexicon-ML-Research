For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string into defective argument types) to the statement "Drivers in Richmond are terrible. Why does everyone in a big city drive like that?", let's break down the process into specific steps.

### Step 1: Identify Specific Claims
Identify what propositions (\<P\>) are being presented in the statement.

- **Claim 1**: "Drivers in Richmond are terrible."
- **Claim 2**: "Why does everyone in a big city drive like that?"

### Step 2: Analyze Each Claim
Determine what type of argument each claim represents. We need to see if any claims fit the defective argument types (\<G\>, \<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<RR\>, \<WCB\>, \<FU\>, or \<DEP\>).

#### Analyzing Claim 1: "Drivers in Richmond are terrible."
1. **Generalization (\<G\>)** - This statement could be a generalization because it takes an undefined set of behaviors observed in Richmond and attributes them universally to all drivers in Richmond.
   
2. **Is it a Proof of Reason (\<PR\>)?**
   - No, Claim 1 is not presented as supporting another proposition and does not fit the criteria for a Proof of Reason.

3. **Other Defective Argument Types:**
   - It does not fall into (\<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<RR\>, \<WCB\>, \<FU\>, or \<DEP\>) based on the given information.

After analysis, Claim 1 fits the type **Generalization (\<G\>)** because it makes a sweeping assertion about all drivers in Richmond based on unstated and possibly limited observations.

#### Analyzing Claim 2: "Why does everyone in a big city drive like that?"
1. **Generalization (\<G\>)** - This statement implies that everyone in big cities drives in the same terrible way, without sufficient evidence to support such a sweeping claim.
   
2. **Is it a Proof of Reason (\<PR\>)?**
   - No, this question implies a proposition rather than providing a proof for another statement.
   
3. **Other Defective Argument Types:**
   - It does not fall into (\<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<RR\>, \<WCB\>, \<FU\>, or \<DEP\>) based on the given information.

After analysis, Claim 2 fits the type **Generalization (\<G\>)** because it extends the behavior observed in Richmond to all drivers in all big cities unjustifiably.

### Step 3: Classify the String
Integrate the analysis into a final classification.

- **Claim 1**: "Drivers in Richmond are terrible." - **Generalization (\<G\>)**
- **Claim 2**: "Why does everyone in a big city drive like that?" - **Generalization (\<G\>)**

Thus, the statement "Drivers in Richmond are terrible. Why does everyone in a big city drive like that?" can be classified as a **Generalization (\<G\>)** because both claims are making broad assertions not necessarily supported by comprehensive evidence.

### Summary
By decomposing and analyzing the statements step by step, we classify the given string as:

**<G>** - Generalization
