For 
To apply <IDAA> (decomposition of the task IDA) to classify the argument "There you are cheating on your husband, how could you ever tell us anything meaningful about ethics?" as one of the defective argument types, we need to break down the process into specific steps. Here we go:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>) in the Argument**
- Proposition: The main assertion being made in the argument.
- In this case: "You cannot tell us anything meaningful about ethics."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>) in the Argument**
- Reason: The causal basis given for the proposition.
- In this case: "You are cheating on your husband."

**Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>) in the Argument**
- Proof of Reason: Additional arguments that corroborate the reason.
- In this case, the argument doesn't provide additional proof; it's directly linking the act of cheating to the inability to speak meaningfully about ethics.

**Step 4: Analyze the Relationship Between <P>, <R>, and <PR>**
- Determine if the reason provided genuinely supports the proposition or if it's flawed.
- Here, the reason (cheating on your husband) is being used to challenge the person's ability to speak on ethics (proposition), but it doesn't logically follow that a single act disqualifies someone from speaking about ethics.

**Step 5: Match the Argument's Flaws to Defective Argument Types**
- Generalization (<G>): Does the argument make an unqualified generalization? No, it's not a generalization.
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>): Does the argument miss out on other possibilities? Doesn't seem specific to complete enumeration.
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>): Does the reason not conclusively support the proposition? Yes, the fact that someone cheats on their husband doesnâ€™t conclusively mean they can't say anything meaningful about ethics.
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>): Is the causal basis weak? Yes, the action of cheating is not directly related to the capability of discussing ethics comprehensively.
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>): Does the reason just repeat the proposition? No, they are two distinct statements.
- Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>): Is there a presumed consensus? No, it doesn't rely on universal agreement.
- Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>): Is there ambiguous language? No apparent ambiguity here.

**Final Classification:**
Based on the analysis, the argument primarily fits the defective argument type <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) because the reason provided (cheating on husband) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (that the person cannot say anything meaningful about ethics). It also exhibits <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) because the causal link between personal actions and the ability to discuss ethics meaningfully is weak and not compelling. 

Thus, we classify the argument as primarily <IR> with an aspect of <WCB>.
