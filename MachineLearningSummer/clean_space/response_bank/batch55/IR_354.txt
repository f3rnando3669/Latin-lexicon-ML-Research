For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition and step-by-step analysis) to classify the given statement, "You didn’t even finish high school, how could you possibly know about this?", we need to break down the task of identifying the argument defect and analyze each component. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) in the statement:**
   - The core assertion is the statement that the speaker is challenging someone’s capability or knowledge based on their educational background.
   - Proposition (<P>): "You possibly cannot know about this."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>) given in the statement:**
   - The reason provided to support the proposition is that the person did not finish high school.
   - Reason (<R>): "You didn’t even finish high school."

3. **Check if the Reason (<R>) conclusively supports the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Assess if completing or not completing high school conclusively determines a person’s knowledge about a particular topic.
   - In this context, non-completion of high school does not definitively determine the level of knowledge on specific issues for an individual.

4. **Match with the known defective argument types:**
   - **Generalization (G)**: This is where a proposition is based on one part or majority but is generalized to all. However, our statement isn't a generalization of a group but rather an individual’s claim.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This concerns missing out on possibilities when enumerating. Not relevant here.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: An <R> that does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the <P>. This seems to fit as non-completion of high school does not wholly negate someone's knowledge on all subjects.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This involves a weak causal basis for <P>. This might apply because the reasoning is insufficient to support the conclusion definitively.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: When the <R> restates <P>. Not applicable here as the reason is different from the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assuming something is certain because it’s universally agreed. Not relevant here.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The argument does not appear to be based on ambiguity.

### Conclusion
After a detailed analysis, the most fitting classification for the statement "You didn’t even finish high school, how could you possibly know about this?" would be either **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** or **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

Given that the proposition’s correctness isn't conclusively demonstrated by the reason, the statement most closely aligns with **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. The reasoning that non-completion of high school equates to a lack of knowledge is not conclusively demonstrating the lack of knowledge on the topic at hand. 

Therefore, the defective type for this argument is best identified as **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
