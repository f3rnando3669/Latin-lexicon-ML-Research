For 
To apply IDAA to the given argument "All stars are exploding balls of gas. Miley Cyrus is a star. Therefore, Miley Cyrus is an exploding ball of gas," we need to decompose the task of classifying the argument defects step by step.

Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- The proposition is the statement that we intend to prove: "Miley Cyrus is an exploding ball of gas."

Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- The reason sets forth the causal basis for the proposition: "Miley Cyrus is a star."

Step 3: Identify the additional arguments supporting the Reason (<PR>)
- In this case, the argument does not provide an explicit additional justification beyond what has been stated as the reason.

Step 4: Analyze the argument's structure and identify which, if any, of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP>) apply

Let's break this down with the defined defective argument types:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: This would occur if the argument overgeneralizes from a limited sample. This doesn't quite fit our case directly.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This isn't about an incomplete listing of all possibilities.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This might apply if the reason given does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition. However, this seems broader than necessary for this analysis.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Similar to Inconclusive Reason, this would apply if the reason isn't compelling.

- **Faulty Repetition (<RR>)**: This defect relates to repetition of the proposition in place of a reason, which isn't present here.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This defect relies on falsely assuming universal agreement, which doesnâ€™t apply directly.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: This defect involves language that can be taken in another sense. The word "star" can be taken in an astronomical sense versus a celebrity sense, indicating ambiguous language use.

The nearest fitting defective argument type seems to be **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)** given the wordplay on "star." The key term "star" can be understood in one sense as an astronomical body and in another sense as a famous person, leading to a misleading conclusion.

Step 5: Classify the argument defect according to the analysis
- The argument should be classified as **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**.

### Conclusion
By following the decomposition steps, the argument "All stars are exploding balls of gas. Miley Cyrus is a star. Therefore, Miley Cyrus is an exploding ball of gas" is classified as type <DEP> due to ambiguous language use.
