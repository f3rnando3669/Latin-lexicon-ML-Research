For 
To apply the process \( \text{IDAA} \) to the string \( s \) "She is good at writing because she writes words effectively," we will decompose the task of classifying the argument \( s \) into specific steps and then apply these steps to identify the type of defective argument.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of \( t \) into \( D \):

1. **Identify the Proposition ( \( P \) ) of the Argument:**
   - The Proposition \( P \) is the statement that sets forth what we intend to prove.

2. **Identify the Reason ( \( R \) ) of the Argument:**
   - The Reason \( R \) sets forth the causal basis for \( P \), establishing the truth of what we are urging.

3. **Determine if the Argument is Defective:**
   - Evaluate if the \( R \) provided conclusively demonstrates the correctness of \( P \).

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type Based on Given Categories:**
   - Compare the observed defect in the argument with the defined defective argument types \( G \), \( FE \), \( IR \), \( RR \), \( WCB \), \( FU \), and \( DEP \).

### Application of \( D \) to \( IDA \):

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition \( P \) of the Argument

- In the string \( s \): "She is good at writing because she writes words effectively."
- The Proposition \( P \) is: "She is good at writing."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason \( R \) of the Argument

- The Reason \( R \) is: "because she writes words effectively."

#### Step 3: Determine if the Argument is Defective

- We need to evaluate if \( R \) ("because she writes words effectively") provides a compelling, conclusive basis for \( P \) ("She is good at writing").

#### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type Based on Given Categories

- **Generalization ( \( G \) ):** Not applicable here; the argument is not making a broad assertion based on a small or incorrect sample.
- **Incomplete Enumeration ( \( FE \) ):** Not applicable here, as the argument is not claiming to consider all possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason ( \( IR \) ):** Not applicable, as the reason is not necessarily inconclusive for proving the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis ( \( WCB \) ):** Plausible, but “writing words effectively” could be a strong reason depending on context.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition ( \( RR \) ):** This matches because the reason ("she writes words effectively") is essentially restating the proposition ("she is good at writing") without providing new, distinct evidence.
- **Presumptuous Consensus ( \( FU \) ):** Not applicable, as there’s no presumption of universal agreement in the provided statement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use ( \( DEP \) ):** Not applicable, as the language appears clear and not subject to different interpretations.

Hence, the defective argument type is:

### Faulty Repetition of Proposition ( \( RR \) )

- **Classification:** The argument \( "She is good at writing because she writes words effectively." \) falls under \( \text{RR} \) (Faulty Repetition of Proposition). The Reason \( R \) simply restates the Proposition \( P \) without providing additional, independent evidence.
