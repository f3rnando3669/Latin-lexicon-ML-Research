For 
To apply IDAA (decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument) to the given sentence, let's break down each step systematically:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   The proposition in the sentence is: "Colgate is the best toothpaste."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   The reason provided in the sentence is: "because almost 90% of dentists approve of this."

3. **Evaluate the Reason against the Types of Defective Arguments:**
   Now, we need to see if the reason provided falls under any of the defective argument types defined earlier.

   - **Generalization (<G>):** This fallacy occurs when an assertion based on some part or the majority of individuals is applied to all.
     - It doesn't seem like a generalization fallacy, as 90% is explicitly mentioned.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This occurs when a proposition claims to cover all possibilities but misses some.
     - The Proposition doesn't enumerate possibilities.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This occurs when the reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
     - The approval of 90% of dentists suggests strong support, but doesn't directly lead to being the 'best', making it potentially inconclusive.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This happens when the causal basis for the reason is weak.
     - Approvals from 90% of dentists can be seen as a strong causal basis but whether this makes it ‘the best’ can be questioned.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This happens when the reason just repeats the proposition.
     - The reason doesn’t repeat the Proposition verbatim; hence, not <RR>.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This occurs when a reason is assumed to be true because it's claimed to be universally agreed upon.
     - The approval of 90% of dentists is a specific number, not an assumed universal agreement.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** This occurs when the reason can be taken in another sense than intended.
     - The stated percentage doesn’t seem ambiguous in itself.

4. **Determine the Fallacy Type:**
   - The provided reason (90% dentist approval) is statistical but doesn’t necessarily mean Colgate is the “best” toothpaste for every aspect (effectiveness, flavor, price, etc.).
   - Arguably, it makes the reasoning fall under **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** because 90% approval by dentists does not conclusively establish that Colgate is the “best” toothpaste. "Best" can be subjective and multifaceted, which the statistic alone does not account for.

**Conclusion:**
The fallacy being committed in the sentence "My mom said that Colgate is the best toothpaste because almost 90% of dentists approve of this." is primarily an **"Inconclusive Reason (IR)"**.
