For 
To classify the given statement "Teacher: If I let you go to the bathroom pretty soon everybody will want to go to the bathroom." as one of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>), we need to apply the process of decomposition <D> to the task <IDA>:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
Determine what the statement is trying to prove or establish.

- **Proposition (<P>):** The teacher's statement implies that allowing one student to go to the bathroom will lead to many, or all, students wanting to go as well.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Determine the justification given for the proposition.

- **Reason (<R>):** The justification given is the causal link that permitting one student will lead to an influx of all students wanting the same.

### Step 3: Classify the Defective Argument Type
Examine the statement against each defective argument type definition:

- **Generalization (<G>):** The <P> (everybody will want to go to the bathroom) is based on an observation about allowing one person. This jumps from an individual instance to a general outcome for the entire group.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The statement does not cover all possible consequences but focuses on one potential outcome.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Does the <R> conclusively support <P>? No strong evidence.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Is the causal link compelling? It relies on assumption rather than facts.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** <R> repeats <P>? No exact repetition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Assumed universal agreement? Not applicable.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Potential multiple interpretations? Not really applicable.

### Step 4: Compare and Determine the Closest Fit
Evaluate the statement "If I let you go to the bathroom pretty soon everybody will want to go to the bathroom" in light of the defective argument classifications:

- **Closest Fit:** Generalization (<G>)

### Conclusion
The statement is best classified as a **Generalization (<G>)** because it asserts that allowing one student to go to the bathroom will necessarily lead to all students wanting to go, which is an overgeneralization from a single instance to a broader, less certain outcome.
