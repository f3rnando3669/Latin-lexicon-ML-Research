For 
To apply **IDAA** to the statement "My opponent raised a good point, but can we trust him? I mean he just moved to town only 5 months ago, how much could he really know?", we will follow specific steps to decompose the task of classifying this defective argument. Here are the steps in detail:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: 
   The proposition is the main point being asserted or the claim being made.
   - In this case, the implicit proposition seems to be: "We should not trust my opponent's point."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: 
   The reason is the justification given for the proposition.
   - Here, the reason given is: "My opponent just moved to town only 5 months ago."

3. **Classify the Defective Argument**:
   We need to determine which type of defective argument this is by analyzing the reason provided in relation to the proposition.

   - **Generalization (<G>)**: This doesn't fit because the proposition isn't based on an over-generalized assertion.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This isn't applicable because there's no claim of complete enumeration of possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason given (opponent's recent move) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (distrust of opponent's point). 
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reason provided (moving recently) is weak and not a compelling causal basis to distrust the opponentâ€™s point.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The reason doesn't repeat the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: There's no assumption of consensus.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: There is no ambiguity in language use here.

4. **Conclusion**:
   Based on the analysis, the argument most closely fits <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) because the reason given (opponent's recent move) does not provide a strong justification for the proposition (distrust of opponent's point).

Therefore, the defective argument type for "My opponent raised a good point, but can we trust him? I mean he just moved to town only 5 months ago, how much could he really know?" is **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason).
