For 
To apply the IDAA process to the string "A lion is a cat and cats are good pets so a lion must be a good pet," we'll decompose the task of classifying the string as one of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP) into specific steps, and then execute the steps.

1. **Identify the components of the argument:**
   - **Proposition (P):** What the argument intends to prove.
   - **Reason (R):** The causal basis for the proposition.
   - **Proof of Reason (PR):** Corroborates the reason with additional arguments.

2. **Break down the argument:**
   - Proposition (P): "A lion must be a good pet."
   - Reason (R): "A lion is a cat and cats are good pets."
   - Proof of Reason (PR): Not explicitly provided, but implied by the statement connecting "cats are good pets" to "a lion must be a good pet."

3. **Evaluate the Propositions and Reasons:**
   - Check for defective argument types:
     - **Generalization (G):** Is the proposition a generalization improperly applied to all members?
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Does the argument miss out on pertinent possibilities?
     - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does the reason conclusively demonstrate the correctness?
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the causal basis for the reason weak or uncompelling?
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Does the reason repeat the proposition?
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Is the proof of reason assumed to be certain due to "universal agreement"?
     - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Is there ambiguous language in the proof of reason?

4. **Classify the Argument:**
   - Examine if "A lion is a cat and cats are good pets" validly supports "A lion must be a good pet."

**Application of the steps:**

1. **Proposition (P):** "A lion must be a good pet."
2. **Reason (R):** "A lion is a cat and cats are good pets."

**Evaluation:**
- The reason provided, "A lion is a cat and cats are good pets," does not conclusively demonstrate that "a lion must be a good pet." The basis for this reasoning is incomplete because it ignores the significant and obvious differences between lions (wild animals) and domestic cats (house pets).
  
**Defective Argument Type:**
- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The causal basis that lions should be good pets because they are cats (and some cats are good pets) is weak and uncompelling. The reason fails to address the critical dissimilarity between domestic cats and wild lions, specifically regarding characteristics that make an animal a good pet.

Therefore, the argument "A lion is a cat and cats are good pets so a lion must be a good pet" is classified as **<WCB>** (Insufficient Causal Basis).
