For 
To apply the task of identifying defective argument types (IDA) to the given string, we'll need to follow these steps as part of IDAA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P) in the statement**.
2. **Identify the Reason (R) in the statement**.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR) if present in the statement**.
4. **Classify the statement as one of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP)**.

Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The Proposition (P) is the main claim the argument intends to prove.

For the given string, the Proposition is:
"Boris is not qualified to make suggestions about our penal system."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The Reason (R) sets forth the causal basis for the Proposition.

For the given string, the Reason is:
"As an ex-convict, he would always take the criminalsâ€™ side."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
In this case, the argument doesn't explicitly provide a Proof of Reason (PR).

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type
We need to classify the identified components against the types of defective arguments (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP):

- **Generalization (G)**: The statement is not generalizing from a sample to a whole population.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This doesn't seem to enumerate possibilities incompletely.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The Reason given does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition that Boris cannot make suggestions about the penal system. Being an ex-convict does not inherently mean he would "always take the criminals' side"; it is not sufficient to prove the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis (being an ex-convict = always taking criminals' side) is not compelling or strong enough to support the proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason does not repeat the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument doesn't claim universal consensus.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language here is not ambiguous, but rather the causation is weak.

### Conclusion
The most fitting defective argument type for the given string is:
- **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**: The Reason (R) given does not conclusively demonstrate the truth of the Proposition (P).

So we classify the string as **IR**.
