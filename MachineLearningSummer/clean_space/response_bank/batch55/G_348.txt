For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to the string "If you don't study, you'll fail your test. Then you will do poorly in the class and your GPA will fall. You won't get into a good college, so you'll never get a decent job and you'll end up poor and homeless." we first decompose the task \( \text{IDA} \) into specific steps. 

Here’s a breakdown of what \( \text{IDAA} \) looks like when applied to \( \text{IDA} \):

1. **Identify the Proposition (\<P\>)**:
   - Identify the main claim or summary statement which is intended to be proven.

2. **Identify the Reason (\<R\>)**:
   - Identify the causal basis that supports the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\<PR\>)**:
   - Examine the arguments provided to corroborate the reason.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**:
   - Based on the definitions provided (\<G\>, \<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<RR\>, \<WCB\>, \<FU\>, or \<DEP\>), classify the defective argument type present in the string if any.

Now, let’s apply these steps to the provided string:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\<P\>)**:
The main claim here appears to be the final outcome stated in the argument:
- "You’ll end up poor and homeless."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (\<R\>)**:
The causal basis leading to this proposition is:
- "If you don't study, you'll fail your test. Then you will do poorly in the class and your GPA will fall. You won’t get into a good college, so you'll never get a decent job."

**Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (\<PR\>)**:
Examine the arguments leading to the reason:
- A series of conditional statements: "If you don’t study, you’ll fail your test." → "Then you will do poorly in the class and your GPA will fall." → "You won’t get into a good college." → "You’ll never get a decent job."

**Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type**:
Review the types of defective arguments (\<G\>, \<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<RR\>, \<WCB\>, \<FU\>, or \<DEP\>):

- **Generalization (\<G\>)**: Applies to claims about the majority or parts being extended improperly to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)**: Applies where not all possibilities are considered.
- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**: Applies where the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**: Applies where the causal basis is weak.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)**: Applies where the reason repeats the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)**: Applies where the proof relies on presumed consensus.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)**: Applies where the language is ambiguous.

In the provided string:

- The argument string follows a chain of highly speculative consequences.
- Each conditional statement is reliant on the truth of the preceding one but lacks strong evidence or causal linkage.

Thus, the defective argument type here is predominantly **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**, because the string assumes a very weak or speculative series of causes to establish an extreme outcome ('you'll end up poor and homeless') without compelling proof.

***Conclusion:***
The string "If you don't study, you'll fail your test. Then you will do poorly in the class and you GPA will fall. You won't get into a good college, so you'll never get a decent job and you'll end up poor and homeless." should be classified under the defective argument type **\<WCB\>**.
