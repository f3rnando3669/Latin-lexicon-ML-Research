For 
To apply \(<IDAA>\) to the string "I am going into surgery tomorrow so please pray for me.  If enough people pray for me, God will protect me from harm and see to it that I have a successful surgery and speedy recovery," let's decompose the task \(<IDA>\) into specific steps and then classify the string.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition \(<D>\) of \(<IDA>\):

1. **Identify the Proposition (\(P\))**: Determine the main assertion or claim that is intended to be proven.
2. **Identify the Reason (\(R\))**: Determine the causal basis provided to support the \(P\).
3. **Identify Proof of Reason (\(PR\))**: Check for any additional arguments used to corroborate the reason.
4. **Classify Defective Arguments**: Determine if the argument falls into one of the defective types \(<G>\), \(<FE>\), \(<IR>\), \(<RR>\), \(<WCB>\), \(<FU>\), or \(<DEP>\).

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\(P\))

The main proposition (\(P\)):
"If enough people pray for me, God will protect me from harm and see to it that I have a successful surgery and speedy recovery."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\(R\))

The given reason (\(R\)):
"Please pray for me."

### Step 3: Identify Proof of Reason (\(PR\))

The statement does not explicitly include a proof of reason (\(PR\)) in the form of additional arguments. Hence we proceed without identifying \(PR\).

### Step 4: Classify Defective Arguments

#### Type <G> (Generalization)
- This doesn't seem to be a generalization from a specific part to the whole.

#### Type <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)
- The argument does not enumerate possibilities, so incomplete enumeration is not applicable.

#### Type <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)
- The reason provided ("Please pray for me") does not conclusively establish that "God will protect me from harm and see to it that I have a successful surgery and speedy recovery." The causal connection between prayer and the outcome is not sufficiently demonstrated.

#### Type <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)
- The statement "Please pray for me" does not merely repeat the proposition in different words, so this type is not applicable.

#### Type <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)
- The reason provided does not offer a compelling causal basis for the proposition. The assumption that enough people praying will lead to successful surgery and protection by God is not backed by a compelling rationale.

#### Type <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)
- There is no mention of universal agreement on the matter, so this type is not applicable.

#### Type <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)
- There is no ambiguous language in the sense that alternative interpretations could change the meaning significantly.

### Classification of the Argument

The argument primarily fits the following types:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (\(IR\))**: The reason that "Please pray for me" does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition that "God will protect me from harm and see to it that I have a successful surgery and speedy recovery."
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(WCB\))**: The causal basis for the proposition is weak as the reasoning provided is not compelling.

Therefore, the string "I am going into surgery tomorrow so please pray for me. If enough people pray for me, God will protect me from harm and see to it that I have a successful surgery and speedy recovery." can be classified as: **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
