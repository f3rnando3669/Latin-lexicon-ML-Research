To apply the decomposition of the advanced task IDA (classifying the given string as a defective argument type) into specific steps, let's go through the task methodically.

1. **Initial Reading and Understanding of the String**:
   The given string is: "Even though people say we are going to behave; we know they won't behave well."

2. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   The main proposition appears to be: "They won't behave well."

3. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   The reason given for the proposition is: "People say we are going to behave."

4. **Analyze the Reason and the Proposition Relationship**:
   Here, it is important to see how the reason relates to the proposition. The structure indicates a contrast or doubt towards what people are saying versus what will actually happen.

5. **Map the Argument onto Potential Defects**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: This does not generalize across all members of a group based on the action of a few.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This is not about claiming a complete enumeration of possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: If the reason does not conclusively support the proposition, it could be IR. "People say we are going to behave" does not logically lead directly to “They won't behave well.”
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal connection here is presumed but not compelling.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason is not merely a repetition of the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There is no assertion here that the point is universally agreed upon.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language does not seem ambiguous as used.

From here, the task is to narrow down the exact type of defective argument by closer analysis:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Step 1: Evaluate if <IR> or <WCB> Fits**:
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Look at whether the reason (what people say) conclusively supports the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Assess whether the causal basis is compelling.

2. **Step 2: Evaluate the Reasoning**:
   - The reason given ("people say we are going to behave") does not strongly support the proposition ("we know they won't behave well").
   - The presumed behavior prediction is contrasted with the assertion of behavior, but the causal link is weak or insufficient.

3. **Conclusion**:
   Based on the steps, the weak causal connection most closely fits the description of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

### Result:

Applying IDAA to "Even though people say we are going to behave; we know they won't behave well," we classify the defective argument type as **<WCB>** — Insufficient Causal Basis.
