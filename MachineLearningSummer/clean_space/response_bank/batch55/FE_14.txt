For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "If it wasn't a missile, a bomb, or mechanical failure, then all that's left is a meteorite," we need to decompose the task of identifying the defective argument into specific steps. Here, I will follow the decomposition and apply it to the given statement.

**Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>):**

1. Identify the Proposition (<P>) in the statement.
2. Identify the Reason (<R>) given for the Proposition.
3. Assess if there is a Proof of Reason (<PR>), corroborating the <R>.
4. Determine if the Proposition or the Reason fits any of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

**Applying <D> to "If it wasn't a missile, a bomb, or mechanical failure, then all that's left is a meteorite":**

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - The proposition here appears to be: "All that's left is a meteorite."
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - The reason given is: "If it wasn't a missile, a bomb, or mechanical failure."
   
3. **Assess if there is a Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - The statement seems to lack an additional argument that corroborates the reason; it's merely presenting possibilities without further evidence.
   
4. **Determine if the Proposition or the Reason fits any of the defective argument types**:
   - Let's evaluate the argument for each type of defect:

   - **<G> Generalization**:
     - The argument doesn't attempt to generalize from a single instance or a majority of instances.
   
   - **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**:
     - The statement claims to have exhausted all possible explanations (missile, bomb, or mechanical failure) and concludes that only a meteorite remains. However, it ignores other potential explanations, such as sabotage, pilot error, etc. Hence, the argument fits into the type <FE> because it fails to account for other pertinent possibilities.

   - **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**:
     - The Reason provided doesn't conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition. The elimination process might be flawed if it hasn't considered all possible scenarios.

   - **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**:
     - The Reason does not merely repeat the Proposition; it attempts to justify it through elimination.

   - **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**:
     - Without further context, we can’t immediately determine if the causal basis is weak, but it might be arguable due to insufficient exploration of possibilities.
   
   - **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**:
     - The statement doesn’t rely on a presumed consensus for its validity.
   
   - **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**:
     - The language in the statement doesn’t seem ambiguous in presenting the reasoning.

**Conclusion:**
The argument best fits into the defective type **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**. The claim to have covered all possibilities and concluded a meteorite is faulty because it fails to consider other potential causes.

So, the classification <s> = "If it wasn't a missile, a bomb, or mechanical failure, then all that's left is a meteorite" as of type <FE>.
