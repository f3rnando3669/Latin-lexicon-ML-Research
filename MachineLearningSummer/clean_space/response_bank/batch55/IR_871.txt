Sure, let's apply the decomposition of the <IDA> task to categorize the given argument. Here are the specific steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The proposition is the main claim that the argument is trying to assert. 
   - In this case, <P> is: "I believe evolution is true."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason provides the causal basis for the proposition.
   - Here, the <R> is: "Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist and perhaps the foremost expert in the field, says that evolution is true."

3. **Evaluate the Reason (<R>):**
   - We need to check whether the reason provided is strong and compelling enough to establish the truth of the proposition.
   - The reason given is an appeal to authority, specifically to Richard Dawkins.

4. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - This involves corroborating the reason through further argumentation or evidence. 
   - In this argument, there is no additional proof provided; it relies solely on the authority of Richard Dawkins.

5. **Check for Defective Arguments:**
   - Compare the identified <P>, <R>, and absence of <PR> against the types of defective arguments.

Let's analyze for defective argument types:

- **Generalization (<G>):**
  - Not applicable here, as the proposition is a belief, not a generalization.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
  - Not applicable here, as the argument doesn’t involve enumerating possibilities.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
  - Applicable, because relying solely on authority doesn’t conclusively establish the correctness of evolution.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
  - Also applicable, because the causal basis (authority of Richard Dawkins) is not compelling enough to prove the truth of evolution.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
  - Not applicable here; the reason is not a repetition of the proposition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
  - Not applicable here, as it’s not arguing that "it is universally agreed upon."

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
  - Not applicable; the argument does not hinge on ambiguous language.

From the analysis, the argument "Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist and perhaps the foremost expert in the field, says that evolution is true. Therefore, I believe it's true." classifies as:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason provided (authority of Richard Dawkins) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (belief in evolution).
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal basis given (authority appeal) is not compelling enough to establish the truth of the proposition.

Hence, the argument falls under both <IR> and <WCB>.
