For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "My opponent suggests that lowering taxes will be a good idea, this is coming from a woman who eats a pint of Ben and Jerry's each night!", we need to decompose the task into specific steps and classify the argument defectively.

Here is the decomposition of the task (D) into specific steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine the main statement or assertion that is being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Determine the causal basis that is being used to support the Proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**: Determine if there are additional arguments or evidence used to corroborate the Reason.
4. **Classify the Defect (IDA)**: Based on the definitions provided, classify the defect in the argument.

Now, let's apply these steps to the given string:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - The Proposition in the argument is: "My opponent suggests that lowering taxes will be a good idea."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - The Reason provided is: "this is coming from a woman who eats a pint of Ben and Jerry's each night!"

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   - There is no additional argument or evidence provided to substantiate the Reason; the Reason itself is being used to undermine the Proposition.

4. **Classify the Defect (IDA)**:
   - The Reason provided does not relate logically to the Proposition. It does not offer a valid causal basis to negate the Proposition. Instead, it attacks the character of the person making the argument rather than addressing the substance of the argument itself.
   - This type of defective argument is known as an **ad hominem** fallacy, which wasn't directly defined in your provided categories. However, based on the definitions:
     - It closely aligns with **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the Reason (R) given does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness or incorrectness of the Proposition (P). 

Therefore, the defective argument type for the given string is best classified as **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the Reason provided is irrelevant to the truth or falsity of the Proposition.
