To apply the IDAA (application of decomposition of task) to the classification of a given argument, we need to break down the IDA task into specific steps. Here is how we can approach it:

### Decomposition of the Task (D) into Specific Steps
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine what is being asserted or claimed in the argument.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the basis or justification provided for the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Look for any support or evidence given to corroborate the reason.
4. **Check for Defective Argument Types**: Evaluate the argument against the defined defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

Now let's apply these steps to the given argument: 

"Eighty-five percent of those surveyed said that it is important to have a cell phone."

### Step-by-Step Analysis (IDAA)

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition in this statement is the claim being made:
- **<P>**: It is important to have a cell phone.

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Next, identify the reason given to support the proposition:
- **<R>**: Eighty-five percent of those surveyed said it is important to have a cell phone.

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
Determine if there is any additional support for the reason provided:
- There is no additional evidence beyond the survey result itself mentioned in this statement.

#### Step 4: Check for Defective Argument Types
Evaluate the argument against each defective argument type:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - Does the argument apply a specific instance to all instances? 
   - No, it does not generalize from a single instance.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - Does the argument claim to consider all possibilities but miss out some?
   - No, this argument does not seem to be an incomplete list of possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - Does the reason provided conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
   - Yes, this could be the case. Just because 85% of those surveyed believe it is important to have a cell phone does not necessarily mean it is objectively important. The argument depends entirely on the opinions of those surveyed without further justification or evidence.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - Is the reason weak in establishing the causal basis for the proposition?
   - Yes, this might also apply as the reasoning is just based on a survey, which does not necessarily imply importance in a broader or objective sense.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - Is the reason merely a restatement of the proposition?
   - No, the reason adds information (survey result) rather than just restating the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - Does the argument assume universal agreement on something still in dispute?
   - No, it does not claim universal agreement. It specifies 85%.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
   - Is the proof of reason taken in another sense than intended?
   - No, the language is clear.

### Conclusion:
The defective argument types that seem most applicable are **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**. 

Thus, the given argument ("Eighty-five percent of those surveyed said that it is important to have a cell phone.") can be classified under:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**

These classifications indicate that the reason given (survey result) does not conclusively establish the importance of having a cell phone and the causal basis (survey opinions) is not sufficiently compelling to validate the proposition.
