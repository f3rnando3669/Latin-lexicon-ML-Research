### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA> Task (IDAA Applied to IDA)

To classify the string as one of the defective argument types, we need to break down the analysis into systematic steps. Here is the detailed decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: What is the main claim or assertion being made?
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: What is the causal basis or reasoning provided to support the proposition?
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: What additional arguments or evidence are provided to corroborate the reason?
4. **Analyze for Defective Arguments**: Determine if the argument fits any of the defective types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP> based on the attributes of the argument.
5. **Conclude Classification**: Classify the string as one of the defective argument types.

### Application to Examples

#### Example 1:
**String:** "Each brick in that building weighs less than a pound. Therefore, the building weighs less than a pound."

1. **Proposition (<P>):** "The building weighs less than a pound."
2. **Reason (<R>):** "Each brick in that building weighs less than a pound."
3. **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** No additional arguments are provided.

**Analysis of Defective Arguments:**
- **<G> (Generalization):** This string is a faulty generalization. The weight of each brick does not necessarily determine the total weight of the building because the building consists of many bricks combined.
- **Other defects (<FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>):** None of these fit as well as <G> in this context.

**Conclusion:** This argument is best classified as type <G> (Generalization).

#### Example 2:
**String:** "Hydrogen is not wet. Oxygen is not wet. Therefore, water (H2O) is not wet."

1. **Proposition (<P>):** "Water (H2O) is not wet."
2. **Reason (<R>):** "Hydrogen is not wet. Oxygen is not wet."
3. **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** No additional arguments are provided.

**Analysis of Defective Arguments:**
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** This string uses an inconclusive reason. The properties of individual elements (hydrogen and oxygen) do not conclusively determine the properties of the compound they form (water), especially considering that water exhibits unique properties different from its constituent gases.
- **Other defects (<G>, <FE>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>):** None of these fit as well as <IR> in this context.

**Conclusion:** This argument is best classified as type <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).

### Final Classification:
**Example 1**: <G> (Generalization)  
**Example 2**: <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)
