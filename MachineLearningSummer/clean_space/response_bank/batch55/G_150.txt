For 
To apply **IDAA** (the application of decomposition **D** to the task of classifying **IDA**) to the statement "Everyone wants to be an English teacher," we need to break down the task **IDA** into specific steps and then follow them to classify the given string **s**.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of **IDA**:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - This step involves identifying the assertion or claim made by the string.
   
2. **Determine if the Proposition (P) matches any of the defective argument types:**
   - <G> Generalization
   - <FE> Incomplete Enumeration
   - <IR> Inconclusive Reason
   - <RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition
   - <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis
   - <FU> Presumptuous Consensus
   - <DEP> Ambiguous Language Use

### Applying the Decomposition to the Given String:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**

   The proposition in the string "Everyone wants to be an English teacher" is the assertion that "everyone" wants to be an English teacher.

2. **Determine if the Proposition (P) matches any of the defective argument types:**
   
   - **<G> Generalization:**
     - The string "Everyone wants to be an English teacher" appears to be a generalization. It takes the desire to be an English teacher, which cannot reasonably apply to literally every single person, and falsely asserts that it applies universally to all people.

   - **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:**
     - This doesn't seem to be an issue of incomplete enumeration, as there are no alternatives explicitly listed.
   
   - **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:**
     - There is no reasoning provided to support the proposition in the string, so it can't be assessed for conclusive or inconclusive reasoning.
   
   - **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:**
     - There’s no additional part of the argument here providing reasoning that repeats the proposition.
   
   - **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:**
     - Similar to **<IR>**, there’s no reasoning or causal basis provided in the given statement.
   
   - **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:**
     - The statement does not assume consensus or claim universality based on an assumed agreement.
   
   - **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:**
     - The statement does not contain ambiguous language that could be misunderstood or taken in another sense.

Based on this breakdown, we can classify the string "Everyone wants to be an English teacher" as an example of the defective argument type **<G>** Generalization, because it asserts something general about "everyone" that is not likely to be true for all individuals.

### Conclusion:

The string "Everyone wants to be an English teacher" is classified under the defective argument type **<G> Generalization**.
