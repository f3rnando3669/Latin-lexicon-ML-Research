For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying the argument), we need to take the advanced task of identifying the type of defective argument and break it down into specific steps. Let's proceed step-by-step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>)

First, we need to extract the main proposition and the reason given in the argument.

- **Proposition (<P>):**  "The Illuminati must have been so clever they destroyed all the evidence."
- **Reason (<R>):** "We have no evidence that the Illuminati ever existed."

### Step 2: Analyze the Reason (<R>) and its effectiveness

Next, evaluate how the reason supports the proposition. Determine if the reason is conclusive, sufficient, repetitive, presumptuous, or ambiguous.

1. **Is the Reason conclusive (<IR>)?**
   - The reason "We have no evidence that the Illuminati ever existed" does not conclusively prove that "The Illuminati must have been so clever they destroyed all the evidence." There is a leap in logic from the absence of evidence to their cleverness.

2. **Is there insufficiency in the causal basis (<WCB>)?**
   - Yes, the reason does not provide a compelling causal link to the proposition that the Illuminati destroyed all the evidence; instead, it merely states a lack of evidence without connecting how the absence of evidence directly implies this cleverness.

3. **Is the proposition being repeated in the reason (<RR>)?**
   - No, the reason is not a direct repetition of the proposition, though it does not adequately support it.

4. **Is there an assumption of universal agreement (<FU>)?**
   - No, the argument does not rely on the assumption that the claim is universally agreed upon.

5. **Is ambiguous language used (<DEP>)?**
   - No, the language is not inherently ambiguous, despite the flawed reasoning process.

6. **Is there a problematic generalization (<G>)?**
   - No sweeping generalization appears to be made regarding individuals or categories beyond this specific instance.

7. **Is there incomplete enumeration (<FE>)?**
   - No claim of complete enumeration of possibilities is made here. The given reason simply states a lack of evidence, not a full consideration of alternative explanations.

### Step 3: Determine the Relevant Defective Argument Type

Based on the analysis:

- The defect primarily lies in **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason given does not conclusively support the proposition. The leap from the absence of evidence to the cunningness of the Illuminati is logically flawed.

- There might also be an element of **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** in that the reasoning does not provide a compelling link between the absence of evidence and the proposition's claim.

### Conclusion:

Based on the steps and analysis, the argument "We have no evidence that the Illuminati ever existed. They must have been so clever they destroyed all the evidence" is predominantly classified as **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason) and to a lesser extent may involve **<WCB>** (Insufficient Causal Basis). However, <IR> is the primary classification as the reasoning does not logically demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
