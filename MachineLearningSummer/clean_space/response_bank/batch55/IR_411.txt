For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "My sister-in-law, who is a teacher, said that this school is not somewhere that I would want to send my children," we will decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps. The steps will help us identify which type of defective argument, if any, is present in the given string.

### Step-by-step Decomposition (<D>)

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine what the string is trying to assert or prove.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Look for the causal basis or justification provided for the proposition.

3. **Check for Defective Types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>):**
   - Compare the elements of the argument with the definitions of defective argument types to classify any issues.

### Application (<IDAA>) to the String

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**

The proposition in the string is: "This school is not somewhere that I would want to send my children."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**

The reason provided is: "My sister-in-law, who is a teacher, said so."

**Step 3: Check for Defective Types**

- **<G> Generalization:** This argument does not generalize from a small sample to a larger population.
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:** This argument does not claim to account for all possible factors or cases.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** Yes, the reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate why the school is bad. Just because the sister-in-law is a teacher and said so doesn't necessarily make it true without additional evidence.
  
  - Reason is in question: Does the qualification of the sister-in-law as a teacher provide sufficient justification for her opinion to be taken as fact?
  
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** The reason is not a repetition of the proposition.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** Yes, the causal basis (opinion of the sister-in-law) submitted for the proposition may not be compelling without further evidence or context.
  
  - Qualification of reason: Does the opinion of a single individual, regardless of her profession, provide a strong causal basis?
  
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** The argument does not appeal to a presumed universal agreement.
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:** The language used does not have ambiguity that could lead to it being understood in multiple ways.

### Conclusion

Based on the decomposition and analysis of the argument:

- The argument likely fits **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** because the reason (opinion of the sister-in-law) does not conclusively prove the proposition without more supporting evidence.
- It could also be categorized as **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)** because the reason provided (a single individual's opinion) is not compelling enough to substantiate the proposition.

Therefore, the defective argument types applicable to the given string are primarily <IR> and secondarily <WCB>.
