For 
To apply \<IDAA\> (the application of task decomposition \<D\> to the task of classifying an argument \<IDA\>), let’s break down the steps and go through them one by one.

### Step 1: Identify the Elements of the Argument
1. **Proposition (\<P\>)**: If you drink alcohol, it will kill any virus you might have.
2. **Reason (\<R\>)**: It is common sense.

### Step 2: Understand the Defective Argument Types
Let's review the defective argument types briefly:
- \<G\>: Generalization
- \<FE\>: Incomplete Enumeration
- \<IR\>: Inconclusive Reason
- \<WCB\>: Insufficient Causal Basis
- \<RR\>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition
- \<FU\>: Presumptuous Consensus
- \<DEP\>: Ambiguous Language Use

### Step 3: Analyze the Reason (\<R\>) for Defects
The reason given by Don is "It is common sense." Let's determine which, if any, defective argument types this corresponds to:
- **Generalization (\<G\>)**: Not applicable because there's no overgeneralization based on limited instances.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)**: Not applicable because Don isn't presenting options he's missing out on. 
- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**: Possible, the reason "It is common sense" does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**: Possible, "It is common sense" doesn't provide a compelling or scientifically valid causal basis for the claim.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)**: Not applicable because the reason given isn't just a restatement of the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)**: Likely applies because Don's argument relies on the claim being universally agreed upon ("common sense"), despite the fact that the effectiveness of alcohol against viruses may be still in dispute.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)**: Not applicable here as the language isn't being used in an ambiguous manner.

### Step 4: Determine the Dominant Defect(s)
Given the analysis:
- \<IR\>: The reason "It is common sense" does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition.
- \<WCB\>: The reason lacks a compelling causal basis.
- \<FU\>: The reason relies on "common sense," which presumes consensus on a question that is scientifically complex.

### Step 5: Classify the Argument
After analyzing the defective argument types and matching them to the given argument, it becomes clear that Don's argument most closely fits with:
- **\<FU\>** (Presumptuous Consensus) as the most apparent defect type, since the appeal is to common sense on a matter requiring specific evidence.
- **\<WCB\>** (Insufficient Causal Basis) also applies because the reason offered isn’t scientifically reliable.

### Conclusion
Applying \<IDAA\> to the given argument, "If you drink alcohol, it will kill any virus you might have. It is common sense," the argument can be classified primarily as type **\<FU\>** (Presumptuous Consensus) and secondarily as **\<WCB\>** (Insufficient Causal Basis).
