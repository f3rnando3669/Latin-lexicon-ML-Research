For 
Sure, let's apply <IDAA> to classify the given statement step by step. Here’s the statement: 

"Only a mentally ill person would kill someone, so anyone who kills someone is automatically mentally ill."

Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>).

- **Proposition (<P>)**: "Anyone who kills someone is automatically mentally ill."
- **Reason (<R>)**: "Only a mentally ill person would kill someone."

Step 2: Determine if the reason conclusively supports the proposition.

We'll compare the structure of the argument and the definitions of defective argument types.

- **Generalization (G)**: We are making an assertion about all killers based on the premise that only mentally ill people would kill. This could be a form of generalization because it assumes all instances fit this specific condition.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This does not seem to involve enumerating possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason may not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. The claim that only mentally ill people would kill does not fully support that all who kill are mentally ill without other supporting evidence.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This may be applicable if the causal connection between mental illness and committing murder is not sufficiently established.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This does not seem to apply as the reason and proposition are not exact repetitions.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There's no explicit assumption of universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language does not seem ambiguous.

Step 3: Classify the statement under the most appropriate defective argument type.

- The given reasoning "Only a mentally ill person would kill someone" might not conclusively support the claim that "anyone who kills someone is automatically mentally ill." This shows a potential leap in logic – the reasoning doesn’t sufficiently establish the proposition without further proof.

Conclusion: The statement can be classified as an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the reason given does not conclusively establish the truth of the proposition. 

So, the classification of the given string is:

**<IR>**
