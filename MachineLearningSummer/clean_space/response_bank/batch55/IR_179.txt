To apply the concept of IDAA to the string "Joe is firm in his principles. The reader admires Joe for not changing his ideas and opinions according to what is popular or advantageous," we're going to decompose the advanced task (IDA) into specific steps (D) for classification. Let’s break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition in a complete argument is a statement summarizing what we intend to prove. In this case:

- **<P>:** "Joe is firm in his principles."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason is the causal basis presented to support the proposition. Here:

- **<R>:** "The reader admires Joe for not changing his ideas and opinions according to what is popular or advantageous."

### Step 3: Determine if the Provided Reason (<R>) is Conclusive
Check whether <R> conclusively demonstrates the correctness of <P>.

- **Evaluation:** "The reader admires Joe for not changing his ideas and opinions according to what is popular or advantageous" is a subjective statement and may not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition that "Joe is firm in his principles."

### Step 4: Assess the Correctness of <P> Using <R>

- **Evaluation:** The reason given is based on reader admiration, which is not a concrete and objective measure of Joe’s firmness in his principles. Thus, it doesn’t conclusively establish the truth of <P>.

### Step 5: Identify the Defective Argument Type
Given that <R> does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of <P>, we classify this argument type based on the definitions provided.

- **<IR>:** "<R> does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the <P>."

### Conclusion
By applying the decomposed steps (D) for the task of classifying <s> as one of the defective argument types (IDA), we determine that the string "Joe is firm in his principles. The reader admires Joe for not changing his ideas and opinions according to what is popular or advantageous" is an example of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
