For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of decomposition of the task into specific steps) to the given string "Throughout history, most philosophers thought men were more rational than women, therefore this is true," we first need to break down the task <IDA> (classifying the string as a defective argument type) into specific steps. Here is the step-by-step decomposition:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition <D> for <IDA>

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine the assertion being made which is intended to be proved.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Find the causal basis provided for the proposition (P).
3. **Analyze the Proof of Reason (PR)**: Look for any further arguments that corroborate the reason (R).
4. **Examine for Defective Argument Types**: Check for characteristics of defective arguments as defined (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

### Applying <D> to the Given String

#### 1. Identify the Proposition (P)
The proposition (P) in the string is:
- **P:** "Men are more rational than women."

#### 2. Identify the Reason (R)
The reason (R) given for the proposition is:
- **R:** "Throughout history, most philosophers thought men were more rational than women."

#### 3. Analyze the Proof of Reason (PR)
There is no additional proof of reason (PR) in the given string. The statement relies entirely on the historical view without further argumentation.

#### 4. Examine for Defective Argument Types

- **Generalization (G):**
  - The proposition is based on the opinion of "most philosophers" but is extended to a universal truth. This could be an overgeneralization since the views of most philosophers do not necessarily reflect the truth of the matter.
  - **Detection:** Yes, it can be seen as a Generalization because it takes the majority opinion of a specific group (philosophers) and applies it universally without considering whether it is actually true.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
  - The argument does not list all possible viewpoints or evidence, just cites historical opinions.
  - **Detection:** This does not fit the exact definition of Incomplete Enumeration, as it claims a majority opinion but does not imply a complete listing of all possibilities.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
  - The reason given (historical opinions) does not scientifically or objectively prove the proposition (men are more rational than women).
  - **Detection:** Yes, the reason is inconclusive because it does not demonstrate the truth of the proposition conclusively.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
  - The historical opinion of philosophers is not a robust causal basis for proving rational superiority.
  - **Detection:** Yes, it fits Insufficient Causal Basis because the provided reason does not compellingly establish the proposition.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
  - The reason provided is not just a mere repetition of the proposition word-for-word but relies on external historical views.
  - **Detection:** No, it does not fit RR.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
  - The argument suggests that because it was historically accepted, it should be accepted now without current evidence.
  - **Detection:** Yes, it indeed assumes consensus where the proposition is still in dispute in contemporary discussions.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
  - The statement does not seem to contain ambiguous language that could be taken in another sense.
  - **Detection:** No, it does not fit DEP.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the string "Throughout history, most philosophers thought men were more rational than women, therefore this is true," fits multiple defective argument types but most precisely falls under:

- **Generalization (G)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**

The most prominent defective argument type is likely **Generalization (G)**, as it extends a specific group's historical viewpoints to a universal truth without rigorous proof.
