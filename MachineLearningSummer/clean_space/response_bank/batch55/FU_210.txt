For 
To apply \(<IDAA>\) to the string "Four legs good, two legs bad," we need to decompose the task of classifying the string into specific steps. Here's how we can do it step by step:

### Decomposition of the Task \(<D>\)
1. **Identify Proposition (\(P\)) and Reason (\(R\)):**
   - Determine if the string "Four legs good, two legs bad" contains a proposition and/or a reason.
   
2. **Analyze Specific Defective Argument Types:**
   - Check for each of the defective argument types (\(G\), \(FE\), \(IR\), \(RR\), \(WCB\), \(FU\), \(DEP\)) in the string.

### Application of Decomposition to Classify the String \(<IDAA>\)

#### Step 1: Identify Proposition (\(<P>\)) and Reason (\(<R>\))
- **Proposition (\(<P>\))**: The string "Four legs good, two legs bad" is making an assertion. The assertion appears to be:
  - \(P1\): Four-legged creatures (e.g., animals) are good.
  - \(P2\): Two-legged creatures (e.g., humans) are bad.

- **Reason (\(<R>\))**: The string itself does not explicitly provide a reason. It is a simple assertion without explanation.

#### Step 2: Analyze Specific Defective Argument Types

- **\(G\) (Generalization)**:
  - Is the assertion based on just a generalization of part or a majority and applied to all?
  - **Evaluation**: Yes, the assertion "Four legs good, two legs bad" generalizes that all four-legged creatures are good and all two-legged creatures are bad without adequate sampling or evidence. 

- **\(FE\) (Incomplete Enumeration)**:
  - Does it claim complete enumeration but miss out on some possibilities?
  - **Evaluation**: It does not seem to enumerate possibilities; it is simply making binary assertions with implicit categories.

- **\(IR\) (Inconclusive Reason)**:
  - Does the reason (or lack thereof) not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
  - **Evaluation**: There is no explicit reason given for this proposition, but it's hard to classify it as \(IR\) without looking deeper into whether it pretends to provide a reason. Here the string lacks a reason altogether.

- **\(WCB\) (Insufficient Causal Basis)**:
  - Is there a weak causal basis supplied for the proposition?
  - **Evaluation**: Since no causal basis is provided, it doesn't specifically fall under \(WCB\).

- **\(RR\) (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**:
  - Is the reason actually a repetition of the proposition?
  - **Evaluation**: No reason is provided, so repetition doesn't apply here directly.

- **\(FU\) (Presumptuous Consensus)**:
  - Is the proof of reason assumed on the grounds of universal agreement which is actually disputed?
  - **Evaluation**: No claim of universal agreement or consensus is made here.

- **\(DEP\) (Ambiguous Language Use)**:
  - Can the language be taken in another sense than intended by the speaker?
  - **Evaluation**: The language is quite clear and specific, despite the simplicity.

### Final Classification:
Based on the analysis, the defective argument type that best fits the string "Four legs good, two legs bad" is:

- **Generalization (\(G\))**: The assertion makes a simplistic and overbroad generalization about four-legged and two-legged creatures without sufficient evidence to support such a claim.

Thus, \(<IDA>\) classification of the string "Four legs good, two legs bad" is:

- \(\boxed{G}\)
