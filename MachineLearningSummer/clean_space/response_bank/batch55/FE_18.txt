Alright, let's apply the structured decomposition approach \( \text{IDAA} \) to classify the argument "If you aren’t a capitalist, you must be a communist."

1. **Identify the components of the argument:**
   - **Proposition (\<P\>):** "If you aren’t a capitalist, you must be a communist."

2. **Classify potential defects:**
   - Determine if the argument fits any of the defined defective argument types.

3. **Examine each type in order:**

   - **\( \text{G} \) Generalization:** This checks if the proposition is a broad assertion based on limited cases. This doesn't directly apply here as the argument is not generalizing from specific individuals or groups.
   
   - **\( \text{FE} \) Incomplete Enumeration:** Check if the argument claims to cover all possibilities but misses some. Here, the proposition presents only two categories (capitalist and communist) but there are multiple economic and political ideologies beyond these two. Thus, this seems a likely match.
   
   - **\( \text{IR} \) Inconclusive Reason:** Inconclusive Reason would apply if there were a causal basis provided which failed to conclusively establish the proposition. However, no reason is given in the argument.
   
   - **\( \text{RR} \) Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** This checks for a restatement of the proposition as a reason. Since no reason is offered, this is inapplicable.
   
   - **\( \text{WCB} \) Insufficient Causal Basis:** This applies if the given reason is weak. Again, no rationale or causal basis is provided, so it's not applicable.
   
   - **\( \text{FU} \) Presumptuous Consensus:** This applies if the proof is based on an assumed universal agreement. The argument doesn't state or imply consensus, thus inapplicable.
   
   - **\( \text{DEP} \) Ambiguous Language Use:** This applies if language ambiguity leads to misinterpretation. The terms "capitalist" and "communist" are straightforward and not ambiguous in this context.

4. **Determine the best fitting type:**
   - The best fitting type is \( \text{FE} \) Incomplete Enumeration, because the argument falsely presents only two possibilities, neglecting other ideological options.

**Conclusion:**
The argument "If you aren’t a capitalist, you must be a communist" is classified as \( \text{FE} \), an Incomplete Enumeration, since it fails to consider the full range of possible economic or political positions.
