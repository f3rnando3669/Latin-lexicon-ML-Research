For 
To apply the process IDAA to the string "My grandmother ate 10 cloves of raw garlic every day. Not surprisingly she lived to be 102," we will decompose the task of identifying the defective argument type into specific steps.

### Steps to Decompose the Task (D):
1. **Identify Proposition (P):** Determine the main claim or assertion made in the string.
2. **Identify Reason (R):** Find the causal basis that the argument presents to support the proposition.
3. **Identify Proof of Reason (PR):** Look for any additional arguments or evidence provided to corroborate the reason.
4. **Classify Defective Argument Type:** Compare the P, R, and PR with definitions of defective argument types and classify the argument.

### Step-by-Step Application (IDAA):

#### Step 1: Identify Proposition (P)
The proposition (P) in the string is:
- "My grandmother lived to be 102."

#### Step 2: Identify Reason (R)
The reason (R) presented to support the P is:
- "She ate 10 cloves of raw garlic every day."

#### Step 3: Identify Proof of Reason (PR)
Additional arguments or evidence (PR) provided:
- There is no additional corroborative argument explicitly given in the string.

#### Step 4: Classify Defective Argument Type
Comparing the proposition, reason, and lack of proof of reason with the definitions of defective argument types:

- **Generalization (G):** The argument does not involve generalizing from one case to all cases.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument does not claim to provide a complete list of possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason given does not conclusively prove the correctness of the proposition. Eating garlic and living long are correlated through one anecdotal case, not a conclusive causal connection.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason is distinct from the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis (garlic consumption) is not compelling or substantiated in proving longevity.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There is no mention of a universal agreement or consensus.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** There is no ambiguous language in how the reason is presented.

Therefore, the most appropriate classification for this argument based on the defective argument types is:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The argument presents a reason (garlic consumption) that is not compelling or proven to be a strong causal basis for the proposition (longevity of 102 years).

### Conclusion
The string "My grandmother ate 10 cloves of raw garlic every day. Not surprisingly she lived to be 102." is classified as **WCB** (Insufficient Causal Basis) according to the defective argument types specified.
