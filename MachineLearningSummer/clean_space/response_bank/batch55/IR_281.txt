For 
Applying IDAA (the decomposition of the task IDA — the classification of a string as a defective argument type — into specific steps) to the given string "Leonardo DiCaprio is just a dumb actor! What does he really know about climate change?!"

Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>).
- Proposition (<P>): "Leonardo DiCaprio is just a dumb actor!"
  - This statement asserts that Leonardo DiCaprio lacks intelligence.
- Reason (<R>): "What does he really know about climate change?!"
  - This question implies skepticism about Leonardo DiCaprio's knowledge regarding climate change based on the assertion made in the proposition.

Step 2: Analyze the Reason (<R>) and its effectiveness in supporting the Proposition (<P>).
- The Reason (<R>) hinges on the assumption that being an actor (specifically, a "dumb actor") is somehow incompatible with having knowledge about climate change.

Step 3: Evaluate whether the Reason (<R>) provides a conclusive basis and whether the proof is presented correctly.
- The Reason (<R>) presented ("What does he really know about climate change?!") does not provide concrete evidence or a causal basis to substantiate the Proposition (<P>).

Step 4: Classification based on identified defective argument types.

- G: Generalization is not applicable here since there is no attempt to generalize from a part to a whole.
- FE: Incomplete Enumeration is not applicable as this argument does not deal with enumeration of possibilities.
- IR: Inconclusive Reason fits since the Reason (<R>) does not conclusively establish the correctness of what it is trying to prove, that Leonardo DiCaprio's knowledge on climate change is invalidated by his profession as an actor.
- RR: Faulty Repetition of Proposition is not applicable here because the Reason does not repeat the Proposition verbatim.
- WCB: Insufficient Causal Basis fits because the causal basis provided is weak and not compelling, questioning his qualifications based on his profession but not providing real linkage or evidence.
- FU: Presumptuous Consensus is not applicable here as no consensus or universal agreement is being claimed.
- DEP: Ambiguous Language Use is not applicable since the language used is not particularly ambiguous in this context.

Step 5: Conclude the classification.
- The argument can be classified as <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis), as it fails to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the <P> and the causal basis presented is weak.

So, "Leonardo DiCaprio is just a dumb actor! What does he really know about climate change?!" is classified under:
- <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)
- <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)

Analyzing and classifying steps show the argument lacks a strong causal basis and fails to conclusively support the conclusion drawn based on the actor's profession.
