To apply the process of **IDAA** (the application of decomposition to the task of identifying defective arguments) to the given string, we need to break down the task of classifying the string into a series of steps. Here’s how we can do it:

### Decomposition Steps (D)

1. **Comprehend the String (s)**: Understand the meaning of the given text.
2. **Identify Key Components**: Identify possible propositions, reasons, and proofs within the string.
3. **Classify Based on Definitions**: Use the definitions of defective argument types to classify the argument.

### Application of Decomposition (IDAA)

#### Step 1: Comprehend the String

The string provided is: "A fallacy of relevance where someone rejects or criticizes another person’s view on the basis of personal characteristics, background, physical appearance, or other features irrelevant to the argument."

This statement describes a specific type of logical fallacy, which is about attacking the person rather than addressing the argument they present.

#### Step 2: Identify Key Components

- **Proposition (P)**: The implied proposition is that attacking someone's personal characteristics is a fallacy of relevance.
- **Reason (R)**: The reason isn't explicitly stated, but the explanation lies in the irrelevance of personal characteristics to the argument.

#### Step 3: Classify Based on Definitions

- Examination indicates the fallacy described isn't directly asserting a generalization, incomplete enumeration, inconclusive reason, faulty repetition, insufficient causal basis, presumptuous consensus, or ambiguous language use.
- **The fallacy described is known as an Ad Hominem fallacy**, specifically, which attacks the person rather than the argument, but none of the defective argument types given directly corresponds to **Ad Hominem**.

Given our definitions and upon deeper examination:

- **DEP**: Does not fit because the fallacy isn't about ambiguous language.
- **FU**: Does not fit because there's no attempt to justify something simply by claiming universal agreement.
- **RR**: Does not fit because the reason isn't a repetition of the proposition.
- **WCB**: The cause of the argument fallacy isn't necessarily weak causal basis but irrelevance.
- **IR**: Could partly fit since it deals with irrelevance that doesn't properly support the argument.
- **FE**: Doesn’t fit because it’s not about incomplete enumeration.
- **G**: Doesn't fit because it's not a case of faulty generalization.

#### Given the closest definitions and the analysis, the most fitting type seems to be:

### IR (Inconclusive Reason)

The statement describes a situation where the reason (attacking personal characteristics) does not conclusively demonstrate the invalidity of the proposition being argued against, thus making it an inconclusive reason.

### Conclusion

Thus, applying IDAA to the provided string, the argument type of the string "A fallacy of relevance where someone rejects or criticizes another person’s view on the basis of personal characteristics, background, physical appearance, or other features irrelevant to the argument" could be classified under **IR** for Inconclusive Reason.
