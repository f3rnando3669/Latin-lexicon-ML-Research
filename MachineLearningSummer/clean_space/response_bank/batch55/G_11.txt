For 
Let's apply the process of decomposing the task of classifying a defective argument step-by-step (IDAA) to the statement: "Sarah loves to wear running shoes, all girls must like to run."

**Step 1: Identify <P> (Proposition):**
The proposition <P> sets forth summarily what we intend to prove. 

In this case, the proposition appears to be: "all girls must like to run."

**Step 2: Identify <R> (Reason):**
The reason <R> sets forth the causal basis for <P>.

Here, the reason seems to be: "Sarah loves to wear running shoes."

**Step 3: Evaluate the Reason against the Proposition:**
Here we need to determine if the reason <R> adequately and conclusively supports the proposition <P>.

- The proposition ("all girls must like to run") is a broad generalization about "all girls."
- The reason ("Sarah loves to wear running shoes") is a specific observation about one individual, Sarah.

**Step 4: Identify Defective Argument Type:**

Let's analyze the possible defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>):

- **Generalization (<G>)**: The defective argument type <G> occurs when a proposition based on a specific instance or a majority is wrongly attributed to all members. 

The proposition "all girls must like to run" is based solely on the observation that "Sarah loves to wear running shoes." This matches the definition of a generalization where a characteristic of one individual (Sarah) is attributed to an entire group (all girls).

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This involves missing some pertinent possibilities in a claimed complete enumeration. This doesn't apply here as the argument is not presenting an enumeration.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This would be if the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. While this is true, it more specifically fits the description of a generalization.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This would be if the causal basis submitted for the proposition is not compelling. The causal basis here is weak but fits the criteria of generalization more aptly.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This involves repeating the same claim in the reason. The reason here is not merely a repetition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This involves assuming something is universally agreed upon. This doesn't apply here.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: This involves ambiguity in the proof's language. There is no significant ambiguity issue in this case.

**Conclusion:**
The statement "Sarah loves to wear running shoes, all girls must like to run." fits the defective argument type **Generalization (<G>)**.

Thus, the classification of the given string is identified as type **<G>**.
