For 
To apply <IDAA> to "Stating that something should be done (or agreed to) because everyone else thinks this way," we will first decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps and then perform the classification.

### Decomposition of <IDA> into Specific Steps (<D>):
1. **Identify Components**: Determine the proposition (<P>), reason (<R>), and proof of reason (<PR>) presented in the argument, if available.
2. **Characterize the Argument**: Analyze the nature of the argument to see if it fits one of the defective types listed: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).
3. **Match Defective Argument Type**: Assign the specific defective argument type based on the analysis.

### Application of <D> to <IDA> for the Given String:
#### Step 1: Identify Components
- **Proposition (<P>)**: "Something should be done (or agreed to)"
- **Reason (<R>)**: "because everyone else thinks this way"
- **Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: (Not explicitly stated, but implied to be the consensus)

#### Step 2: Characterize the Argument
- The argument suggests that the action or agreement is justified solely on the basis that it aligns with a universal or majority consensus.

#### Step 3: Match Defective Argument Type
- The argument's reason (R), "because everyone else thinks this way," relies heavily on the presumed consensus of the majority rather than on rational or empirical evidence.
- This fits the defective argument type called **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**, where a reason or proof is assumed as certain solely because it is alleged to be universally agreed upon.

### Conclusion:
The argument "Stating that something should be done (or agreed to) because everyone else thinks this way." is best classified as <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).
