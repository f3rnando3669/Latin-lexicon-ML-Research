For 
Certainly! Let's apply the method of decomposing the task of classifying the argument to the given string, step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Argument
First, we need to understand what the argument is trying to say:
- **Proposition (P):** The argument is asserting that something must be right.
- **Reason (R):** The reason provided is that everybody thinks that way.

### Step 2: Identify the Argument Structure
Next, let's identify the parts of the argument within the given string:
- The proposition (<P>): "It must be right."
- The reason (<R>): "Because everybody thinks this way."

### Step 3: Classify Each Component
Based on the definitions provided for defective argument types, we need to see which classification the argument fits into. Here is a closer look:

- **Generalization (G):** This doesn't fit since "It must be right" isn't based on a sample of individuals referred to all.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This doesn't fit as the argument isn't trying to enumerate possibilities.
  
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason might not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition, but let's keep looking.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This entails that the reason provided is not a compelling causal explanation.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This doesn't apply since the reason and the proposition aren't just restating the same thing.
  
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The reason is based on the assumption that universal agreement among people indicates correctness, which seems to resonate here.
  
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The argument appears straightforward without ambiguous language.

### Step 4: Final Classification
Based on the analysis, the argument leans towards **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** because it assumes that just because everybody thinks a certain way, it must be right, which is still a disputable position and not inherently true.

### Conclusion
The defective argument type for the given string "Because everybody thinks this way, it must be right." is **<FU>**, Presumptuous Consensus.
