For 
To apply \( <IDAA> \) to the given argument — "Billy: 'An apple is a vegetable.' Bobby: 'Don't listen to Billy; he failed Spanish class last year.'" — we need to decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps and then proceed through each step.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of \( <IDA> \) 

Since \( <IDAA> \) is defined as the application of \( <D> \) (decomposition) to \( <IDA> \) (identifying defective argument type), let’s outline the steps involved in decomposition and classification:

1. **Identify the Proposition \( (P) \):**
   - Determine the assertion that is intended to be proved.
   
2. **Identify the Reason \( (R) \):**
   - Determine the causal basis or argument presented in support of the Proposition \( (P) \).
   
3. **Evaluate the Reason \( (R) \):**
   - Assess whether the reason is adequate in supporting the proposition.
   
4. **Identify Proof of Reason \( (PR) \):**
   - Determine if any further proof of the reason is provided.
   
5. **Classify the Defective Argument Type \( (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP) \):**
   - Compare the identified \( (P), (R), \) and \( (PR) \) to the defined defective argument types and identify which one it matches.

### Apply the Decomposition to the Given Argument

Now, let’s decompose and classify the argument step-by-step for the given example:

1. **Proposition (P) Identification:**
   - Proposition (P): "An apple is a vegetable."
   
2. **Reason (R) Identification:**
   - Reason (R): "Billy failed Spanish class last year." (This is the only reasoning provided, though it doesn't directly address the proposition.)

3. **Evaluate the Reason (R):**
   - The reason given by Bobby does not address the proposition about apples being vegetables. Instead, it attacks Billy's credibility without relevance to the botanical classification of apples.

4. **Proof of Reason (PR) Identification:**
   - There is no additional proof provided to support Bobby's reasoning. The argument rests entirely on the claim about Billy's past performance.

5. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:**
   - Bobby's argument seems to be an attack on Billy's character rather than providing a valid reason related to the proposition. This kind of argument is an **Ad Hominem** fallacy.
   - From the definitions, an **Ad Hominem** fallacy closely matches the classifiable defective argument types by being a form of misdirection or **Presumptuous Consensus \( (FU) \)**. However, since \( FU \) implies "universally agreed upon" which is not directly applicable here, it is more accurate to consider:
   - **\( FU \):** would involve assuming consensus, while **Ad Hominem** fallacies might loosely be affiliated with "Inconclusive Reason \( (IR) \)" as they do not address the core argument directly but attempt to disprove it using irrelevant points.

Hence, the defective argument type in this context is closest to **Inconclusive Reason \( (IR) \)** since Bobby's reasoning does not address Billy’s actual claim.

### Conclusion

- \( <s> \) = "Billy: 'An apple is a vegetable.' Bobby: 'Don't listen to Billy; he failed Spanish class last year.'"
- The argument is classified as **\( IR \)** (Inconclusive Reason).

This is because Bobby's response does not provide a relevant reason showing why Billy's statement about apples is incorrect but instead diverts to an irrelevant issue about Billy's past academic performance.
