To apply the process of <IDAA> to classify the string "Everything I say is true. This is true because I said it, and everything I say is true." we need to decompose the task of classifying the defective argument <s> into specific steps. Here is the step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The phrase "Everything I say is true" is our proposition (<P>).

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The phrase "This is true because I said it" constitutes the reason (<R>).

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - The reiteration "everything I say is true" serves as a sort of proof of the reason (<PR>) in the argument.

4. **Classify whether the argument is defective and identify which type, if defective:**
   - **Check Generalization (<G>)**: The statement does not base its claim on a part or majority of a groupâ€”they are asserting a universal claim without reference to a sample.
     - Not <G>.
   - **Check Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement does not involve enumerating possibilities; it's not an attempt to list out any set of alternatives.
     - Not <FE>.
   - **Check Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason "because I said it" does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. It fails to establish causality in a substantial manner.
     - Potentially <IR>.
   - **Check Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reason provided is "because I said it," which is a weak causal basis for claiming that everything said is true.
     - Potentially <WCB>.
   - **Check Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The reason essentially repeats the proposition with no new information: "This is true because everything I say is true".
     - Strongly matches <RR>.
   - **Check Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument does not refer to a consensus or universal agreement; rather, it relies solely on the speaker's own assertion.
     - Not <FU>.
   - **Check Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: There is no ambiguity in the language used; the terms used are clear in their intended meaning.
     - Not <DEP>.

Given these classifications, the string "Everything I say is true. This is true because I said it, and everything I say is true." primarily represents a **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** as the reason provided does not add any new information and essentially restates the proposition.

Thus, applying <IDAA> to this argument string, we classify <s> as <RR>.
