For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "We can’t legalize marijuana; if we do, then the next thing you know people will be strung out on heroin," we'll start by decomposing the task <IDA> into specific steps and then perform each step.

### Decomposition <D> of <IDA>:
1. **Identify the main proposition (P)**: Determine the primary assertion or claim being made.
2. **Identify the reason(s) (R)**: Determine the causal basis or reasoning behind the proposition.
3. **Check for Proof of Reason (PR)**: Examine if there is corroborative evidence or supporting arguments for the reason given.
4. **Compare against known defective argument types**: Classify each part of the argument as one or more of the defective types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Application <IDAA>:

#### Step 1: Identify the main proposition (P)
The primary assertion or claim:
**P**: "We can’t legalize marijuana."

#### Step 2: Identify the reason(s) (R)
The reasoning given to support this claim:
**R**: "If we do, then the next thing you know people will be strung out on heroin."

#### Step 3: Check for Proof of Reason (PR)
Examine if any further evidence or supporting arguments are provided for the reason:
In this statement, there is no additional supporting argument or evidence provided, so **PR** is absent or implicitly weak.

#### Step 4: Compare against known defective argument types

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Does the proposition make sweeping generalizations not necessarily applicable to all? 
   - No, it doesn’t attribute characteristics of some to all, but suggests a causal link between two events.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Is the proposition assuming a complete set of possibilities but missing pertinent ones?
   - No, it does not claim a complete enumeration of possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
   - Yes, the reason provided does not conclusively prove the claim. The connection between legalizing marijuana and subsequent heroin use is not established with compelling evidence.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Is the reason weak without a compelling causal basis for the proposition?
   - Yes, the causal link ("if we legalize marijuana, people will end up on heroin") is a classic slippery slope argument, which is considered a weak causal basis without strong evidence connecting these steps.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Is the reason merely a restatement of the proposition?
   - No, the reason is not merely a restatement but an additional (though weak) causal argument.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Is the supporting argument assumed as certain on the grounds of purported universal agreement?
   - No, there is no appeal to universal agreement in this instance.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Is there ambiguity in the language that can be misinterpreted?
   - No significant ambiguity is apparent in this argument.

### Conclusion
The argument "We can’t legalize marijuana; if we do, then the next thing you know people will be strung out on heroin" primarily exhibits the characteristics of:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis is weak and relies on a slippery slope argument.

Therefore, the string "We can’t legalize marijuana; if we do, then the next thing you know people will be strung out on heroin" can be classified as primarily of types **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** and **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)** in the context of defective argument analysis.
