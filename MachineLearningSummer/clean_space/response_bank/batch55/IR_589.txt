For 
To apply IDAA to the given string, we'll take a step-by-step approach to decompose the advanced task (IDA) into specific steps and then apply it to classify the argument. Here is how we will proceed:

**Step 1:** Identify the Proposition (P)
**Step 2:** Identify the Reason (R)
**Step 3:** Determine if the Reason (R) is defective
**Step 4:** Classify the type of defective argument based on the given definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>

Let's apply these steps to the given string:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The Proposition (P) is the statement we're trying to prove. In the argument: "'Our family has always been farmers, so we should always be farmers''

**Proposition (P):** "We should always be farmers."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The Reason (R) provides the causal basis for the Proposition. In the argument: "'Our family has always been farmers, so we should always be farmers''

**Reason (R):** "Our family has always been farmers."

### Step 3: Determine if the Reason (R) is defective
We need to analyze whether the Reason provides a conclusive or compelling support for the Proposition.

The argument claims that because something has always been the case, it should always be the case. This suggests a reasoning that past behavior automatically justifies future behavior without providing a substantive causal basis or evidence.

### Step 4: Classify the type of defective argument
We now apply the definitions provided:

- **Generalization (G):** Not applicable, as it does not refer to a part to whole argument.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable, as it does not involve missing possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The Reason does not conclusively demonstrate that the family should always be farmers.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The Reason provided ("always been farmers") is not a compelling causal basis for the Proposition ("we should always be farmers").
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The Reason is not a direct repetition of the Proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Not applicable, as it doesn't rely on assumed universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Not applicable, as the language isn't ambiguous.

Based on this analysis, the Reason provided for the Proposition is not compelling and does not conclusively support it.

**Conclusion:**

This argument is an example of the defective argument type **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, because the Reason given ("Our family has always been farmers") does not provide a compelling enough basis to justify the Proposition ("we should always be farmers").
