For 
To apply IDAA (the application of task decomposition to the task of classifying the defectiveness of the argument) to the statement "The economy has improved greatly because of the new president," we need to break down the classification task (IDA) into specific steps (D). Here's the step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>)

1. **Proposition (<P>)**: What are we intending to prove?
   - "The economy has improved greatly"

2. **Reason (<R>)**: What is the causal basis for the Proposition?
   - "because of the new president"

### Step 2: Evaluate the Argument Based on the Definitions of Defective Arguments

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: 
   - Check if the Proposition (<P>) makes an assertion about all instances based on just a part or majority. 
   - Here, "The economy has improved greatly" does not involve a faulty generalization as it is a claim related to one specific instance (the economy).

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: 
   - Check if all possibilities have been considered to conclude the Proposition (<P>).
   - The statement does not mention other factors that could affect the economy, thus it may be missing other pertinent possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: 
   - Check if the Reason (<R>) conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the Proposition (<P>).
   - Assertion that the improvement is "because of the new president" does not conclusively demonstrate the causal relationship without further evidence.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: 
   - Check if the Reason (<R>) has a compelling causal basis.
   - The statement assumes that the president is the primary cause without providing evidence or robust causal links.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: 
   - Check if the Reason (<R>) merely repeats the Proposition (<P>).
   - The Reason does not just repeat the Proposition but is intended to explain the cause.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: 
   - Check if the Proof of Reason (<PR>) is assumed as certain through a claimed consensus.
   - The statement does not invoke any universal agreement as evidence.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: 
   - Check if the Proof of Reason (<PR>) can be taken in another sense than intended.
   - The language is not particularly ambiguous, it is rather the unsubstantiated causal claim that is critical.

### Step 3: Classify the Defectiveness

After examining each defective argument definition, we can classify the given argument primarily as:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Because it fails to consider other possibilities for the economy's improvement.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Because the Reason given does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Because the stated Reason doesn't provide a compelling or robust causal basis.

Therefore, the primary classifications for the argument "The economy has improved greatly because of the new president" are:

- <FE>
- <IR>
- <WCB>
