For 
To apply the process of IDAA (decompositional approach to classify a given string according to the defective argument types), we need to break the task down into specific steps and then execute those steps systematically to find the right classification for the given string ", or a group of people think, in order to persuade one to think the same way."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D):

1. **Identify the Context of the String**: Examine the content of the string to understand what it is asserting or implying.
2. **Match with Defective Argument Types**: Compare the identified context with each of the defective argument types' definitions.
3. **Analyze Key Phrases and Structure**: Focus on specific phrases and structural elements within the string to pinpoint which argument type it aligns with.
4. **Assess Underlying Reasoning (if applicable)**: Determine if the string provides reasoning and whether it fits any of the defective argument criteria.
5. **Conclude with Classification**: Conclude which defective argument type the string best matches.

Now, let's apply these steps to the given string:

### 1. Identify the Context of the String:

The string ", or a group of people think, in order to persuade one to think the same way." implies that a consensus or a group's belief is expected to persuade an individual to adopt the same belief.

### 2. Match with Defective Argument Types:

- **<G> Generalization**: The string doesn't seem to imply a broad application based on a limited sample but rather on consensus.
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: No enumeration of possibilities is presented in the string.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The reasoning here is more about consensus, not presenting an inconclusive reason.
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: There's no repetition of the proposition in this string.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: Causal basis isn't explicitly mentioned, so it's unlikely to fit here.
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: The string is highlighting that a group's belief is used to persuade -- this fits well with assuming something is true because "it is universally agreed upon."
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: Language does not seem ambiguous but rather focuses on consensus.

### 3. Analyze Key Phrases and Structure:

Key Phrases: 
- "group of people think"
- "in order to persuade"
- "to think the same way"

The key idea is that a group's consensus is used as a persuasiveness tool, suggesting an argument type based on presumed consensus.

### 4. Assess Underlying Reasoning (if applicable):

- The reasoning provided is that if a group thinks in a certain way, one should be persuaded to think the same way. This involves presumption of consensus as evidence.

### 5. Conclude with Classification:

After analyzing, the most fitting classification for the given string ", or a group of people think, in order to persuade one to think the same way." is:

**<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**

### Conclusion:

The string ", or a group of people think, in order to persuade one to think the same way." has been classified as <FU> Presumptuous Consensus. The reasoning is that it assumes that the thought process of a group should be persuasive purely based on its consensus, which is characteristic of Presumptuous Consensus.
