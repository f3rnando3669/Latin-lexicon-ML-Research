To apply the decomposition of the task of classifying the argumentative defect type (<IDA>) to the given string, we first need to identify and classify the components of the argument according to their defects. To do this, we will follow a step-by-step approach (IDAA).

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (IDAA):
1. **Identify the components of the argument in the given string**:
    - Who is making the argument?
    - What is the Proposition (<P>)?
    - What is the Reason (<R>) or arguments supporting the Proposition?
  
2. **Examine each component for defects**:
    - Check if the Proposition (<P>) is a Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), or another defect.
    - Check if the Reason (<R>) for the Proposition contains defects such as Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), or Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>).
    - Check if the Proof of Reason (<PR>) contains defects like Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>) or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

3. **Classify the detected defect type in the argument**:
    - Assign the appropriate defect type label (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>) based on the analysis.

### Application to the Given Argument:
#### Step 1: Identify the Components
  
- **Proposition (<P>) by Wilma**: "You cheated on your income tax."
- **Reason (<R>) implied by Wilma**: "Cheating on your income tax is wrong."
- **Rebuttal by Walter (possible <R>)**: "Hey, wait a minute. You cheated on your income tax last year. Or have you forgotten about that?"

#### Step 2: Examine Each Component for Defects

1. **Evaluate Wilma's Proposition and Reason**:
   - Proposition (<P>): "You cheated on your income tax."
   - Reason (<R>): "That’s wrong."

2. **Evaluate Walter's Rebuttal**:
   - Walter's rebuttal does not attempt to directly refute the Proposition or the Reason given by Wilma.
   - Instead, he brings up a counter-accusation: "You cheated on your income tax last year. Or have you forgotten about that?"

#### Step 3: Classify the Detected Defect Type

- The key defect type in Walter's argument is that he doesn’t provide a rebuttal to the Proposition or Reason presented by Wilma. Instead, he tries to undermine her by bringing up her own past behavior.
- This approach of addressing the opponent rather than the argument itself is known as a type of ad hominem attack, which is often characterized as deflecting or shifting the argumentation focus.

### Classification:
- Since Walter does not directly address the Proposition or the Reason but instead points to a personal behavior of Wilma, this resembles a defective argument strategy where the Reason (<R>) presented is actually an attempt to perform an unrelated attack.

Based on the definitions provided, this argument does not neatly fit into <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP> but instead demonstrates an Ad Hominem fallacy. However, if we were to apply the closest match from the defects outlined, it would arguably fall under insufficient causal basis (<WCB>) because the rebuttal does not weaken the causal basis of Wilma’s argument but instead shifts the ground of the argument to an unrelated matter.

Thus, given the set of defects provided:
- **Classification**: <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) or an additional category not listed: Ad Hominem.
