For 
To apply the decomposition of task (<D>) to the task of classifying a defective argument (<IDA>), we will follow specific steps. Here, we will break down the process of identifying and classifying the argument as a specific defect type:

**Step 1: Identify Proposition (<P>)**
The proposition is the statement or claim that is set forth to be proven.

In the given sentence:
- **Proposition (<P>):** "Students should not be allowed to park in lots now reserved for faculty."

**Step 2: Identify Reason (<R>)**
The reason sets forth the causal basis for the proposition.

In the given sentence:
- **Reason (<R>):** "because those lots should be for faculty only."

**Step 3: Classify the Type of Defective Argument**
Based on the identified <P> and <R>, we will now analyze and classify the defective argument type by matching it with definitions provided.

In this case, we check if the defective argument matches any of the defined types:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** This is not the case here, because the <P> is not making a broad assertion from a limited sample.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This is not applicable, as there is no enumeration involved in the argument.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Check if the <R> does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the <P>. 

    - Here, the reason given is "those lots should be for faculty only," which is merely a restatement of the proposition without providing additional rationale or evidence. The reason does not demonstrate why faculty lots should exclusively be for faculty beyond the proposition.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Check if the <R> essentially restates the <P>.
   
    - "Those lots should be for faculty only" is basically a repetition of "Students should not be allowed to park in lots now reserved for faculty" as it doesn't provide a new reason or evidence. It rephrases the proposition in a slightly different wording without offering additional justification.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The argument may also be potentially weak if the reason provided is not a compelling causal basis.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This is not applicable as there's no claim based on universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** This is not applicable as there's no apparent ambiguity in the given statement's language.

**Step 4: Final Determine the Classification**

Based on the analysis, the given argument closely aligns with **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)** because the reason provided merely restates the proposition without providing any additional justification or evidence.

**Conclusion:**

Applying IDAA to "Students should not be allowed to park in lots now reserved for faculty because those lots should be for faculty only," we classify this argument as of type **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**.
