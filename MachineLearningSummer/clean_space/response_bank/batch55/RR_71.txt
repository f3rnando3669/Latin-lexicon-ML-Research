Sure, let's break down the task of classifying the defective argument in the given string "Why should we put people on trial when we know they are guilty?" by applying the decomposition of tasks.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDAA Applied to IDA

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**
- Analyze the string "Why should we put people on trial when we know they are guilty?" to understand the main assertion.
- The implied proposition is: "We should not put people on trial when we know they are guilty."

**Step 2: Extract the Reason (R)**
- Determine the reason provided for the proposition.
- The reason provided is that "we know they are guilty."

**Step 3: Test for Reasons That Establish Truth (PR)**
- Check if the reason is being corroborated by further arguments or evidence. In this case, the string does not provide additional proof or argument.

**Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type**
- Now, we compare the provided argument against the defective argument types to classify its defects:

  - **Generalization (G)**: This does not seem to be a generalization of a sample to an entire population.
  - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This argument does not make an enumerative claim.
  - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason "we know they are guilty" does not conclusively demonstrate why trials should be unnecessary. It assumes the correctness without evidentiary alignment.
  - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The reason doesn’t establish a strong causal link between knowing someone is guilty and the conclusion that trials are unnecessary.
  - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason isn't a repetition of the proposition.
  - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument doesn’t rely on the idea that the point is "universally agreed upon."
  - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language doesn't seem ambiguous in this context.

### Conclusion:
The defective argument primarily falls into two categories but is best classified as **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided ("we know they are guilty") does not conclusively demonstrate why this should negate the need for a trial.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: It provides weak causal reasoning, as knowing guilt does not necessarily provide a sufficient basis for bypassing the legal process of a trial.

Considering the context and aiming to choose the most precise label, the primary classification is **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
