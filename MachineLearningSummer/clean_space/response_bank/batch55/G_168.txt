For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition and analysis of the task of identifying defective arguments) to the given string "I have a red car. My car was in a wreck. Therefore, all red cars get wrecked," let's break down the process step-by-step.

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - The Proposition in the argument is the statement that the arguer intends to prove.
   - In this case, the Proposition is: "All red cars get wrecked."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - The Reason is the causal basis that supports the Proposition.
   - Here, the Reason seems to be: "My car was in a wreck."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - The Proof of Reason is meant to corroborate the Reason with additional arguments.
   - In this example, there isn't an explicit Proof of Reason presented. The argument moves directly from the individual case to the general statement.

4. **Evaluate the Argument for Defects:**
   - **Generalization (G):** This type of defective argument occurs when the Proposition is based on a single case or a non-representative sample.
     - Check if the argument makes an unfounded leap from a single instance to a general rule.
     - In this case, the argument concludes "All red cars get wrecked" from a single incident involving the arguer's red car. This is a clear Generalization.

5. **Classify the Defective Argument:**
   - Given the analysis, the string "I have a red car. My car was in a wreck. Therefore, all red cars get wrecked." is a classic case of Generalization (G).

Summary of IDAA Applied:
- Break down the argument to identify its components: Proposition, Reason, and Proof of Reason.
- Evaluate whether the argument fits any predefined defective types.
- Classification: The argument is identified as a defective argument of type Generalization (G).
