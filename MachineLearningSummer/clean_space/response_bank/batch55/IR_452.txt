For 
Applying IDAA (which involves decomposing the task of classifying the argument into specific steps) to the provided dialogue between Charlie and Bob:

**Step 1: Identify the proposition (P) in Charlie's statement.**
- Proposition: "We need better regulation of the industry."

**Step 2: Identify the reason (R) supporting the proposition (P).**
- Reason: "Fast food is filled with salt, fat, and added sugars."

**Step 3: Identify any proof of reason (PR) provided by Charlie to support the reason (R).**
- Charlie does not provide explicit proof of reason (PR) in his statement.

**Step 4: Evaluate Bob's response.**
- Bob's response: "That may be, but you're sure a hypocrite! I saw you devour a Triple-Baconator, super-sized fries, and 64 ounces of soda yesterday." 

**Step 5: Classify Bob's argument using defective argument types.**
- Bob's argument does not actually address the proposition (P) or reason (R) presented by Charlie. Instead, he attacks Charlie personally by highlighting Charlie’s behavior.

**Step 6: Determine which classification matches Bob's response.**
- Bob's response is a type of ad hominem (attacking the person instead of addressing the argument).
  
In the framework of the defective argument types defined earlier:
- The closest matches from the list provided would seem to be:
  - None perfectly match ad hominem, but elements of "Presumptuous Consensus" (FU) and "Ambiguous Language Use" (DEP) do not fully apply here either.
- Given the options, Bob's response does not fall neatly into one of the predefined defective argument classifications (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

Finally, we need to clarify the original classification and might need to expand our list of defective argument types to include ad hominem for this specific scenario. But within the given classifications, Bob's argument doesn't fit into any of the predefined defective arguments, indicating perhaps a need to refine or expand the classifications.

Result: The classification of Bob’s argument as per the given defective argument list is indeterminate, suggesting an expansion to include types such as 'Ad Hominem'.
