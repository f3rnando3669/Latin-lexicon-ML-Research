For 
Let's apply the process of decomposition of the advanced task (IDAA) to classify the given string as one of the defective argument types (IDA).

### Step-by-Step Analysis (D):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - In this context, the Proposition (<P>) is the main claim or statement that is being argued.
   - **Proposition**: "We should not ban Hummers."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - The Reason (<R>) is the causal basis or justification given in support of the Proposition.
   - **Reason**: "If we ban Hummers because they are bad for the environment eventually the government will ban all cars."

3. **Evaluate the Argument Types**:
   - Now, we will evaluate if the argument falls into any of the defective argument types defined.

### Steps to classify <s> into IDA:

1. **Check for Generalization (G)**:
   - Does the Proposition apply a general rule based on limited instances or majority but not necessarily all?
   - Here, the Proposition does not make a generalization based on limited data, so it’s not G.

2. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - Does the Proposition claim a complete set of possibilities but misses out on some?
   - The argument does not enumerate possibilities, so it’s not FE.

3. **Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - Does the Reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition?
   - Yes, the statement "eventually the government will ban all cars" doesn't conclusively show that banning Hummers specifically leads logically to a ban on all cars.

4. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - Is the causal basis for the Proposition not compelling?
   - Yes, the Reason provided seems speculative and not a strong causal link to the Proposition about banning Hummers leading to banning all cars.

5. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - Does the Reason merely repeat the Proposition in different words?
   - This does not apply in this case, as the Reason offers a different claim (though speculative).

6. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - Does the Proof of Reason assume universal agreement for something still in dispute?
   - This does not apply here, as there’s no claim of universal agreement involved.

7. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
   - Can the Proof of Reason be taken in another sense than intended by the speaker?
   - This does not apply here, as the language used in Reason and Proposition is unambiguous.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the classification of the argument is:

- **IR: Inconclusive Reason** - The Reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.
- **WCB: Insufficient Causal Basis** - The Reason has a weak and speculative causal link to the Proposition.

By the IDAA process, the given string can be classified as falling into categories:
- **IR** (Inconclusive Reason)
- **WCB** (Insufficient Causal Basis).
