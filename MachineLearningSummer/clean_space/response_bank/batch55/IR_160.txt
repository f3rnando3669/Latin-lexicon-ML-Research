For 
To apply IDAA to the statement "Don't believe what Kim says about global warming. Kim dropped out of college!", we need to decompose the task of classifying the argument type into specific steps. Let's start by breaking down the argument and then categorizing it according to the defective argument types defined.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
1. **Proposition (P)**: The main point that the argument is making is that we should not believe what Kim says about global warming.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
2. **Reason (R)**: The causal basis for this proposition is that Kim dropped out of college.

### Step 3: Assess the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
3. **Proof of Reason (PR)**: There is no additional proof offered here; the reason itself is stated as "Kim dropped out of college."

### Step 4: Determine if there is a match to defective argument types
- **Generalization (G)**: This does not involve asserting something about a whole group based on partial evidence.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This does not claim to enumerate all possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This could be relevant here. The reason (Kim dropped out of college) does not necessarily relate to the correctness of Kim's claims about global warming.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The reason given (Kim dropped out of college) does not provide a compelling causal basis for the proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason does not simply repeat the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There is no claim of universal agreement here.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: There does not appear to be ambiguity in the language used.

### Step 5: Match to closest defective argument type
Based on the analysis, it seems that the argument primarily suffers from an **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because the reason given (Kim dropping out of college) does not provide a compelling causal basis for the claim that one should not believe what Kim says about global warming.

### Conclusion
The statement "Don't believe what Kim says about global warming. Kim dropped out of college!" is classified as a defective argument type of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
