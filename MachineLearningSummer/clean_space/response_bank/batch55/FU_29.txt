For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition approach) to the task of classifying the defective argument type of the string "Everyone being referred to as comrade," we will break down the process into specific steps. Here’s how that can be done:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

#### Step 1: Identify the proposition (<P>) in the string.
The proposition is the core assertion or statement we intend to prove or discuss.

- In this case, <P> is: "Everyone is being referred to as comrade."

#### Step 2: Examine the context to find the reasoning (<R>).
Look for or infer reasoning that explains why <P> is claimed to be true.

- The string "Everyone being referred to as comrade" doesn’t provide an explicit reason. We must analyze the implied reason behind the statement.

#### Step 3: Assess the argument to see if it includes a proof of reason (<PR>).
This step involves checking for any additional evidence or argumentation that supports the reason.

- The string doesn’t offer further proof or evidence; it just makes a blanket assertion.

#### Step 4: Identify if the argument fits any defective argument classifications.
Using the definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>, we classify the defect type.

### Analysis of Defective Argument Type

#### Generalization (<G>)
An assertion based on some part or majority of individuals, generalized to all.

- "Everyone being referred to as comrade" assumes that the practice of referring to individuals as comrades is universal, without specifying the scope or population from which this observation is drawn.

#### Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
A claim to having made a complete enumeration of possibilities but missing out on some pertinent ones.

- The statement does not imply enumeration of all possibilities; it is a general assertion.

#### Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.

- There is no explicit reason presented, so this category does not fit here.

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
The reason is weak or not compelling.

- Again, no explicit reason or causal basis is given in the string.

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
Reason is presented but says precisely the same as the proposition.

- There is no repetition here.

#### Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
Proof of reason assumed as certain due to "universal agreement."

- Not applicable; no consensus is mentioned.

#### Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)
Proof of reason can be taken in another sense than intended.

- There is no indication of ambiguous language.

### Classification

Given that the statement "Everyone being referred to as comrade" hinges upon a broad application from an unspecified or insufficient data source, the most fitting classification is:

- **<G> (Generalization)**

This is because the statement generalizes a practice to the entirety of "everyone" without any qualification or scope, fitting the criteria for the Generalization defective argument type.

### Conclusion
By methodically breaking down the task through steps and applying the definitions, we classify "Everyone being referred to as comrade" as a case of **Generalization (<G>)**.
