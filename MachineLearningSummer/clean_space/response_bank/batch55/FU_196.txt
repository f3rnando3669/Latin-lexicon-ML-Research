For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a defective argument) to the given string "I guess I should buy my 12-year-old daughter an iPhone. Everyone at her new school has one and I want her to fit in with the other kids.", we will proceed step by step as follows:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)

The proposition in the string is:
- "I guess I should buy my 12-year-old daughter an iPhone."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)

The reason provided in support of the proposition is:
- "Everyone at her new school has one and I want her to fit in with the other kids."

### Step 3: Identify if there is a Proof of Reason (<PR>)

In this argument, there is no separate proof of reason provided. The string lacks additional arguments corroborating the reason.

### Step 4: Check for Defective Argument Types

Now, we will classify the argument by checking for any of the defective argument types mentioned (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

**1. Generalization (<G>)**
- Is the proposition based on an assertion about all individuals based on a part or majority? 
- In the string, the argument is based on a specific observation (everyone at her new school has one), but it does not necessarily imply a generalization about the population at large. So, it doesn't fit <G> directly.

**2. Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
- Does the proposition claim to have covered all possibilities but miss out on some?
- The argument does not enumerate possibilities explicitly, nor does it claim completeness. So, it does not fit <FE>.

**3. Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- Does the reason not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
- The reason provided (everyone has one, and I want her to fit in) does not conclusively prove that buying an iPhone is necessary. "Fitting in" is a subjective and inconclusive basis for the proposition.

**4. Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
- Is the causal basis provided by the reason not compelling?
- The causal basis ("to fit in with other kids") may be considered weak without additional context or support, making the reason insufficient.

**5. Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**
- Does the reason essentially restate the proposition?
- The reason provided restates the concern indirectly but doesn't merely repeat the proposition.

**6. Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
- Is the proof of reason based on assumed consensus?
- The argument assumes that because "everyone at her new school has one," it must be true she needs one to fit in, suggesting an assumed consensus without actual proof.

**7. Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**
- Can the proof of reason be taken in another sense?
- The language used ("fit in with the other kids") is somewhat ambiguous but not excessively so. It's relatively clear what the speaker intends.

### Step 5: Classify the Defective Argument

Based on the analysis, the argument most closely fits the following defective argument types:
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The reasoning assumes a consensus that having an iPhone is necessary for fitting in.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis for the proposition ("to fit in with other kids") is weak and not compelling without additional support.

### Conclusion

The classification for the given string "I guess I should buy my 12-year-old daughter an iPhone. Everyone at her new school has one and I want her to fit in with the other kids." is:

- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**
