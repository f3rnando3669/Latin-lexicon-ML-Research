For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying the argument into its steps) to the statement "Every time I wash my car it rains; therefore, washing my car makes it rain," we will decompose the task into specific steps and analyze each part of the argument accordingly.

### Decomposition Steps for <IDA> (Classifying Argument Type):
1. Identify the proposition <P>.
2. Identify the reason <R>.
3. Identify the proof of reason <PR>.
4. Evaluate the argument for potential defects.
5. Classify the argument as one of the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step-by-Step Application of <IDAA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition <P>:**
   - Proposition (<P>): "Washing my car makes it rain."

2. **Identify the Reason <R>:**
   - Reason (<R>): "Every time I wash my car it rains."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason <PR>:**
   - In this argument, there is no additional evidence or argument beyond <R> that is provided to support <P>. Therefore, <PR> is absent in this case.

4. **Evaluate the Argument for Potential Defects:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** The argument might be an overgeneralization if it assumes that the personal experience of the speaker (every time they wash their car it rains) applies universally.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This doesn't seem to apply as the argument doesn't claim to enumerate possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason given (it always rains when the car is washed) does not conclusively prove that washing the car is the cause of the rain.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The reason is not a compelling causal basis for the proposition. Just because two events coincide (washing a car and rain) does not mean one causes the other.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason is not merely repeating the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** There is no claim of consensus in the argument.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** There is no ambiguous language in the proof of reason.

5. **Classify the Argument:**
   - The argument has an insufficient causal basis for the claim. The provided reason (correlation between car washing and rain) does not convincingly establish the cause-effect relationship (washing the car makes it rain). Therefore, it is a classic example of the **fallacy of "Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc"**, which is a type of <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).

### Conclusion:
The argument "Every time I wash my car it rains; therefore, washing my car makes it rain" should be classified as <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis). This reason lacks compelling evidence to support the proposition that washing the car causes it to rain.
