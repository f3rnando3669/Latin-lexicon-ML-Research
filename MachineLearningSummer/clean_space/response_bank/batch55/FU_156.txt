To apply the process of decomposing the task of classifying a defective argument (IDA) into specific steps (D) and then applying it to classify the given string, we can break it down as follows:

### Decomposition (D) of Task (IDA):
1. **Identification of Argument Parts:**
    - Identify the Proposition (P) in the given string.
    - Identify the Reason (R) supporting the Proposition.
    - Identify the Proof of Reason (PR) if present.

2. **Classification of Defective Argument Types:**
    - Compare the identified parts to known defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).
    - Determine if the argument fits into one or more of the defective types.

### Application (IDAA) to the Given String

#### Your Given String:
"Up until the late 16th century, most people believed that the earth was the center of the universe. This was seen as enough of a reason back then to accept this as true."

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identification of Argument Parts:**
    - **Proposition (P):** "The earth is the center of the universe."
    - **Reason (R):** "Most people believed this to be true up until the late 16th century."

    There does not appear to be an explicit Proof of Reason (PR) provided in this string.

2. **Classification of Defective Argument Types:**
    - Examine the Reason (R) for potential defects in argumentation.

      Let's go through each defective argument type to determine which (if any) applies:

      - **Generalization (G):** The argument does not generalize based on a part to the whole; instead, it mentions a historical belief.
      - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument does not claim a complete listing of possibilities.
      - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The Reason (R) does not demonstratively establish the truth of the Proposition (P). The belief of most people does not necessarily equate to the truth.
      - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** There is a causal basis (belief of most people), but it is not compelling or sufficient to establish truth.
      - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The Reason does not merely repeat the Proposition.
      - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument relies on the consensus (most people believed).
      - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** No significant ambiguous language is present.

#### Conclusion:
- The main types that closely fit the given string are **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

##### Final Classification:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Because the reason that "most people believed" does not logically prove that the earth is the center of the universe.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reasoning insufficiently establishes the proposition as a compelling truth.

Therefore, the given string "Up until the late 16th century, most people believed that the earth was the center of the universe. This was seen as enough of a reason back then to accept this as true." can be classified under the defective arguments **IR (Inconclusive Reason)** and **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
