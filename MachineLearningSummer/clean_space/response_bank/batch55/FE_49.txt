Let's apply the decomposition (D) to the task of classifying the given string (IDA) as one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D):
1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine the main claim or assertion being proposed.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Find the causal or supporting basis for the Proposition.
3. **Evaluate Proof of Reason (PR)**: Check if additional arguments are presented to support the Reason.
4. **Apply Defective Argument Criteria**: Compare the structure of the argument against the criteria for defective arguments <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

Let's break down the argument:
- **String (s)**: "Either we accept the findings of this study demonstrating that this new intervention is the best to be used for this disorder, or we must no longer call ourselves scientists, psychologists, or reasonable people."

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The Proposition (P) in the argument is:
- "We must accept the findings of this study demonstrating that this new intervention is the best to be used for this disorder."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The Reason (R) supporting the Proposition is implied through a conditional statement rather than explicit reasoning:
- "If we do not accept the findings, we must no longer call ourselves scientists, psychologists, or reasonable people." This suggests that being a scientist, psychologist, or reasonable person intrinsically requires acceptance of the studyâ€™s findings.

### Step 3: Evaluate Proof of Reason (PR)
There is no additional argument or proof (PR) provided in the statement to further substantiate the Reason (R).

### Step 4: Apply Defective Argument Criteria
Let's match the argument against each defective argument type to see which fits best:
1. **<G> Generalization**: No generalization based on a part or majority is evident here.
2. **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: There is no enumeration of possibilities that may be missing.
3. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The Reason (R) does not seem to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition (P). It relies on an emotional appeal rather than logical reasoning, creating a false dichotomy.
4. **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: The Reason (R) is not a repetition of the Proposition (P).
5. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: The Reason (R) relies on a weak causal basis, appealing to authority and identity rather than providing concrete evidence for the Proposition (P).
6. **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: The argument implies a universal agreement, but does not directly state it.
7. **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: There is no ambiguity in the wording.

Given the analysis, the defective argument type that best fits is:
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The Reason presented does not conclusively prove the Proposition and relies on a false dichotomy, suggesting that not accepting the findings questions the identity and rationality of the audience, rather than providing concrete evidence.

Therefore, the argument "Either we accept the findings of this study demonstrating that this new intervention is the best to be used for this disorder, or we must no longer call ourselves scientists, psychologists, or reasonable people." is classified as <IR>.
