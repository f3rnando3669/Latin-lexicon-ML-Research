To apply the IDAA (decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument) to the given statement, we will break down the task into specific steps. Let's follow these steps:

### Step 1: Decompose the statement into its parts
1. **Identify the propositions if multiple**:
   - Proposition 1: "His political party wants to spend your precious tax dollars on big government."
   - Proposition 2: "But my political party is planning strategic federal investment in critical programs."

### Step 2: Identify any reasoning and proof of reasoning associated with the propositions
- For Proposition 1:
  - Reasoning (R): Implication that spending increases are negative or wasteful ("wants to spend your precious tax dollars on big government").
  - Proof of Reasoning (PR): Lacking direct proof or additional arguments to support the implication presented.

- For Proposition 2:
  - Reasoning (R): Implies a more positive or beneficial outcome ("strategic federal investment in critical programs").
  - Proof of Reasoning (PR): Also lacking additional arguments or evidence to corroborate the reasoning.

### Step 3: Evaluate defective argument types

#### Evaluating Proposition 1:
- **Generalization (G)**: It does sound like it might overgeneralize by suggesting all the actions of "his political party" are about spending tax dollars on big government.
  - This fits the form of (G) as it casts an assertion on a broad group without supporting each individual action or member.

#### Evaluating Proposition 2:
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Proposition 2 states that an alternative spending plan is "strategic federal investment in critical programs," which is essentially restated rather than further explained or proven. 
  - This could be seen as (RR) because it repeats the initial proposition using different words without presenting real reasoning.

### Step 4: Cross-evaluate causes and effects
- **Incorrect Reasoning (IR)**: If the reasoning in both propositions does not conclusively demonstrate correctness due to lack of evidence or causation, then both might be classified under IR. However, this seems less directly fitting compared to the Generalization and Faulty Repetition identified above.

### Step 5: Make the final classification based on the more dominant defect in reasoning
- Given the steps and evaluation:
  - Proposition 1 seems more accurately classified as a **Generalization (G)**.
  - Proposition 2 seems more accurately classified as a **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** due to its reiteration of the idea rather than presenting new supporting evidence.

### Conclusion

The given statement "His political party wants to spend your precious tax dollars on big government. But my political party is planning strategic federal investment in critical programs." can be classified as containing:
- **Generalization** <G> in Proposition 1.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition** <RR> in Proposition 2.
