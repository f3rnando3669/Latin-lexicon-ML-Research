For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument type into specific steps) to the question "Have you stopped cheating on your tests?", we need to follow a structured approach to identify the type of defective argument. 

Here’s the step-by-step decomposition and analysis:

1. **Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P> and Reason <R> in the Question**

   - **Proposition <P>:** The proposition implicit in the question is "You have been cheating on your tests."
   - **Reason <R>:** The reason is not explicitly stated in the question, but it is assumed to be prior behavior of cheating.

2. **Step 2: Check for the Presence of Defective Argument Types**

   We will examine the string against each defective argument type definition to see which it fits:

   - **Generalization (G):** The question does not generalize from a subset to the whole; it directly addresses the individual being questioned.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The question does not enumerate possibilities; it only suggests a binary situation (stopped or not stopped).
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** There isn’t an explicit reason provided in the question, making IR not applicable directly here.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis is implied but not weakly presented due to lack of provided reasons, not directly weak.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason isn’t repeating the proposition; hence, RR doesn’t apply.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument is not relying on a presumed consensus or generally accepted truth.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The question employs a structure that can lead to a misleading or forced assumption, hinting at ambiguity.

3. **Step 3: Evaluate for Ambiguity in Language (DEP)**

   - The key feature of the question is its structure. It implicitly assumes that the person asked has been cheating without providing evidence for this proposition (P). Therefore, it creates a "loaded question," which can be taken to unfairly presuppose guilt.
   - Ambiguity in such questions forces the respondent into a dilemma without acknowledging the proposition's truth or falsity independently.

4. **Step 4: Extract Conclusion and Identify Argument Type**

   - Based on the analysis above, the defective argument type here aligns most closely with **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**. The question ambiguously presupposes an assertion without allowing for the scenario where the presupposition (cheating) is false.

**Conclusion:**
The question "Have you stopped cheating on your tests?" is classified under the defective argument type **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)** due to the inherent presupposition that the questioned individual has been cheating, thereby leading to potential misinterpretation or unfair assumption.
