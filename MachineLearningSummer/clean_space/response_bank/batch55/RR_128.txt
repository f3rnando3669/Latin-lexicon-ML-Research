To apply IDAA to classify the given string, we will decompose the task (IDA) into specific steps (D). Here are the steps to follow:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)** - Determine the main assertion or statement that is being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)** - Find the causal basis or supporting reason that is provided for the main assertion.
3. **Check the Proof of Reason (PR)** - Look for any additional arguments or evidence that corroborates the Reason.
4. **Classify the argument** - Based on the identified parts, classify the argument as one of the defective types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

Applying these steps to the given string:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**

Bob: "that movie was a waste of time and money"  
- Here, Bob asserts that the movie was not worthwhile, which we can consider as the Proposition (<P>).

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)**

Ted: "what was wrong with it?"  
Bob: "It sucked"  
- Bob's reason for why the movie was a waste of time and money is that "It sucked." This is meant to serve as the Reason (<R>).

**Step 3: Check the Proof of Reason (PR)**

- There is no additional argument or evidence provided by Bob beyond his initial Reason. There is no Proof of Reason (<PR>).

**Step 4: Classify the argument**

- The Reason provided by Bob, "It sucked," is vague and does not give a compelling causal basis to support the Proposition. "It sucked" is neither a detailed nor a conclusive reason.

Based on our definitions, we can classify this argument as <RR>:

**Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** - Here, the reason given is weak because it essentially repeats the proposition in different words without providing additional substantive information. "It sucked" merely reiterates that the movie was bad without explaining why.

**Final Classification:**

This is an example of <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
