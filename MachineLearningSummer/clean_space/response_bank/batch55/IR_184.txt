For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition and step-by-step application) to the given statement, we need to classify the argument based on the defective argument types provided. Here’s how we can decompose this task:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - This is the main statement or assertion that is being argued.
   - In this case: "We should abolish the death penalty."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - This is the argument provided to support the Proposition.
   - In this case: "Many respected people, such as Imran Kader, have publicly stated their opposition to it."

3. **Determine which category the argument fits:**
   - We need to analyze if the reason or any component of the statement fits into one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Analyze the Proposition (<P>):**
   - "We should abolish the death penalty." 
   - The proposition itself is clear and direct.

2. **Analyze the Reason (<R>):**
   - "Many respected people, such as Imran Kader, have publicly stated their opposition to it."
   - This is the reasoning provided to support the proposition.

3. **Evaluate the Reason Against Defective Argument Types:**

   - **Generalization (<G>):**
     - Is this a generalization based on a limited sample?
     - Not exactly, it doesn’t claim universality but leverages authority.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
     - Does it claim to be a complete list of reasons?
     - No, it doesn’t present itself as a complete enumeration.
  
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
     - Does the reason conclusively support the proposition?
     - There's a fundamental issue here: just because some respected people oppose the death penalty doesn’t necessarily provide conclusive evidence that it should be abolished. This doesn’t establish causality or address the nuances of the death penalty debate comprehensively.
  
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
     - Is the causal basis compelling enough?
     - The reason given (some respected people’s opposition) doesn’t provide a comprehensive causal basis. It might be seen as appealing to authority without substantial evidence.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
     - Is the reason merely a restatement of the proposition?
     - No, it presents a different idea (support from respected people).

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
     - Is it assuming consensus prematurely?
     - There's an element here; it suggests that the opinion of respected people equals a consensus, which isn't necessarily true.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
     - Could the language be taken in another sense?
     - The language seems clear; no significant ambiguity is present in the terms used.

### Conclusion:

After evaluating the argument against all possible defective argument types, the following classifications seem appropriate:

**Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason provided (some respected people’s opposition) does not conclusively establish the correctness of abolishing the death penalty.

**Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The argument relies on the opposition of "respected people" as if it’s a widely accepted consensus, which can be presumptuous.

Thus, the argument "We should abolish the death penalty. Many respected people, such as Imran Kader, have publicly stated their opposition to it.” can be classified as containing aspects of **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** and **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**.
