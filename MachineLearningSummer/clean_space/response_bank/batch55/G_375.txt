For 
To apply IDAA to the statement "Atheists are morally bankrupt," we will decompose and examine this statement step by step to classify it as one of the defective argument types defined. Here we go:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)

The proposition (P) in the statement is:
- **P**: "Atheists are morally bankrupt."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R) if Present

In the given statement, there is no explicit reason (R) provided to support the proposition. However, this might not be necessary for all faulty argument types.

### Step 3: Check for Defective Argument Types

Given the types of defective arguments defined (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP), let's analyze the statement in the context of each type:

1. **Generalization (G)**
   - **Definition**: The P is based on some one part or on a majority of individuals but not necessarily applicable to all, and is referred to all.
   - **Analysis**: The statement "Atheists are morally bankrupt" is making a sweeping generalization about all atheists based on an unverified sample. The moral character of atheists cannot be uniformly asserted without evidence applicable to every individual atheist.
   - **Conclusion**: This seems to fit the type <G>.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
   - **Definition**: The P is defective when we claim to have made a complete enumeration of the possibilities but actually miss out on some pertinent ones.
   - **Analysis**: The statement does not list possibilities or suggest it has considered all variables.
   - **Conclusion**: This does not fit <FE>.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
   - **Definition**: The R does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the P.
   - **Analysis**: There is no explicit reason R presented here.
   - **Conclusion**: This does not fit <IR>.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
   - **Definition**: The R is weak if the causal basis which it submits for the P is not compelling.
   - **Analysis**: Again, no causal basis R is submitted.
   - **Conclusion**: This does not fit <WCB>.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
   - **Definition**: The R is weak when it appears to be presented as the R, but says precisely the same as was said in the P.
   - **Analysis**: No separate R is given.
   - **Conclusion**: This does not fit <RR>.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
   - **Definition**: The PR is assumed as certain on the ground that "it is universally agreed upon," a thing which is still in dispute.
   - **Analysis**: There is no presumption of universal agreement stated here.
   - **Conclusion**: This does not fit <FU>.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**
   - **Definition**: The PR can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended.
   - **Analysis**: The statement does not employ particularly ambiguous language.
   - **Conclusion**: This does not fit <DEP>.

### Step 4: Classify the Statement

After the analysis, the statement "Atheists are morally bankrupt" is best classified as a Generalization (G) since it makes a blanket assertion about all atheists without sufficient evidence to support the claim for each individual.

### Conclusion

The defective argument type for "Atheists are morally bankrupt." is:
- **<G>**: Generalization
