For 
To apply the IDAA (the decomposition of the Identification of Defective Arguments task) to the string "the following is an example of...," we need to break down the process of identifying what type of defective argument it might be. Here are the decomposed steps for the task:

### Steps for IDAA:

1. **Understand the Defective Argument Types:**
   - Review and understand the definitions of the defective argument types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), and Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

2. **Analyze the String:**
   - Examine the string "the following is an example of..." for any distinct markers or claims that align with the characteristics of the defective argument types.

3. **Classification Step-by-Step:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** Check if there is an assertion based on a single instance or a non-representative sample.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Determine if the argument implies a complete list but misses some possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Check if the reason provided does not conclusively support the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Examine if the causal basis is not compelling or sufficiently strong.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Identify if the reason merely restates the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Check if it assumes a consensus that is still in dispute.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Look for ambiguity in how the argument or proof is presented.

### Applying IDAA to the Given String:

1. **Understand the Defective Argument Types:**
   - We've already provided the definitions of each defective argument type.

2. **Analyze the String:**
   - The string is: "the following is an example of..."
   - This string is incomplete and does not provide enough context about the argument or what it's an example of.

3. **Classification Step-by-Step:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** The string does not make an assertion that generalizes from a single instance or non-representative sample.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The string does not claim a complete list or enumeration.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** There's no reason or proof presented in the given string. It's incomplete.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Similarly, there's no causal basis presented.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The string does not repeat any proposition or argument.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The string does not make any assumptions about universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The string is incomplete and does not present ambiguity in terms of the argument's proof.

Since the string "the following is an example of..." is incomplete and does not provide sufficient information, it does not fit the definitions of the defective argument types provided.

### Conclusion:
Given that the string "the following is an example of..." is incomplete and lacks context, it does not directly classify under any of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>). Therefore, it's not possible to categorize this incomplete string into any specific defective argument type based on the given definitions.
