To apply the process of decomposing the task of classifying a given string as a specific type of defective argument (IDA), we will break down the task into specific steps (D). Hereâ€™s how the application of performing decomposition (IDAA) to the classification task (IDA) would look step-by-step for classifying the argument:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**

Identify the primary assertion or proposition that the speaker intends to prove.

- In the given string, the proposition (<P>) is: "I need a new car."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**

Determine the causal basis presented to establish the truth of the proposition.

- The reason (<R>) provided is: "The owner of the car dealership by my house told me."

**Step 3: Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**

Check any additional arguments that corroborate the reason given.

- Here, the proof of reason (<PR>) is: "he would know since he works in the industry."

**Step 4: Compare the Identified Parts to Defective Argument Types**

Compare the identified <P>, <R>, and <PR> against the definitions of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP) to identify which one it most closely matches.

1. **Generalization (<G>):** Not applicable as it's not based on the majority or a single part referred to all.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Not applicable as there is no claim of a complete enumeration of possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This seems potentially relevant. While working in the industry gives some level of authority, it's not a conclusive reason that unquestionably justifies needing a new car.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Also relevant. The fact that the owner works in the industry may not be a compelling enough reason as the owner also has a vested interest in selling cars.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Not applicable as it does not repeat the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Not applicable since there is no claim based on universal agreement.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Not applicable as there is no significant ambiguity in the language use regarding different interpretations.

**Step 5: Determine the Most Fitting Defective Argument Type**

Based on comparison, determine which defective argument type is the most fitting.

- In this instance, the argument fits best with **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because the reason (<R>) provided by the car dealer working in the industry does not form a compelling enough causal basis for needing a new car, given the potential vested interests of the dealer.

**Conclusion**

Based on the steps above, the classification of the given string is <WCB>. The argument "The owner of the car dealership by my house told me I need a new car, and he would know since he works in the industry" is classified as Insufficient Causal Basis.
