For 
To apply IDAA (decompose the task of classifying the string into specific steps) to the given conversation between Speaker 1 and Speaker 2:

Step 1: Identify the Propositions and Reasons in the Argument
Speaker 1’s statement:
- **Proposition (P)**: "The idea of a moral law requires the existence of a lawgiver (i.e., God)."
- **Reason (R)**: (Implied but not fully stated) Perhaps an author's notion that moral laws imply a moral lawgiver.

Speaker 2’s statement does not provide a clear proposition or reason related to arguing against Speaker 1's point but rather an attack on Speaker 1's credibility based on their religious beliefs.

Step 2: Determine if there is a Reason substantiating Speaker 1’s Proposition
Speaker 1's proposition appears as a statement without a detailed reason provided explicitly in the text.

Step 3: Examine Speaker 2's Response for Type of Defective Argument
Analyze Speaker 2’s response within the criteria provided:
- **Generalization (G)**: Not applicable here as the response does not assert a generalized proposition applicable to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable since no enumeration of possibilities is provided.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Not applicable directly, as no reason is provided by Speaker 2.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Not applicable, as no causal basis is provided directly by Speaker 2.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Not applicable, as no repetition is present in Speaker 2's response.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Not applicable, as Speaker 2 does not appeal to consensus.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Not applicable since the language used (an attack on character) is direct.

Evaluate Speaker 2’s Argument:
Speaker 2’s response focuses on an ad hominem attack, questioning the validity of Speaker 1's statement solely based on their identity as a Christian rather than addressing the proposition or provided reasoning.

Step 4: Classify the Type of Defective Argument
Given Speaker 2's response, the type of defective argument aligns closely with an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** classification. Although no direct reason is displayed, the response does not attempt to disprove Speaker 1's proposition effectively and does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness or incorrectness of Speaker 1's P. 

Thus, the dialogue would represent IR, as Speaker 2’s engagement does not substantively address the argument’s core reasons or propositions.

**Final Classification** for "Speaker 1: I think the idea of a moral law requires the existence of a lawgiver (i.e. God). Speaker 2: Of course you would say that. You’re a Christian. Why should we listen to you?" based on defective argument types:
**IR (Inconclusive Reason)** - Speaker 2's comment does not address the causal basis of Speaker 1's argument.
