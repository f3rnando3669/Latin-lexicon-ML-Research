Applying the process for decomposing the task of classifying the given string as per the defective argument types, we progress step-by-step through the classification:

### Step 1: Identify and Isolate Assertions (Propositions)
First, we identify the statements within the string that are establishing a specific claim or assertion (P):

1. **Proposition 1 (P1):** "We know the virus started in a lab because it's too deadly to have just been the result of basic circumstance."
2. **Proposition 2 (P2):** "But it hasn't been as deadly for China which proves that it's lab-made."
3. **Proposition 3 (P3):** "Because it's deadly."

### Step 2: Identify and Isolate Reasons (R)
Next, we identify the Reasons (R) provided to support each of the Propositions (P):

1. **Reason for P1 (R1):** "because it's too deadly to have just been the result of basic circumstance."
2. **Reason for P2 (R2):** "which proves that it's lab-made." (This overlaps with P2 itself, making it potentially a Faulty Repetition)
3. **Reason for P3 (R3):** "Because it's deadly." (Again, overlapping with P3 itself, another repetition)

### Step 3: Evaluate Each Proposition for Defective Argument Types
Now we proceed with the evaluation of each proposition and its associated reasons for defective argument types:

#### Evaluation for Proposition 1:
**P1:** "We know the virus started in a lab..."
- **R1:** "...because it's too deadly to have just been the result of basic circumstance."
- **Possible Defective Argument Types:**
  - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason provided ("it's too deadly") does not conclusively demonstrate that the virus must have started in a lab.
  - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reasoning that deadliness implies a lab origin is weak and not compelling.

Given this, P1 primarily suffers from **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

#### Evaluation for Proposition 2:
**P2:** "But it hasn't been as deadly for China which proves that it's lab-made."
- **R2:** "which proves that it's lab-made."
- **Possible Defective Argument Types:**
  - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason essentially repeats the proposition without adding new evidence or reasoning.
  - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument assumes a complete consideration of reasons without acknowledging other factors that could explain lower death rates in China.

Given this, P2 primarily suffers from **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** and potentially **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**.

#### Evaluation for Proposition 3:
**P3:** "Because it's deadly."
- **R3:** "Because it's deadly."
- **Possible Defective Argument Types:**
  - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Here, the reason is just a repetition of the proposition itself.

Given this, P3 primarily suffers from **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**.

### Step 4: Synthesize Findings
Combining these findings, we formulate the final classification for the string as containing multiple defective argument types:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Present in reasoning for P1.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Present in reasoning for P1.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Present in reasoning for P2 and overwhelmingly in P3.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Potentially present in reasoning for P2.

### Conclusion
The string "We know the virus started in a lab because it's too deadly to have just been the result of basic circumstance. But it hasn't been as deadly for China which proves that it's lab-made. Because it's deadly." includes defective argument types: **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**, and potentially **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**.

Thus, in the context of <IDAA>, the string would be classified primarily as containing IR, WCB, RR, and potentially FE.
