For 
Sure, let's apply the IDAA to the statement: "Every time we sacrifice virgins, it rains. Therefore, sacrificing virgins causes it to rain."

### Step 1: Decompose the IDA task
Identify the defective argument type by checking for various types of logical fallacies or defects defined as <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

#### Sub-tasks:
1. Check if the Proposition <P> is a Generalization <G>.
2. Check if the Proposition <P> involves an Incomplete Enumeration <FE>.
3. Check if the Reason <R> is Inconclusive <IR>.
4. Check if the Reason <R> has an Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>.
5. Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>.
6. Check if the Proof of Reason <PR> involves Presumptuous Consensus <FU>.
7. Check if the argument uses Ambiguous Language <DEP>.

### Step 2: Identify components of the argument
- **Proposition** (<P>): "Sacrificing virgins causes it to rain."
- **Reason** (<R>): "Every time we sacrifice virgins, it rains."

### Step 3: Apply each sub-task to the argument

1. **Check for Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The statement "Every time we sacrifice virgins, it rains" assumes that a specific observed pattern can be generalized to a cause-and-effect relationship without sufficient basis for the generality.
   - However, this isn't a textbook case of <G> because it doesn't mention a categorical generalization about populations or classes directly. It is more about causation.

2. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - This is not an incomplete enumeration. It does not provide a list of possibilities or claim completeness.

3. **Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The reason provided, "Every time we sacrifice virgins, it rains," does not conclusively establish the correctness of the Proposition because correlation does not imply causation. This could be considered as <IR>, but it fits more accurately into another category (explained next).

4. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - The key issue in the argument is that the causal basis (correlation between virgin sacrifices and rain) is not compelling or sufficient to demonstrate that sacrifices truly cause rain. This strongly points to an <WCB> defect, as the causation is weak and not substantiated by compelling evidence.

5. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - The Reason is not merely a repetition of the Proposition. They are distinct statements.

6. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - Thereâ€™s no mention of universal agreement or consensus. This defect type does not apply here.

7. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
   - There is no ambiguous language in the statement. The terms are quite literal and straightforward.

### Step 4: Conclusion
The defective argument in "Every time we sacrifice virgins, it rains. Therefore, sacrificing virgins causes it to rain." primarily shows the defect type <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) because the Reason does not provide a compelling or substantiated causal connection to the Proposition. 

Therefore, <s> = "Every time we sacrifice virgins, it rains. Therefore, sacrificing virgins causes it to rain." is classified as <WCB>.
