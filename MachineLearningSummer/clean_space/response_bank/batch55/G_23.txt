For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying defective arguments) to identify the type of defective argument in the given statement, we need to follow a structured approach. Here’s the step-by-step decomposition (D) and analysis:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D)

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Find the main assertion the argument is trying to establish.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine the causal basis provided to support the proposition.

3. **Analyze the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Look for any additional arguments or evidence given to corroborate the Reason.

4. **Classify the Argument Type:**
   - Assess whether the argument fits into one of the defective argument categories (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) based on the definitions provided.

### Applying IDAA to the Given Statement

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - **Main Assertion:** "You should never gamble!"

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - **Causal Basis:** "Once you start gambling you find it hard to stop. Soon you will spend all your money on gambling, and eventually you will turn to crime just to support your gambling addiction."

3. **Analyze the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - The statement does not provide any further evidence or additional arguments beyond the causal basis provided in <R>.

4. **Classify the Argument Type:**
   - Review the nature of the argument:
     - The statement asserts a series of consequences that supposedly follow from gambling (difficulty stopping, spending all money, turning to crime).
     - These consequences are extreme and do not apply universally to all individuals who gamble.
    
   - **Defective Argument Type:**
     - **Generalization (<G>):** The argument makes a sweeping assertion that applies to all individuals based on a perceived tendency or a subset of individuals. It generalizes the negative outcomes of gambling to everyone without sufficient proof that this applies universally.

#### Conclusion
The argument provided fits the type of Defective Argument known as **Generalization (<G>)**, because it takes specific or extreme outcomes associated with gambling and applies them universally without enough justification that these outcomes will occur for everyone.

Thus, "You should never gamble! Once you start gambling you find it hard to stop. Soon you will spend all your money on gambling, and eventually you will turn to crime just to support your gambling addiction.
¡Nunca debes apostar! Una vez que empiece a jugar, le resultará difícil dejar de jugar. Pronto gastará todo su dinero en juegos de azar y, finalmente, recurrirá a la delincuencia solo para apoyar su adicción al juego." is classified as <G> (Generalization).
