For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "There is no need for additional taxes for education. Every year we throw more money into education, and all they do is hire more management and build more buildings. None of the money actually reaches the classroom or is really used for education," we need to break down the process of classifying it into its defective argument type step-by-step:

1. **Identify Proposition (<P>)**: The proposition is the statement that sets forth what is intended to be proved.
   - **Proposition**: "There is no need for additional taxes for education."

2. **Identify Reason (<R>)**: The reason is the causal basis given for the proposition.
   - **Reason**: "Every year we throw more money into education, and all they do is hire more management and build more buildings."

3. **Identify Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: The proof of reason corroborates the reason by means of additional arguments.
   - **Proof of Reason**: "None of the money actually reaches the classroom or is really used for education."

4. **Evaluate for Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: Does the argument assert something based on a part or a majority as applicable to all?
     - Yes, the argument generalizes the entire education system's use of funds without specific evidence for every situation.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Does the argument claim to enumerate possibilities completely but leave out pertinent ones?
     - The argument does not explicitly claim to list all possibilities, but it implicitly suggests a complete enumeration of uses of funds.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
     - The reason is not entirely conclusive; it assumes that all allocated money fails to reach the classroom without addressing potential complexities.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Is the causal basis weak or not compelling?
     - The causal basis might be seen as weak because it does not provide detailed evidence or statistical data to support the broad claim.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Does the reason simply repeat the proposition without adding new information?
     - The reason "Every year we throw more money into education, and all they do is hire more management and build more buildings" is different from the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Is something assumed as certain because it is "universally agreed upon" while still in dispute?
     - The argument does not rely on an assumed consensus.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Can the proof of reason be taken in another sense than the speaker intended?
     - The term "used for education" is somewhat ambiguous, but not significantly so.

5. **Classification**:
   - The argument appears to primarily suffer from **Generalization (G)**, as it makes a sweeping claim about all educational spending being ineffective based on limited observations.
   - There is an element of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, as the causal reason provided is weak without robust evidence.

Therefore, based on the evaluation, the argument "There is no need for additional taxes for education. Every year we throw more money into education, and all they do is hire more management and build more buildings. None of the money actually reaches the classroom or is really used for education" can be classified under:
   - **Generalization (G)**
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
