For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "God exists because the Bible says so. The Bible is a reliable source because it is the word of God.", we need to decompose the task of classifying the defective argument into specific steps and then apply these steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (Applying <D> to <IDA>)

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**
    - Determine the main assertion or claim that is intended to be proven.
    
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**
    - Identify the causal basis given to establish the truth of the Proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**
    - Look for additional arguments that corroborate the Reason.

4. **Evaluate for Defective Argument Types**
    - Check for each of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>):
        - **<G> (Generalization)**
        - **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**
        - **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**
        - **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**
        - **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**
        - **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**
        - **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**

### Application of Steps to the String

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- **Proposition (<P>):** "God exists."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- **Reason (<R>):** "Because the Bible says so."

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** "The Bible is a reliable source because it is the word of God."

#### Step 4: Evaluate for Defective Argument Types

- **Check for <IR> (Inconclusive Reason):**
  - The reason "Because the Bible says so" does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition "God exists." It assumes the reliability of the Bible without providing an external validation context.

- **Check for <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):**
  - The statement "The Bible is a reliable source because it is the word of God" essentially repeats the initial proposition that relies on assuming the Bible's authority without independent proof, making it a circular argument.

### Mitigating Confounding Analysis
- By closely analyzing, we see that the argument primarily falls under the category of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)** because the Reason provided is not independent and relies on the initial assertion within the Proposition.

### Conclusion

After applying each step of <IDAA> to the provided string, the proper classification of the defective argument is:

- **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**
