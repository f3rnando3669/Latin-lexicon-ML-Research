For 
To apply the decomposition of <IDA> into specific steps (<IDAA>) for classifying the given string "People who eat yogurt have healthy guts. If I eat yogurt I will never get sick." as one of the defective argument types, we can break down the task step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Components
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - "People who eat yogurt have healthy guts."
   
2. **Identify the Proposition of the Conclusion (<PC>):**
   - "If I eat yogurt I will never get sick."

### Step 2: Determine the Reason (<R>)
   - The implied reason is: "Because yogurt contributes to healthy guts, it prevents sickness."

### Step 3: Validate the Reason (<R>)
1. **Check for Generalization (<G>):**
   - Here, the proposition that "People who eat yogurt have healthy guts" may not apply universally to all people.
   - **Yes, this is a potential generalization.**

2. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The string does not enumerate all possible reasons or factors for having a healthy gut.
   - **Not directly applicable.**

3. **Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The reason provided does not conclusively prove that eating yogurt will prevent sickness entirely.
   - **Yes, this is an inconclusive reason, as having a healthy gut doesnâ€™t guarantee immunity to sickness.**

4. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The causal link between eating yogurt and never getting sick is weak.
   - **Yes, this argues weakly that yogurt consumption alone prevents all sickness.**

5. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - The reason here does not merely repeat the proposition.
   - **Not applicable.**

6. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - The argument does not claim universal agreement.
   - **Not applicable.**

7. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - The argument does not feature clear ambiguous terms.
   - **Not applicable.**

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
Based on the identified defective components, this string shows characteristics of:
- **Generalization (G)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

### Step 5: Select the Dominant Defective Argument Type
Given the argument's primary flaw is the insufficient and weak causal basis for the conclusion that eating yogurt will prevent all sickness, the most dominant type is:
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

### Conclusion
By following the IDAA steps, the given string "People who eat yogurt have healthy guts. If I eat yogurt I will never get sick." has been classified as predominantly being of the defective argument type **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
