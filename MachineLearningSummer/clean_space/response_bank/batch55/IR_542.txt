For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given statement, we will decompose the task (<IDA>) into specific steps (<D>) and then perform those steps sequentially. Here is the process:

### Decomposition (<D>)
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** What is the main assertion being made?
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** What is the causal basis for the proposition?
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):** What additional arguments are used to corroborate the reason?
4. **Classify the Defective Argument:** Determine if the string fits any of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Application of <D> to <IDA>:
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The proposition in the statement is: "He is guilty of that crime."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason given is: "He's a terrible person."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - The proof provided is: "In fact, several years ago he was convicted of that same kind of crime."

4. **Classify the Defective Argument:**
   - Let's analyze whether any defective argument types apply:
     - **Generalization (<G>):** This does not seem to be a case of generalization.
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This does not seem to be a case of incomplete enumeration.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason "He's a terrible person" does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition "He is guilty of that crime." Being a terrible person does not logically establish guilt for a specific crime.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal basis ("He's a terrible person") for the proposition is weak because it does not directly relate to the specific crime in question.
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This is not a case of repeating the proposition as the reason.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This is not a case of assuming consensus.
     - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** There does not seem to be any ambiguous language that can be taken in another sense.

Thus, the statement fits the defective argument types **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.

### Conclusion:
The statement "I don't see how you can believe he is not guilty of that crime. He's a terrible person and I can prove it. In fact, several years ago he was convicted of that same kind of crime." contains defective argument types. Specifically, it suffers from an **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** because being a terrible person does not conclusively demonstrate guilt, and it also suffers from **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** because the reason provided does not compellingly establish the proposition's truth.
