For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposition of IDA into specific steps) to the statement "A parent who says that the teacher doesn't know how to teach because she graduated from a community college," we need to break down IDA (the task of classifying the string) into specific steps. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
The proposition <P> is the assertion we intend to prove in the argument.

- **Proposition <P>:** "The teacher doesn't know how to teach."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
The reason <R> is the causal basis for the proposition.

- **Reason <R>:** "She graduated from a community college."

### Step 3: Examine the Correlation of <P> and <R>
Analyze whether the reason <R> sufficiently supports the proposition <P>.

- **Examination:** Does the fact that the teacher graduated from a community college provide sufficient basis to claim that she doesn't know how to teach?

### Step 4: Check for Defective Argument Types
Based on the definitions of defective argument types, identify which (if any) is present in the argument.

1. **Generalization <G>:** Is <P> an assertion based on a majority or some part and applied to all?
   - No. The argument focuses on a specific teacher, not a generalization about all teachers.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>:** Is <P> claimed complete but missing pertinent possibilities?
   - No. The argument doesn’t enumerate possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason <IR>:** Does <R> fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of <P>?
   - Yes. Graduation from a community college does not conclusively demonstrate teaching inability.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>:** Is <R> a weak causal basis for <P>?
   - Yes. Graduating from a community college is not a compelling reason to establish poor teaching ability.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>:** Does <R> simply repeat the <P>?
   - No. The reason provided is distinct from the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>:** Is <PR> assumed certain based on presumed universal agreement?
   - No. This argument does not rely on presumed consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>:** Is <PR> taken in a different sense than intended?
   - No apparent ambiguity in the language.

### Step 5: Classify the Defective Argument
Based on the examination above, classify the argument string.

- **Classification:** The statement can be classified as an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The reason provided (graduation from a community college) does not conclusively support the proposition (teacher's inability to teach) and is not a compelling causal basis for such a claim.

### Conclusion
By decomposing the task of classifying the argument into individual steps and carefully examining each element of the argument against the defined defective argument types, we classify the argument: "A parent who says that the teacher doesn't know how to teach because she graduated from a community college," as displaying Inconclusive Reason (IR) and Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).
