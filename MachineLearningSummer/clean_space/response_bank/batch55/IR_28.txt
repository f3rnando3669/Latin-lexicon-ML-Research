For 
To apply IDAA to the given argument (the advertisement), we need to decompose the task of identifying the type of defective argument step by step.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (*D*) of Argument Classification (*IDA*):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Determine what is being asserted or claimed.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Determine what reason is given to support the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Determine if there is additional argumentation to corroborate the reason.
4. **Analyze Defective Argument Types:** Examine if the argument contains any of the specified defective types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Application (IDAA) to the Given Argument:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition in the advertisement is: "People should give to St. Jude Research Center."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason provided is: "You wouldn't want to let these children die, right?"

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
In this case, the proof of reason would be: The assumption that acting otherwise would result in children's death is implicitly accepted.

#### Step 4: Analyze Defective Argument Types

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - Is the argument using a general case to assert a point applicable to all? 
   - No, it is making a direct appeal.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Does it claim to have considered all possibilities and missed some?
   - No, this is not the structure being used.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Does the reason conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
   - The argument suggests a severe outcome (children dying) without establishing a direct causal link between the donation and the prevention of death.
   - This might indicate an inconclusive reason.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Is the given reason not compelling enough as a causal basis?
   - The emotional appeal of not wanting children to die serves as a causal basis but without substantial backing on how the donation directly affects that outcome.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - Is the reason just a repetition of the proposition?
   - No, the reason gives an additional emotional appeal.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - Is the argument assuming something is true because it is "universally agreed upon"?
   - No, this is not the structure used here.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - Could the reason be interpreted in a different way than intended?
   - The language is quite straightforward and direct; hence, not ambiguous.

Based on the decomposition and analysis:
- The primary defect here seems to be **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the reason ("You wouldn't want to let these children die, right?") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition that donating to St. Jude will necessarily prevent the children's death. It appeals more to emotion than providing empirical evidence.

### Conclusion:
The defective argument type of the given advertisement is **"Inconclusive Reason (IR)"**.
