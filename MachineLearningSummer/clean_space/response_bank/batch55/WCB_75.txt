For 
To apply the decomposition of the task (<IDAA>) to classify the argument "Water fluoridation affects the brain. Citywide, student’s test scores began to drop five months after fluoridation began," we'll break it down step by step into specific steps:

### Step 1: Identify Proposition <P>
- **Proposition (P)**: "Water fluoridation affects the brain."

### Step 2: Identify Reason <R>
- **Reason (R)**: "Citywide, student’s test scores began to drop five months after fluoridation began."

### Step 3: Analyze Proof of Reason <PR>
- In this case, there is no explicit further argument presented as proof for the reason <R>.

### Step 4: Identify the type of each part and detect defects
- **Identify defects in Proposition (P)**
  - **P**: "Water fluoridation affects the brain."
    - It seems like a general statement, but not all instances of water fluoridation may have been assessed.
    - It could be scrutinized as a **Generalization (G)** if it lacks comprehensive evidence.
    
- **Identify defects in Reason (R)**
  - **R**: "Citywide, student’s test scores began to drop five months after fluoridation began."
    - This reason suggests causality due to correlation. Temporality (sequence in time) doesn't establish causation conclusively.
    - It might be **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because it doesn't provide a clear causal link between fluoridation and test scores dropping.
    - It could also be considered **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** as the reason given (drop in test scores) doesn't strongly support the proposition (affects the brain) compellingly.
  
- **Identify defects in absence of Proof of Reason (PR)**
  - Lack of further supporting arguments (no additional proof provided).
  - Nothing classified under **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** or **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**.

### Step 5: Final Classification
- The argument chiefly suffers from **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because the reason provided does not compellingly support the proposition.
- There is also a likely **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** since the relationship between fluoridation and the drop in test scores is stated without a clear causal mechanism being demonstrated.

Thus, applying the decomposition approach, the argument "Water fluoridation affects the brain. Citywide, student’s test scores began to drop five months after fluoridation began." can be classified primarily as **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** and potentially **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
