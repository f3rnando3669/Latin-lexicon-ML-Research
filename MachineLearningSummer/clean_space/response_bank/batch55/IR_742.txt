Sure, applying IDAA (the decomposition task applied to the classification task) involves breaking down the process of classifying the given string step by step. Here's how you can proceed:

### Step 1: Break Down the Statement
Analyze and break down the statement into its components to understand the context and arguments.

1. "I'd also like you to consider the possibility that these people intend to attack both Mandela and myself."
2. "That doesn't mean I'm excluding the possibility that it really is Mandela these lunatics are after."
3. "I just want you to think critically about what you are doing."
4. "Pieter van Heerden was murdered."
5. "That means there are eyes and ears everywhere."
6. "Experience has taught me that red herrings are an important part of intelligence work."
7. "Do you follow me?"

### Step 2: Identify Propositions <P>
Find the explicit propositions within the statement.

1. "these people intend to attack both Mandela and myself."
2. "it really is Mandela these lunatics are after."
3. "Pieter van Heerden was murdered."
4. "there are eyes and ears everywhere."
5. "red herrings are an important part of intelligence work."

### Step 3: Identify Reasons <R>
Identify the reasons or causal bases provided for the propositions.

1. Reason for proposition 1 or 2 might be the implication of the murder of Pieter van Heerden and surveillance ("there are eyes and ears everywhere").
 
### Step 4: Identify Proofs of Reasons <PR>
Identify if any proofs are provided to substantiate the reasons.

1. Proof for the reason "there are eyes and ears everywhere" appears to be the "murder of Pieter van Heerden."

### Step 5: Classify the Defective Arguments
Classify each component using the defined defective argument types:

1. Generalization <G>: Not detected in the string. The arguments don't appear to apply to all from a specific part or majority.
2. Incomplete Enumeration <FE>: Not detected. The statement does not attempt to list possibilities in a complete manner.
3. Inconclusive Reason <IR>: Detected.
    - "Pieter van Heerden was murdered. That means there are eyes and ears everywhere." â€“ The reason given (murder) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (surveillance).
4. Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>: Detected.
    - Same as above, the murder is a weak causal basis for the assertion of widespread surveillance.
5. Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>: Not detected. The reasons are not repetitions of the propositions.
6. Presumptuous Consensus <FU>: Not detected. The argument does not rely on presumed universal agreement.
7. Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>: Detected.
    - "Experience has taught me that red herrings are an important part of intelligence work." The term "red herrings" can be taken ambiguously as a generalization without specific context.

### Conclusion
- **Classify the String**: 
    - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: "Pieter van Heerden was murdered. That means there are eyes and ears everywhere." The reasoning does not conclusively connect the murder with pervasive surveillance.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The same statement can also be seen as weakly establishing causation.
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The term "red herrings" might be ambiguous.

Thus, according to the specific steps of <IDAA>, the string contains <IR>, <WCB>, and <DEP> as defective argument types.
