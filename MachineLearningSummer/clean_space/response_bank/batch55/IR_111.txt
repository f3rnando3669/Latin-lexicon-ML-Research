For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of IDA) to classify the argument "There is definitely a link between autism and the vaccines given to toddlers. I know this because a Wikipedia entry mentioned numerous studies that found this to be true," we need to follow the steps methodically.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\<P\>)
Proposition (\<P\>) in this argument:
- "There is definitely a link between autism and the vaccines given to toddlers."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\<R\>)
Reason (\<R\>) provided to support the proposition:
- "A Wikipedia entry mentioned numerous studies that found this to be true."

### Step 3: Classify the Defective Argument Type
Now, we need to systematically evaluate whether the argument falls into any of the defective argument types (\<G\>, \<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<RR\>, \<WCB\>, \<FU\>, or \<DEP\>).

#### Generalization (\<G\>)
- Is the proposition based on applying one part or majority to all?
  - Not applicable here, as the claim is about causation.

#### Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)
- Does the argument claim a complete enumeration but miss pertinent possibilities?
  - Not directly applicable here, since it doesn't enumerate all possible causes of autism.

#### Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)
- Does the reason conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
  - The reason cites a general reference (Wikipedia) and "numerous studies" without specifics to establish the link; it's weak and inconclusive.

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)
- Is the causal basis strong and compelling?
  - The reason presented a citation to Wikipedia, which is not a strong or sufficient causal basis for a medical claim.

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)
- Does the reason merely restate the proposition?
  - No, the reason does not repeat the proposition; it refers to a source.

#### Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)
- Is the proof assumed as certain because it is "universally agreed upon" while still in dispute?
  - Not directly applicable, although claiming numerous studies implies consensus, the Wikipedia citation makes it more about the credibility of sourcing rather than presumed consensus.

#### Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)
- Can the argument be taken in another sense than intended?
  - Language isn’t the primary issue; the problem lies more in the source’s credibility and sufficiency.

### Conclusion
- The argument "There is definitely a link between autism and the vaccines given to toddlers. I know this because a Wikipedia entry mentioned numerous studies that found this to be true" fits best into the Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>) category. The stated reason explains the cause (citing Wikipedia) but is not strong or compelling enough to substantiate the proposition.

### Result
- "There is definitely a link between autism and the vaccines given to toddlers. I know this because a Wikipedia entry mentioned numerous studies that found this to be true" is of type \<WCB\>.
