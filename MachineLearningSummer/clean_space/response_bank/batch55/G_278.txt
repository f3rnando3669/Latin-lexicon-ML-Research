For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposing a task into specific steps) to IDA (the task of classifying a string as a defective argument type) for the string "I had a bad teacher once; therefore, all teachers must be bad," let's break it down:

### Step 1: Understand the Defective Argument Types
- **<G> Generalization:** An assertion based on an insufficient sample size is applied to a larger group.
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:** An incomplete list of possibilities misses pertinent ones.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** The reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** The reason provided is not compelling enough.
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** The reason merely restates the proposition.
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** Assumes universal agreement on a disputed matter.
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:** The proof can be interpreted in a different sense than intended.

### Step 2: Analyze the Proposition and Reason
- **Proposition (P):** "All teachers must be bad."
- **Reason (R):** "I had a bad teacher once."

### Step 3: Identify the Defective Argument Type
- **Proposition Analysis:** The proposition claims that "all teachers must be bad."
- **Reason Analysis:** The reason given is based on a single experience ("I had a bad teacher once").

### Step 4: Match the Analysis with Definitions
Given the definitions, the string appears to be making a broad assertion about all teachers based on a single instance. This corresponds to:

- **<G> Generalization**: The assertion "all teachers must be bad" is based on a single experience with one bad teacher. This is a classic case of overgeneralizing from an insufficient sample size.

### Step 5: Classify the String
The string "I had a bad teacher once; therefore, all teachers must be bad," is best classified as:

**<G> Generalization**

### Conclusion
By decomposing the task of classifying the defective argument into specific analytical steps, we conclude that the string is an example of a **Generalization (G)**.
