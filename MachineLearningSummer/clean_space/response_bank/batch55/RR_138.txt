For 
To decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps, we can follow the below structure:

1. **Identify the Propositions (P) within the argument.**
2. **Identify the Reasons (R) presented in support of each Proposition.**
3. **Identify the Proofs of Reasons (PR) if any.**
4. **Classify each identified (P), (R), or (PR) according to defective argument types: (G), (FE), (IR), (RR), (WCB), (FU), or (DEP).**

Now, apply these steps to the given conversation:

### Step 1: Identify Propositions (P)
1. **Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified.**
   - Proposition (P1): Jesus was not really crucified.
2. **Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.**
   - Proposition (P2): The Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.
3. **Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran.**
   - Proposition (P3): God tells us so, here in the Koran.

### Step 2: Identify Reasons (R)
1. **Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so.**
   - Reason (R1 for P1): The Quran says Jesus was not really crucified.
2. **Speaker 1: Because the Koran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.**
   - Reason (R2 for P2): The Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.
3. **Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran.**
   - Reason (R3 for P2): God tells us so in the Quran (This can be seen as supporting R2).

### Step 3: Identify Proofs of Reason (PR)
1. **Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran.**
   - Proof of Reason (PR3 for R3): God telling us in the Quran

### Step 4: Classify Arguments
1. **Proposition (P3): God tells us so, here in the Koran.**
   - This statement can be seen as 
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Both R3 and PR3 depend on each other in a circular manner.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: R3 does not provide additional evidence outside of what needs to be proven.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This assumes that if the Quran says so, it must be true because it is God's word, which is essentially contested.

2. **Reason (R1 for P1): The Quran says Jesus was not really crucified.**
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: R1 is only conclusive if one assumes the Quran's infallibility, which is not a given since it is precisely the point under dispute.

3. **Reason (R2 for P2): The Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.**
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: R2 doesnâ€™t have an independent basis outside of the assertion itself.

### Final Classification:
- The conversation predominantly illustrates **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, and **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** due to its circular nature and lack of external evidence to substantiate the claims independently of the initial proposition.

Therefore, the defective argument types identified in this argument are primarily (RR), (IR), and (FU).
