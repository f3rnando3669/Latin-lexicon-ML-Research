For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to the given string, we first need to decompose the task \( \text{IDA} \) of classifying the argument types into specific steps. Here’s a structured methodology for \( \text{D} \) (the decomposition of \( t \) into specific steps):

### \( \text{D} \) - Steps for Performing \( \text{IDA} \)
1. **Identify the Proposition (\( P \))**: Determine the central claim or assertion being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (\( R \))**: Find the causal basis or justification provided for the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\( PR \))**: Look for additional arguments that corroborate the reason.
4. **Examine each component (P, R, PR) for defects**: Using the definitions provided, check for the following:
   - Generalization (\( G \))
   - Incomplete Enumeration (\( FE \))
   - Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \))
   - Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \))
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( RR \))
   - Presumptuous Consensus (\( FU \))
   - Ambiguous Language Use (\( DEP \))

### Applying \( \text{IDAA} \) Step-by-Step:

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( P \))**: 
   In the given string, Person 1's statement is:
   \[
   \text{P: "I am for raising the minimum wage in our state."}
   \]

2. **Identify the Reason (\( R \))**:
   Person 2 does not explicitly provide a reason related to the proposition \( P \). Instead, Person 2 provides a personal attack:
   \[
   \text{R: "She is not smart enough to even run a business."}
   \]

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\( PR \))**:
   There is no additional proof provided for the reason given by Person 2. The statement by Person 2 does not support the proposition \( P \) with any meaningful proof.

4. **Examine each component (P, R, PR) for defects**:
   - Generalization (\( G \)): Not applicable as there is no generalization made.
   - Incomplete Enumeration (\( FE \)): Not applicable as there are no enumerative claims.
   - Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \)): The reason provided does not even attempt to address or support the proposition. It is an ad hominem attack and inappropriate as a reason.
   - Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \)): The reason \( R \) does not provide a causal basis for the proposition \( P \), thus fitting this category.
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( RR \)): Not applicable as the reason given is not a repetition of the proposition.
   - Presumptuous Consensus (\( FU \)): Not applicable here.
   - Ambiguous Language Use (\( DEP \)): Not applicable here.

By examining Person 2's response, it mainly fails to provide a relevant argument. Specifically, the defect lies in the fact that Person 2's reason does not address the proposition about raising the minimum wage but rather attacks the individual’s capability in an irrelevant domain.

Therefore, we classify the argument defect type as:
\[
\text{WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)}
\]

However, the personal attack shows elements of another type of defective argument often outside the provided list: **Ad Hominem**. This is where the reasoning attacks the person instead of the argument. While "Ad Hominem" is not listed in your specified defects, it may additionally be informative to consider.
