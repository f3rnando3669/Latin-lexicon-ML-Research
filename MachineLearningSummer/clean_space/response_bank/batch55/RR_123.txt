To apply IDAA to the task of classifying the statement "Harold’s new book is well-written because Harold is a wonderful writer." according to the defective argument types defined, we will decompose the task into specific steps and analyze each component.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Analysis:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>).
The proposition is the main assertion or statement that is being argued.

\[ P: \text{Harold’s new book is well-written.} \]

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>).
The reason provides the causal basis for the proposition.

\[ R: \text{Harold is a wonderful writer.} \]

#### Step 3: Evaluate the causal relationship between <R> and <P>.
The causal relationship should establish the truth of the proposition.

- Here, the reason presented is that Harold is a wonderful writer, which is used to claim that his new book is well-written.
- To determine the strength of this causal relationship, consider whether being a wonderful writer necessarily guarantees that a specific book will be well-written or if other factors might be at play.

#### Step 4: Check for specific defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: 
   - Does the proposition make a broad assertion based on limited evidence? 
   - Not applicable here, as the assertion is about a specific book, not a generalization based on a subset of data.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - Does the proposition claim completeness without covering all possibilities?
   - Not applicable here, as this argument does not enumerate possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
   - Applicable. While Harold's reputation as a wonderful writer suggests a likelihood that his book might be well-written, it doesn't conclusively prove it because other factors could influence the quality of a specific book. 

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - Is the reason presented a weak causal basis for the proposition?
   - Applicable. The reason (Harold being a wonderful writer) is not a compelling basis to definitively establish that this particular book is well-written, as other aspects like editing, the book's content, and context could affect it.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - Does the reason merely restate the proposition without providing additional support?
   - Applicable. The reason (Harold is a wonderful writer) is a restatement of the implied quality (well-written) and does not provide distinct evidence separate from the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - Does the proof assume consensus rather than provide actual proof?
   - Not applicable here, as no universal agreement is being assumed.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
   - Could the proof be taken in another way than intended?
   - Not directly applicable, as the language used here is clear in intention.

#### Step 5: Classify the defective argument type (IDA).

Given the analysis, we find the statement falls into multiple defective argument types:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**

### Conclusion:

The statement "Harold’s new book is well-written because Harold is a wonderful writer." is classified as having the following defective argument types:
- **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**
- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**
- **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**
