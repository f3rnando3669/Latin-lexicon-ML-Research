For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of decomposition to the task of identifying the argument type) to the given statement, we take it step by step:

### Step 1: Understanding the Proposition (<P>)
Identify the <P> in the argument.  
In this case, the <P> is: 
- "You should eat more green leafy vegetables."

### Step 2: Understanding the Reason (<R>)
Identify the <R> given to support the <P>.  
In this case, the <R> is: 
- "because Ms. Lord says so, and she is an expert on grammar and vocabulary."

### Step 3: Categorizing the Argument Type
Determine if the argument falls under any of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>) based on the definitions.

#### Analysis:
- **Generalization (<G>)**: This is not applicable since the argument is not generalizing from a part to the whole.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This is not applicable since the argument is not attempting to enumerate possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: While the reason given (<R>) is indeed provided, it does not directly support the <P> in a suitable manner. The expertise of Ms. Lord in grammar and vocabulary has no logical connection with the truth of the <P> (the need to eat more green leafy vegetables). Therefore, the reason is inconclusive in demonstrating the correctness of the proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This is not applicable since the reason provided does not merely restate the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This seems relevant; the causal basis (Ms. Lord's assertion based on her expertise in an unrelated field) is not compelling for the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This is not applicable as the argument does not mention any presumed universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: This is not applicable since the language is not ambiguous.

### Step 4: Delineating the Defective Argument Type
Based on the analysis:
- The main defect in the argument is twofold: it is an **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** because the reason provided doesn't properly connect to the proposition, and it is also **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** since the expertise cited is in an unrelated field.

### Conclusion:
The argument is classified under both <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis). However, the primary classification would generally fall under **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason) in most formal settings, as the reason fails to support the proposition logically.

Thus, the application of <IDAA> to "You should eat more green leafy vegetables, because Ms. Lord says so, and she is an expert on grammar and vocabulary" results in the identification of the defective argument type as **<IR>**.
