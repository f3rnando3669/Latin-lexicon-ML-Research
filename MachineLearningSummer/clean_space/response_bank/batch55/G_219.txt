For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task IDA) to the given statement "All tall people are good basketball players," we'll follow a step-by-step process for classification. Let’s decompose the task:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P> in the given string
The proposition <P> in the string "All tall people are good basketball players" is:
- All tall people are good basketball players.

### Step 2: Evaluate the type of Proposition <P>
We need to check against the definitions of defective arguments to determine which one applies.

### Step 3: Check for Generalization <G>
Generalization is where a proposition is based on some part or a majority of individuals but not necessarily applicable to all.

- "All tall people are good basketball players" generalizes the attribute of being tall to being good at basketball, which is based on some subset of tall people rather than all.

### Step 4: Verify completeness and soundness of <R>
There is an implicit reasoning that being tall correlates to being good at basketball, but without further proof.

### Step 5: Check if the Proposition <P> fits other defect types
Let’s cross-check other defective argument types in case our initial classification is not accurate:
- **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>**: This would apply if the argument falsely claims that all possibilities are considered. Here, it's not about enumeration.
- **Inconclusive Reason <IR>**: There is no explicit reason stated; it’s an assertion.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>**: The causal basis (height to basketball skill) is implied but not explicitly weak.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>**: The reason isn’t repeated in the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>**: There is no appeal to universal consensus here.
- **Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>**: The terminology is not ambiguous.

### Step 6: Confirm the defect type
Based on the decomposition, the string "All tall people are good basketball players" fits the type <G> as it makes a broad generalization not necessarily applicable to every tall person.

### Conclusion
The statement "All tall people are good basketball players" is an example of the defective argument type <G> (Generalization).

Thus, the application of IDAA to the given string classifies it as type <G>.
