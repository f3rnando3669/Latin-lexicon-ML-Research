For 
To apply the task of **IDAA** to the given example "Employer: It says here on your resume that you are a hard worker, you pay attention to detail, and you don’t mind working long hours. Andy: Yes sir. Employer: I spoke to your previous employer. He says that you constantly change things that should not be changed, you could care less about other people’s privacy, and you had the lowest score in customer relations. Andy: Yes, that is all true, as well. Employer: Great then. Welcome to our social media team!" we will decompose the task of classifying the argument into the defective types. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the task.

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**  
The proposition in this dialogue is implicitly presented when the Employer finalizes the conversation:  
**P**: "Andy is suitable to join our social media team."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**  
The reason is given by the Employer during part of the conversation. It is:
**R**: "Andy is a hard worker, pays attention to detail, and doesn’t mind working long hours (as stated on the resume)."

However, there is also a contradictory reason presented:
**R'**: "Andy constantly changes things that should not be changed, could care less about people’s privacy, and had the lowest score in customer relations (as per the previous employer)."

**Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**  
There isn't a clearly stated additional argument that corroborates either <R> or <R'> as a Proof of Reason. Hence, we'll leave this part out as it's not explicitly given.

**Step 4: Identifying if the argument is defective and classifying it into one of the defective types**  
Examine the inconsistencies or faults in the reasoning.

**4.1: Checking for <IR> Inconclusive Reason**  
One could argue that the Reason <R> of being a hard worker, paying attention to detail, and not minding long hours does not conclusively support the Proposition <P> considering the contradictory Reason <R'>. This step would check if the <R> is not sufficiently establishing <P>. However, this could be also a misinterpretation given it's more about contradiction within the reasons and not conclusiveness.

**4.2: Checking for <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**  
The causal basis could be seen as insufficient due to the contradictory nature of the Reason <R'>. The positive points given do not compellingly counter the negative points to justify <P> definitively.

**4.3: Checking for other defectives**  
The other defective argument types typically relate to enumerations, generalizations, repetitions, presumptions, and ambiguous language which do not directly apply here.

**Conclusion**  
Based on the analysis, the most fitting defective argument type in this particular situation appears to be **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**, because the Employer’s conclusion looks insufficient given the contradictory reasons provided, thus failing to compellingly support hiring Andy for the social media team.

The argument could thus be seen as having an **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
