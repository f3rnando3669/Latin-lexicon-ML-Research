Sure, let's apply the task of decomposing <IDA> to classify the statement "Subscribe to our streaming services, or get stuck with cable!" into specific steps. 

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D> Applied to <IDA>) and Classification:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**
   - **Proposition (P):** "Subscribe to our streaming services."
   - **Implied Proposition if you don’t follow P:** "Get stuck with cable."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**
   - **Reason (R):** The implication here suggests that cable is undesirable and the only alternative.

3. **Proof of the Reason (<PR>)**
   - **Proof (PR):** The statement doesn't provide any proof. It is based on an implied binary choice which lacks support.

4. **Evaluate the Defective Argument Types against the Statement**
   - **Generalization (G):** Not applicable, as the statement isn’t generalizing based on partial data.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Applicable. The statement implies there are only two options: either their streaming service or cable television, missing other possibilities such as other streaming services, satellite TV, or no subscription at all.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Not directly applicable since there isn’t a reason provided as to why cable is bad or streaming is necessarily better.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Can be argued to apply here, as there’s a weak causal basis to claim that without subscribing to their service, one is stuck with cable.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Not applicable since it doesn't repeat the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Not applicable directly, the statement is not attempting to use a consensus as its proof.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Not applicable, the language used is quite clear in its directive.

5. **Finalize the Classification**
   - The statement "Subscribe to our streaming services, or get stuck with cable!" is best classified as **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**. It asserts a limited range of choices without considering all pertinent alternatives.

Therefore, the categorized defective argument type for the given string is **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**.
