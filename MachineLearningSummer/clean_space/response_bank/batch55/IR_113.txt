For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given statement "Student: Hey, Professor Moore, we shouldn't have to read this book by Freud. Everyone knows he used cocaine," we need to decompose the task of classifying the defective argument into specific steps. Let's break it down:

1. **Identify <P> (Proposition):**
   - What is the statement intending to prove?
   - Proposition: "We shouldn't have to read this book by Freud."

2. **Identify <R> (Reason):**
   - What is the causal basis for <P>?
   - Reason: "Everyone knows he used cocaine."

3. **Determine <PR> (Proof of Reason):**
   - Is there any presented evidence or corroboration for the reason?
   - In this statement, there is no direct proof provided. 

Now that we have broken down the argument into <P> and <R>, we can classify the type of defective argument. We will look at each possible type and determine if it fits:

4. **Examine for <G> (Generalization):**
   - Is the assertion based on a small part or majority but applied to all?
   - The statement does link Freud's use of cocaine to a broad dismissal of his entire body of work. Thus, it could represent a form of generalization.

5. **Examine for <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):**
   - Is the argument claiming a complete enumeration of possibilities but missing key elements?
   - The argument does not attempt to enumerate possibilities.

6. **Examine for <IR> (Inconclusive Reason):**
   - Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
   - The reason does not conclusively lead to the claim that the book should not be read; Freud's personal habits do not necessarily diminish the value of his work.

7. **Examine for <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):**
   - Is the causal basis for the proposition not compelling?
   - The causal connection (Freud's cocaine use as a reason not to read his book) is weak and not compelling.

8. **Examine for <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):**
   - Does the reason simply repeat the proposition in different terms?
   - The reason is not a mere repetition of the proposition.

9. **Examine for <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):**
   - Is the proof assumed certain on the basis of universal agreement?
   - The claim "Everyone knows he used cocaine" suggests a presumptuous consensus but does not provide substantial proof.

10. **Examine for <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):**
    - Can the proof be taken in another sense than intended?
    - The language used is not ambiguous in this sense.

On reviewing the classifications and the argument, the most fitting classification for this defective argument is:

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The statement assumes that the studentâ€™s opinion is correct because "everyone knows he used cocaine," implying a universal agreement without substantive evidence to support why that should affect reading the book.

Thus, the classification of the argument "Student: Hey, Professor Moore, we shouldn't have to read this book by Freud. Everyone knows he used cocaine." is <FU>.
