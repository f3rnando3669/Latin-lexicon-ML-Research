For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "People have believed that fish is 'brain food' for decades, so I don't believe the FDA when they claim that eating fish does not enhance the intellect," we need to decompose the task of classifying the defective argument into specific steps. These steps will help us identify which type of defective argument the given statement falls into. Here is the step-by-step decomposition and classification:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>)

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine what claim or proposition is being made in the statement.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine what reason is provided to support the proposition.

3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Determine whether there is any supporting evidence or proof provided for the reason.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument (<IDA>):**
   - Compare the identified elements with the definitions of defective arguments <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.
   - Match the statement to the most appropriate type.

### Application of Decomposition to the Statement (<IDAA>)

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition: "I don't believe the FDA when they claim that eating fish does not enhance the intellect."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason: "People have believed that fish is 'brain food' for decades."

3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Proof of Reason: The belief of people over decades is used as the proof here.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument (<IDA>):**
   - Analyze the type of reasoning and classify the argument:

    - **Generalization (<G>):** Not applicable here, as the proposition is not generalized based on a minority or majority.
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Not applicable here, as the statement doesn't claim a complete enumeration of possibilities.
    - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Not directly applicable as the reason provided is historical belief, not directly an argument's logical basis.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Not directly applicable, since the argument does not cite a casual reason that's weak but rather historical consensus.
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Not applicable, as the reason is not a repetition of the proposition.
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This is applicable. The statement assumes that the longstanding belief ("People have believed that fish is 'brain food' for decades") is sufficient proof ("so I don't believe the FDA") without addressing the scientific claim.
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Not applicable here as there is no ambiguous language that can be interpreted in more than one sense.

### Conclusion:
The given statement "People have believed that fish is 'brain food' for decades, so I don't believe the FDA when they claim that eating fish does not enhance the intellect." is best classified as **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**. The speaker relies on the assumption that a widely held belief over time constitutes conclusive evidence, despite it being a matter under scientific dispute.

--- 
Applying <IDAA> in this structured manner enables a clear identification and classification of the defective argument within the given statement.
