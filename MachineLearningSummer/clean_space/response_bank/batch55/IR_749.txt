Sure, applying the defined concepts step by step, we need to categorize the type of defective argument in the statement "Skipping looking for a second opinion or evidence and just asking one doctor is what fallacy?" 

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) and Application (IDAA):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   The proposition in this context can be summarized as: "Asking just one doctor and not seeking a second opinion or more evidence is a fallacy."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   The reason presented would be: "One doctor does not represent the entirety of possible medical opinions and evidence."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   The proof could potentially include arguments illustrating reliance on a broader spectrum of opinions, like:
   - Medical diagnosis can vary greatly among different doctors.
   - Evidence-based practice requires multiple sources for validation.

4. **Examine the Potential Defective Argument Types against the Structure:

   - **Generalization (G):** The proposition implies a broad application based on limited input. 
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This seems to be the fit because the argument skips over looking for further evidence by stopping at one opinion, presuming completeness without thorough consideration of all possibilities and data. 
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason might not conclusively support the broad implication.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis provided might not be strong enough.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Repeating the proposition as the reason doesn’t appear to be the issue here.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The statement does not cite a false consensus.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The meaning of the terms is clear and unambiguous.

5. **Determine the Best Fit:**
   The defective argument that seems to apply best is <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration). It categorizes the statement well because it implies that considering one doctor’s opinion as fully sufficient without further investigation or additional evidence overlooks other necessary possibilities in a complete evaluation.

### Conclusion:
Applying the task IDAA, the string "Skipping looking for a second opinion or evidence and just asking one doctor is what fallacy?" corresponds to the defective argument type <FE>, Incomplete Enumeration.
