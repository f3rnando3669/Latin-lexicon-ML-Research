For 
To apply the decomposition of the task (D) to identify the argument fallacy (IDA) in the given statement, we will follow these specific steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - Determine the main assertion or claim being made.
  
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - Identify the causal basis or justification supporting the claim.

3. **Check for defective arguments**:
   - Compare the argument to the list of defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

Let's break down the task step by step:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**
- In the given argument, the main assertion appears to be: "your opinion on movies is better."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)**
- The justification given for this assertion is: "because your friend picks their nose" and "we shouldn't trust them because that's gross."

**Step 3: Check for defective arguments**
- Given the identified P and R, let's see if this argument fits any defective argument types.

- **G (Generalization)**: 
  - No, the argument does not claim that something true for some parts is true for all.

- **FE (Incomplete Enumeration)**: 
  - No, the argument does not fail due to claiming completeness when it lacks it.

- **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**: 
  - Yes, <R> ("because your friend picks their nose, so we shouldn’t trust them because that’s gross") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of <P> ("your opinion on movies is better"). The fact that someone picks their nose has no logical bearing on their movie opinions.

- **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: 
  - No, the argument does not simply restate the proposition.

- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: 
  - Yes, <R> is weak because the causal basis, which is "nose picking behavior judging movie opinion," is not a compelling or relevant reason to support <P>.

- **FU (Presumptuous Consensus)**: 
  - No, the argument does not assume a consensus.

- **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use)**: 
  - No, the argument does not depend on ambiguous language.

**Conclusion:**
The argument contains multiple fallacies, mainly IR (Inconclusive Reason) and WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis). Both these fallacies highlight a mismatch between the reason provided and the claim being made.

To succinctly answer the question:
You committed the fallacy of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** in this argument.
