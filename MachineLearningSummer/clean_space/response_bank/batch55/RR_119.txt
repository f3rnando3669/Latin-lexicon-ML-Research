For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "I am athletic because I run, and I run because I'm athletic," we need to decompose the task <t> (classifying the string <s> as a type of defective argument) into specific steps. This follows the definition of <D> (decomposition). We'll perform this step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P> and the Reason <R> in the argument
The statement has two parts:
1. "I am athletic because I run."
2. "I run because I'm athletic."

For the first part:
- Proposition <P>: "I am athletic"
- Reason <R>: "I run"

For the second part:
- Proposition <P>: "I run"
- Reason <R>: "I'm athletic"

### Step 2: Evaluate the Corresponding Proof of Reason <PR>
The argument structure seems circular and self-reinforcing, which is critical in identifying the type of defective argument.

### Step 3: Determine the Defective Argument Type
Given the structure of the statements, let's examine the definitions of defective argument types to see which one matches:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Not applicable here because the statements do not generalize an assertion from a part to the whole.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not applicable as there is no claim of complete enumeration.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This could be considered if the reason provided does not conclusively support the proposition.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This applies if the causal basis for the proposition is not compelling.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: **This is precisely the type that matches**. The reason (<R>) appears to be presented for the proposition (<P>), but it essentially repeats what was already stated in the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Not applicable as there's no assumption of universal agreement presented.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Not applicable since there is no ambiguous language complicating the meaning.

### Step 4: Classify the String <s>
Based on the analysis and matching the types, the string "I am athletic because I run, and I run because I'm athletic" fits best into the category of:
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**

### Conclusion
By breaking down the task <IDA> into specific steps (decomposed task <D>), we can confidently classify the argument as a type of defective argument: **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**.
