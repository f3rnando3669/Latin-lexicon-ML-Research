For 
To apply the process of IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument) to the given sentence, we will follow methodical steps to determine the specific type of defective argument (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>). Here are the steps:

### Step 1: Recognize and Extract the Proposition (<P>)
- **Identify Proposition:** The proposition here is "if we allow same-sex couples to marry, then the next thing we know we'll be allowing people to marry their parents, their cars and even monkeys."
- **Proposition Summary:** Colin Closet asserts that permitting same-sex marriage will lead to absurd outcomes like allowing marriage to parents, cars, and monkeys.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>) and Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- **Reason:** The underlying reasoning appears to be that allowing same-sex marriages fundamentally changes the definition of marriage, opening the door to other extreme forms.
- **Proof of Reason:** No explicit additional arguments or evidence are provided in the given statement to corroborate the Reason.

### Step 3: Evaluate Reason for Defectiveness
- **Assess Reason:** The Reason does not demonstrate causally or logically why allowing same-sex marriage would lead to these outcomes.
- **Check for Defects:**
  - **Generalization (G):** Whether the Proposition applies a quality of some or majority to all.
  - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Whether a complete list of possibilities isn't actually complete.
  - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Whether the Reason conclusively demonstrates correctness.
  - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Whether the Reason provides a compelling causal basis.
  - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Whether the Reason simply repeats the Proposition.
  - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Whether the Proof of Reason assumes certainty based on universal agreement.
  - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Whether the Proof of Reason can be taken differently than intended.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type
- **Determine Type:**
  - **Generalization (G):** The argument doesn't generalize from some to all.
  - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable as no complete enumeration is given.
  - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The Reason does not conclusively demonstrate why these specific absurd outcomes will follow.
  - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The Reason provided lacks a compelling causal link. Allowing same-sex marriage does not logically lead to permitting marriages to non-human entities or objects. 
  - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The Reason is not simply a repetition of the Proposition.
  - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** No assumption of universal agreement is made.
  - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** There is no ambiguous language leading the statement to be taken in another sense.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the identified defective argument type is **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The Reason provided, which claims that allowing same-sex marriages will lead to absurd consequences without a compelling causal connection, is weak.
