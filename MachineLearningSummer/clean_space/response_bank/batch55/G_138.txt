For 
To apply \( IDAA \) to the statement "Women can't do as good a job as men," we need to decompose the task of classifying the statement into specific steps and follow through with each of these steps methodically.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (\( D \)):
1. **Identify the structure of the argument:** Determine if there is a Proposition (\( P \)), Reason (\( R \)), and Proof of Reason (\( PR \)).
2. **Evaluate the Proposition (\( P \)):** Examine whether \( P \) is a generalization, incomplete enumeration, or contains ambiguous language.
3. **Evaluate the Reason (\( R \)):** Check if \( R \) is weak due to inconclusive reasoning, faulty repetition, or insufficient causal basis.
4. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (\( PR \)):** Determine if \( PR \) is based on an incorrect assumption of consensus or uses ambiguous language.
5. **Classify the argument type:** Based on the evaluations, classify the argument as \( G \), \( FE \), \( IR \), \( RR \), \( WCB \), \( FU \), or \( DEP \).

### Applying the Decomposition to the Statement:
1. **Identify the Structure of the Argument:**

   The statement "Women can't do as good a job as men" is a Proposition (\( P \)). It sets forth a claim to prove, which is that women are inherently less capable than men in job performance. The statement does not provide an explicit Reason (\( R \)) or Proof of Reason (\( PR \)). Therefore, we focus solely on the Proposition.

2. **Evaluate the Proposition (\( P \)):**

   - **Generalization (\( G \))**: The statement is likely a generalization because it takes a trait attributed to some individuals (possibly based on an unstated or implicit observation) and applies it to all women.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (\( FE \))**: This does not seem to be the case, as \( P \) does not claim a complete listing of possibilities.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (\( DEP \))**: The language is clear in its assertion; it does not seem ambiguous.

3. **Evaluate the Reason (\( R \)):**

   No Reason (\( R \)) is explicitly stated, hence we cannot evaluate \( R \) for this argument.

4. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (\( PR \)):**

   No Proof of Reason (\( PR \)) is explicitly stated, hence we cannot evaluate \( PR \) for this argument.

5. **Classify the Argument Type:**

   Given the evaluation of \( P \), the statement "Women can't do as good a job as men" falls under the category of Generalization (\( G \)). It broadly and unfairly ascribes a characteristic (job performance capability) to all members of a group (women) based on insufficient evidence, as the statement does not offer any specific reasoning or proof.

### Classification:
The statement "Women can't do as good a job as men" is an argument of type \( G \) (Generalization).
