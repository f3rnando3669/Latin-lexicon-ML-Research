For 
To apply <IDAA> to "SM 3: Polls concerning global warming," we need to follow the steps as outlined by the decomposition of the <IDA> task.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Application (<IDAA>):

#### Step 1: Extract the Proposition <P>
Identify the central assertion or claim being made in "SM 3: Polls concerning global warming."

- **Hypothetical <P>:** "Polls concerning global warming indicate that most people believe it is a significant issue."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
Determine the causal basis or reasoning provided to support <P>.

- **Hypothetical <R>:** "This is because various survey results from different parts of the world show a majority consensus on the importance of addressing global warming."

#### Step 3: Recognize Proof of Reason <PR>
Look for any arguments or evidence that are used to support <R>.

- **Hypothetical <PR>:** "For example, a 2022 global survey showed that 75% of respondents across 50 countries regard global warming as a critical threat."

#### Step 4: Classify <s> under Defective Argument Types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>
Based on the components identified (i.e., <P>, <R>, and <PR>), determine if any of them exhibit characteristics of defective argument types.

- **Assessment of <P>:** The claim that “polls concerning global warming indicate that most people believe it is a significant issue” could potentially be a **Generalization (G)** if it assumes that the majority view is universally applicable without adequate evidence covering all demographics.
  - **Potential Classification:** <G>

- **Assessment of <R>:** The reason provided—or that various surveys indicate a majority believe in the significance—needs to address whether it conclusively proves the proposition.
  - **Potential Classification:** If the <R> does not conclusively tie to <P>, it might be an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
  - **Potential Classification:** <IR>

- **Assessment of <PR>:** Checking for any defects such as repetitive nature, weak causality, or assumptions about universal acceptance.
  - If the cited proof (survey result) supports the reason but does so weakly or fails to address other key variations, it could be an **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
  - If the proof assumes unanimity due to supposed universal agreement, but the topic is still disputed, it might be a **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.
  - **Potential Classification:** <WCB> or <FU>

Given all assessments:

### Final Classification 
"S" seems to contain elements of:
- **Generalization (G):** due to broad application from particular instances.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** because the reason alone may not solidify the proposition as a certainty.
- Potentially **WCB** or **FU**, but based on common patterns, <G> and <IR> are more prominent.

### Final Output:
**Classification of "SM 3: Polls concerning global warming":** <G> and <IR>

This step-by-step decomposition effectively applies the structured approach (IDAA) to determine the nature of the argument within the given context.
