To apply the task of <IDAA> (decomposition of classifying a defective argument) to the provided argument, we need to break down the classification task into specific steps and then analyze the string accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <t> into <D>:
1. **Identify the Proposition <P>**: Determine the main proposition (assertion) being made.
2. **Identify the Reason <R>**: Identify the causal basis provided for the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason <PR>**: Look for any additional arguments or proofs supporting the reason.
4. **Classify the Argument**: Using the definitions of defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>, classify the given argument.

Now, let's perform steps 1-4 for the given string.

### Analysis of the Given String:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
The main proposition appears to be: 
- "If you have never been born again, eternal separation from God in the Lake of Fire awaits you."
- "If you are born again, then being with the Lord in heaven forever is your destiny."

These are conditional statements presenting outcomes based on a specific condition (being born again or not).

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
The reasoning behind the proposition can be interpreted as:
- "Being born again determines your eternal destiny."

This causal connection links the condition (being born again or not) to the outcomes (eternal separation or being with the Lord).

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason <PR>
There are suggestions of consequences but no additional arguments or evidence directly supporting the causal basis (reason). The text implies the correctness of the conditional outcomes without further elaboration or evidence, which can be taken as an assumption.

#### Step 4: Classify the Argument
To classify the argument, we need to identify if it fits into any of the defective argument types:

- **<G>**: Generalization – The conditions are not generalizations based on specific instances; they are binary existential conditions.
- **<FE>**: Incomplete Enumeration – The argument addresses two specific cases (born again or not), but does not imply a complete enumeration of all possible conditions.
- **<IR>**: Inconclusive Reason – The reason provided is not conclusively demonstrating the correctness of the proposition; it's based on conditional logic without thorough evidence.
- **<RR>**: Faulty Repetition of Proposition – The argument does not contain repetitive elements where the reason repeats the proposition verbatim.
- **<WCB>**: Insufficient Causal Basis – The causal basis (being born again) is not conclusively tied to the proposed outcomes; it's presented as a belief system basis.
- **<FU>**: Presumptuous Consensus – The argument does not rely on a supposed universal agreement.
- **<DEP>**: Ambiguous Language Use – The language appears straightforward in its assertions and does not present ambiguity.

Considering the steps and the definitions, the argument most closely aligns with <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) or <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).

### Conclusion
The argument presented can be classified as:
- **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason): The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- Additionally, it may also be seen as **<WCB>** (Insufficient Causal Basis), as the causative link between being "born again" and the eternal outcomes (separation from God or being with the Lord) is not compellingly demonstrated and relies heavily on faith-based claims rather than logical reasoning.

Therefore, the argument presented in the string is most likely defective due to both inconclusive reason and insufficient causal basis.
