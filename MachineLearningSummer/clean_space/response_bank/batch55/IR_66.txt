For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition approach) to the classification task <IDA> for the given string "4 percent of Americans believe that lizard people control politics," we need to take the following steps step-by-step:

### Decomposition Steps <D> for <IDA>:
1. **Identify Components:** Break down the assertion into its Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), and Proof of Reason (<PR>) if applicable.
2. **Determine Type of Defective Argument:** Examine the components and match them with the definitions of defective argument types: <G> (Generalization), <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration), <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis), <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus), <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use).

### Apply Decomposition Steps:
#### Step 1: Identify Components
**Given string:** "4 percent of Americans believe that lizard people control politics."

- **Proposition (<P>):** The central assertion or proposition in this statement is: "Lizard people control politics."
- **Reason (<R>):** The supporting reason provided is: "4 percent of Americans believe."
- **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Not explicitly provided in the string.

#### Step 2: Determine Type of Defective Argument
Now that we have identified the components, we will examine these components to determine which type of defective argument this string represents:

- **Generalization (<G>):** The statement refers to the belief of a small percentage (4 percent) of Americans and generalizes this to imply a broader truth (“lizard people control politics”), despite this being the belief of only a small segment.
  
Based on this examination, the string "4 percent of Americans believe that lizard people control politics" primarily fits the defective argument category of **Generalization (<G>)**.

### Conclusion
Using <IDAA> to classify the string, we conclude that the string "4 percent of Americans believe that lizard people control politics" is best classified as a type <G> (Generalization) defective argument.
