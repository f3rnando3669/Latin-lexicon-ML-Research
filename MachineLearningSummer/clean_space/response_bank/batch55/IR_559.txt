Certainly! Let's apply <IDAA> to classify the string "The car was built with cheap parts, so it only goes to show that the car will fall apart." I'll break it down step by step to identify which type of defective argument, if any, the statement belongs to.

### Step 1: Identify Proposition (P) and Reason (R)

1. **Proposition (P)**: The conclusion or main claim we intend to prove.
   - **P**: The car will fall apart.

2. **Reason (R)**: The causal basis for the Proposition (P).
   - **R**: The car was built with cheap parts.

### Step 2: Identify Proof of Reason (PR)

- In this case, the Reason is asserted without additional back-up or corroborating arguments. Thus, there doesn’t seem to be an explicit **Proof of Reason (PR)** provided.

### Step 3: Evaluate the Reason (R) and Proposition (P) Relationship

- Now we need to determine if the given Reason (R) conclusively supports the Proposition (P). 

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type

Let’s evaluate the types of defective arguments based on the characteristics provided:

1. **Generalization (G)**: Not applicable here as there is no assertion based on some individuals applied to all.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable as there is no claim to have enumerated possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: 
   - The Reason (R) provided ("The car was built with cheap parts") does not conclusively demonstrate that the car will definitively fall apart. 
   - Cheap parts might suggest higher risk, but it does not establish certainty, giving room for doubt regarding the conclusive relationship.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - The Reason (R) may be weak or not compelling enough to justify the Proposition (P) absolutely. Cheap parts don’t always mean the car will fall apart; additional context is needed.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - Not applicable as the Reason (R) does not simply restate the Proposition (P).

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - Not applicable as there is no appeal to any supposed universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
   - Not applicable as there’s no evident ambiguity that changes the intended meaning of the statement.

Summarizing our analysis:

### Step 5: Conclusion

Based on the steps outlined, the argument "The car was built with cheap parts, so it only goes to show that the car will fall apart." predominantly fits into the category of:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, as the Reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the truth of the Proposition.
  
Additionally, there may also be a touch of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** since the causal basis is weak and not compelling enough.

### Final Classification

The argument is mostly of type **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason), with a possible secondary classification as **<WCB>** (Insufficient Causal Basis).

With this analysis, we conclude our application of <IDAA> to the given string.
