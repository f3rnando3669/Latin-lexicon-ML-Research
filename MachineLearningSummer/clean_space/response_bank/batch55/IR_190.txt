For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string, we need to decompose the task of classifying the string into specific steps. The given string appears to be an instance of some defective argument type. Here we'll break down <D> (decomposition of the task) into specific steps and classify the string accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>) for <IDAA>:

1. **Identify the main argument**: Extract the argument presented in the string.
2. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine what is intended to be proven or asserted in the argument.
3. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Identify the causal basis or reasoning provided for <P>.
4. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Look for any corroboration or additional arguments supporting <R>.
5. **Classify the Argument Type**: Compare the extracted elements to the definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP> to classify the defective argument type.

### Step 1: Identify the Main Argument
The main argument involves a confrontation where a friend tells a man who has cheated on his spouse that it is wrong. The man's response shifts the topic to a broader discussion of what is right versus wrong and who decides that.

### Step 2: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The friend asserts a proposition:
- **<P>**: Cheating on one's spouse is wrong.

### Step 3: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The man’s reason or response is:
- **<R>**: Right versus wrong and who decides (implying relativism or subjectivity in moral judgments).

### Step 4: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
The man's argument does not offer further corroborative arguments supporting his notion of relativism directly; instead, he deflects the issue.

### Step 5: Classify the Argument Type
Now, given the elements:

- **<P>**: Cheating on one's spouse is wrong.
- **<R>**: Discussion about the subjective nature of morality (right versus wrong and who decides).

We need to classify the defective argument type by comparing it to the defined types:

1. **<G> (Generalization)**: Not applicable as the proposition is not generalized from a part to a whole.
2. **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: Not applicable as there is no enumeration involved.
3. **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: Partially applicable but broad.
4. **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: Not applicable as <R> does not merely repeat <P>.
5. **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: Applicable, as the man's reason (discussion about moral relativity) does not compellingly address the specific proposition about cheating being wrong.
6. **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: Not applicable because no universal agreement is claimed.
7. **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: Partially applicable due to the ambiguity in the discussion of moral relativity.

Given the analysis, the man’s response most closely fits:

- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The discussion about moral relativity does not sufficiently address the specific proposition that cheating is wrong.

Thus, the string "A man who has cheated on his spouse is confronted by a friend who tells him that it is wrong. The man begins to talk about right versus wrong and who decides" can be classified as a <WCB> type defective argument. The man’s reason fails to compellingly establish a causal basis for challenging the proposition.
