For 
Certainly! Let's go step by step to apply IDAA to the given statement:

**Statement**: "Royal's promoting their team for the next season by telling people to come join the team because everyone else has."

**Task (IDA)**: Classify the statement as one of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

**Task (D)**: Decompose IDA into specific steps.

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Determine what claim is being made.
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Determine the causal basis or justification provided for the proposition.
   
3. **Identify the type of defective argument (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP)**:
   - Compare the identified <P> and <R> with the definitions of defective argument types to classify the statement.
   
**Applying D to IDA (IDAA)**:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - "Come join the team."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - "Because everyone else has."

3. **Identify the type of defective argument <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>**:
   - The argument is urging others to join because it claims "everyone else has." This implies that the reason for joining is based on the consensus of others.

Let's compare this with our defective argument types:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement is not making a generalization about a majority but is instead relying on the actions of others as a reason.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement isn't claiming completeness in listing possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided ("everyone else has") does provide some basis, but it appeals to the idea of consensus rather than a direct causal basis.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: While the basis is an appeal to consensus, this isn't usually what is meant by an "insufficient causal basis" since it's more about the strength rather than the type of reason.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The reason and the proposition are not saying the same thing.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The reason assumes consensus is a valid justification, which fits closely with this type of defective argument.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The language used is straightforward and not particularly ambiguous.

Based on this analysis, the argument seems to best fit the category of **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**, as it relies on the assumption that because "everyone else has" joined, this is a compelling reason.

**Conclusion**:
The statement "Royal's promoting their team for the next season by telling people to come join the team because everyone else has" is classified as <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus), based on our decomposition and analysis steps.
