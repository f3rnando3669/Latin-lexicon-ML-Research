For 
To apply the decomposition of the advanced task (IDAA) to the task of classifying the string (IDA), let's break down the process step by step:

1. **Understand the given task (IDA):** We are required to classify the string as one of the defective argument types provided: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

2. **Examine the string:** The string to be classified is: "Either we have the full football season or we scrap it altogether and have zero football."

3. **Identify the argument type:** Based on the definitions provided for the defective argument types, analyze which fallacy fits the given string.

4. **Mapping the string to the definitions:**
   - **Generalization (G):** Involves generalizing based on a part or majority but isn't attempting to generalize about a group.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This involves claiming a complete enumeration of possibilities but missing out important ones.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Reason doesn't conclusively demonstrate the correctness.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis for the argument is weak.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The Reason is merely a repetition of the Proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Assuming universal agreement or consensus.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Argument can be taken in a different sense than intended.

5. **Match the string to one of the defective argument types:**
   - The given string presents two options as if they are the only possible outcomes: either a full football season or scrapping it completely. This suggests that the speaker is presenting a false dichotomy by limiting the possibilities to only two extreme outcomes, neglecting other potential partial or modified solutions.

6. **Identify the specific defective argument type:**
   - By features of the definitions, "Incomplete Enumeration (FE)" fits because the argument presents an incomplete enumeration of possibilities, failing to consider any options other than the extreme positions presented.

7. **Conclusion:** Classify the string.
   - The string "Either we have the full football season or we scrap it altogether and have zero football" is an example of the defective argument type called Incomplete Enumeration (FE).

By following these steps, we have decomposed the task (D) of classifying the string into specific actions required to achieve the task (IDA), and we have determined that the given argument is an example of "Incomplete Enumeration (FE)."
