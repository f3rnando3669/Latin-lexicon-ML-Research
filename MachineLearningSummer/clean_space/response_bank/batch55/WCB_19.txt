For 
To apply IDAA to the string "I bought new shoes then my head started itching. I must be allergic to the shoes," we'll decompose the task IDA (classifying the string as one of the defective argument types) into specific steps. Here is the step-by-step decomposition and analysis:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D):
1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine the claim or assertion being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Find the causal basis or reasoning supporting the Proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**: Look for additional arguments or evidence that corroborate the Reason.
4. **Examine the Structure**: Analyze the logical flow between P, R, and PR.
5. **Match with Defective Argument Types**:
    - Check for Generalization (G).
    - Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE).
    - Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR).
    - Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).
    - Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR).
    - Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU).
    - Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).
6. **Classify the Argument**: Based on the analysis, classify the argument into one of the defective argument types.

### Analysis of the String:
**String**: "I bought new shoes then my head started itching. I must be allergic to the shoes."

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: 
   - Proposition (P): "I must be allergic to the shoes."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: 
   - Reason (R): "I bought new shoes then my head started itching."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   - There is no explicit PR provided in the string; the argument relies solely on the correlation presented in R.

4. **Examine the Structure**:
   - The structure presents a sequence of events: buying new shoes followed by head itching, which leads to the conclusion that the shoes are causing the allergy.

5. **Match with Defective Argument Types**:
    - **Generalization (G)**: Not applicable; no generalization from a single instance to a universal truth.
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable; enumeration of possibilities is not relevant in this context.
    - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Potentially applicable; the itching could have many causes other than the new shoes.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Applicable; the causal link between buying new shoes and head itching is weak and not compelling.
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Not applicable; the Reason is not just a repetition of the Proposition.
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Not applicable; the argument does not rely on assumed universal agreement.
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Not applicable; the language used is not ambiguous.

6. **Classify the Argument**:
   - The argument is best classified as an **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The Reason provided - that buying new shoes led to head itching - is a weak causal basis for concluding an allergy to the shoes. There are many other potential causes for the itching that are not considered, thus the argument lacks a compelling causal link.

### Classification:
The string "I bought new shoes then my head started itching. I must be allergic to the shoes." is classified as a defective argument of type **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
