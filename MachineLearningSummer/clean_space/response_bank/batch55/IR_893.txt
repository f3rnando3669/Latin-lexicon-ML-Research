For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument into specific steps) to the given statement "There must be objective rights and wrongs in the universe. If not, how can you possibly say that torturing babies for fun could ever be right?", we need to break down the classification task (IDA) into specific steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**
- The proposition (P) is the main statement or assertion being made. 

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)**
- The reason (R) provides the causal basis for the proposition, establishing why it should be considered true.

**Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**
- The proof of reason (PR) corroborates the reason through additional arguments or evidence.

**Step 4: Determine Which Defective Argument Type, if Any, Applies**
- Check if the identified components (P, R, PR) exhibit any of the defects: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU) or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

### Applying the Steps to the Given Statement

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**
- Proposition (P): "There must be objective rights and wrongs in the universe."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)**
- Reason (R): "If not, how can you possibly say that torturing babies for fun could ever be right?"

**Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**
- The statement does not explicitly provide an additional proof of reason (PR) beyond the reasoning provided.

**Step 4: Determine Which Defective Argument Type Applies**

- **Generalization (G)**: The statement does not involve generalizing from a sample to a whole.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement does not attempt to enumerate possibilities incorrectly. 
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason presented questions the moral relativism of torturing babies for fun, which may not conclusively demonstrate why there must be objective rights and wrongs in the universe.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The reason provided questions an extreme scenario without establishing why this implies the necessity of objective rights and wrongs universally.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason does not repeat the proposition verbatim.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The reason doesn't assume consensus; it challenges a point without claiming universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The reason's terms don't seem to have ambiguous meanings; the terms used are specific in context.

### Conclusion
The most fitting defective argument type for the given statement based on our decomposition is:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason given ("If not, how can you possibly say that torturing babies for fun could ever be right?") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition ("There must be objective rights and wrongs in the universe."). The argument relies on an emotional appeal rather than a logical foundation that conclusively proves the existence of objective morals.

Thus, the string "There must be objective rights and wrongs in the universe. If not, how can you possibly say that torturing babies for fun could ever be right?" is best classified as an instance of <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
