For 
To classify the argument "Don't listen to Mr. Fingers when he says walk in the hallways. How can you trust someone who wears bow ties?" within the given defective argument types, we'll apply <D>, the decomposition of the task into specific steps, and perform <IDAA> on the sentence. Let's break down the process step by step:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition <D> Applied to <IDA> for Argument Classification

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**
3. **Evaluate the Reason against the Proposition (P)**
4. **Identify if any corollary or Proof of Reason (PR) is provided**
5. **Determine if the argument fits any defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>**

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
In the given argument, the key proposition (P) seems to be:
- "Don't listen to Mr. Fingers when he says walk in the hallways."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The given reason (R) provided to support this proposition is:
- "How can you trust someone who wears bow ties?"

### Step 3: Evaluate the Reason against the Proposition (P)
Evaluating this Reason (R):
- The reason appears to focus on Mr. Fingers' choice of attire (wearing bow ties) and implies his advice is untrustworthy because of it.

### Step 4: Identify if any corollary or Proof of Reason (PR) is provided
- In this argument, no additional proof or corollary is provided to support the reason. The reason is given as an assertion without further backing.

### Step 5: Determine if the argument fits any defective argument types
Now, let's classify the argument against the defective argument types:

- **Generalization (G):** The argument does not appear to generalize from a sample to a whole.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument does not present an incomplete list of possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason given (Mr. Fingers' attire) does not logically conclude that his advice on walking in hallways is untrustworthy. It is an inconclusive reason as it does not demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis (bow ties affecting advice) is weak and not compelling.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason (R) does not merely repeat the proposition (P).
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument does not assume a thing to be true based on universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The argument does not hinge on ambiguous language.

After analyzing the argument, the most fitting classifications for the defective argument type are:
1. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the reason (R) given does not conclusively support the correctness of the proposition (P).
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** as the causal link between wearing bow ties and the trustworthiness of advice is weak and non-compelling.

Thus, the argument "Don't listen to Mr. Fingers when he says walk in the hallways. How can you trust someone who wears bow ties?" is best classified as type <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and also fits <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
