For 
To apply the process of IDAA (the application of the decomposition of the task IDA to classify a defective argument) to the statement "A year is 365 days long, so I celebrate my birthday every 365 days," we need to systematically break down the classification process step by step.

Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P) and the Reason (R)
- **Proposition (P):** "I celebrate my birthday every 365 days."
- **Reason (R):** "A year is 365 days long."

Step 2: Determine if P and R establish a strong argument
- The argument claims that, because a year is 365 days long, birthdays are celebrated every 365 days.

Step 3: Evaluate if P: "I celebrate my birthday every 365 days" is sufficiently supported by R: "A year is 365 days long."
- We need to consider exceptions and additional factors such as leap years, in which a year is 366 days long.

Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument
- Considering the provided definitions, determine if there's a defect in the reasoning chain connecting P and R.

Given the specific types of defective arguments (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP):

1. **Generalization (G):** This argument does not appear to generalize based on a non-universal subset.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The statement omits the possibility of leap years, which suggests that it attempts to enumerate possibilities incompletely.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason given does not account for all necessary details (such as leap years).
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis is weak since it fails to consider all variations of a year's length.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason is not simply a repetition of the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument does not claim universal agreement on any disputed fact.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** There is no ambiguity in language usage leading to a reinterpretation of the speaker's intent.

Step 5: Conclude Classification
- The argument misses out on considering leap years, hence it fits best under **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** because it deceptively assumes total coverage of possibilities without accounting for all of them.

Thus, the statement "A year is 365 days long, so I celebrate my birthday every 365 days" is classified as an **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** defective argument.
