For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a defective argument), we will systematically break down the advanced task of classifying the provided string into specific steps. Here is a step-by-step approach to classify the argument in the string:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
- **String**: "In the business meeting, she proposed a new advertising plan for the dog food brand, but I found out she actually hates dogs. How can we trust her advertising skills?"
- **Proposition (P)**: "How can we trust her advertising skills?"

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
- **Reason (R)**: "She actually hates dogs."

### Step 3: Analyze the Argument Structure
- **Initial Argument Structure**:
  - **Proposition (P)**: "How can we trust her advertising skills?"
  - **Reason (R)**: "She actually hates dogs."

### Step 4: Determine if the Reason <R> is Conclusive for <P>
- The argument suggests that hating dogs makes her advertising skills for dog food untrustworthy. However, this connection is weak and not necessarily valid since personal feelings toward dogs do not directly impact advertising skills.

### Step 5: Check for Defective Argument Types
1. **Generalization (G)**:
    - The argument does not generalize a trait from a small sample to a larger group.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
    - The argument does not claim to have considered all possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
    - There is a weak link between hating dogs and advertising skills. Thus, <R> ("she hates dogs") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of <P> ("how can we trust her advertising skills?").
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
    - The causal link between hating dogs and poor advertising skills is not compelling or substantial.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
    - The reason does not repeat the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
    - There is no claim of universal agreement or consensus on an argument in dispute.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
    - No ambiguous language is detected that changes the intended meaning.

### Step 6: Select the Most Appropriate Defective Argument Type
- Based on Steps 4 and 5, the most fitting defective argument types for the given argument are:
    - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

### Conclusion
The string "In the business meeting, she proposed a new advertising plan for the dog food brand, but I found out she actually hates dogs. How can we trust her advertising skills?" contains elements of defective argument types **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

Therefore, the classification under task IDA yields:

- **Type**: IR (Inconclusive Reason)
- **Type**: WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)
