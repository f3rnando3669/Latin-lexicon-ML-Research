Sure, let's apply the structured approach outlined by defining the task of IDAA and then proceed step-by-step with the decomposition for classifying the provided string.

**Given string (`s`):** "Eat lamb--could thousands of coyotes be wrong?"

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of the Task (`IDAA`)

1. **Step 1: Identify and Understand the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The given statement is: "Eat lamb."
   - This is the proposition, as it's asserting something the speaker wants the audience to accept or follow.

2. **Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The justification given for the proposition ("Eat lamb") is: "could thousands of coyotes be wrong?"
   - This implies that since many coyotes eat lamb, it must be a good or correct thing to do.

3. **Step 3: Analyze the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - The proof of reason in this context hinges on the implied consensus that thousands of coyotes form.

4. **Step 4: Classify defects according to the given types:**
   - We need to identify if this statement fits into any defective argument categories (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Classification - Defective Argument Analysis

- **Generalization (G):** Not applicable since the argument does not generalize a part to the whole.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable as it doesn't attempt to list all possibilities and claim completeness.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Not applicable directly, although the reason is weak, it does provide a reason based on consensus.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Not applicable directly; the causal link isn't entirely weak, rather based on the premise's acceptability.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Not applicable since the reason isn't just repeating the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Applicable. The core of the argument is based on the assumption that just because many coyotes (assumed universally) eat lamb, it must be right or good to eat lamb. This consensus is presumptuous as coyotes’ dietary habits aren’t necessarily applicable or persuasive for human dietary choices.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Not applicable as it's clear what is meant by "thousands of coyotes."

Since the argument asserts the correctness of eating lamb based on the supposed consensus of coyotes, which is still in dispute as a valid reason for humans, it falls under the Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>) category.

### Conclusion

Upon decomposition and analysis of the task:

**Classification (`IDA`) of "Eat lamb--could thousands of coyotes be wrong?":** The sentence is classified as **<FU>** (Presumptuous Consensus).
