For 
To apply IDAA to "When sales of hot chocolate go up, street crime drops," we will follow the structured approach for the decomposition of the advanced task IDA (Identifying Defective Arguments).

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDA (Identification of Defective Argument):
1. **Identify Elements of Argument:**
   - Proposition (P)
   - Reason (R)
   - Proof of Reason (PR)

2. **Match Argument Against Defective Types:**
   - Generalization (G)
   - Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
   - Inconclusive Reason (IR)
   - Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
   - Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
   - Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)

3. **Classify the Argument:**

### Application to "When sales of hot chocolate go up, street crime drops:"

1. **Identify Elements of Argument:**
   - Proposition (P): "Street crime drops."
   - Reason (R): "When sales of hot chocolate go up."

2. **Match Argument Against Defective Types:**
   - **Generalization (G):** This argument is not attempting to generalize a limited observation to a broader population.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument does not claim a complete enumeration of all potential reasons for street crime dropping.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason given does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. The correlation mentioned does not necessarily imply causation.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis here (sales of hot chocolate) for the drop in street crime is weak. There is no compelling reason provided as to why the rise in hot chocolate sales would cause a reduction in street crime.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason is not a repetition of the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument does not rely on the assumption of universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The statement's meaning is clear and unambiguous.

3. **Classify the Argument:**
   - The argument primarily suffers from two possible defective types:
     - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason provided does not robustly demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal relationship implied is weak without further supporting evidence.

Given these classifications, the primary defective type for the argument "When sales of hot chocolate go up, street crime drops" is likely **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The causal link between hot chocolate sales and street crime rates lacks a robust explanation and thus does not provide a compelling reason for the proposition.
