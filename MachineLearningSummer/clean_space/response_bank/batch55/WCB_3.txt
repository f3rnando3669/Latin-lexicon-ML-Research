To apply the decomposition process to the task of identifying the defective argument type (IDAA) for the given statement, we should break down the task into specific steps and analyze each part step by step.

Here are the steps for the decomposition (D) of IDA (Identifying Defective Arguments):

1. **Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P) in the statement.**
2. **Step 2: Identify the Reason (R) provided to support the Proposition (P).**
3. **Step 3: Identify if there are any Proofs of Reason (PR) presented to support the Reason (R).**
4. **Step 4: Compare the identified parts with definitions of defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).**
5. **Step 5: Determine which defective argument type best matches the statement.**

Let's apply these steps to the statement: "You said that 'runs' occur to statistically independent phenomena such as roulette wheel spins."

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The proposition is the assertion being put forth. In this case:
- **P**: 'Runs' occur to statistically independent phenomena such as roulette wheel spins.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason provides the causal basis for the proposition.
- There is no explicit reason stated in the given string. It seems the statement focuses on the proposition itself.

### Step 3: Identify Proof of Reason (PR)
Proof of Reason would provide additional arguments supporting the Reason.
- There is no proof of reason presented. The statement does not go beyond the proposition.

### Step 4: Compare the Identified Parts with Definitions of Defective Argument Types
Since we have only identified a proposition without a reason or proof of reason, we need to see if the statement fits one of the defective argument types:

- **G (Generalization)**: The statement might be suspect if it asserts a general rule (runs occur) based on a specific example.
- **FE (Incomplete Enumeration)**: This does not apply since the statement is not enumerating possibilities.
- **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**: There's no reason provided, so this is not applicable.
- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: No causal basis provided, so not applicable.
- **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: No repetition of Proposition was noted.
- **FU (Presumptuous Consensus)**: No consensus is mentioned.
- **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use)**: The term 'runs' might be ambiguous, but there's no secondary interpretation provided in the statement.

### Step 5: Determine the Defective Argument Type
Given the statement, the most fitting defective argument type is **G (Generalization)** because it generalizes 'runs' occurring in statistically independent phenomena based on a specific instance (roulette wheel spins).

Therefore, applying IDAA to the given statement "You said that 'runs' occur to statistically independent phenomena such as roulette wheel spins" classifies it as a defective argument of type **G (Generalization)**.
