For 
To apply the task of classifying the given argument "All useless laws, such as Reform Bill 13, should be repealed." as of type <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>, we need to break down the process into a set of specific steps. Here, we decompose the task and apply it step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
**Proposition (P)**: "All useless laws, such as Reform Bill 13, should be repealed."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R> and the Proof of Reason <PR>, if present
In this case, the argument as given primarily consists of <P>. There is no explicitly stated Reason <R> or Proof of Reason <PR>.

### Step 3: Analyze for Defective Argument Types
We examine the proposition to see if it matches any of the defective argument types defined:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - The proposition takes one instance (Reform Bill 13) and generalizes it to all "useless laws."

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - There is no claim of a complete enumeration of possibilities in the given statement.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - There's no Reason <R> explicitly stated in the proposition to check for conclusive demonstration.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - There's no causal basis provided to evaluate the strength or sufficiency of it.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - There is no Reason <R> provided that might be a mere repetition of <P>.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - The proposition does not rely on a claim of universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
   - The phrase "useless laws" could be considered ambiguous and subject to different interpretations.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
Based on the analysis from Step 3, the primary issues in the provided argument are:

- **Generalization (G)**: By using the example of Reform Bill 13, the statement implies that all useless laws should be repealed, generalizing from one specific case to all similar cases.
  
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The term "useless laws" is somewhat ambiguous, as "useless" can be subjective and may vary in interpretation based on the speaker's intent and the audience's reception.

### Conclusion
Applying IDAA to the argument "All useless laws, such as Reform Bill 13, should be repealed," we classify it primarily as:
- A **Generalization (G)** due to the extrapolation from a single instance (Reform Bill 13) to all so-called "useless laws."
- A **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use)** because "useless laws" is a term that can be taken in different senses than the speaker might intend.

Thus, the argument may suffer from multiple defects: generalization and ambiguous language use.
