To apply the task of decomposing the argument classification task into specific steps (IDAA) to the given argument, we'll follow a structured approach to identify any defective argument types present. Here's the argument to analyze:

"If there is no objective morality, then all the bad people will not be punished for their bad behavior after death. I don’t like that; therefore, morality must be objective."

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**
- Determine the main claim or assertion the argument is trying to prove.
- Proposition: "Morality must be objective."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)**
- Identify the causal basis provided to establish the truth of the proposition.
- Reason: "If there is no objective morality, then all the bad people will not be punished for their bad behavior after death. I don’t like that."

**Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**
- Determine if there are additional arguments presented to support the reason.
- Proof of Reason: Not explicitly provided; the reason itself is based on the personal dislike of the outcome if there is no objective morality.

**Step 4: Evaluate for Defective Arguments** 
- Analyze the reason and the proof of reason to identify any of the defective argument types defined.

Now, taking each defective argument type one by one:

1. **Generalization (G):** This does not apply, as the argument is not making a broad claim based on a small sample.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This does not apply, as the argument is not claiming a complete enumeration of possibilities and missing some.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. Just because the speaker dislikes the consequence of there being no objective morality does not logically establish that morality must be objective. There is a subjective emotional appeal rather than a logical basis.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis (dislike of an undesirable outcome) is weak and not compelling enough to prove the proposition.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason does not simply restate the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument does not rely on an assumed consensus about a debated issue.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The argument does not contain ambiguous language that can be taken in another sense.

**Conclusion:**
The argument mainly falls into the defective argument type of both **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** due to the reliance on personal dislike rather than a logical or empirical basis to support the proposition.

Thus, the string "If there is no objective morality, then all the bad people will not be punished for their bad behavior after death. I don’t like that; therefore, morality must be objective." is classified as both <IR> and <WCB>.
