For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "I think that businesses should not have to limit the amount of pollutants they release into the atmosphere because Rush Limbaugh says that there is no real evidence for industrial pollutants causing the Greenhouse Effect," we need to decompose the task of classifying the string into specific steps. Here's how we can do this step by step:

### Step 1: Identify Propositions and Reasons
- **Proposition (P):** This is the statement that the argument is trying to prove.
  - **P:** Businesses should not have to limit the amount of pollutants they release into the atmosphere.
- **Reason (R):** This is the statement that provides a causal basis for the Proposition.
  - **R:** Rush Limbaugh says that there is no real evidence for industrial pollutants causing the Greenhouse Effect.

### Step 2: Evaluate the Type of Defective Argument
Now we need to assess whether the argument falls into any of the defective argument types specified:

1. **Generalization (G):** The argument makes an assertion applicable to all based on a part or majority.
   - **Is P based on something true for a part but claimed for all?** No clear indication of this.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument claims a complete enumeration of possibilities but misses pertinent ones.
   - **Does the argument claim completeness but seems to miss possibilities?** This isn't directly suggested here.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** R does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of P.
   - **Does R conclusively demonstrate P?** The reason given, based on Rush Limbaugh's claim, does not provide strong, empirical evidence for P.
   - **Likely Fit:** Yes, there is an IR because the reason provided is not conclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** R is weak if it doesn't compellingly support P.
   - **Is the causal basis weak?** Yes, the argument relies on the opinion of Rush Limbaugh without broader verification.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** R repeats P in different words.
   - **Does R say the same as P?** No, it doesn't repeat but tries to provide an additional reason.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** PR assumed as certain because it's "universally agreed upon."
   - **Is there a PR assuming universal agreement?** No, it does not claim universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** PR can be taken in another sense than intended.
   - **Is the language ambiguous?** The statement does not appear ambiguous in the way defined.

### Conclusion
By evaluating each defective argument type, we find that the provided argument primarily fits:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The argument's reason (Rush Limbaugh's statement) does not conclusively support the proposition that businesses should not have to limit pollutants.

Additionally, it can also be considered a case of:
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis for the proposition is weak and not compelling.

### Final Classification:
The argument "I think that businesses should not have to limit the amount of pollutants they release into the atmosphere because Rush Limbaugh says that there is no real evidence for industrial pollutants causing the Greenhouse Effect" is classified as **IR (Inconclusive Reason)** and **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
