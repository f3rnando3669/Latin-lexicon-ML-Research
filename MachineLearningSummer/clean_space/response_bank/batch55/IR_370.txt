Sure, let's decompose the advanced task <IDA> into specific steps, label it as <D>, and then apply the decomposition <IDAA> to the given string.

### Decomposition of Task <IDA>:
1. **Identify the Proposition (P) from the given string:** This is the part of the argument that sets forth the summary of what we intend to prove.
  
2. **Identify the Reason (R) in the argument:** This sets forth the causal basis for P.

3. **Identify any Proof of the Reason (PR) if given:** This corroborates the Reason with additional arguments or evidence.

4. **Classify the defective argument type:**
   - Check for Generalization (G)
   - Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
   - Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR)
   - Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
   - Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
   - Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
   - Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)

### Application of <IDAA> to the given string:
#### Given String:
"You asked me why the unemployment rate has increased once more, but I'm going to tell you what has an even worse effect on morale in this country."

#### Step-by-Step Application:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - In the given string, there doesn't seem to be a clear proposition that sets forth what the speaker intends to prove. Instead, the speaker avoids addressing the proposition directly.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - The string mentions the speakerâ€™s intention to redirect the conversation ("but I'm going to tell you what has an even worse effect on morale in this country"), but this does not provide a reason related to the initial proposition.

3. **Identify any Proof of the Reason (PR):**
   - There is no proof presented in the given string. The statement simply hints at presenting a different topic.

4. **Classify the defective argument type (one-by-one):**
   - **Generalization (G):** No assertion is made based on parts or majority.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** No complete enumeration of possibilities is claimed.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** No reason is given for the initial proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** No causal basis provided as no reason is given.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** No repetition of the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** No appeal to unanimity.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Language used to introduce a different topic but not ambiguous in the traditional sense for argument context.

Given that the speaker diverts from the original question, this seems to most closely correlate with **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**. Despite not directly addressing the initial question, the statement fails to provide a reason to support or refute the increase in unemployment rate. Thus, the argument presented is defective due to the irrelevance of the response to the original question.

So, the classification of <s> is:
- **Defective Argument Type:** Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)

The final classified type is **<IR>**.
