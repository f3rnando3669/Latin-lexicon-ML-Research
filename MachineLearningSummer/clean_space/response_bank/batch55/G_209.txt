To apply IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a string as a defective argument type) to the given string, we will decompose the task into specific steps and classify the string accordingly.

### Step 1: Identify the components and structure of the argument
First, let's break down the argument into its components to understand the structure:

- **Proposition (P):** "Do most Americans believe in God?"
- **Reason (R):** "To find out, we asked over 10,000 scientists at colleges and universities throughout America. Less than 40 percent said they believed in God."
- **Conclusion (implicit):** "Most Americans no longer believe in God."

### Step 2: Assess and classify the argument
Next, we'll evaluate the reasoning provided in the argument and see if it fits any of the defective arguments specified.

#### Evaluation of the Reason (R):
- The survey targeted a specific subset of the population ("over 10,000 scientists at colleges and universities"), which is not representative of the general population of Americans.
- Scientists at colleges and universities might hold different beliefs compared to the general American populace.

#### Classification:

1. **Generalization (G):** The argument generalizes the beliefs of a specific group (college and university scientists) to the entire population of Americans. This matches the definition of a Generalization, where a proposition based on one part is applied to all.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument might not be considering all possible groups within the American population, leading to an incomplete assessment.
  
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition regarding the entire American population.

Based on the provided definitions and the analysis, the most fitting type of defective argument here is:

### "Generalization (G)"
The reason (R) provided by asking a subset of the population (scientists) does not ensure that the conclusion (most Americans) holds since it generalizes the beliefs of this specific subset to the entire population which may not be representative.

### Conclusion
The classification of the given string "Do most Americans believe in God? To find out, we asked over 10,000 scientists at colleges and universities throughout America. Less than 40 percent said they believed in God. The conclusion is obvious: Most Americans no longer believe in God." falls under the defective argument type **Generalization (G)**.
