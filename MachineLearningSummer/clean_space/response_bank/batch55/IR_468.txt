For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a given string as a specific type of defective argument) to the string "Billy - 'An apple is a vegetable.' Bobby - 'Don't listen to Billy; he failed Spanish class last year.'":

### Step 1: Understand the Context and Contents
- **s = "Billy - 'An apple is a vegetable.' Bobby - 'Don't listen to Billy; he failed Spanish class last year.'"**
  
### Step 2: Identify Propositions and Reasons
- **Proposition (<P>):** This is the statement or assertion intended to be proven.
  - From Billy: "An apple is a vegetable."
- **Reason (<R>):** This is the causal basis or evidence used to establish the truth of the proposition.
  - From Bobby: "Billy failed Spanish class last year."
  
### Step 3: Analyze the Reason
- Does Bobby's reason address the proposition? 
  - Bobby’s reason ("Billy failed Spanish class last year") does not provide a direct causal basis for disputing the claim ("An apple is a vegetable"). Instead, it attacks Billy’s credibility without addressing the actual proposition.

### Step 4: Identify the Defect Type Based on Analysis
To classify **s** as one of the defective argument types:

- **<G> (Generalization):** The argument does not generalize from one or a majority to all.
- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):** There's no list of possibilities being incompletely enumerated.
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** **Bobby's reason about Billy's failure in Spanish does not relate directly to the correctness of the proposition about apples.**
- **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** There's no repetition of the same thing as the reason.
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** Here, the reason itself is irrelevant, not just insufficient.
- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):** There's no claim of universal agreement.
- **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):** No evidence of ambiguous language use is seen.

Thus, the most fitting classification for Bobby's argument is:

***Defective Argument Type: Inconclusive Reason (IR)***

### Conclusion
Upon decomposing the task, the given string clearly demonstrates an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** where Bobby undermines Billy's credibility without addressing the truth or falsity of Billy's claim about the vegetable status of an apple.
