For 
To apply **<IDAA>** to the string "In Act 1, Juror Seven says, 'There are still eleven of us who think he's guilty. You're alone.' His attempt to use numbers to persuade Eight is:", we first need to decompose **<IDA>** into specific steps for task **<D>** and then apply these steps to classify the string as one of the defective argument types.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition **<D>** for **<IDA>**:
1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine if there is a clear assertion that Juror Seven is making.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Determine if there is a causal basis or reasoning provided for the Proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Argument Types**: Compare the identified **<P>** and **<R>** to the defective argument types (**<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>**).

### Applying **<D>** to **<IDA>** for the Given String:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - **<P>**: The assertion made by Juror Seven is essentially that the defendant is guilty.

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - **<R>**: The reason provided is the number of people (eleven out of twelve) who think the defendant is guilty.

3. **Evaluate the Argument Types**:
   - **<G> Generalization**: This does not generalize from a small sample or individual to an entire group; it states a fact about the current jury's opinion.
   - **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: This is not a case of listing possibilities and missing some; it is about a majority opinion.
   - **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The number of people who believe something does not necessarily demonstrate its truth â€” this is not conclusive evidence of guilt.
   - **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: The reasoning (number of people) does not simply repeat the proposition (guilty verdict).
   - **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: The causal basis here (majority belief) is argued to be weak because majority belief does not equate to factual correctness.
   - **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: The argument relies on the number of people and could align with the idea of a presumed consensus that does not settle the dispute.
   - **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: The language is not particularly ambiguous in another sense than what is intended.

**Conclusion**:

- The type that most closely fits Juror Seven's argument is both **<IR> Inconclusive Reason** and **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**. 
  - **<IR>** because the number of people who think he's guilty does not conclusively demonstrate a valid reason the defendant is indeed guilty.
  - **<WCB>** because the reason provided (majority opinion) is not a compelling one as it relies on appeal to majority rather than factual evidence.

**So, applying IDAA to this argument:**

Juror Seven's attempt to use numbers to persuade Eight is classified as <IR> and <WCB>.
