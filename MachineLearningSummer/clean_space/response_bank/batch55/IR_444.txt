Sure, let's apply the task decomposition to classify the given argument step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
First, we need to identify the Proposition <P> in the argument. The Proposition is the statement or claim that someone is trying to prove. In the given argument:

"Look, it doesn't matter whether or not you think America should build a wall on the border. The President thinks America should do it, so it's a good idea."

The <P> here is:
"The President thinks America should do it."

However, it appears that the statement being argued is actually implied to be:
"Building a wall on the border is a good idea."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
Next, we need to identify the Reason <R> provided to support the Proposition. The Reason is the justification or causal basis provided. In the given argument:

"The President thinks America should do it."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason <PR>
We look at the Proof of Reason <PR>, which is the additional support or corroboration for the Reason. In this argument, there isn't a traditional additional reasoning step, but the implication is that because “The President thinks America should do it,” it is considered a good idea.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type
We now need to classify the type of defective argument presented by analyzing how the Proposition <P>, Reason <R>, and Proof of Reason <PR> interplay.

### Analysis and Classification

1. **Generalization (<G>):** The argument does not appear to extend a particular case to a general rule, so it doesn't fit into <G>.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument does not claim to account for all possibilities or cases, so <FE> doesn't apply.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The Reason does not conclusively support the Proposition. The President’s opinion alone does not conclusively prove that building a wall is indeed a good idea.
   
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This seems quite relevant here. The Reason for the Proposition is weak—just because the President believes it does not inherently make the plan a good idea.
   
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The Reason here is not simply a repetition of the Proposition, so it doesn’t fit <RR>.
   
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** It is not claiming universal agreement. Instead, it is relying on the authority of the President’s opinion.
   
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** There is no ambiguity in language use in the argument, so <DEP> does not apply.

Based on the analysis, the argument is best classified as **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)** because the Reason given (the President’s opinion) is not compelling enough to establish the truth of the Proposition (that building a wall on the border is a good idea).

In summary:
**IDAA applied classification:** <WCB>
