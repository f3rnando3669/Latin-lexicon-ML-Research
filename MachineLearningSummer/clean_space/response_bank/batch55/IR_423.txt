To classify the given string using the IDAA approach, we need to decompose the task (D) into specific steps. Here’s the step-by-step decomposition and classification:

### Step 1: Identify <P> (Proposition)
- The initial proposition is: "We should offer movies on our company’s website."

### Step 2: Identify <R> (Reason)
- The reason given in reply is: "No, we’ve built our company’s fortune by renting movies only through our stores."

### Step 3: Analyze the Relationship Between <P> and <R>
- We need to determine whether the reason (R) effectively supports the proposition (P) or if it introduces any defects.

### Step 4: Check for Defective Argument Types
1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Is this an assertion based on an unrepresentative sample applied to all cases? 
   - Not applicable here.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Does it claim complete enumeration but fail to do so?
   - Not applicable here.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Does the reason not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
   - Possibly applicable; let's analyze further.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Is the causal link weak or not compelling?
   - Possibly applicable; let's analyze further.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Does it repeat the same statement in different words?
   - Not applicable here.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Is it based on an assumed universal agreement?
   - Not applicable here.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Is ambiguous language used?
   - Not applicable here.

### Step 5: Detailed Analysis for Inconclusive Reason (IR) and Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided ("No, we’ve built our company’s fortune by renting movies only through our stores.") does not directly address whether offering movies on the website is a good idea or not. It merely states the company's past success but doesn't conclusively argue why expanding to a website would not work.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal link here is weak because the fact that the company has been successful renting movies in stores does not necessarily mean that renting movies through a website would not work or be unsuccessful. The argument assumes that past success in one domain (stores) invalidates potential success in another domain (website), which is not a compelling causal basis.

### Step 6: Conclusion
- The statement falls under **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because the reason given relies on a weak causal basis that does not compellingly counter the proposition of offering movies on the company’s website.

Hence, by applying IDAA to the given string, we classify it as type **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
