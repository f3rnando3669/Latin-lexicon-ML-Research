To decompose the task of classifying the given argument type (IDA) into specific steps (D) and then apply it to the provided argument "Cassie has no school spirit—she never comes to any of our football games. Guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something" (IDAA), we can break down the process as follows:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Determine the main assertion or claim being made.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Locate the causal basis presented to support the proposition.

3. **Evaluate the Proposition for Defective Argument Types:**
   - Check if the Proposition (P) fits any of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

4. **Evaluate the Reason for Defective Argument Types:**
   - Check if the Reason (R) fits any of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

5. **Identify Proof of Reason (PR) if Present:**
   - Determine if there is additional evidence supporting the Reason and evaluate whether it fits any of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

6. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:**
   - Based on the evaluation, classify the argument under one of the defective types.

### Application of IDAA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - The proposition is: "Cassie has no school spirit."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - The reason given is: "She never comes to any of our football games."

3. **Evaluate the Proposition for Defective Argument Types:**
   - Let’s consider if "Cassie has no school spirit" fits any defective types:
     - **Generalization (G)**: This could be seen as generalizing Cassie’s lack of school spirit based on her absence from football games alone.

4. **Evaluate the Reason for Defective Argument Types:**
   - The reason "She never comes to any of our football games" could imply:
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: There could be other school activities she participates in that also show school spirit, not just football games.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason doesn’t conclusively prove she lacks school spirit, as it is only based on football game attendance.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal link between not attending football games and lacking school spirit is weak because school spirit can be shown in many other ways.
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This is not applicable here as the reason is not a repetition of the proposition.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This doesn’t apply as there’s no claim of universal agreement.
     - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The statement is clear and unambiguous.

5. **Identify Proof of Reason (PR) if Present:**
   - There is no additional proof provided supporting the reason.

6. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:**
   - The primary defect seems to be a combination of **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** and **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the argument assumes school spirit can only be measured by attendance at football games (missing out on other possible indications) and doesn’t conclusively demonstrate the lack of school spirit.

In summary, the given argument can be primarily classified as **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** and **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. This classification follows the steps of identifying the proposition, reason, and evaluating them to distinguish the defective argument types.
