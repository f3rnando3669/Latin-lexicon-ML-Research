For 
Sure, I will now apply the decomposition of the task "classifying the string as of type G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU or DEP" step by step to the provided dialogue.

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P), Reason (R), and Proof of Reason (PR) in the provided argument.**

- **Pastor Pete:** "People are turning to God everywhere!"
  - This is the Proposition (**P**) that Pastor Pete intends to prove.

- **Pastor Pete:** "9 out of 10 people I interviewed said that they had a personal relationship with Jesus Christ."
  - This is the Reason (**R**) that Pastor Pete presents to support the Proposition (**P**).

- **Fred:** "Where did you find these people you interviewed?"
  - This question challenges the proof provided.

- **Pastor Pete:** "In my church."
  - This answer can be seen as a Proof of Reason (**PR**) indicating the source of the interviewees.

**Step 2: Evaluate the Reason (R) and Proof of Reason (PR) for the Proposition (P).**

- **R:** "9 out of 10 people I interviewed said that they had a personal relationship with Jesus Christ."
  - We need to evaluate if this Reason sufficiently supports the Proposition.

- **PR:** "In my church."
  - We need to evaluate if this Proof of Reason sufficiently corroborates the Reason.

**Step 3: Identify if the argument type fits one of the defective categories: G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, or DEP.**

- The statement "People are turning to God everywhere!" is a general assertion.
- The proof provided "9 out of 10 people I interviewed said that they had a personal relationship with Jesus Christ" comes from a limited sample (people in Pastor Pete’s church).

Based on these steps, let's match the argument to one of the defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G):** The argument may be classified as a Generalization because Pastor Pete is making a broad assertion based on a sample that may not be representative of the whole population ("everywhere").

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This does not apply as the argument does not claim to cover all possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This may apply because the Reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition. However, this can be a secondary classification combined with Generalization.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This does not seem to apply as it’s more about the strength of the causal connection rather than the representativeness of the sample.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This does not apply as the Reason is not a repetition of the Proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This does not apply as there is no mention of universal agreement being the proof.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** This does not apply because there's no ambiguity in the language used.

**Final Classification:**

The argument primarily falls under the defective argument type **Generalization (G)**. Pastor Pete's reasoning, based on a small and potentially biased sample (his church), does not justify the broad claim he makes about people turning to God "everywhere."

This completes the decomposition and classification (IDAA) for the given string.
