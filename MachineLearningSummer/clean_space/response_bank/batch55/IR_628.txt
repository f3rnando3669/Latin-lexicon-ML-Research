For 
To apply the defined process \( \text{IDAA} \) to the string "What type of persuasive writing is used to influence readers’ feelings (pathos)?", we need to carefully follow the steps of decomposing \( \text{IDA} \) into manageable parts and then applying those steps to our string. Let's go through this step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Task \( \text{IDA} \) and the string \( s \)**:
   - Task \( \text{IDA} \): Classify the given string \( s \) as one of the defective argument types \( \text{<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>} \).
   - String \( s \): "What type of persuasive writing is used to influence readers’ feelings (pathos)?"

2. **Decompose \( \text{IDA} \) into Specific Steps \( \text{D} \)**:
   - **Step 1**: Recognize the nature of the argument or question presented in the string \( s \).
   - **Step 2**: Identify components \( \text{<P>}, \text{<R>}, \text{<PR>} \), if any, within the string.
   - **Step 3**: Compare these components against the list of defective argument types \( \text{<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>} \).

3. **Apply Step 1**: Recognize the Nature of the Argument or Question
   - The string is a question asking about the type of persuasive writing that uses pathos to influence readers' feelings.

4. **Apply Step 2**: Identify Components <P>, <R>, <PR> (if any)
   - **Proposition \( \text{<P>}**: The implied proposition is that there is a specific type of persuasive writing aimed at influencing readers’ feelings using pathos.
   - **Reason \( \text{<R>}**: The reason is implicit in the term "influence readers’ feelings (pathos)", suggesting that this type of writing appeals to emotions (although not explicitly stated as a reason here).
   - **Proof of Reason \( \text{<PR>}**: Not explicitly present.

5. **Apply Step 3**: Compare Against Defective Argument Types
   - **Generalization \( \text{<G>}**: This would involve making a broad assertion based on limited evidence. The string does not appear to generalize in such a way.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration \( \text{<FE>}**: This involves incorrectly claiming completeness. The string does not enumerate possibilities or claim completeness.
   - **Inconclusive Reason \( \text{<IR>}**: The reason is not presented clearly enough to assess conclusiveness.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis \( \text{<WCB>}**: The causal basis isn't clearly defined to evaluate its sufficiency.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition \( \text{<RR>}**: The string does not repeat the proposition as the reason.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus \( \text{<FU>}**: No universal agreement or consensus is implied or assumed.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use \( \text{<DEP>}**: The string uses technical terms like "pathos" and "persuasive writing" that could be interpreted in various ways.

**Conclusion**:
Given the analysis, the most fitting defective argument category for the provided string is \( \text{<DEP>} \) (Ambiguous Language Use). The usage of the term "pathos" and the question about "type of persuasive writing" without clear definitions or context could lead to multiple interpretations, making the question ambiguous.
