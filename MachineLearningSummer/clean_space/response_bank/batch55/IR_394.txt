For 
Sure, let's apply the decomposition (`<D>`) method to the task of classifying the defective argument (`<IDA>`) in the given statement.

The statement provided is:
"If you write to Mrs. Roth and tell her: 'Mrs Roth, I know I haven't done any of the assignments, but I need a C anyway because I'm asking nicely and I'm a good person, and I'm going to get in trouble if you don't.'"

Here is a step-by-step decomposition and classification:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition in the statement is:
"I need a C anyway."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reasons stated for the proposition are:
"I'm asking nicely."
"I'm a good person."
"I'm going to get in trouble if you don't."

### Step 3: Check for Types of Defective Arguments

1. **Generalization (G)**
   - The proposition does not seem to be based on a generalization of a small group to a larger one.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
   - There is no claim of having considered all possibilities and missing out on some.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
   - We need to evaluate if the reasons mentioned actually demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
   - The reasons provided need to be compelling and sufficiently causal.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
   - The reasons should not just repeat the proposition in different words.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
   - There should be no assumptions based on universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**
   - The language should not be ambiguous or unclear.

### Step 4: Analyze Each Reason

1. **"I'm asking nicely."**
   - This reason does not demonstrate a strong causal basis for needing a C. This could hint toward `WCB` (Insufficient Causal Basis).

2. **"I'm a good person."**
   - This reason also does not provide a strong causal relationship to justify the grade. This could again point to `WCB`.

3. **"I'm going to get in trouble if you don't."**
   - This reason tries to establish a consequence but doesn't sufficiently justify why this should result in a C. This might be seen again as `WCB`.

### Step 5: Determine the Defective Argument Type

Based on the analysis:
- The main issue with the argument seems to be that the reasons given are not compelling enough to establish the truth of the proposition. They don't provide a strong causal basis for why the student deserves a C.

### Classification Summary

Given the reasons identified and their lack of compelling causal relationship to the proposition, the defective argument type for the provided statement is most accurately:

**<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**

Therefore, the statement is classified as containing an `Insufficient Causal Basis`.
