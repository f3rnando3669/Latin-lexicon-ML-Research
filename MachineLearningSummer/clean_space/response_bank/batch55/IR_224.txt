For 
To apply the process of <IDAA> (decomposing the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types) to the statement "An abusive attack against someone making the argument, instead of the argument itself, is called a/an":

### Step 1: Understanding the Statement
1. **Identify the key elements of the statement:**
   - The statement mentions "an abusive attack against someone making the argument."
   - It specifies "instead of the argument itself."

### Step 2: Analyzing the Nature of the Argument
2. **Classify the nature of the argument in the statement:**
   - This statement describes a type of argumentative fallacy.
   - The nature of the fallacy is attacking the person making the argument rather than addressing the argument itself.

### Step 3: Matching with Defective Argument Types
3. **Compare the description with the defective argument types:**
   - **<G> Generalization**: Not applicable, as there is no generalization based on a part.
   - **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: Not applicable, as it does not involve missing out on possibilities.
   - **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: Not applicable, as it does not discuss the conclusiveness of the reason.
   - **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: Not applicable, as it does not discuss causality.
   - **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: Not applicable, as it does not simply repeat the proposition.
   - **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: Not applicable, as it does not assume something is universally agreed upon.
   - **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: Not applicable, as it does not involve ambiguous language.

### Step 4: Conclusion
4. **Recognize that the statement does not fit into the predefined defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>):**
   - The statement actually describes a well-known fallacy known as "ad hominem," but none of the defective argument types defined in the task (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP) match this.

Based on the decomposition <D> of the advanced task <t>:
- The statement "An abusive attack against someone making the argument, instead of the argument itself, is called a/an" does not fit into any of the defective argument types defined within the scope (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

Therefore, the appropriate classification (IDA) for this specific statement does not match any of the given defective argument types.
