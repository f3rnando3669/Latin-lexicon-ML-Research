To apply IDAA (decomposition of the task into specific steps) to IDA (classification of the defective argument type) for the given statement, we will break down the process step-by-step:

1. **Understand the Statement:**
   - Statement: "Eating five candy bars and drinking two sodas before a test helps me get better grades. I did that and got an A on my last test in history."
   - Proposition (\<P\>): Eating five candy bars and drinking two sodas before a test helps get better grades.
   - Reason (\<R\>): I did that (ate candy bars and drank sodas) and got an A on my last test in history.

2. **Identify Key Components:**
   - Proposition (\<P\>): Assertion made about the effect of candy bars and sodas on grades.
   - Reason (\<R\>): The evidence given to justify the proposition is a single incident of consuming candy and sodas and receiving a good grade.

3. **Analyze the Reasoning:**
   - Examine if the Reason (\<R\>) appropriately and conclusively supports the Proposition (\<P\>).
   - Consider whether this reason could be an instance of any defective argument types (\<G\>, \<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<RR\>, \<WCB\>, \<FU\>, or \<DEP\>).

4. **Match Against Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (\<G\>):** This could be checked if the argument generalizes from an insufficient number of instances.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>):** Check if the argument fails to consider all relevant instances or possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>):** Verify if the reason does not conclusively prove the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>):** Determine if the reason does not provide a compelling causal basis for the proposition.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>):** Check if the reason merely restates the proposition in different words.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>):** See if the proof is assumed to be universally agreed upon despite being in dispute.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>):** Check if the reason could be interpreted in a different sense than intended.

5. **Classify the Statement:**
   - The Proposition (\<P\>) is quite broad: eating candy bars and drinking sodas improves grades.
   - The Reason (\<R\>) is based on a single instance: one test result.
   - This suggests a type of defective argument where the conclusion is being drawn from an insufficient sample size, trying to generalize a single event to a broad conclusion.

6. **Determine the Specific Defective Argument:**
   - Given that the argument is based on a single instance and makes a broad assertion, it most closely aligns with Generalization (\<G\>).

Therefore, the fallacy in the given example is best classified as a **Generalization (G)**:
The statement inaccurately generalizes a conclusion (better grades) from a single occurrence (getting an A on the last test in history after eating candy bars and drinking sodas).
