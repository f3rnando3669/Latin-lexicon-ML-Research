Applying IDAA to classify the given string involves decomposing the task of classifying the string into specific steps. Here’s the step-by-step process for the provided example:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The first step is to identify the main proposition in the string which sets forth what the speaker intends to prove.

**Example String:** "I believe in supernatural beings because every time I drive past the cemetery where my grandmother is buried, a light on my dashboard flashes. Her spirit causes this because it never happens otherwise."

- **Proposition (<P>):** "I believe in supernatural beings."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Next, we need to find the reason provided to support the proposition. The reason sets forth the causal basis for the proposition.

- **Reason (<R>):** "Because every time I drive past the cemetery where my grandmother is buried, a light on my dashboard flashes."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
Then, we should pinpoint any additional arguments or evidence corroborating the reason.

- **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** "Her spirit causes this because it never happens otherwise."

### Step 4: Evaluate the Defective Argument Types
Now, with the proposition, reason, and proof identified, we will evaluate the argument against the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

**Types to consider:**

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: If the proposition is overly generalized based on insufficient evidence.
   - Not applicable here directly.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: If the argument claims complete enumeration but misses pertinent possibilities.
   - Not applicable here directly.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: If the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
   - The reason provided ("Because every time I drive past the cemetery where my grandmother is buried, a light on my dashboard flashes.") does not conclusively demonstrate the presence of supernatural beings. This could be classified as <IR>.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: If the reason is just a repetition of the proposition.
   - Not applicable here.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: If the reason has a weak causal connection to the proposition.
   - The causal relationship cited ("Her spirit causes this because it never happens otherwise.") is speculative and lacks compelling evidence. This can be classified as <WCB>.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: If the proof of reason assumes universal agreement prematurely.
   - Not applicable here.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: If the proof can be taken in another sense than intended.
   - Not applicable here.

### Step 5: Classify the String
Based on the evaluation, we classify the argument:

- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** The reason provided does not conclusively prove the presence of supernatural beings.
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The causal basis suggested that the grandmother’s spirit causes the dashboard light to flash is weak and speculative.

### Conclusion
The string "I believe in supernatural beings because every time I drive past the cemetery where my grandmother is buried, a light on my dashboard flashes. Her spirit causes this because it never happens otherwise." can be classified as containing the defective argument types:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
