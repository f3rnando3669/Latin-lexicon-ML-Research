To apply the IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a given string as one of the specified defective argument types) to the example dialogue between Speaker 1 and Speaker 2, let's break down the process into specific steps.

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - In the given string, Speaker 1 makes a proposition.
   - Proposition (P): "No fault divorce has proven to be detrimental to society and the family."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - We need to determine if there is a reason provided that supports the proposition.
   - In this case, Speaker 1 does not provide a direct reason in the quoted text. So there is no explicit Reason (R) given.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   - Check if there’s any further proof or argument provided to support the reason.
   - Since there is no explicit Reason (R) given, there is also no Proof of Reason (PR) in the text.

4. **Classify the defectiveness in Speaker 1’s argument (if any)**:
   - Without a reason provided, Speaker 1's argument lacks a Reason (R) which could suggest a defective argument type.
   - Since the argument does not reach the stage where it gives a reason or proof of reason, it’s hard to determine a specific type of defective argument (such as IR, WCB, etc.) solely based on this part.

5. **Examine Speaker 2’s response**:
   - Speaker 2’s response shifts focus from the argument about no fault divorce to Speaker 1’s personal history.
   - Response: "You didn’t seem to think that when you got divorced."

6. **Determine if Speaker 2’s response targets any defective argument type**:
   - Speaker 2’s response does not address the content of Speaker 1’s proposition.
   - Instead, it introduces an **ad hominem** (attacking the person rather than addressing the argument), which is not among the defined defective argument types but is a recognized fallacy.

7. **Considering IDA (Classifying the defective argument)**:
   - We need to re-evaluate the exchange to see if any of the predefined defective argument types apply.
   - The response by Speaker 2 does not directly address the proposition set by Speaker 1. Instead, it attacks Speaker 1’s credibility based on their personal actions.

Since Speaker 2’s response does not fit neatly into any of the predefined defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP) but rather falls into an ad hominem attack, it indicates an irrelevant rebuttal. If we must choose from the provided types strictly within the exercise context:

- The argument type that closest resembles an issue here, albeit indirectly, is **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use)**. This is less direct because "ambiguous" here stretches to involve an irrelevant counterpoint, diverting the original topic.

Ultimately, the conversation as presented demonstrates an "ad hominem" response. Recognizing this may help us understand why it doesn't fit directly into any of the predefined defective arguments stated but rather involves another kind of fallacy not listed in the initial definitions.
