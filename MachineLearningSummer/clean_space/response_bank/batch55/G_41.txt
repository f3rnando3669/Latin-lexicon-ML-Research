Sure, let's apply the decomposition of task \(<t>\) into specific steps \(<D>\) to the task of classifying a defective argument \(<IDA>\):

### Step-by-step Application of \(<IDAA>\)

1. **Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\(<P>\))**  
   Extract the proposition or main point that is being put forward in the argument.
   
2. **Step 2: Identify the Reason (\(<R>\))**  
   Identify the basis or reason that supports the proposition.

3. **Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (\(<PR>\))**  
   Look for any supplementary arguments or evidence provided to support the reason.

4. **Step 4: Compare with Definitions of Defective Arguments**  
   Match the extracted \(<P>\), \(<R>\), and \(<PR>\) to the definitions of defective arguments \(<G>\), \(<FE>\), \(<IR>\), \(<RR>\), \(<WCB>\), \(<FU>\), and \(<DEP>\).
   
5. **Step 5: Make a Classification Decision**  
   Determine which defective argument type \(<s>\) fits the given string best based on the previous steps.

Now apply these steps to the given string:

#### String: "It’s getting late, and we still have to decide on the school budget. What do you say we just leave it as is and we can call it a night?"

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify the Proposition (\(<P>\))**:  
   The proposition here is: "We should leave the school budget as is."

2. **Identify the Reason (\(<R>\))**:  
   The reason given is: "It’s getting late."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\(<PR>\))**:  
   No additional proof or supplementary argument is provided beyond the reason stated.

4. **Compare with Definitions of Defective Arguments (\(<G>\), \(<FE>\), \(<IR>\), \(<RR>\), \(<WCB>\), \(<FU>\), \(<DEP>\))**:  
   - **Generalization (\(<G>\))**: Not applicable, as this does not involve a generalized assertion based on limited instances.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (\(<FE>\))**: Not applicable, no enumeration is claimed.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (\(<IR>\))**: Possibly relevant. The reason "it’s getting late" does not conclusively demonstrate why the school budget should be left as is.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(<WCB>\))**: Fits well. The reason (it’s getting late) provides an insufficient causal basis for the proposition (leaving the school budget as is).
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(<RR>\))**: Not applicable, as the reason does not repeat the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (\(<FU>\))**: Not applicable, consensus is not claimed.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (\(<DEP>\))**: Not applicable, no ambiguous language detected.

5. **Make a Classification Decision**:  
   The string "It’s getting late, and we still have to decide on the school budget. What do you say we just leave it as is and we can call it a night?" seems to fit the defective argument type <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis), because the causal basis presented ("it's getting late") is weak for the proposition ("leave the school budget as is").

### Conclusion
Therefore, applying \(<IDAA>\) to the given string, we classify it as type \(<WCB>\) (Insufficient Causal Basis).
