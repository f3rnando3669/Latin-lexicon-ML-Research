For 
To apply the process of IDAA (the application of task decomposition to the task of identifying defective arguments) to the statement "My first time meeting Mr. Casal went poorly, so his class will not be a good one this year," we need to decompose the task IDA of classifying the argument into specific steps. Here is how we can proceed step by step:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - The proposition in the argument is: "his class will not be a good one this year."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - The reason provided to support the proposition is: "My first time meeting Mr. Casal went poorly."

3. **Check for Defective Argument Types**:
   - We need to determine if the argument falls into any of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP>).

4. **Analyze Each Potential Defective Argument Type**:
   
   - **Generalization (G)**:
     - Is the assertion based on a small or unrepresentative sample extended to a broader population? Yes, the argument is making a generalization about the entire class based on a single event (the first meeting).
     - Conclusion: The argument is a **Generalization** (<G>).

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
     - Is there a claim of considering all possibilities when some are missing? Not directly applicable here.
   
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
     - Does the reason provided fail to conclusively establish the proposition? "My first time meeting Mr. Casal went poorly" might not conclusively prove that "his class will not be a good one this year." The argument does not guarantee that a poor first meeting directly evidences a poor class.
   
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
     - Is the causal connection weak or unconvincing? Yes, a single poor meeting doesn't necessarily lead to a poor class experience over the year. 
     - Conclusion: The argument could also fall under **Insufficient Causal Basis** (<WCB>).

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
     - Is the reason essentially a restatement of the proposition? No, the reason and the proposition are not the same.
   
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
     - Is there an appeal to a consensus that is actually in dispute? No consensus is mentioned.
   
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
     - Is there ambiguous language that could lead to multiple interpretations? The language does not appear ambiguous.

5. **Conclusive Classification**:
   - Based on the analysis, the argument primarily falls under the category of **Generalization** (G). 
   - There is also a strong case for **Insufficient Causal Basis** (WCB), as the reason does not convincingly establish the proposition on its own.

Therefore, applying IDAA, the statement "My first time meeting Mr. Casal went poorly, so his class will not be a good one this year" can be classified as containing defects of type **Generalization (G)** and possibly **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
