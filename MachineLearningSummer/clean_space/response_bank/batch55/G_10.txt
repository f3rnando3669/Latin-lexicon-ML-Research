For 
Certainly! Let's use **IDAA** (the application of the decomposition of an advanced task) to classify the defective argument type in the statement "My parents are vegetarians, and they are good people. Therefore, all vegetarians must be good people."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition \(<P>\) in the argument:**
   - This is the summary of what is intended to be proved.
   - **Proposition \(<P>\):** "All vegetarians must be good people."

2. **Identify the Reason \(<R>\) that sets forth the causal basis for \(P\):**
   - This is the reason provided to support the proposition.
   - **Reason \(<R>\):** "My parents are vegetarians, and they are good people."

3. **Identify if there's a Proof of Reason \(<PR>\) used in the argument:**
   - This would be any additional arguments corroborating the reason.
   - **Proof of Reason \(<PR>\):** There doesn’t seem to be an additional proof supplied beyond the reason.

4. **Assess if the Reason \(<R>\) is valid and conclusively supports \(P\):**
   - Evaluate if \(<R>\) really establishes the truth of \(P\).
   - Let's break down the \(<R>\):
     - The speaker’s reasoning is that their parents are vegetarians and good people.
     - The leap made is that this attribute (being vegetarian and good) applies to all vegetarians.

5. **Classify the argument according to the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>):**
   - **Generalization \(<G>\):** The \(<P>\) takes an attribute observed in a limited sample (the parents) and applies it universally to all members of the group (all vegetarians).

#### Conclusion:
The argument fits the defective type of **Generalization \(<G>\)**. This is because the proposition is making an assertion based on a specific part (the speaker's parents) and erroneously applying it to all individuals in the group (all vegetarians).

### Final Classification:
- The string "My parents are vegetarians, and they are good people. Therefore, all vegetarians must be good people." is of the type **Generalization \(<G>\)**.
