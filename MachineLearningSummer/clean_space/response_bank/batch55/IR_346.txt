To apply the process of IDAA (decomposition of the task into steps and then the application of those steps to classify the given string as one of the defined defective argument types), let's break down our task step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Argument
Read and comprehend the given example:
"By rejecting God, you are rejecting goodness, kindness, and love itself."

### Step 2: Identify the Key Components
- **Proposition (<P>)**: The statement being made here is that by rejecting God, you are rejecting goodness, kindness, and love.
- **Reason (<R>)**: The causal basis is implied to be that God embodies or is synonymous with goodness, kindness, and love.
- **Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: There's an implicit assumption that to reject God is necessarily to reject goodness, kindness, and love, based on an alleged universally accepted correlation between God and these virtues.

### Step 3: Analyze Each Component

#### Analyzing <P>:
Is the assertion in <P> based on something like a generalization or enumeration which could be incomplete or over-generalized?
- It asserts a definitive outcome (rejecting goodness, kindness, and love) based on a single action (rejecting God).

#### Analyzing <R>:
Is the causal basis (that's implied) conclusive or could it be weak, inconclusive, or repetitive of <P>?
- The causal basis is that rejecting God equals rejecting certain virtues. It assumes a very specific and universal definition of God that is not necessarily agreed upon by all.

#### Analyzing <PR>:
Is the proof based on presumptuous consensus or ambiguous language?
- The proof relies heavily on an implied consensus that God universally represents the stated virtues. This presumption is not established as fact and is open to dispute.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument
Which of the defective argument types does it fit based on our analysis?
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument assumes as certain and universally agreed upon the connection between God and goodness, kindness, and loveâ€”a point which is still in dispute.
- It also indirectly contains elements of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** since the causal link between rejecting God and rejecting specific virtues is not conclusively demonstrated and relies heavily on the presumed consensus.

### Step 5: Conclusion
By carefully decomposing and analyzing the given argument, we find that it best fits the defective argument type **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** because it assumes universal agreement on a contentious issue:

*The fallacy in the example "By rejecting God, you are rejecting goodness, kindness, and love itself," is an instance of **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.*
