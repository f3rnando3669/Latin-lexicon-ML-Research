For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "There must be objective rights and wrongs in the universe. If not, how can you possibly say that torturing babies for fun could ever be right?", we need to decompose the task of classifying the defective argument type into specific steps. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Identify the components of the argument
- **Proposition (<P>):** "There must be objective rights and wrongs in the universe."
- **Reason (<R>):** "If not, how can you possibly say that torturing babies for fun could ever be right?"

### Step 2: Determine the nature of the potential defective argument

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - Does the argument make a broad assertion based on insufficient evidence?
   - No, the argument is not generalizing from specific instances but rather making an absolute claim about moral absolutes.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Does the argument claim to cover all possibilities but leaves some out?
   - No, the argument is not enumerating possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Does the reason provided fail to conclusively establish the proposition?
   - Possibly. The reason given ("If not, how can you possibly say that torturing babies for fun could ever be right?") appeals to an extreme example and does not conclusively establish the existence of objective moral truths, but rather leverages an emotional response.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Is the causal basis weak or not compelling enough to establish the proposition?
   - Potentially, as the argument hinges on an emotional appeal rather than a logical basis for the existence of objective moral truths.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - Is the reason merely a repetition of the proposition?
   - No, the reason involves a related but distinct statement.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - Does the argument assume consensus where there isn't one?
   - No, the argument does not rely on a claim of universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - Can the reason be taken in another sense than the speaker intended?
   - No, the language used is quite specific and non-ambiguous with respect to its meaning.

### Step 3: Classify the defective argument type
Based on the evaluations above, the most fitting defective argument classifications are:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Because the reason provided appeals to an emotional example rather than providing a logical basis that conclusively demonstrates the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Because the causal basis submitted is emotionally charged and not necessarily compelling or logical enough to establish the proposition of objective moral truths.

### Conclusion
The given string exhibits characteristics of both the <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) defective argument types.
