For 
Alright, let's apply the concept of <IDAA> to the string "Marcus wants to go to a small community college close to home, but most of the kids in his class are applying to larger colleges out of state. Marcus decides that he should also apply to those colleges." We'll break down the classification (<IDA>) into specific steps (<D>).

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - **Proposition:** "Marcus decides that he should also apply to those colleges."
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The Reason provided is: "most of the kids in his class are applying to larger colleges out of state."
   
3. **Determine if the Reason and Proof of Reason (<PR>) are Valid:**
   - We need to examine if the Reason conclusively supports the Proposition and if the Reason is properly substantiated by additional arguments or evidence (if given).

### Steps to evaluate the Argument for Defects:

4. **Check for Generalization (<G>):**
   - Is the decision based on an assertion that applies to only some or most individuals, but not necessarily all?
     - In this case, Marcus bases his decision on what "most of the kids in his class" are doing. This is a Generalization because it applies the decision of some or most of the kids to Marcus' situation without necessarily accounting for his individual needs or preferences.

5. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Does the argument claim to have considered all possibilities but miss some?
     - No such claim is made.

6. **Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Does the Reason conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition?
     - The Reason does not conclusively show that Marcus should apply to those colleges. Just because most kids are applying out of state doesn't mean it's the right choice for Marcus.

7. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - Does the Reason just repeat the Proposition in different words?
     - No, the Reason is not a mere repetition.

8. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Is the Reason not compelling enough as a causal basis for the Proposition?
     - The Reason is weak: the basis that others are applying to larger colleges does not offer a compelling reason for Marcus himself to do so.

9. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - Is the Proof of Reason assumed as certain based on consensus which is still in dispute?
     - There's no mention of universal agreement being used as proof.

10. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
    - Is there ambiguous language that can be interpreted differently?
      - Thereâ€™s no ambiguous language in the presented argument.

### Conclusion:

Applying <IDAA> to the string provided, we identify the defective argument types as follows:
- **<G> Generalization:** The argument generalizes the decision-making process based on what most kids are doing.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** The Reason does not conclusively support the Proposition.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** The causal basis provided (following what most kids are doing) is not a compelling reason for Marcus to apply to those colleges. 

Thus, the primary classifications for the given statement are <G>, <IR>, and <WCB>.
