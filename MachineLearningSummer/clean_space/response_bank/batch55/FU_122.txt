For 
To apply **IDAA** to "Tries to persuade the reader to do, think or buy something because it is popular or because 'everyone' is doing it," we need to decompose the task of classifying the string as one of the defective argument types, step by step. Let's break down the task (IDA) into specific steps (D).

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Key Elements:**
   - Proposition (\<P\>): What is being claimed or urged?
   - Reason (\<R\>): The basis provided for the claim.
   - Proof of Reason (\<PR\>): Additional arguments supporting the reason.

2. **Understand the Defective Arguments:**
   - \<G\>: Generalization
   - \<FE\>: Incomplete Enumeration
   - \<IR\>: Inconclusive Reason
   - \<RR\>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition
   - \<WCB\>: Insufficient Causal Basis
   - \<FU\>: Presumptuous Consensus
   - \<DEP\>: Ambiguous Language Use

3. **Analyze the Given String:**
   - Interpret the meaning and key elements of the given string.
   - Check for the applicability of each defective argument type.

### Detailed Analysis and Classification:

#### 1. **Identify Key Elements:**
   - The given string is "Tries to persuade the reader to do, think or buy something because it is popular or because 'everyone' is doing it."
   - Proposition (\<P\>): Persuading the reader to do, think, or buy something.
   - Reason (\<R\>): It is popular or everyone is doing it.

#### 2. **Understand Defective Arguments:**
   Let's recap the defect types briefly as they relate to the argument components:

   - **Generalization (\<G\>)**: Applies to all based on some or many.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)**: Falsely claims a comprehensive list.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**: Reason doesn't conclusively support the proposition.
   - **Faulty Repetition (\<RR\>)**: Reason repeats proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**: Weak causal reason for the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)**: Assumes consensus where there is dispute.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)**: Language can be interpreted differently than intended.

#### 3. **Analyze the Given String:**
   - The string essentially uses popularity ("popular" or "everyone is doing it") as the basis for the proposition.
   - This suggests that the reason provided is a form of appeal to consensus or popularity.

#### 4. **Apply Defective Argument Types:**
   - **\<G\>: Generalization** - Not applicable. No broad assertion based on a subset.
   - **\<FE\>: Incomplete Enumeration** - Not applicable. No enumeration involved.
   - **\<IR\>: Inconclusive Reason** - This could be partly relevant, but it needs further supporting context to be conclusive.
   - **\<RR\>: Faulty Repetition** - Not applicable. The proposition and reason aren't identical.
   - **\<WCB\>: Insufficient Causal Basis** - Possible since "popularity" isn't a robust, compelling reason for the proposition.
   - **\<FU\>: Presumptuous Consensus** - Highly applicable. The string suggests everyone agrees or does it, which is presumed.
   - **\<DEP\>: Ambiguous Language Use** - Not applicable. The language used is clear in its intent.

#### Final Classification:
Based on the analysis and the stringent definitions, the string "Tries to persuade the reader to do, think or buy something because it is popular or because 'everyone' is doing it" most closely aligns with a defective argument type of **\<FU\>** (Presumptuous Consensus).

### Conclusion:

IDAA has classified the given string as **\<FU\>** (Presumptuous Consensus). The central reason the argument is defective is that it presumes a universal agreement or action (everyone is doing it), which remains unproven and is a disputable point.
