Sure, let's apply the structured approach to decompose the task of classifying the argument in the given dialogue according to the defined defective argument types.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of the Task <IDA>:
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Determine the main assertion being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Identify the reason provided to support the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Check for additional arguments provided to bolster the reason.
4. **Analyze for Defects:**
     - Inspect for Generalization (<G>)
     - Inspect for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
     - Inspect for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
     - Inspect for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
     - Inspect for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
     - Inspect for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
     - Inspect for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)

Now, let's apply this step-by-step process to the given dialogue.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
Marty's assertion is essentially: **"Doc, I'm from the future."**

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Marty's reason backing his assertion is: **"I came here in a time machine that you invented."**

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
Marty doesn't explicitly provide further proof in this excerpt aside from the context that he is in the current time frame and referring to Doc’s invention.

### Step 4: Analyze for Defects

#### Inspect for Generalization (<G>)
- Marty's argument doesn't make a general assertion applicable to all based on one part or a majority, so no Generalization defect detected.

#### Inspect for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- There's no claim made by Marty regarding having completely enumerated possibilities, so no Incomplete Enumeration defect detected.

#### Inspect for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- Whether the existence of a time machine conclusively proves Marty is from the future is debatable, but Doc's doubt suggests an Inconclusive Reason. **Potential <IR>.**

#### Inspect for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- The reason relies on the premise that Doc invented the time machine, which itself needs verification. It’s not inherently compelling as proof without further evidence. **Potential <WCB>.**

#### Inspect for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
- There’s no faulty repetition of the proposition here. The reason is different from the proposition.

#### Inspect for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
- Marty’s argument does not appeal to any consensus. No Presumptuous Consensus detected.

#### Inspect for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)
- There’s no ambiguous language being used that can be taken differently from what Marty intended. No Ambiguous Language Use detected.

### Conclusion
Doc's response to Marty suggests skepticism, highlighting potential defects in Marty’s argument. Specifically:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Doc does not find Marty's reasoning conclusive enough to substantiate the claim of him being from the future.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis (time machine invention) provided by Marty is not compelling in the absence of additional proof.

Hence, the argument in the dialogue classifies under **<IR> and <WCB>** defective types.
