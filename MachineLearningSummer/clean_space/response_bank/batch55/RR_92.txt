Sure, let's apply the decomposition of the task IDA (classifying a defective argument) to the string "You can't give me a D because I'm an A student!" Here is the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The string presents a summary of what is intended to be proved:
- **Proposition (<P>):** "You can't give me a D."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The string sets forth the causal basis for the Proposition:
- **Reason (<R>):** "because I'm an A student."

### Step 3: Classify the Defective Argument
Compare the identified <P> and <R> to the defective argument types:
1. **<G> - Generalization:** No, the argument is not making a generalized assumption based on one part or majority.
2. **<FE> - Incomplete Enumeration:** No, the argument is not claiming a complete list of possibilities while missing some.
3. **<IR> - Inconclusive Reason:** Yes, the conclusion that an A student cannot get a D is not necessarily supported by the reason provided. Being an A student in general does not conclusively justify that one cannot receive a D in a specific instance.
4. **<RR> - Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** No, the reason isn't restating the proposition.
5. **<WCB> - Insufficient Causal Basis:** Yes, the causal basis (being an A student) isn't compelling enough to conclude that one cannot get a D.
6. **<FU> - Presumptuous Consensus:** No, the argument isn't assuming universal agreement which is in dispute.
7. **<DEP> - Ambiguous Language Use:** No, there's no ambiguity in the language used in the sense intended by this type.

### Step 4: Conclusion
The argument could be classified under the following defective argument types:
- <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)
- <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)

### Final Classification
Considering all the steps above, the string "You can't give me a D because I'm an A student!" can best be classified as both:
- **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason), because the reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **<WCB>** (Insufficient Causal Basis), because the causal basis which it submits for the proposition is not compelling.

In summary, the defective argument type of the provided string is:
- **<IR> and <WCB>**
