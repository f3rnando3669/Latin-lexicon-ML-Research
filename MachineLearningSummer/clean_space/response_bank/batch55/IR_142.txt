To apply the task of decomposing the advanced task of classifying the argument type (IDA) into specific steps (IDAA), we will analyze the given argument step by step:

1. **Identify and extract the Proposition (<P>)**:
    - The proposition is the main assertion that we intend to prove.
    - In the given argument: "Education is important for the future of the American people and our country."
    
      So, the extracted <P> is: "Education is important for the future of the American people and our country."

2. **Identify and extract the Reason (<R>)**:
    - The reason sets forth the causal basis for the proposition.
    - In the given argument: "So, you should choose to study at St. Cloud State University."
    
      So, the extracted <R> is: "you should choose to study at St. Cloud State University."

3. **Determine whether the Reason (<R>) conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the Proposition (<P>)**:
    - Assess if the reason given is a compelling and logical basis for the proposition.
    - In this case, the reason provided (choosing St. Cloud State University) is not conclusively demonstrating why education is important for the future of the American people and our country. It seems more like a leap from a general proposition about education to a specific recommendation.

Based on this analysis, the defective argument type appears to be one where the reason does not conclusively support the proposition (<P>), which falls under:

**<IR> â€“ Inconclusive Reason**

4. **Verification and Proof of Reason (PR)**:
    - We would check for any additional arguments that corroborate the reason. In this case, there are none provided.
    - Inconclusiveness is confirmed due to the lack of any supporting Proof of Reason (PR).

Therefore, the advanced task IDAA when applied to the given argument "Education is important for the future of the American people and our country. So, you should choose to study at St. Cloud State University." results in the classification of this argument as:

**Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**

The steps involved:
1. Extract <P> and <R>.
2. Verify the logical connection between <P> and <R>.
3. Identify the absence of conclusive proof and classify the argument type accordingly.

Thus, the final classification is clearly <IR>.
