For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the string "Aliens must exist because there is no evidence that they don't exist," we will follow a systematic decomposition of the task into specific steps to classify the type of defective argument:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- **Proposition (P)**: "Aliens must exist."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- **Reason (R)**: "there is no evidence that they don't exist."

### Step 3: Determine if the Reason (<R>) supports the Proposition (<P>)
- Assess the logical structure and content of the Reason.
- **Assessment**: The Reason given is that the lack of evidence against the existence of aliens is presented as support for their existence.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type
Given the information:
- **Generalization (G)**: Not applicable in this case as it does not involve applying an assumption based on a subset to the whole.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable, no enumeration of possibilities is claimed.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The Reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition. 
  - The absence of evidence against a thing is not solid evidence for its existence.
- **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**: This type sometimes overlaps with IR, but it primarily concerns the strength of the causal basis which might not be very compelling.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Not applicable, as the Reason does present a different claim than the Proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Not applicable, the Reason doesn't appeal to universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Not applicable, there is no ambiguous language used in the statement.

The Reason does not conclusively support the Proposition and is thus inconclusive.

### Step 5: Final Classification
Based on the decomposition and assessment, the string "Aliens must exist because there is no evidence that they don't exist." best fits the defective argument type:
- **<IR> - Inconclusive Reason**

Thus, the classified type of defective argument for the given string is **<IR>**.
