For 
To apply the task of decomposing and subsequently classifying the given string "All teachers drink coffee and teachers are people; therefore, all people drink coffee." using the method <IDAA>, we'll follow these outlined steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Analysis:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**
- **Proposition:** "All people drink coffee."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**
- **Reason:** "All teachers drink coffee and teachers are people."

**Step 3: Determine what the Proof of Reason (<PR>) would entail**
- To support the reason given, one might need evidence or further argumentation confirming that the set "teachers" is representative of "people" in terms of the drinking coffee habit.

**Step 4: Classify the Argument Type**

- **Step 4.1: Check for Generalization (<G>)**
  - Does the proposition make a broad assertion based on a specific subset?
  - Yes. This argument assumes that because all teachers (a subset of people) drink coffee, all people must do so. The assertion about "all people" is based on one specific group, teachers.

  Therefore, this is a **Generalization**.

- **Step 4.2: Evaluate for any other defective argument types**
  - Let's briefly consider other defective types for completeness:
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** There's no indication here that the reasoning involves missing out on other possibilities in an enumeration.
    - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason doesn't inherently fail; rather, the logical leap is made from a specific to a general case.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The reason’s connection to the proposition fails in the sense of it being a generalization, rather than lacking a causal basis.
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason isn't a repetition of the proposition; it’s an extended reasoning but incorrectly generalized.
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** No consensus is mentioned.
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The language isn’t ambiguous.

Therefore, the defective argument type of **Generalization (G)** is the most accurate classification.

### Conclusion:
The string "All teachers drink coffee and teachers are people; therefore, all people drink coffee." is best classified as a **Generalization (G)**.
