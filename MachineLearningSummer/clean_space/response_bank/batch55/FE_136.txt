For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of IDA into specific steps) to the string "Are you going to do well in school, or are you going to succeed as a cadet?", we need to follow a structured process. We will decompose the task of classifying the defective argument into specific steps and apply each step to the given string.

### Step-by-step Decomposition for IDAA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
    - Analyze the given string to find the main assertion or proposition being made.
    
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
    - Look for the reasoning or causal basis, if any, that is provided to support the proposition.
    
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
    - Check if there are any supporting arguments or evidence that corroborate the Reason.
    
4. **Classify the Defective Argument**:
    - Determine which type of defective argument the string falls into based on the following criteria: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

Let's apply these steps to the given string.

### 1. Identify the Proposition (<P>)

The string "Are you going to do well in school, or are you going to succeed as a cadet?" presents an either-or scenario, implying a choice between two outcomes:
- Doing well in school.
- Succeeding as a cadet.

So, we can infer the proposition as:
- To be successful, one must either do well in school or succeed as a cadet.

### 2. Identify the Reason (<R>)

The string does not explicitly provide a reason or causal basis supporting the proposition. It only presents the two options without elaboration.

### 3. Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)

The string also does not provide any supporting arguments or evidence that corroborate the Reason, as no reason is given.

### 4. Classify the Defective Argument

Given that the string implies a choice between two outcomes without consideration of other possible outcomes, and lacks reasoning and proof:

- There is an **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument assumes there are only two possible outcomes (doing well in school or succeeding as a cadet), ignoring other potential outcomes.
- There's also a possibility of **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The use of "well in school" and "succeed as a cadet" can be vague and open to interpretation. 

However, since the most prominent issue is presenting two mutually exclusive options without acknowledging other possibilities, **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** is the primary defective argument type here.

Thus, after applying IDAA to the string "Are you going to do well in school, or are you going to succeed as a cadet?", we classify it as an **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**.
