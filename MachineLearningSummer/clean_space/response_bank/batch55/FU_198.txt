Sure! Let's apply the IDAA framework step by step to identify which fallacy is used to promote something based on popularity.

### Step 1: Identify <t>
The task <t> is to classify the philosophical or logical fallacy where something is promoted based on its popularity.

### Step 2: Define <D> (Decompose the task <t>)
To decompose the task, we need to follow these specific steps:
1. **Understand the definition**: Identify and understand the definitions of known fallacies.
2. **Match key characteristics**: Find a fallacy that matches the key characteristic of promoting something based on popularity.
3. **Validate classification**: Ensure that the classification aligns with the characteristics and definitions provided in our IDA context.

### Step 3: Apply <D> to <IDA>
Let's apply this decomposition method to classify the provided string, "Which fallacy is used to promote something based on popularity?"

#### Step 3.1: Understand the definition
We need to look at each defined defective argument type and understand its characteristics.

- **<G> Generalization**: Assertion based on some or a majority but not all individuals.
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: Claiming complete enumeration of possibilities but missing some.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: Reason says precisely the same as the proposition.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: Reason's causal basis for the proposition is not compelling.
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: Assumed as certain because "it is universally agreed upon".
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: Proof can be taken in another sense than intended.

#### Step 3.2: Match key characteristics

The question asks for a fallacy where something is promoted based on popularity. The characteristic focus here is "popularity."

The fallacy where something is promoted based on popularity is known as **Appeal to Popularity** or **Bandwagon Fallacy**. In the defined contexts, <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus) matches this characteristic closely:
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: This defective argument type assumes a proposition is certain because it is universally agreed upon, which aligns with the idea of promoting something based on its popularity.

#### Step 3.3: Validate classification
Validate that the classification aligns with the key characteristic:
- The fallacy described (promoting something based on popularity) fits the definition of <FU>, which involves assuming consensus to promote an idea.

### Conclusion
By applying the IDAA framework step by step, we classify the string "Which fallacy is used to promote something based on popularity?" as:
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**
