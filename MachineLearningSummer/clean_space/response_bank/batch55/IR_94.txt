For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a defective argument type) to the given string "Yeah, I think everyone's opinion counts on moral matters like that, but that Lila sleeps around with anything. I know of at least one marriage she's broken up, so why should her opinion count on anything, much less morality?", we need to break down the task into specific steps. Here’s the decomposition and subsequent analysis:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D> of <t>):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine what claim is being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine what causal basis is used to support the claim.
3. **Identify Proof of Reason (<PR>)** if any: Determine if there are additional arguments supporting the reason.
4. **Classify the Argument**: Determine whether the argument falls into one of the defective types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Application of Decomposition to Classifying Defective Argument (<IDAA> to <IDA>):

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition in the string appears to be: "Lila's opinion should not count on anything, much less morality."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason given to support this proposition is: "Lila sleeps around with anything, and I know of at least one marriage she's broken up."

#### Step 3: Identify Proof of Reason (<PR>)
There isn’t an additional argument beyond the stated reason. The argument relies on the assertion about Lila’s personal life.

#### Step 4: Classify the Argument

Based on the decomposition:
- The argument makes a general claim about Lila's credibility on moral matters based on her personal life.
- It assumes that her actions (breaking up one marriage through sleeping around) suffice to discredit her opinions on morality entirely.

This argument type can be classified as:
- **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument generalizes Lila's behavior (assuming unethical behavior in one instance) to disqualify her opinion on all matters concerning morality. It uses one instance (breaking up one marriage) to draw a broader conclusion about her overall moral credibility.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided (Lila’s personal behavior) does not conclusively establish why her moral opinions should be entirely dismissed. It attacks the person (ad hominem) rather than addressing the validity of her moral opinions directly.

Considering both, the primary classification can be identified as **Generalization (<G>)**, since it uses a specific instance to generalize about Lila's overall credibility on moral issues.

### Conclusion
After applying <IDAA>:
The string "Yeah, I think everyone's opinion counts on moral matters like that, but that Lila sleeps around with anything. I know of at least one marriage she's broken up, so why should her opinion count on anything, much less morality?" is best classified as a defective argument of type <G> (Generalization).
