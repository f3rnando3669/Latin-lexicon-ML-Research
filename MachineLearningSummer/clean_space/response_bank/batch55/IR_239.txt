For 
To apply IDAA (decomposition of the classification task IDA) to the given string, "We cannot listen to John’s opinion on global warming because he is a tree hugger. No podemos escuchar la opinión de John sobre el calentamiento global porque es un abrazador de árboles," we will break down the task into specific steps. Here are the steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Proposition and Reason
Identify the proposition (\<P\>) and reason (\<R\>) in the given statement.

\[ P: \text{We cannot listen to John’s opinion on global warming} \]
\[ R: \text{because he is a tree hugger.} \]

### Step 2: Analyze the Argument Structure
Determine if there are any proofs of reason (\<PR\>) provided to support the reason (\<R\>).

\[ PR: \text{No additional arguments given to support the reason.} \]

### Step 3: Check for Defective Argument Types
Using the recognized defective argument types, check if the argument suffers from any of them:

1. **Generalization (\<G\>)**: Determine if the argument makes a broad assertion from insufficient data.
    - In this case, no specific data or individuals are generalized.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)**: See if the argument claims to consider all possibilities but actually misses some.
    - This is not applicable as the argument does not enumerate possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**: Check if the reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
    - The reasoning does not conclusively support the proposition because labeling John as a "tree hugger" is not a valid reason to dismiss his opinion on global warming. 

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**: See if the causal basis submitted for the proposition is weak and not compelling.
    - The causal basis ("tree hugger") is weak and not compelling. This type also fits.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)**: Verify if the reason is merely a repetition of the proposition.
    - The reason provided is not a repetition of the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)**: Check if the proof of reason is assumed as certain by claiming universal agreement.
    - There is no indication of consensus claimed in the argument.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)**: Determine if any terms in the proof of reason can be taken in another sense than intended.
    - Ambiguity in the term "tree hugger" could lead to misunderstandings, but it does not form the core of the argument in this context.

### Step 4: Conclude the Classification
Based on the analysis in Step 3, identify the primary defective argument types that apply:

- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**: The reason provided (John being a "tree hugger") does not logically support the proposition that his opinion on global warming should be disregarded.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**: The causal basis provided is weak and not compelling in dismissing John’s opinion on global warming.

### Conclusion
The given argument "We cannot listen to John’s opinion on global warming because he is a tree hugger" is primarily classified under both Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>) and Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>).

Thus, the final classification for the given string using IDAA is:

\[ \{ IR, WCB \} \]
