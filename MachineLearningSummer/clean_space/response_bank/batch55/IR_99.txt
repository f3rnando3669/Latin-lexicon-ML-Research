Certainly! Let's apply the process of IDAA to classify the argument provided: "If you don't turn in your homework, you will be getting a call home."

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   The proposition in the given argument is: "You will be getting a call home."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   The reason provided for the proposition is: "If you don't turn in your homework."

3. **Identify the possible Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   The argument implicitly assumes a proof for the reason which might be: "Not turning in homework leads to a call home."

4. **Analyze the Proposition (P) and Reason (R) against possible defective argument types**:

   - **Generalization (G)**: The argument does not seem to be a generalization, as it doesn't claim that something applicable to a part is applicable to the whole.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument doesn't seem to be making an enumeration of possibilities, so this doesn't apply.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason presented ("If you don't turn in your homework") does seem to support the proposition, but we need to see if it conclusively does. 

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: We must check if "not turning in homework" is a sufficient causal basis to assert that the student will definitely get a call home. There might be other factors involved, like school policies, frequency of the behavior, or teacher discretion.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason doesn’t just repeat the proposition, so this doesn’t apply.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument does not rely on a universally agreed upon premise, so this doesn't apply.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The terms used in the argument don't seem to be ambiguous or open to multiple interpretations here.

5. **Determine the classification**:
   Upon analysis, the argument seems to be best classified as **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The reason "If you don't turn in your homework" alone may not be a compelling enough causal basis for the conclusion that "you will be getting a call home" without more context or supporting evidence.

Therefore, the argument "If you don't turn in your homework, you will be getting a call home" is classified as type <WCB>.
