For 
To apply the process IDAA to the task of identifying the logical fallacy in the given statement, we will decompose the task into specific steps for clarity and precision.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of the Task (IDAA)

1. **Identify and Express the Proposition (\<P\>)**:
   - Proposition (\<P\>): The claim is that "space aliens must be real."

2. **Reason (\<R\>)**:
   - Reason (\<R\>): The justification given is that "you can't prove that space aliens don't exist."

3. **Proof of Reason (\<PR\>)**:
   - Here, a further validation might involve the assertion that lacking disproof is proof, but it is worth noting that the statement lacks this explicit corroboration.

4. **Classify the Fallacy**:
   - Next, we match the argument against the known defective argument types.

### Analysis against Defective Arguments

#### 1. **Generalization (\<G\>)**
   - A generalization asserts a broader claim based on limited cases. The statement does not fit this description as it is based on the inability to disprove rather than instances or samples.

#### 2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)**
   - Incomplete Enumeration involves missing out on possibilities. In this case, it's more about proof or disproof rather than enumerating possibilities.

#### 3. **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**
   - This is when the reason does not conclusively support the proposition. The statement indeed suffers from inconclusive reasoning as the inability to disprove something does not conclusively prove its existence.

#### 4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**
   - Here, the reason lacks a compelling causal link to the proposition. The claim is based on a lack (of disproof) rather than a presence (of evidence).

#### 5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)**
   - This involves repeating the proposition as the reason. The argument does not reiterate the proposition as its reason.

#### 6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)**
   - This type insists something is true because it is universally accepted, which is not the argument here.

#### 7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)**
   - The argument does not seem to hinge on ambiguity in terms of language use; it's based more on a logical basis.

### Conclusion
Upon analyzing the statement and matching it against the defective argument types, the best fit is **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)** as the reason given (you can't disprove it) does not conclusively establish the truth of the proposition (aliens must be real).

---

### Final Classification
The statement "You can't prove that space aliens don't exist, so they must be real" is an example of an **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)** logical fallacy.
