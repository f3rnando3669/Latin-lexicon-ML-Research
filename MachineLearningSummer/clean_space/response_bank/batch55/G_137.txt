For 
Sure, let's apply the decomposition technique (<D>) to accomplish the task of identifying the defective argument type (<IDA>) in the given string. We will break down the process step by step.

1. **Extract Proposition (<P>):**
   - The primary claim or statement intended to be proven.
   - In the statement "I know that our TV advertisements are more effective than radio," the proposition is: 
     - _“Our TV advertisements are more effective than radio.”_

2. **Identify Reason (<R>):**
   - The causal basis or supporting reason for the proposition (<P>).
   - In the statement, the reason given is: 
     - _“The numbers show that we hit twice the audience with TV, and our focus groups remember the TV commercial 38 percent more than the radio slot.”_

3. **Examine Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Additional arguments or evidence corroborating the reason (<R>).
   - The given statement mentions numerical data and focus group results as proof:
     - _“The numbers show that we hit twice the audience with TV.”
     - “Our focus groups remember the TV commercial 38 percent more than the radio slot.”_

4. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types:**

    Let's check for each defective argument type possibility:
   
    - **Generalization (<G>):** There's no indication that the claim is based on a specific part but generalized to all without sufficient justification. So, this doesn't seem to be the issue.
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** We need to check if all possibilities were considered or if there were missing pertinent examples or cases.
    - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Check if the reason conclusively demonstrates the effectiveness of TV over radio.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal basis needs to be strong and compelling. Do these numbers and focus group results provide compelling causality?
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Check if the reason simply repeats the proposition in different words.
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Check if the argument relies on a presumption of universal agreement.
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Check if the terms or statements can be taken in a different sense than intended.

Based on this analysis, here's the precise classification:

- **Generalization (<G>): Not applicable. No broad generalization is made from one part to the whole.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>): Not applicable. The argument does not claim to consider every possible factor but does refer to two pieces of data.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>): Potentially applicable. Merely citing higher audience reach and focus group recall does not conclusively demonstrate "more effectiveness" as it doesn't cover other effectiveness measures like sales impact, engagement, or conversion rates.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>): Potentially applicable. The argument uses numbers but doesn't establish a compelling and thorough causal link between these stats and overall effectiveness.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>): Not applicable. The reason provides additional facts and is not a mere repetition of the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>): Not applicable. The argument doesn't assume universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>): Not applicable. Terms used have their intended meanings.

Given the analysis above, the most fitting defective argument type is <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) because the argument does not fully establish the claimed "effectiveness" just from the stated numerical reach and recall percentages. The conclusion of "effectiveness" might require more comprehensive evidence.

Thus, the classification is **<IR>** for this argument.
