For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "This is an example of what?\nAttacks the arguer instead of the argument", we need to decompose the task of classifying this string into specific steps. Let's break it down:

1. **Understand the context and nature of the string**: The given string is "This is an example of what?\nAttacks the arguer instead of the argument." This appears to describe a type of defective argument.

2. **Analyze the components of the given string**:
   - The first part of the string is a question asking for classification: "This is an example of what?"
   - The second part provides a description of the argument: "Attacks the arguer instead of the argument."

3. **Identify which type of defective argument it resembles**:
   - We know it is an argument that mistakenly targets the person (arguer) rather than addressing the argument itself.

4. **Map the description to the defined defective argument types**:
   - **Generalization**: An assertion based on some individuals, not all, but referred to all.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration**: An incomplete list of possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason**: A reason that doesn't conclusively prove the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis**: A weak causal basis for the proposition.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: Repeating the proposition as the reason.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus**: Assuming consensus for a disputed point.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use**: Ambiguity that can be interpreted in another sense.

5. **Evaluate if the provided description ("Attacks the arguer instead of the argument") fits any of these types**:
   - The description provided ("Attacks the arguer instead of the argument") is typically known as an **ad hominem** fallacy where the attack is on the person, not their argument.
   - However, none of the provided defective argument types explicitly describe an "ad hominem" fallacy.

6. **Determining the appropriate mapping**:
   - Since the given defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP) don't explicitly cover ad hominem attacks directly, we may conclude that based on the definitions provided, none directly match the "ad hominem" fallacy.

Thus:

a. **If classifying based on provided definitions**: The string "Attacks the arguer instead of the argument" does not map directly to any of the defective argument types defined (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP) as none of these types cover ad hominem directly.
   
b. **Recommendation**:
   - The task (seemingly educational) should include "ad hominem" as an additional defective argument type since it is pivotal in understanding logical errors.

In summary, **applying IDAA to classify "Attacks the arguer instead of the argument" suggests no fit in provided defective argument categories** (as "ad hominem" is not listed).

Would you like me to propose adding 'ad hominem' as a new defective argument type, or is there another aspect you'd like to explore?
