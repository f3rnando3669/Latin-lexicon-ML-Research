For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to the statement "I have a right to free speech so I can say what I want and you shouldn't try to stop me," we'll follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Parts of the Argument:**
   - **Proposition, \( \text{P} \):** "I have a right to free speech so I can say what I want."
   - **Reason, \( \text{R} \):** "You shouldn't try to stop me."

2. **Analyze the Proposition \( \text{P} \):**
   - **Content of \( \text{P} \):** The proposition here is based on the assertion of a right (free speech) which allows the speaker to say what they want.
   - **Check for Types of Defective Arguments in \( \text{P} \):**
     - \( \text{G} \): Generalization
     - \( \text{FE} \): Incomplete Enumeration
     - ***None of these directly apply to the \( \text{P} \) itself.***

3. **Analyze the Reason \( \text{R} \):**
   - **Content of \( \text{R} \):** The statement attempts to prevent the listener from stopping or interfering based on the reason provided in \( \text{P} \): the right to free speech.
   - **Check for Types of Defective Arguments in \( \text{R} \):**
     - \( \text{IR} \): Inconclusive Reason
     - \( \text{WCB} \): Insufficient Causal Basis
     - \( \text{RR} \): Faulty Repetition of Proposition
       - ***None of these directly apply to \( \text{R} \) itself.***

4. **Assess the Proof of Reason \( \text{PR} \):**
   - The statement does not explicitly provide a proof for the reason \( \text{R} \); it relies only on the proposition \( \text{P} \) to justify \( \text{R} \).

5. **Identify Defective Argument Types in \( \text{PR} \):**
   - **Locate the Defective Argument Type:**
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition \( \text{RR} \):** The reason \( \text{R} \) "You shouldn't try to stop me" is essentially repeating the proposition \( \text{P} \). \( \text{P} \) claims a right to free speech, implying the ability to say what one wants, which is also what \( \text{R} \) asserts without adding a new justification.

6. **Classify \( \text{s} \) within Defective Argument Types:**
   - Based on the analysis, we classify \( \text{s} \) as:

**\( \text{RR} \): Faulty Repetition of Proposition \(**

The statement "I have a right to free speech so I can say what I want and you shouldn't try to stop me" is classified as \( \text{RR} \) because the reason \( \text{R} \) repeats the essence of the proposition \( \text{P} \) without providing additional, independent justification.
