Sure, let's follow the defined process of decomposing the task and then applying that decomposition to classify the given statement. Here's the step-by-step application of IDAA (application of decomposition to IDAâ€”Identifying Defective Arguments) to the given string:

### Decomposition of Task (D for IDA):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Determine the main assertion or proposition presented in the argument.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Determine the causal basis or reason given for the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Find any additional arguments or evidence provided to support the reason.
4. **Check for Defects:**
    - **Generalization (<G>):** Check if the proposition makes an assertion based on a part or majority and applies it to all.
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Check if the proposition claims completeness but misses possibilities.
    - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Check if the reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Check if the reason provides a weak causal basis for the proposition.
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Check if the reason simply repeats the proposition without adding new information.
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Check if the proof of reason assumes universal agreement on a disputed matter.
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Check if the argument can be interpreted differently than intended by the speaker.

### Application of Decomposition (D) to IDA (Classifying Defective Argument):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The implied proposition is: The choice between being a "cat person" or "dog person" is valid and significant.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - There is no explicit reason given in the statement.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - There is no explicit proof of reason given either.

4. **Check for Defects (<IDA>):**

    - **<G> (Generalization):** The statement doesn't make a broad generalization based on a part or majority and apply it to all. So, this defect doesn't seem applicable.
    - **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):** The statement does not claim a complete list of possibilities. It's not an enumerative statement, so this defect doesn't apply.
    - **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** Since there's no reason provided, we can't say the reason is inconclusive.
    - **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** No causal basis is provided, so this does not apply.
    - **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** No reason is given that repeats the proposition, hence this defect doesn't apply.
    - **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):** The statement does not assume universal agreement on a disputed matter.
    - **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):** The statement is quite straightforward and not ambiguous as it stands. 

From the analysis, it seems that the given conversation snippet "Are you a cat or a dog person?" does not fit neatly into any of the defined defects (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>) as it lacks a conventional argument structure that includes a proposition, reason, and proof.

Therefore, we can conclude that the statement "At a recent cocktail party, the conversation has turned to family pets, and your friend asks you 'Are you a cat or a dog person?'" is not a defective argument per the specified categories. It's simply a conversational question without an argumentative structure.
