For 
To apply **<IDAA>** to the given argument, we need to decompose the task of classifying the argument ("The word of Zorbo the Great is flawless and perfect. We know this because it says so in The Great and Infallible Book of Zorbo’s Best and Most Truest Things that are Definitely True and Should Not Ever Be Questioned.") into specific steps. Let's get started:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) of the Argument:**
   - `<P>`: "The word of Zorbo the Great is flawless and perfect."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>) Supporting the Proposition:**
   - `<R>`: "We know this because it says so in The Great and Infallible Book of Zorbo’s Best and Most Truest Things that are Definitely True and Should Not Ever Be Questioned."

3. **Evaluate the Reason's Validity:**
   - Check if the reason (<R>) provides a compelling and conclusive causal basis for the proposition (<P>).

4. **Identify Any Proof of Reason (<PR>) Given:**
   - `<PR>` is implied by the reference to the book's infallibility and authority.

5. **Classify the Argument Into One of the Defective Argument Types:**
   - Determine if any of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP>) apply based on the identified components <P>, <R>, and <PR>.

### Detailed Decomposition and Application:

1. **Identify <P>:**
   - `<P>`: The assertion here is "The word of Zorbo the Great is flawless and perfect."

2. **Identify <R>:**
   - `<R>`: The reason provided is "because it says so in The Great and Infallible Book of Zorbo’s Best and Most Truest Things that are Definitely True and Should Not Ever Be Questioned."

3. **Evaluate the Reason (<R>):**
   - This reason is essentially restating the proposition by referencing a source that declares itself trustworthy and infallible without external corroboration. 
   - We need to see if <R> provides an independent and compelling causal basis. In this case, it does not. 

4. **Identify <PR>:**
   - `<PR>`: Here, the proof is based on the book's own claims of infallibility and truth, which is not independently verified.

5. **Classify:** 
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason provided is essentially a repeat of the proposition. It says that the word is flawless and perfect because the book says it is flawless and perfect. This is circular reasoning where the reason merely restates the proposition in different words.

### Conclusion:
The argument falls under the defective argument type **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)** because the reason provided (<R>) merely paraphrases the proposition (<P>) without offering any independent or compelling evidence.

Thus, when you apply **<IDAA>** to the argument "The word of Zorbo the Great is flawless and perfect. We know this because it says so in The Great and Infallible Book of Zorbo’s Best and Most Truest Things that are Definitely True and Should Not Ever Be Questioned," the classification is clearly **<RR>**.
