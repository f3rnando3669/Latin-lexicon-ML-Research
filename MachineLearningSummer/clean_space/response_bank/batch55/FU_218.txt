For 
Sure, let's apply the decomposition process (<D>) to the task of classifying the defective argument (<IDA>) in the given string <s>. Here is the string:

"Killing thousands of people as a result of drug war campaign is not a crime to humanity because millions of Filipino support it."

To apply <IDAA> to this task, we will decompose the advanced task of classification into specific steps and then execute each step methodically.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
First, we need to determine what the main assertion or proposition is. 

**Proposition (P):**
"Killing thousands of people as a result of the drug war campaign is not a crime to humanity"

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Next, we identify the reason provided to support the proposition.

**Reason (R):**
"because millions of Filipino support it"

#### Step 3: Analyze the Reason in the Context of Known Defective Arguments
Now, we compare the identified reason <R> with the definitions of the defective argument types to see which one it falls under.

1. **Generalization (G):** <P> is applied to all based on some individuals or a majority but not necessarily to all.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** <P> claims completeness but misses important possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** <R> fails to conclusively demonstrate <P>.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** <R> lacks compelling causal basis for <P>.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** <R> says exactly the same as <P>.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** <PR> is assumed true because it is "universally agreed upon".
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** <PR> can be misinterpreted in a different sense than intended.

#### Step 4: Match <R> Against Defective Argument Definitions
Looking at the reason "because millions of Filipino support it":

- It implies that the popularity or support among people is being taken as a justification for the proposition. 
- This fits precisely into the definition of **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**, where something is presumed to be true simply because it is widely supported.

### Conclusion
After analyzing and matching the reason to the defective argument types, we can now classify the argument.

#### Classification Result:
**Defective Argument Type (<IDA>): Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**

By systematically following the decomposition steps, we identified and classified the defective argument type correctly.
