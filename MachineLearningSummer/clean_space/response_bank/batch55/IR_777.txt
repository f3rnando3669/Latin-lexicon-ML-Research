For 
To apply <IDAA> to the provided string, we first need to decompose the task of classifying the string into specific steps. Here's the decomposition for <IDA>:

1. **Identify and understand the types of defective arguments:** Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), and Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).
2. **Analyze the components of the provided string:** Look for the proposition (<P>), reason (<R>), and proof of reason (<PR>).
3. **Compare each component to the definitions of the defective argument types:** Determine if any part of the argument fits one or more of the defective argument categories.

Let's apply these steps to the given string.

### Step by Step Application of <IDAA>

#### Step 1: Identify and understand the types of defective arguments.

1. **Generalization (<G>):** Assertion based on some or a majority of individuals, generalized to all.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Claiming a complete enumeration of possibilities but missing pertinent ones.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal basis for the proposition is not compelling.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason says precisely the same as the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Assuming proof as certain because "it is universally agreed upon."
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The proof of reason can be interpreted differently than intended by the speaker.

#### Step 2: Analyze the components of the provided string.

The argument provided is:
"Recently, we highlighted a British journalist’s story about the underside of Dubai’s startling ascent. Some in Dubai called foul, including one writer who wants to remind Britons that their own country has a dark side. After all, what to think of a country in which one-fifth of the population lives in poverty?"

- **Proposition (<P>):** Dubai is criticized for its dark side.
- **Reason (<R>):** A reminder that Britain also has a dark side; specifically, one-fifth of the population lives in poverty.
- **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** None explicitly mentioned, but the statement about Britain's poverty is used as if it were a proof.

#### Step 3: Compare each component to the definitions of the defective argument types.

1. **Generalization (<G>):** The string doesn't assert based on a subset generalized to all, so not <G>.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The string doesn’t claim a complete enumeration of possibilities, so not <FE>.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The reason given (Britain's dark side and poverty rate) does not logically support the proposition about Dubai. It instead appears to deflect or distract rather than prove or disprove Dubai's condition.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** While the reason provided (Briton's poverty) is a fact, it does not serve as a strong causal basis for the proposition about Dubai; however, <IR> is a better fit here.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason is not a repetition of the proposition, so not <RR>.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** There is no assumption of universal agreement, so not <FU>.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The language isn't inherently ambiguous, so not <DEP>.

### Conclusion
The classified defective argument type for the provided string is **<IR>**: Inconclusive Reason. The reason provided (the conditions in Britain) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition about Dubai.
