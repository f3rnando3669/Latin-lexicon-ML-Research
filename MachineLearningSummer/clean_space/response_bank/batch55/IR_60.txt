For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given dialogue "Mother: It’s bedtime Jane \n\nJane: Mom, how do ants feed their babies? \n\nMother: Don’t know dear, close your eyes now. \n\nJane: But mama, do ant babies cry when they’re hungry?", we need to decompose the advanced task (t) of identifying a defective argument into specific steps (D). The decomposition of <t> into <D> involves the following steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):** Determine the statement or claim that is being put forward.
2. **Identify the Reason (R):** Identify the reason or basis provided to support the Proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):** Check if there is any evidence or additional arguments corroborating the Reason.
4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type (IDA):** Based on the defined defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, and <DEP>, classify the string.

Next, we apply these steps to the given conversation:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Mother: “It’s bedtime Jane.”
   - Jane: “Mom, how do ants feed their babies?”
   - Jane: “But mama, do ant babies cry when they’re hungry?”

   Here, there are several propositions:
   - Proposition 1 (P1): It's bedtime Jane. (Mother)
   - Proposition 2 (P2): How do ants feed their babies? (Jane)
   - Proposition 3 (P3): Do ant babies cry when they’re hungry? (Jane)

2. **Identify the Reason (R):** 
   - Mother provides a response but does not give a reason that pertains to the propositions about ants (Responses: "Don't know dear, close your eyes now.")

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - No additional arguments or evidence are provided to support any statements about ants or bedtime.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type (IDA):**
   - We will examine the defective argument types defined to classify the conversation.

Let’s focus specifically on Jane’s propositions about ants and the mother’s failure to provide an appropriate reason or evidence:

- **Generalization (G):** Not applicable, no generalization is present.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable, no enumeration of possibilities is provided.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The mother’s responses lack conclusive reasons about the questions Jane asks.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The mother’s answer “Don’t know dear...” shows there is no causal basis given.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Not applicable, there's no repetition of the same proposition as a reason.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Not applicable, no consensus is assumed.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Not directly relevant here, no ambiguous language was used.

Therefore, the best classification would be:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** "Don’t know dear...” does not provide a conclusive reason for the propositions about ants.

Thus, we classify the string as <IR> — Inconclusive Reason — since the mother’s response does not adequately address or provide a reason for Jane’s specific propositions.

In summary, the application of <IDAA> to the conversation concludes that the mother's response provides an Inconclusive Reason (<IR>) to Jane's propositions regarding ants.
