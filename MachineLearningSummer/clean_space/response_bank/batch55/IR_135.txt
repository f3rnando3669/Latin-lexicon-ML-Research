For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "That answer you just gave cannot be right because you are always so rude," we will decompose the task of classifying the string into specific steps in order to correctly identify the type of defective argument present. Here’s the step-by-step process:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>):**
   - Proposition (<P>): "That answer you just gave cannot be right."
   - Reason (<R>): "because you are always so rude."

2. **Analyze the relationship between <P> and <R>:**
   - We need to determine the nature and relevance of the <R> in justifying or proving the <P>.

3. **Check for defective argument types:**
   - **Generalization (G):** Does the argument generalize from a part or majority to all?
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Does the argument falsely claim to have considered all possibilities?
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does the <R> fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the <P>?
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the <R> not a compelling causal basis for the <P>?
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Does the <R> merely repeat the <P> without adding new information?
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Does the argument rely on a presumed universal agreement?
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Could the <PR> be interpreted differently than the speaker intended?

### Application of Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - "That answer you just gave cannot be right."
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - "because you are always so rude."

3. **Evaluate the Reason (<R>) for relevance and conclusiveness:**
   - The reason provided ("you are always so rude") does not directly address the correctness of the given answer. Rudeness is unrelated to the factual correctness or logical validity of an answer.

4. **Classify the defect:**
   - The argument uses the speaker’s rudeness as a reason to reject the correctness of the answer, which is logically irrelevant.

5. **Determine the correct defect classification:**
   - The type of defect present here is best characterized by **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. The reason provided (rudeness) does not conclusively demonstrate the truth or falsity of the proposition (the correctness of the answer).

### Conclusion

Thus, by applying <IDAA> to "That answer you just gave cannot be right because you are always so rude," we classify the argument as having an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
