To apply **<IDAA>**, we need to decompose the task **<IDA>** of classifying a string into specific steps and then proceed step by step. Let's go through this process systematically.

### Step 1: Identify Proposition and Reasoning
First, break down the argument and identify the parts:
- **Proposition (<P>):** The conclusion or assertion being made.
- **Reason (<R>):** The causal basis or rationale supporting the proposition.
- **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Additional arguments supporting the reason.

For the given string:
"Don't listen to her even though she's a doctor. She isn't a good person, so her opinion is invalid."

Identify:
- **Proposition (<P>):** "Her opinion is invalid."
- **Reason (<R>):** "She isn't a good person."

### Step 2: Analyze for Defective Argument Types
Next, go through each defective argument type and check if the given argument fits any of them.

1. **Generalization (<G>):** Is the assertion based on one part or a majority but applied to all?
   - **No**, the statement does not generalize from a part to the whole.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Does it claim completeness but miss relevant possibilities?
   - **No**, the argument does not enumerate possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Does the reason fail to demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
   - **Yes**, "She isn't a good person" does not conclusively prove "Her opinion is invalid."

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Is the causal basis weak or not compelling?
   - **Yes**, the idea that being a good person correlates directly with the validity of professional opinions is weak.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Does the reason restate the proposition?
   - **No**, the reason does not simply restate the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Is consensus assumed incorrectly?
   - **No**, there is no appeal to consensus in the argument.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Can the statement be taken in another unintended sense?
   - **No**, the language use is not ambiguous in its intention.

### Step 3: Summary and Classification
From the analysis, we find that the argument primarily fits two defective types:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**

The reason provided ("She isn't a good person") does not adequately support the proposition ("Her opinion is invalid"). This makes the argument both inconclusive and weakly founded.

### Conclusion
Given these observations, the classification of the string is:

**<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason) and **<WCB>** (Insufficient Causal Basis)

Therefore, the argument:
"Don't listen to her even though she's a doctor. She isn't a good person, so her opinion is invalid."
is primarily both **<IR>** and **<WCB>**.
