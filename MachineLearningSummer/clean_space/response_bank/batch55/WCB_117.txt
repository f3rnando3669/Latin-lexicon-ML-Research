For 
Certainly! We'll apply the decomposition task \(<D>\) to the task of classifying the argument type \(<IDA>\).

### Decomposition (\<D\>) of \(<IDA>\):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
    - Determine the main assertion or claim that is intended to be proved.

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
    - Determine the causal basis or justification provided for \(<P>\).

3. **Analyze the Proof of Reason (PR)**:
    - Check for any corroborating arguments or evidence that support the Reason (\(R\)).

4. **Evaluate the Completeness and Quality**:
    - Evaluate the completeness and quality of the argument, looking for any defective argument types \(<G>\), \(<FE>\), \(<IR>\), \(<RR>\), \(<WCB>\), \(<FU>\), or \(<DEP>\).

5. **Classify the Argument Type**:
    - Based on the evaluation, classify the argument into one of the defective types if applicable.

### Step-by-Step Application (\<IDAA\>) to the String:

**String:** "If the country is ever going to be safe from terrorists we have to close the borders."

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
- Proposition (\(P\)): "We have to close the borders."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
- Reason (\(R\)): "If the country is ever going to be safe from terrorists."

#### Step 3: Analyze the Proof of Reason (PR)
- The statement does not provide a clear Proof of Reason (\(PR\)). There are no additional arguments or evidence provided to corroborate the Reason (\(R\)).

#### Step 4: Evaluate the Completeness and Quality

- Let's evaluate each potential defective argument type:

  - **Generalization (\<G\>)**: The statement does not appear to generalize based on a small or irrelevant sample.

  - **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)**: The statement does not enumerate all possibilities; it suggests a single solution without considering others.

  - **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**: The Reason (\(R\)) does not conclusively demonstrate that closing the borders is the only or most effective way to ensure the country's safety from terrorists.

  - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**: The Reason (\(R\)) provided does not robustly establish a compelling causal link. There is an implicit assumption that closing the borders will prevent terrorism, without sufficient justification.

  - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)**: The Reason (\(R\)) and Proposition (\(P\)) do not simply repeat each other.

  - **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)**: There is no implicit or explicit appeal to a consensus or universally agreed-upon notion in this argument.

  - **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)**: The language does not seem ambiguously used in a sense different from the speaker's intended meaning.

#### Step 5: Classify the Argument Type

Based on the evaluation, the argument can be identified as having an **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)** since the Reason provided does not establish a compelling or conclusive link to the Proposition.

**Conclusion**: The given statement "If the country is ever going to be safe from terrorists we have to close the borders." is classified as an argument with an **Insufficient Causal Basis** (\<WCB\>).
