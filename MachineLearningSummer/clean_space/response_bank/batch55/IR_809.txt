To apply IDAA to the given string "My wife wants to talk about cleaning out the garage, so I asked her what she wants to do with our patio furniture. Now she's shopping for new patio furniture and not asking me about the garage," we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Breakdown the Argument
First, let's summarize the main points in the provided statement:

1. Proposition (<P>): The speaker is suggesting that the wife initially wanted to talk about cleaning out the garage.
2. Reason (<R>): The speaker's response was to ask about the patio furniture.
3. Proof of Reason (<PR>): The resulting action was the wife shopping for new patio furniture instead of discussing the garage.

### Step 2: Assess for Defective Arguments
Next, we will identify which type of defective argument best classifies the statements made by the speaker.

Here's the primary statement once more for reference:  
"My wife wants to talk about cleaning out the garage, so I asked her what she wants to do with our patio furniture. Now she's shopping for new patio furniture and not asking me about the garage."

We will go through each defective argument type to see which one fits:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This involves making a universal claim based on limited evidence. The statement does not seem to generalize any universal principle.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This involves claiming a complete enumeration of possibilities but missing some. The argument doesn't enumerate possibilities.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This occurs when the reason given does not conclusively support the proposition. Here, the proposition is about talking about the garage, but the reason given (asking about the patio furniture) does not address the proposition directly.
   
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This involves a weak causal link between the reason given and the proposition. There is some causality implied (the shift to the patio furniture discussion), but it's weak in context.
   
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This involves repeating the proposition as the reason. There doesn’t seem to be a repetition here.
   
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This assumes a proposition is true because it's widely agreed upon. This does not apply here.
   
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: This involves ambiguity in the language used. This doesn't appear to be a case of ambiguous language.

### Step 3: Conclusive Identification
From the analysis above, the most fitting type of defective argument for the given statement is:

**Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** 

The Reason given (asking about patio furniture) does not directly or conclusively address the Proposition (wife wanting to talk about cleaning the garage). The action that followed was unrelated to the core issue.

### Conclusion
Thus, applying IDAA to the statement "My wife wants to talk about cleaning out the garage, so I asked her what she wants to do with our patio furniture. Now she's shopping for new patio furniture and not asking me about the garage," we classify it as type <IR> — Inconclusive Reason.
