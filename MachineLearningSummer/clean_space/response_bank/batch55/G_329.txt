For 
To apply the decomposition of the task <IDA> (Identifying Defective Arguments) to the provided argument, we will break down the advanced task into specific steps as follows:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine what is being asserted or proposed as the main claim of the argument.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Identify the causal basis provided to support the Proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**: Look for any additional arguments or evidence presented to support the Reason.
4. **Evaluate for Defective Argument Types**: Assess the argument for the presence of any defective argument types defined: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.
5. **Classify the Argument**: Based on the evaluation, classify the argument under the observed defective argument type(s).

Let's apply this to the given argument step by step:

---

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**  
The main claim being asserted is:  
_P: "We should make animal experimentation illegal right now."_

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)**  
The causal basis provided to support the Proposition is:  
_R: "Animal experimentation reduces our respect for life. If we don't respect life, we are likely to be more and more tolerant of violent acts like war and murder. Soon our society will become a battlefield in which everyone constantly fears for their lives. It will be the end of civilization."_

**Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**  
Additional arguments or evidence to support the Reason include:  
_PR: "Our society will become a battlefield in which everyone constantly fears for their lives. It will be the end of civilization."_

**Step 4: Evaluate for Defective Argument Types**

- **Generalization (G)**: The argument does not make broad assertions based on limited examples, so not <G>.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not claim to have considered all possible perspectives explicitly, so not <FE>.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The Reason provided (R) claims that animal experimentation reducing respect for life will lead to societal breakdown; however, this connection is speculative and lacks conclusive proof. Hence, it seems applicable to <IR>.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal relationship is weak and speculative without strong evidence connecting animal experimentation directly to societal collapse, suggesting \[R\] is not compelling. Hence, it is also applicable to <WCB>.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The Reason does not simply restate the Proposition, so not <RR>.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument does not include an assertion that something is universally agreed upon without proof, so not <FU>.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language used is clear in its intent and not open to multiple interpretations, so not <DEP>.

**Step 5: Classify the Argument**  
Based on the evaluations, the argument can be classified as containing:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal relationship provided by the Reason is weak and not compelling enough.

---

**Conclusion**: The provided argument primarily suffers from "Inconclusive Reason" and "Insufficient Causal Basis," and thus can be classified under types <IR> and <WCB>.
