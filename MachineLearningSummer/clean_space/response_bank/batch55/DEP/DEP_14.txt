To apply IDAA (the decomposition of an advanced task into specific steps) to the task of classifying the string using IDA (the classification task), let's break down the process step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Context and Intent
First, read and understand the context and intent of the statement.

**Context**: 
- Speaker 1 is discussing their campaign involving people going door to door to spread a message about social injustice.
- Speaker 2 objects on the basis that using people is inherently wrong.

### Step 2: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
Identify the primary assertion or proposition made in the statement.

For Speaker 1:
<Preliminary Proposition>: "We are using thousands of people to spread the word about social injustice and the need for change."

For Speaker 2:
<Main Proposition>: "I can’t be a part of this because I was always taught that it’s wrong to use people."

### Step 3: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Identify the reason or causal basis supporting the proposition.

For Speaker 2:
<Reason>: "I was always taught that it’s wrong to use people."

### Step 4: Evaluate the <R> in Supporting the <P>
Determine if the reason provided (R) conclusively supports the proposition (P).

**Evaluation**:
- The reason given by Speaker 2 does not provide a comprehensive or conclusive rationale. It’s an assertion based on personal upbringing or beliefs, lacking in broader justification or evidence.
  
### Step 5: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
Identify if there exists any additional corroborating evidence or arguments supporting the <R>.

**Observation**:
- There’s no additional argument or evidence provided; Speaker 2’s statement is based on personal teaching.

### Step 6: Classify the Defective Argument
Using the definitions of defective argument types provided, classify the argument.

**Evaluation and Classification**:
- **Generalization (G)**: No claim about a whole group based on a part.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: No claim about missing out on possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Yes, because the reason given (personal teaching) does not robustly support the conclusion.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Argument could be weak, but this isn’t the primary issue.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: No repetition of the same idea as a reason.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: No appeal to universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: No misleading use of language to misunderstand the proposition.

The most suitable classification for Speaker 2’s argument is:

### Conclusion:
**Defective Argument Type: Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- The Reason (R) "I was always taught that it’s wrong to use people" does not conclusively support the Proposition (P) "I can’t be a part of this."

Hence, by applying IDAA, we classify the argument under type IR: Inconclusive Reason.
