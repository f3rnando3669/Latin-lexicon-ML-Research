To apply the IDAA (the advanced task decomposition of classification of defective arguments) to the given dialogue, we can proceed as follows:

**Step 1: Identify and understand the statements (propositions and reasons) in the dialogue.**

- **Bernice asks:** "Do you support Black Lives Matter?"  
  This is a question, and it is attempting to get Mildred's position on the BLM movement.
  
- **Mildred responds:** "Of course, I do!"  
  This is a statement of support for the Black Lives Matter movement from Mildred.

- **Bernice asserts:** "Then you should support me looting that store."  
  This is a proposition (P) that if someone supports Black Lives Matter, they should also support looting a store.
  
- **Mildred responds:** "Wait... what?"
  This indicates confusion or disagreement from Mildred, highlighting that she doesn't see the connection between supporting BLM and supporting looting.

**Step 2: Analyze the logical structure and reasoning used in Bernice's proposition.**

- **P (Proposition):** If you support Black Lives Matter, you should support looting that store.
- **R (Reason):** This is implicit, but the reason seems to be that supporting BLM implies supporting all actions taken in its name, including looting.

**Step 3: Evaluate if the argument is defective and classify it.**

- The argument seems to make a broad, unsupported leap between supporting BLM and supporting looting, which is an overgeneralization.

**Step 4: Check against the defective argument types:**
  
Given the above analysis, we will check the argument against the defined defective argument types.

1. **Generalization (G):** The argument infers that supporting one aspect of a movement implies supporting all actions related to it. This is a classic case of overgeneralizing.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable here. The argument isn’t based on an incomplete list of possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason doesn’t conclusively establish that supporting BLM should lead to supporting looting. This also applies.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal connection between supporting BLM and supporting looting is weak.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Not applicable. The reason is not the same as the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Not applicable. There’s no assumed universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Not applicable. The proposition is clear about its intent but illogical.

**Conclusion:**

The main issue with Bernice's argument is that it falls under both **Generalization (G)** and **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. It generalizes that supporting a movement equals supporting all actions taken in that name and also provides an inconclusive reason that doesn’t logically necessitate the conclusion.

Thus, the dialogue can be classified under both <G> for overgeneralization and <IR> for lack of a conclusive reason.
