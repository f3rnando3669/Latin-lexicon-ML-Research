Sure, let's apply the decomposition task \( <D> \) to the argumentative defect identification task \( <IDA> \) for the given string:

**Step 1: Identify and understand the Proposition (\( <P> \))**
- The initial statement is: "It is said that we have a good understanding of our universe."
- This constitutes the Proposition (\( <P> \)), wherein it sets forth a general claim about our understanding of the universe.

**Step 2: Identify and understand the Reason (\( <R> \))**
- The second part of the statement is: "Therefore, we know exactly how it began and when."
- This is the Reason (\( <R> \)), providing a causal basis for the previous proposition (\( <P> \)) by deriving a specific conclusion about our knowledge of the universe's origins.

**Step 3: Determine the type of defective argument**
Now we analyze if the argument is defective and, if so, which type among the given definitions it falls into.

- Here, the statement implies that having a "good understanding of our universe" automatically leads to knowing "exactly how it began and when." However, these two pieces of knowledge are not necessarily directly connected or exhaustive. Hence, a general understanding of the universe doesn't logically necessitate precise knowledge of its origins.

- The nature of the defect reveals that the Reason (\( <R> \)) is not conclusively supporting the Proposition (\( <P> \)), giving rise to a potential classification under Defective Argument (\( <IR> \)), i.e., Inconclusive Reason.

**Step 4: Validate against other defect types for confirmation**
- \( <G> \) Generalization: This isn't just based on part or the majority of individuals but instead connecting generalized understanding to a specific precise knowledge.
- \( <FE> \) Incomplete Enumeration: This argument does not involve enumerating possible instances.
- \( <RR> \) Faulty Repetition of Proposition: This does not simply repeat the Proposition as a Reason.
- \( <WCB> \) Insufficient Causal Basis: Although similar, inconclusive reasoning seems a more fitting classification, since it’s presenting a causal link that doesn't sufficiently derive the conclusion.
- \( <FU> \) Presumptuous Consensus: The argument isn’t claiming universal agreement but instead infers conclusions from presumed comprehensive knowledge.
- \( <DEP> \) Ambiguous Language Use: The terms used are not ambiguous but straightforward in meaning.

**Step 5: Conclusion**
- Upon validation, the most fitting defective argument type here is \( <IR> \) Inconclusive Reason since the Reason (\( <R> \)) provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition (\( <P> \)).

Therefore, the given string "It is said that we have a good understanding of our universe. Therefore, we know exactly how it began and when." is classified as \( <IR> \), i.e., an Inconclusive Reason.
