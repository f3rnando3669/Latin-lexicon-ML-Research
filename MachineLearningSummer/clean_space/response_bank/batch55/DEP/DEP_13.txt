For 
To apply IDAA (the application of the decomposition of an advanced task into specific steps) to IDA (the task of classifying a string as a type of defective argument), we can break down the process into a series of steps. Let's begin with our input string: "The writer or speaker intentionally misleads the audience by using a word with a double or ambiguous meaning."

### Step 1: Identify the components of the string
- **Subject:** "The writer or speaker"
- **Action:** "intentionally misleads the audience"
- **Method:** "by using a word with a double or ambiguous meaning"

### Step 2: Understand the nature of the defect in the argument
- The defect described involves the use of a double or ambiguous meaning, which causes misleading.

### Step 3: Recall definitions of defective argument types
- **<G>: Generalization:** Assertion based on a part or majority but not applicable to all.
- **<FE>: Incomplete Enumeration:** Claim of complete enumeration missing possibilities.
- **<IR>: Inconclusive Reason:** The reason doesn't conclusively support the proposition.
- **<WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis:** Weak causal basis for the proposition.
- **<RR>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** Reason repeats the proposition.
- **<FU>: Presumptuous Consensus:** Proof assumed as certain due to supposed universal agreement.
- **<DEP>: Ambiguous Language Use:** Proof taken in another sense than intended by the speaker.

### Step 4: Match the defect to the appropriate type
- The description provided fits best with **<DEP>** (Ambiguous Language Use), as it explicitly mentions misleading through ambiguity in language.

### Step 5: Confirm the classification
- Verify that <DEP> fits well by checking the definition: The defect arises from potential misunderstandings due to ambiguous language, aligning with "using a word with a double or ambiguous meaning."

### Conclusion
Based on the steps taken, we can classify the string "The writer or speaker intentionally misleads the audience by using a word with a double or ambiguous meaning." as type **<DEP>** (Ambiguous Language Use).
