For 
To apply the process defined as <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string into specific steps) to the string "Science shows us that improved quality of life comes through research and invention," we first need to follow the structured approach of <D> (decomposition of the task). Here, we will break down the task of classifying the string into smaller, manageable steps, and then tackle each step methodically.

### Step 1: Identify the Components of the Argument

First, we need to understand the given string and identify its components in terms of the argument structure previously defined:

- **Proposition (<P>):** A statement that we intend to prove.
- **Reason (<R>):** The causal basis for the proposition.
- **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Additional arguments that corroborate the reason.

### Step 2: Analyze the String

Analyze the given string to see how it fits into the components of a complete argument:

"Science shows us that improved quality of life comes through research and invention."

- **Proposition (<P>):** Improved quality of life comes through research and invention.
- **Reason (<R>):** Science shows us this fact.

### Step 3: Evaluate for Defective Argument Types

We will now evaluate the simplified argument to see if it falls under any of the defective argument types defined:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - Does the proposition make a broad statement based on limited data?
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Does the statement claim to have covered all possibilities but potentially misses some?
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Does the provided reason fail to conclusively prove the proposition?
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Is the causal basis weak or not compelling?
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - Does the reason just repeat the proposition in different words?
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - Does the proof assume something to be universally agreed upon when it is still in dispute?
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - Can the proof be taken in another sense than the intended one?

### Step 4: Match the Defective Argument Types

#### 1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The proposition states a general outcome ("improved quality of life") based on practices ("research and invention"). This could potentially classify as a generalization if it's based on limited examples and not evidence across the board.

#### 2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The statement does not enumerate all possible ways to improve the quality of life. It mentions only "research and invention" but omits other potential factors like social policies, economic changes, etc.

#### 3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The string simply states "Science shows us" without a detailed explanation of how science demonstrates this. Thus, the reason provided is inconclusive.

#### 4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - If we evaluate the reason "Science shows us," it lacks detailed causal linkage showing why research and invention specifically improve quality of life, making it an insufficient causal basis.

#### 5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - The reason is not repeating the proposition verbatim. Hence, <RR> does not apply here.

#### 6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - The statement does not explicitly rely on universal agreement, so <FU> is not applicable.

#### 7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - The phrase "Science shows us" is not particularly ambiguous. Hence, <DEP> does not apply here.

### Step 5: Determine the Most Suitable Defective Argument Types

Based on the analysis, the most suitable defective argument types are:
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Because the statement fails to cover all possible improvements to quality of life.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Because the reason provided lacks detailed support or proof.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Because the reason lacks a compelling causal connection.

### Step 6: Summarize the Conclusion

The given string "Science shows us that improved quality of life comes through research and invention" is defective and best classified under:
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**

Therefore, the application of <IDAA> to the string has identified it as possessing multiple defective argument characteristics, specifically <FE>, <IR>, and <WCB>.
