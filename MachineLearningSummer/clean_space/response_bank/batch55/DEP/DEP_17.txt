To apply the advanced task decomposition (D) to the classification task (IDA) for the argument "According to the Supreme Court, we have a right to abortion. Therefore, it is right to have an abortion," we will break down the steps needed to identify the defective argument type. Let's proceed step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
Determine the statement that is being put forward as what we intend to prove.

In this argument, <P> is:
**"It is right to have an abortion."**

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
Determine the causal basis that is being set forth to establish the truth of the Proposition.

In this argument, <R> is:
**"According to the Supreme Court, we have a right to abortion."**

### Step 3: Evaluate the Reason <R>
Assess whether the Reason provides a compelling basis for the Proposition.

### Step 4: Check for Defective Argument Types
Determine if the argument fits any of the defective types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

1. **Generalization (<G>):** Does <P> apply to all based on insufficient evidence?
   - Not applicable here. The argument doesn't generalize based on an insufficient subset.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Does <P> claim a complete enumeration of possibilities but miss some?
   - Not applicable here. The argument doesn't enumerate possibilities.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Does <R> fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of <P>?
   - This seems relevant. The statement "According to the Supreme Court, we have a right to abortion" doesn't conclusively establish that "it is right to have an abortion." The legal right doesn't inherently make it ethically or morally right.
   
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Is <R>'s causal basis weak or not compelling?
   - This also seems relevant. The legal decision by the Supreme Court is not a sufficiently compelling reason to deem something ethically or morally right.
   
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Does <R> say precisely the same as <P>?
   - Not applicable here. <R> and <P> are not identical.
   
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Is <PR> assumed as certain because it is "universally agreed upon"?
   - Not applicable here. There's no consensus or talked about.
   
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Can <PR> be taken in another sense than the speaker intended?
   - Not directly applicable as the phrase is clear in its legal context.

### Step 5: Conclusion
On evaluating the defective argument types, we find that the argument fits the types <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).

### Final Classification
The argument "According to the Supreme Court, we have a right to abortion. Therefore, it is right to have an abortion." can be classified as:
**<IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**

These steps illustrate the detailed decomposition and classification of the argument into the appropriate defective argument types.
