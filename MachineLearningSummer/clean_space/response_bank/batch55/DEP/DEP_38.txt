To apply the task of IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of identifying the type of defective argument) to the given argument string, we first need to break down the string into its components, analyze them, and classify the type of argument defect. Let's proceed step by step.

### Step 1: Decompose the Argument
We identify the main points and the logical flow of the argument:

1. Assertion about the law: "Why does the law state that you have to be 21 years old to drink?"
2. Questioning the significance of one day: "Does it really make any difference if you are 20 years and 364 days old? That is absurd."
3. Conclusion/Generalization: "Therefore, if a single day makes no difference, then a collection of 1095 single days won’t make any difference."
4. Final conclusion: "Therefore, changing the drinking age to 18 will not make any difference."

### Step 2: Identify the Type of Defective Argument

1. **Generalization (G)**: The argument seems to imply that because one day does not make a significant difference, multiple days (1095 days) aggregating to 3 years won't make a significant difference. This is a hasty generalization.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not directly applicable here as the argument doesn’t miss out pertinent possibilities in a list-like manner.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning provided (that one day doesn't make a difference) does not conclusively prove the proposition that the drinking age should be changed. However, this seems more closely connected to Insufficient Causal Basis than Inconclusive Reason given the context.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis provided (a single day difference doesn’t matter) is weak to justify the proposition to change the legal drinking age for an entire different age group.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: There are repetitions in the argument but not in a manner that the reason is merely the proposition rephrased.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Not applicable here as there’s no appeal to universal agreement on the matter.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The argument uses "difference" ambiguously without clarifying what kind of "difference" is significant—legally, metabolically, cognitively, etc.

### Step 3: Classification

After analyzing the components, we see the main defect is that the argument is trying to generalize the negligible significance of one day to a large span of three years without a compelling causal basis. This highlights two primary defects:

1. **Generalization (G)**: Assuming the lack of difference for one day means the lack of significant difference for a much larger period.
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The reasoning that one day doesn't matter is insufficient to justify the overall assertion that the drinking age should be lowered by 3 years.

### Conclusion

Thus, the defective argument presented in the string can be classified as a combination of **<G> Generalization** and **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**.
