To apply the decomposition of the task (D) to the classification task (IDA) for the given string, we need to break down the process into specific steps and then follow those steps methodically. Here’s a step-by-step decomposition and application of IDAA to the string "Noisy children are a real headache. Two aspirin will make a headache go away. Therefore, two aspirin will make noisy children go away."

### Step 1: Identify the Propositions
First, we need to break down the string into its distinct propositions (P), reasons (R), and proofs of reason (PR). 

1. **Proposition** <P>: "Noisy children are a real headache."
2. **Reason** <R>: "Two aspirin will make a headache go away."
3. **Conclusion** <C>: "Therefore, two aspirin will make noisy children go away."

### Step 2: Analyze the Reasoning
Next, we need to understand the reasoning used to arrive at the conclusion and identify any causal bases.

- **Reason Provided**: The efficacy of two aspirin in treating a headache.
- **Conclusion Inferred**: The assumption that noisy children can be treated similarly to headaches.

### Step 3: Evaluate the Reason and Its Connection to the Proposition
We need to evaluate the causal basis and see if it’s relevant and compelling for the conclusion drawn.

- **Relevance**: Does the reason (2 aspirin alleviating a headache) logically apply to the proposition (noisy children as a headache)?
- **Compulsion**: Is the stated reason compeling enough to conclusively demonstrate the proposition?

### Step 4: Identify Defective Argument Types
Now we classify the identified propositions, reasons, and conclusions into one of the known defective argument types.

Let’s enumerate possible issues:
1. Generalization (G)
2. Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
3. Inconclusive Reason (IR)
4. Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
5. Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
6. Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
7. Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)

### Step 5: Classify the Argument Based on Defective Types

- **Generalization (G)**: This doesn’t apply here since we are not generalizing a claim based on limited evidence.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This is also not applicable as the argument does not list exhaustive possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason does not conclusively support the proposition since the effect of aspirin on a headache isn't directly transferable to noisy children.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal link between aspirin alleviating a headache and affecting noisy children is weak. Aspirin's chemical effects on biological headaches do not relate to the social or behavioral context of children making noise.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason provided isn't just a repetition of the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This isn't assumed as certain by universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: There is no ambiguity in the terms used.

### Conclusion
From the evaluation, the argument falls under "Insufficient Causal Basis" (WCB), as the reason provided does not compellingly establish the correctness of the proposition.

So, based on IDAA, the classification of the argument "Noisy children are a real headache. Two aspirin will make a headache go away. Therefore, two aspirin will make noisy children go away." is WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis).
