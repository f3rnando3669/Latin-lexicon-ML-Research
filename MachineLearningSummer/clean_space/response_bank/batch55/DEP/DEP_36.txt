For 
To apply the process of IDAA to the given string "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses.", we need to decompose the task of identifying the defective argument into specific steps. Here is the step-by-step decomposition and classification:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDAA

1. **Identify the Proposition (\<P>\) in the argument**:
   - Determine what is being asserted or concluded in the argument.
   - **In the given argument**: "Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."

2. **Identify the Reason (\<R>\) supporting the Proposition (\<P>\)**:
   - Determine the causal basis provided for the Proposition.
   - **In the given argument**: "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\<PR>\) if present**:
   - Determine if there is any additional argument or proof provided to corroborate the Reason.
   - **In the given argument**: "Fetuses are innocent human beings."

4. **Evaluate the Reason (\<R>\) and Proof of Reason (\<PR>\) to see if they fit any defective argument types**.

### Application to the Given Argument

1. **Proposition (\<P>)**:
   - "Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."

2. **Reason (\<R>)**:
   - "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being."

3. **Proof of Reason (\<PR>)**:
   - "Fetuses are innocent human beings."

4. **Classification of Defective Argument - Type Analysis**:
   - **Evaluate for Generalization (\<G>)**:
     - This is not primarily about generalizing from a part to a whole.

   - **Evaluate for Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE>)**:
     - This does not involve enumeration of possibilities.

   - **Evaluate for Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>)**:
     - The Reason given is clear and specific; it associates immorality with killing innocent human beings.

   - **Evaluate for Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB>)**:
     - This is where the argument can have an issue. The argument assumes that since killing innocent human beings is immoral, this applies without additional causal support to fetuses. This categorization depends on ethical or logical underpinnings that may not be thoroughly examined in the argument.
   
   - **Evaluate for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR>)**:
     - The Reason does not merely repeat the Proposition; it introduces a moral principle.

   - **Evaluate for Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU>)**:
     - There is no explicit appeal to universal agreement in the given argument.

   - **Evaluate for Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP>)**:
     - There might be ambiguity in the term "innocent human beings" and whether it categorically includes fetuses without question. 

### Conclusion

The given argument seems to primarily exhibit characteristics of **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB>)**, as it submits that since fetuses are innocent human beings, the immorality of killing innocent human beings straightforwardly applies to fetuses. The inferential step might not have been sufficiently compelling or supported causally within the argument's framework, potentially needing more substantiation.

Alternatively, **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP>)** could also apply due to potential ambiguity in the classification of fetuses strictly as "innocent human beings" without further context given in the argument.
