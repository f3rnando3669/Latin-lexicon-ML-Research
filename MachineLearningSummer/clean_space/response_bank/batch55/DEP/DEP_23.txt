To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task IDA) to the given statement, we need to break down the identification and classification of the defect in the argument step by step. Here's the process:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
Determine the main proposition or claim in the statement.
- **Statement:** "I don’t understand why you’re saying I broke a promise. I said I’d never speak again to my ex-girlfriend. And I didn’t. I just sent her a quick text."
- **Proposition (P):** "I didn’t break my promise."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
Identify the reason provided to support the proposition.
- **Reason (R):** "I said I’d never speak again to my ex-girlfriend. And I didn’t. I just sent her a quick text."

### Step 3: Classify the Defective Argument (IDA)
Analyze the reason to determine if it falls into one of the defective argument types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).
- The reason provided seems structured on the interpretation of the word "speak." The speaker claims not to have spoken to the ex-girlfriend but acknowledges sending a text message.
- The defectiveness hinges on the ambiguity or equivocation of the term "speak."

### Step 4: Select the Appropriate Defective Argument Type
Match the identified problem with the most fitting defective argument type.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)** seems to be the most appropriate classification. The ambiguity arises from the term "speak," which can be interpreted narrowly (spoken words) or more broadly (any form of communication).

### Step 5: Confirm the Classification
Re-examine the argument to confirm that the identified defective type is the most accurate.
- The confusion in the argument is due to the ambiguous use of the word "speak," as the promise was understood in a broad sense (no communication), while the speaker interprets it narrowly (no verbal communication).

### Final Classification
- **Defective Argument Type:** Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)

### Conclusion
The statement "I don’t understand why you’re saying I broke a promise. I said I’d never speak again to my ex-girlfriend. And I didn’t. I just sent her a quick text.” falls under the defective argument type of **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)** because it relies on an ambiguous interpretation of the term "speak."
