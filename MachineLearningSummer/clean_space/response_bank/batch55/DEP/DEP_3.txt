For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of IDA into specific steps) to classify the string "The nuthatch was discovered by Tilly Turnow in the woods, while hopping from branch to branch of an elm tree, singing happily." we'll break this down step by step.

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\<P\>)**  
In this case, the proposition (\<P\>) from the given string is: "The nuthatch was discovered by Tilly Turnow in the woods."

**Step 2: Analyze Reason (\<R\>)**  
For the given string, we need to analyze if there's a causal basis (\<R\>) to establish the truth of (\<P\>). Here, the sentence provides background details, but there's no explicitly stated reason that sets forth a causal basis for the discovery. It’s more of a narrative than an argument with reasoning.

**Step 3: Inspect Proof of Reason (\<PR\>)**  
Similarly, the string does not provide any additional arguments or evidence (\<PR\>) to corroborate the reason. The information about "hopping from branch to branch" and "singing happily" are descriptive but do not serve the function of (\<PR\>).

**Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Types (\<G\>, \<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<RR\>, \<WCB\>, \<FU\>, \<DEP\>)**  
Now, we classify the argument based on the defective types.

- **\<G\>: Generalization** - Not applicable here, as the sentence does not generalize a specific instance to a broader conclusion.
- **\<FE\>: Incomplete Enumeration** - Not applicable here, as the statement does not enumerate possibilities or suggest a comprehensive list of evidence.
- **\<IR\>: Inconclusive Reason** - Since there is no causal (\<R\>) to demonstrate the correctness of (\<P\>), this might superficially fit, but it is more absent than inconclusive.
- **\<RR\>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition** - Not applicable here, there is no real repetition of (\<P\>) as (\<R\>).
- **\<WCB\>: Insufficient Causal Basis** - This is not directly applicable because no (\<R\>) is attempted, which means there can't be a weak basis.
- **\<FU\>: Presumptuous Consensus** - Not applicable, as there is no attempt to use universal agreement.
- **\<DEP\>: Ambiguous Language Use** - Possible concern for ambiguous detail, but not directly fitting to categorize this sentence alone under ambiguous language.

Given the analysis, the string does not fit typical defective argument types straight away because it lacks a clear propositional structure meant to argue a point rather than simply state or describe an observation.

However, since there is an inherent lack of reasoning and proof, the defective type closest to our analysis might be **\<IR\>: Inconclusive Reason** due to the narrative form providing descriptive details rather than arguments, making its proposition logically unsupported even if not argued upon formally. But it should be noted this is not strong evidence for concluding it's defective in argumentative terms - it’s more that it's simply not an argument but rather an observation.
