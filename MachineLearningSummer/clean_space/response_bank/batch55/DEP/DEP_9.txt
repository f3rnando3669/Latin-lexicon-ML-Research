For 
To apply the method IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types), let's break down the process for the given string step by step:

1. **Extract Key Information:**
   - **String (s):** "The fallacy of equivocation occurs when a key term or phrase in an argument is used in an ambiguous way, with one meaning in one portion of the argument and then another meaning in another portion of the argument."

2. **Identify Key Components of the String:**
   - **Proposition (P) :** The fallacy of equivocation occurs when a key term or phrase in an argument is used in an ambiguous way.
   - **Reason (R) :** The key term or phrase is used with one meaning in one portion of the argument and then another meaning in another portion of the argument.

3. **Compare with Definitions of Defective Argument Types:**

   - **Generalization (G) :** Not applicable here; there is no assertion based on an incomplete observation of individuals.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE) :** Not applicable; no claim of making a complete list of possibilities is mentioned.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR) :** Not applicable; the statement does not seemingly fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB) :** Not applicable; the causal basis is not weak in context to the proposition.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR) :** Not applicable; the Reason does not restate the Proposition word for word.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU) :** Not applicable; no universal consensus is claimed.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP) :** Applicable; the fallacy of equivocation explicitly refers to ambiguity in the usage of terms.

4. **Determine the Best Fit:**
   - By the definitions provided, the case of equivocation corresponds most closely with **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**, as it illustrates the practice of using words in an argument in a way that they can be taken in another sense than the speaker initially intended.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The string "The fallacy of equivocation occurs when a key term or phrase in an argument is used in an ambiguous way, with one meaning in one portion of the argument and then another meaning in another portion of the argument." should be classified as **DEP** (Ambiguous Language Use).

By following the structured decomposition approach, we applied IDAA to unequivocally determine the classification for the provided string.
