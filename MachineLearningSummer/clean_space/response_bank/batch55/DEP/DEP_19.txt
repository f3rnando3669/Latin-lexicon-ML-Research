To apply the advanced task of classifying a given argument as a defective argument type using the framework provided, we need to break down the process into specific steps. This process is defined as <IDAA>.

Let's apply <IDAA> to the statement "Historians agree that studying the past is the best way to avoid repeating mistakes."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDAA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**
   - **Proposition (P):** "Studying the past is the best way to avoid repeating mistakes."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**
   - **Reason (R):** "Historians agree that studying the past is the best way to avoid repeating mistakes."

3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**
   - **Proof of Reason (PR):** This is implied to be the consensus among historians, but it lacks explicit additional arguments or evidence. Instead, the proof is simply the claim of universal agreement among historians.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**
   - Inspect the argument for any signs of defective argument types defined as <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Analysis:

- **Generalization (G)**: The statement does not appear to be a generalization based on a subset of individuals but is presented as a consensus.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement does not involve a complete enumeration or a list of possibilities; hence, this defect is not applicable.
  
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This could be relevant if the reason fails to conclusively demonstrate the proposition. However, the focus here is on the credibility of the consensus rather than the reasoning strength.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The reason provided is based on the consensus of historians rather than a direct causal link, which might make it insufficient.
  
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason does not merely repeat the proposition; it introduces the consensus as a reason.
  
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The statement specifically falls under this type of defective argument. The argument assumes that because historians universally agree, the proposition must be true. This is problematic because the consensus itself is used as proof without independent verification.
  
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The statement does not rely on ambiguous language that could be interpreted differently.

### Conclusion:

**Defective Argument Type:** **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**

Thus, the classification of the argument "Historians agree that studying the past is the best way to avoid repeating mistakes" falls under the defective argument type <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).
