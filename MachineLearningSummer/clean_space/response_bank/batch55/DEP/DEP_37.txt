For 
The advanced task <t> here is identifying the logical fallacy committed in the given argument string. We need to decompose <t> into specific steps and apply it to the task of classifying the string "Whatever happens by chance should be punished, because whatever happens by chance is a departure from law and all departures from law should be punished."

Let's break this down step-by-step in <D> and apply it:

### Step 1: Identify the proposition (<P>)
- **Proposition (P):** "Whatever happens by chance should be punished."

### Step 2: Identify the reason (<R>)
- **Reason (R):** "Whatever happens by chance is a departure from law and all departures from law should be punished."

### Step 3: Analyze the reason to see if it conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the proposition (<IR>)
- Analyze whether the reason provided is both necessary and sufficient to establish the proposition.

### Step 4: Check if the argument form falls into any defective argument categories
- **Generalization (<G>):** Determine if the argument is making an assertion about all instances based on limited evidence.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Check if the argument fails to consider all pertinent possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** See if the reason does not definitively establish the truth of the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Assess if the reason submitted is weak and not compelling.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Check if the reasoning is simply restating the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Identify if the argument assumes universal agreement on a disputable point.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** See if any terms used can lead to confusion or misinterpretation.

### Step 5: Apply the defective argument classification

- The argument states that "whatever happens by chance is a departure from law and all departures from law should be punished."
- The reason (<R>) equates happenings by chance with departures from law and concludes that because all departures from law should be punished, chance happenings should also be punished.

Let's analyze this further:
- The reason assumes that anything happening by chance inherently violates a law without establishing why or how it inherently does so. This causation is listed but not substantiated.
- The conclusion that all departures from law should be punished is an assertion without backing beyond a simple logical statement.

The reason provided does not necessarily demonstrate the correctness of the proposition definitively. It assumes causation without sufficient support, which is characteristic of an insufficient causal basis (<WCB>).

**Identified Defective Argument Type:** **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**

### Conclusion:
The logical fallacy in the argument "Whatever happens by chance should be punished, because whatever happens by chance is a departure from law and all departures from law should be punished." is best classified as an **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The reason given does not provide a compelling justification for the proposition.
