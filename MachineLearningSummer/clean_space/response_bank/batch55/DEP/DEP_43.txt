For 
To apply IDAA (the application of task decomposition to the identification of defective arguments) to the provided string "only man is rational; no women is man; Therefore, no women is rational," we will decompose the task of classifying the argument type step-by-step.

**Step 1: Identify the components of the argument.**
- **Proposition (P):** "Therefore, no women is rational"
- **Reason (R):** "only man is rational" and "no women is man"

**Step 2: Analyze the reasoning (R) and the proposition (P).**
- Reason 1: "only man is rational" (implies that rationality is exclusive to men)
- Reason 2: "no women is man" (states that women do not belong to the category of men)

**Step 3: Determine if the argument presented shows any signs of the defective arguments described.**
- Generalization (<G>): This doesn't apply here as the argument isn't making a broad assertion based on an incomplete sample.
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>): This doesn't apply here as the argument isn't enumerating possibilities.
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>): This should be considered. The reasons only show that 'only men are rational' and 'women are not men,' but do they conclusively lead to 'no women is rational'? 
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>): Relevant, because the leap from the premises to the conclusion should be scrutinized.
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>): This doesn’t directly rephrase the proposition within the reasoning.
- Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>): The argument doesn’t rely on a presumed universal agreement.
- Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>): There is no prominent ambiguity or multiple interpretations of the language presented.

**Step 4: Evaluate the relationship between <R> and <P>.**
- To prove "no women is rational" based on the given premises: 
  - Reason 1: "only man is rational" suggests exclusivity but is often logically interpreted as "if someone is rational, then they are a man."
  - Reason 2: "no women is man" formally excludes women from the group called 'men.'

The reasoning chain leads to the conclusion, but one must evaluate its conclusiveness:
- It directly combines exclusivity and category exclusion: (If rational, then man) + (Women are not men) → (No women are rational).

**Step 5: Conclude if the argument is defective based on the given analysis scheme.**
- The premises lead to the conclusion, but their logical rigor shows that the conclusion depends entirely on accepting the exclusivity virtually without further context or proof. More scrutinizing suggests an inconclusive leap because:
  - The exclusivity might be challenged (e.g., definitions of rationality, categorizations).
  - Furthermore, without deeper proofing, if the logical form <PR> is questioned, it suggests IR or WCB.

So, the final classification step leads us to:
- The argument doesn't conclusively prove its conclusion in an absolute logical sense. Still, it follows formal logic but lacks scrutiny about its foundational premises.

**Final Classification:**
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>),** because while it follows formal steps, the certitude is under question.
- Possibly **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**, due to exclusivity challenge.

Thus, officially:

**Type: <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**

The analysis under IDAA, step by step, points most conclusively to the defect of Inconclusive Reason.
