For 
To decompose and classify the argument given in the statement "Professor, you have to give me an A on this paper..." we'll follow the steps of <IDAA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition <P>**:
   - The central statement that the speaker wants to prove.
   - Here, <P> is: "You have to give me an A on this paper."

2. **Identify the Reason <R>**:
   - The causal basis or reasons that establish the truth of the proposition.
   - The speaker provides several reasons:
     - "I only turned in a sentence and some clip art because..."
     - "my grandmother suddenly died while traveling in the Northern Yukon..."
     - "I had to travel for her funeral..."
     - "my parents got divorced in the middle of the ceremony..."
     - "all the stress caused me to become catatonic for two weeks..."
     - "my grandmother's last wish was that I'd get an A in this class."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason <PR>**:
   - Additional arguments that corroborate the briefly presented Reason.
   - The speaker relies on emotional and situational contexts to support their claims.

Now, let's classify the argument based on defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: 
   - Not applicable since no broad assertion about a group is being made.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: 
   - Not applicable since there is no claim of having enumerated all possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: 
   - The reasons provided (death in the family, divorce, stress) do not conclusively demonstrate why the professor must give an A. They indicate why the paper was incomplete but do not justify the grade directly.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: 
   - The reasons provided are based on situational hardships and emotional appeal. They do not form a compelling causal basis for why an A should be given.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: 
   - Not applicable as the reasons given are not merely a repetition of the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: 
   - Not applicable since there is no assertion of universal agreement as evidence.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: 
   - Not applicable as the language itself is not ambiguous; the reasons are clear.

Based on the analysis, the primary defects in the argument are:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasons given do not conclusively demonstrate that the speaker deserves an A.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reasons rely on emotional appeal and personal hardships rather than a compelling rationale directly linking to the necessity of an A grade.

Thus, the statement can be classified as exhibiting the defects <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
