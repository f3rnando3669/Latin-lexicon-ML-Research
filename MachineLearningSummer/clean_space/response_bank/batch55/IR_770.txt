For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string, we need to decompose the task of classifying the string as one of the defective argument types into specific steps. Here's how we can break down the process:

### Step 1: Identify and Understand the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>)

Identify the proposition and reason parts in the string.

- **Proposition (<P>)**: The initial assertion.
  - "President Trump said that he was proud of the children who participated in this year's Special Olympics."

- **Reason (<R>)**: The causal basis or reason provided for the proposition.
  - "Those kids are a bunch of losers."

### Step 2: Analyze the Logical Structure

Understand the logical structure and coherence of the argument.

- **Logical Structure**: The argument presents a positive statement followed by a negative statement, which are logically inconsistent.

### Step 3: Evaluate for Defective Argument Types

Evaluate the argument against each defective argument type to determine the classification.

- **Generalization (G)**: The argument contains no evidence of an inappropriate generalization. It does not apply a characteristic of one part to the whole.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not claim completeness in listing possibilities.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided ("Those kids are a bunch of losers") does not logically support or demonstrate the correctness of the proposition ("President Trump said that he was proud of the children who participated in this year's Special Olympics").

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The reason given does not provide a compelling causal basis for the proposition.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason does not simply repeat the proposition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument does not rely on assumed universal agreement.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The argument does not use ambiguous language directly but contains logically conflicting statements.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument

Based on the evaluation:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason "Those kids are a bunch of losers" does not support or logically substantiate the proposition about being proud of the children. This is an example of IR.
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The reason given does not provide a strong or compelling basis related to the proposition stated initially.

### Final Classification:

Given the evaluations, the primary classification for the defective argument type is **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. The secondary, less severe classification can be **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

Thus, the string should be classified under **IR** with a consideration of **WCB**.
