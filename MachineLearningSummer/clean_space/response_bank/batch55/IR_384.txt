To apply the IDAA (application of decomposition to the task of classifying a string as a defective argument type) to the given string, we need to follow a systematic approach in order to classify the argument. Here are the steps of the decomposition:

### Step 1: Understand <s> Fully
First, interpret the string to understand the complete meaning of the argument.
**String \( s \): "If you hadn't vandalized that car, don't you think things would have gone better for you?"**

### Step 2: Parse and Identify Components
Determine if the string has components of a Proposition (P), Reason (R), or Proof of Reason (PR).

- **Proposition (P)**: The core statement or claim being made. In this case, the implicit claim seems to be "Things would have gone better for you."
- **Reason (R)**: The causal basis for the proposition. Here, the reason given is "If you hadn't vandalized that car."
- **Proof of Reason (PR)**: Corroboration of the reason, which is not explicitly provided in the string.

### Step 3: Identify the Type of Defective Argument
Compare the components we identified against the definitions of defective arguments.

1. **Generalization (G)**: The proposition is based on a part or majority but not applicable to all. 
   - Not applicable here.
  
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Claiming a complete enumeration of possibilities but missing some.
   - Not applicable here.
  
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition.
   - Here, the connection between not vandalizing the car and things going better is not definitively established. The statement assumes a direct causal relationship without fully proving it.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Weak causal basis for the proposition.
   - The reason given ("If you hadn't vandalized that car") is somewhat weak and assumes a direct linear improvement in outcomes, which may not necessarily be compelling.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Reason is essentially just a repetition of the proposition.
   - Not applicable here as the reason given is distinct from the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assuming a thing is universally agreed upon while still in dispute.
   - Not applicable. There's no universal agreement being asserted here.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Reason or Proof of Reason can be taken in another sense.
   - Not applicable. The language is clear about the cause and effect intended.

### Step 4: Determine the Most Appropriate Defective Argument Type
Based on the identified defective argument types:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** both seem potentially relevant. There's a weak causal basis (things might not have gone better purely because of the absence of vandalism), and the reasoning doesn't conclusively establish the proposition.

### Conclusion
In applying IDAA to the string:
"If you hadn't vandalized that car, don't you think things would have gone better for you?"

The argument can be categorized as both **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The causal connection is not conclusively demonstrated and the basis for that causal connection is weak.
