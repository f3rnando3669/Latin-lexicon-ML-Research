Sure, let's apply the decomposition method, <D>, to the task of classifying the given string, which is <IDA>.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Find the summarizing statement that sets forth what is intended to be proven.
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine the causal or supporting basis provided to establish the truth of the Proposition.
   
3. **Identify Additional Proof or Corroboration (<PR>):**
   - Check if there are additional arguments presented to support the Reason.
   
4. **Evaluate for Defective Argument Types:**
   - Apply the definitions of each defective argument type (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) to classify the defective aspects, if any, in the argument.

### Apply Decomposition Steps to the Statement:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- The proposition in the statement is: "All Math classes must be hard."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- The reason given is: "My cousin said her Math class was hard. The one that I’m in is hard too."

#### Step 3: Identify Additional Proof or Corroboration (<PR>)
- In this case, the Reason provided does not include additional proofs or corroborations beyond the personal and anecdotal instances.

#### Step 4: Evaluate for Defective Argument Types
- Let's assess the argument against each defective argument type definition:

  - **Generalization (<G>):** 
    - The Proposition "All Math classes must be hard" is a generalization based on a limited observation: two instances of Math classes being hard (cousin's class and the speaker's class).
    - This fits the definition of <G> where an assertion based on some small part or majority is applied to all.

  - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
    - The statement does not list all possibilities but focuses on only two instances to claim a complete nature of difficulty.
    - It is possible to also consider this an incomplete enumeration since other Math classes might differ in difficulty.

  - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
    - The Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition because two instances are insufficient to conclude about "all" Math classes.
    
  - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
    - The causal basis (two individual experiences) is not strong enough to support the universal claim made in the Proposition.
    
  - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
    - The Reason is not merely a repetition of the Proposition; hence this does not apply.
    
  - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
    - The argument does not assume universal agreement; thus, this does not apply.
    
  - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
    - The language is clear and not ambiguous, so this does not apply.

### Conclusion:
The most fitting defective argument type based on the detailed step-by-step decomposition is **Generalization (<G>)**. The argument incorrectly generalizes from a small sample size (two personal experiences) to a broad conclusion (all Math classes are hard).

Therefore, the statement "My cousin said her Math class was hard. The one that I’m in is hard too. All Math classes must be hard." is an example of **Generalization (<G>)**.
