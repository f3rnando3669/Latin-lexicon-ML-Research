For 
To apply the process of <IDAA> (the application of decomposition of an advanced task into specific steps) to the classification task <IDA> (classifying the string "The milk was left out all night and was spoiled. It should have been put in the refrigerator"), we need to break down the task into manageable steps and systematically analyze the given statement.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Start by identifying the main claim or statement that is intended to be proved.
   - In this case, "It should have been put in the refrigerator" is the proposition.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine the causal basis provided to support the proposition.
   - Here, the reason given is "The milk was left out all night and was spoiled."

3. **Determine if the Reason Supports the Proposition:**
   - Check if the reason provided establishes a logical basis for the proposition.
   - Spoiled milk as a result of being left out suggests that refrigeration could have prevented spoilage.

4. **Examine for Defective Argument Types:**
   - Evaluate whether the argument fits into any of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>.

### Application of Defective Argument Types:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - Check if the argument is making a broad generalization from a specific instance.
   - This does not seem to be a generalization, as the argument is about a specific instance of milk spoilage.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Determine if all relevant possibilities have been considered.
   - The statement does not enumerate other possibilities but focuses on the act of refrigeration preventing spoilage.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Assess whether the reason fails to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
   - The reason provided seems sufficient (left out all night -> spoiled) to support the proposition (should have been refrigerated).

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - Check if the reason and proposition are tautological or repetitive.
   - The reason is not merely a repetition of the proposition; it's a causal statement leading to a conclusion.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Evaluate if the causal basis for the reason is weak or not compelling.
   - Given common knowledge about milk spoilage, the causal basis (left out all night leading to spoilage) is compelling.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - Determine if the proof of reason relies solely on presumed universal agreement.
   - The argument does not rely on an assumed consensus, but on a reasonable causal connection.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - Examine if any part of the argument uses ambiguous terms that could be misinterpreted.
   - The language in the statement is clear and unambiguous.

### Conclusion:

The argument "The milk was left out all night and was spoiled. It should have been put in the refrigerator" does not appear to fall into any of the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>. This indicates that it is likely a valid argument with a clear proposition supported by a causally sound reason.

### Final Classification:

The given statement does not classify into any defective argument types listed. Therefore, it is a valid argument with respect to the definitions provided.
