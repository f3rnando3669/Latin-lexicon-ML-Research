To apply the decomposition of the advanced task (IDAA) to classify the provided string, "Saying that a compromise between two extremes is the truth," as one of the defective argument types, let's break it down step by step systematically.

1. **Identify and Understand the Advanced Task (IDA):**
   - IDA is the task of classifying a given string (in this case, the argument "Saying that a compromise between two extremes is the truth") as one of the defined defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>).

2. **Decompose the Advanced Task (D):**
   - To decompose the task of IDA, break it into specific steps:
     1. **Understand the Argument:** Comprehend the string to be classified.
     2. **Analyze the Proposition (<P>):** Identify the central assertion or proposition.
     3. **Analyze the Reason (<R>):** Determine the causal basis given for the proposition.
     4. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Check if there's corroboration for the reasons.
     5. **Match Against Defective Arguments:** Compare the identified elements against each defective argument type to make the classification.

3. **Apply the Decomposition (IDAA) to the Given String:**
   - **Step 1: Understand the Argument**
     - The argument claims that a compromise between two extremes is the truth.
   
   - **Step 2: Analyze the Proposition (<P>)**
     - Proposition: "A compromise between two extremes is the truth."
   
   - **Step 3: Analyze the Reason (<R>)**
     - The reason is implicitly based on the assumption that truth is always found in moderation or a middle ground, but this reason is not explicitly stated.
   
   - **Step 4: Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**
     - No additional proof or argument is presented to support the reason.

   - **Step 5: Match Against Defective Arguments**

     - **<G> Generalization:** The proposition is not based on a sample or an incomplete set, so this doesn't apply.

     - **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:** The string does not enumerate possibilities or claim completeness in enumeration.

     - **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** The assumed reason (that compromise is inherently truthful) does not conclusively demonstrate that a compromise is always the truth. The middle ground may not always be the correct or truthful position.

     - **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** The reason doesn't restate the proposition in different words.

     - **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** The causal basis (that middle ground is truth) is weak as it isn't a compelling one universally and doesn't consider context-specific truths.

     - **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** The argument does not assume a universal agreement on the compromise being the truth.

     - **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:** The string's language is clear and isn't ambiguous in its intended sense.

  **Decision:**
  - The classification must be <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) or <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
  - Since the argument doesn’t conclusively demonstrate that compromise is always the truth based on the given reason, and the causal basis isn't compelling enough without supporting arguments or context, the proper classification would be: **<IR> – Inconclusive Reason**.

Thus, by breaking the task into systematic steps, the given argument "Saying that a compromise between two extremes is the truth" is classified as an **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**.
