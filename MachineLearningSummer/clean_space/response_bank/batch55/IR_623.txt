For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of the decomposition of the task into specific steps) to classify the given string according to the defective argument types defined, let's break it down step-by-step.

1. **Identify the proposition <P> in the sentence:**
   Tim's assertion is essentially: "Bill should be fired and not me."
   
   So, our proposition <P> is: "Bill should be fired and not me."

2. **Identify the reason <R> given for the proposition:**
   Tim's reason seems to imply that Bill is guilty of creating a lie: "Bill is going to come to you with some pathetic attempt to weasel out of this lie that he has created."
   
   Therefore, our reason <R> is: "Bill is going to come to you with some pathetic attempt to weasel out of this lie that he has created."

3. **Examine <R> for defects:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** Is there an overgeneralization? Not really; Tim is focusing on specific individuals (Bill).
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Is Tim failing to consider all possibilities? There isn't an explicit enumeration that seems incomplete.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Does this reason conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition? The reason given describes an anticipated action by Bill but does not necessarily conclusively prove that Bill should be fired rather than Tim.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Is the causal basis submitted for the proposition compelling? The reason does not establish a strong causal link; it is more about what Tim expects Bill to do.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Is the reason essentially the same as the proposition? No, the reason is a predictive statement about Bill's actions, not a mere repetition of the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Is the proof assumed to be certain based on perceived universal agreement? No, there isn't any mention of universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Can the proof be taken another way than intended? The language might not be ambiguous enough to fit this defect.

4. **Determine the defective argument type:**
   The most fitting defect here appears to be <IR> (Inconclusive Reason). The reason given by Tim is predictive and not definitively conclusive evidence that Bill should be fired instead of Tim.

Therefore, applying <IDAA>, the classification of the given string "Tim: Boss, you heard my side of the story why I think Bill should be fired and not me. Now, I am sure Bill is going to come to you with some pathetic attempt to weasel out of this lie that he has created."
is of type <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
