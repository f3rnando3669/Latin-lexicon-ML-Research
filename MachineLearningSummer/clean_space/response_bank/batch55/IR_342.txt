For 
To apply the process <IDAA> to the given statement "Latin should not be taught in school since it is not spoken anywhere in the world. All learning should have some use to be of value, and a dead language has no practical use.", we need to follow a step-by-step approach to decompose and then classify the argument using the specified defect types.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**
- Look for the main assertion or thesis being presented.

**Step 2: Locate the Reason (R)**
- Identify the causal basis for the proposition. This is the rationale explaining why the proposition is true.

**Step 3: Find the Proof of Reason (PR)**
- Look for any additional arguments that are used to support the reason.

**Step 4: Analyze for Defective Argument Types**
- Compare the identified parts (P, R, PR) with the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP).

### Analysis

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**
- Proposition: "Latin should not be taught in school."

**Step 2: Locate the Reason (R)**
- Reason: "since it is not spoken anywhere in the world."

**Step 3: Find the Proof of Reason (PR)**
- Proof of Reason: "All learning should have some use to be of value, and a dead language has no practical use."

**Step 4: Analyze for Defective Argument Types**
   
- **Generalization (G):** 
  Not applicable here, since the argument is not making a broad assertion based on a small sample.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
  Not applicable here, as this argument is not about enumerating possibilities or scenarios.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
  Potentially applicable. The reason "since it is not spoken anywhere in the world" does not conclusively demonstrate why Latin should not be taught. It assumes that utility in a modern spoken context is the only criteria without addressing broader educational or historical values.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
  Also potentially applicable. The causal basis that Latin is not spoken does not compellingly support the proposition that it should not be taught. It overlooks other potential benefits of learning Latin such as understanding of linguistics, history, and classical literature.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
  Not applicable here since the reason is not a direct repetition of the proposition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
  There doesn't appear to be an assumption of universal agreement here.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
  Not applicable. The language used is quite clear and not prone to different interpretations.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis:
- The argument could fall under **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the reason given ("not spoken anywhere") does not fully establish why teaching Latin is without value.
- It could also be categorized as **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** since the causal basis is weak and does not comprehensively justify the proposition.

Thus, the classification of the given string "Latin should not be taught in school since it is not spoken anywhere in the world. All learning should have some use to be of value, and a dead language has no practical use." would be primarily **<IR>** and secondarily **<WCB>**.
