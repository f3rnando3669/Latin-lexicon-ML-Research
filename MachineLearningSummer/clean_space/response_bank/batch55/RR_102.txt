To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task IDA into specific steps) for classifying the given string, we'll break down the process systematically:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify and Understand the Argument:**
   - Read the given string and identify the structure of the argument.
   - Determine the Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), and Proof of Reason (<PR>) if they are present.

2. **Classify the Parts of the Argument:**
   - Check if the identified parts fit into any known defective argument types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

3. **Analyze the Argument for Defects:**
   - Compare the argument parts to the definitions of defective argument types.
   - Classify the argument based on observed defects.

### Analysis and Classification:

1. **Step 1: Identify and Understand the Argument:**
   - **String:**
     - "My way of responding to difficult patients is by far the most ethical because no other way is so ethical and it is the only way that is completely ethical."

   - **Identify <P> (Proposition):**
     - "My way of responding to difficult patients is by far the most ethical."

   - **Identify <R> (Reason):**
     - "Because no other way is so ethical and it is the only way that is completely ethical."

2. **Step 2: Classify the Parts of the Argument:**
   - Examine the Reason:
     - "Because no other way is so ethical and it is the only way that is completely ethical."
       - The Reason seems to restate the Proposition using slightly varied wording but does not provide a new foundation or causal basis.

3. **Step 3: Analyze the Argument for Defects:**
   - Comparing the Reason to Defective Argument Definitions:
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
       - <RR>: A Reason (<R>) is weak when it appears to be presented as the Reason but says precisely the same as was said in the Proposition (<P>).
       - In this string, the Reason essentially repeats the Proposition:
         - Proposition: "My way is the most ethical."
         - Reason: "No other way is as ethical, and it is the only completely ethical way."
       - The Reason fails to provide new justification or evidence and merely restates the Proposition.

### Conclusion:
The argument provided can be classified as a **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** because the Reason given for the Proposition does not add any new information or rationale but instead repeats the Proposition in a slightly altered form.

So the string "My way of responding to difficult patients is by far the most ethical because no other way is so ethical and it is the only way that is completely ethical." is classified as <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
