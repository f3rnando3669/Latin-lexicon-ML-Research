For 
To apply IDAA to the string "Sleeping until noon is the worst thing to do because it is bad to sleep late," we will decompose the task of classifying the string (IDA) into specific steps (D).

### Decomposition of IDA (D):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine the assertion being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Identify the causal basis given for the Proposition.
3. **Examine the Proof of Reason (PR)**: If present, identify any corroborating arguments for the Reason.
4. **Classify the String**: Based on the given definitions of defective arguments, classify the string as one of the types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

Now, let's apply these steps to our string.

### 1. Identify the Proposition (P)
The proposition is the primary assertion being made in the string. In this case:
- **Proposition (P)**: "Sleeping until noon is the worst thing to do."

### 2. Identify the Reason (R)
Next, identify the reason given to support the proposition:
- **Reason (R)**: "because it is bad to sleep late."

### 3. Examine the Proof of Reason (PR)
Check if there are any additional arguments or evidence used to corroborate the reason. In this string, there doesn't seem to be any explicit Proof of Reason provided, so we can skip this step.

### 4. Classify the String
Now, we will classify the string using the definitions of defective arguments:

- **Generalization (G)**: The string does not make a generalization based on a part or majority and apply it to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The string does not claim to have made a complete enumeration of possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason "because it is bad to sleep late" does not conclusively demonstrate why "sleeping until noon is the worst thing to do." It merely restates the opinion.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis provided ("it is bad to sleep late") could be seen as insufficient or subjective, not making a compelling argument.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason (R) "because it is bad to sleep late" restates the proposition (P) "Sleeping until noon is the worst thing to do" in different words without adding new information.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The string does not appeal to a presumed universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language in the string is not ambiguous in a way that might be interpreted differently than intended.

Based on the classifications:
- The reason (R) "it is bad to sleep late" is essentially a repetition of the proposition (P) "Sleeping until noon is the worst thing to do," which makes it fit the category of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**.

### Conclusion
Applying IDAA, we classify the string "Sleeping until noon is the worst thing to do because it is bad to sleep late" as an argument with a **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**.
