Sure, let's perform the task of applying the decomposition (IDAA) to the classification task (IDA) for the argument:

"If you believe that I am wrong, prove to me that I am."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) for the Classification Task IDA
The first step is to understand the structure and content of the argument and then classify it according to the provided defective argument types.

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
A proposition is a statement or an assertion that we intend to prove.
- **Extracted Proposition (P)**: "I am not wrong."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason provides a causal basis or justification for the proposition.
- **Extracted Reason (R)**: The reason is implied rather than explicitly stated. It prompts the other person to prove them wrong, suggesting confidence in the original assertion.

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
A proof of reason corroborates the reason.
- **Extracted Proof of Reason (PR)**: This is not provided in the given string.

Given these steps, we see that the structure of the argument is somewhat lacking.

### Classifying the Defective Argument
Now, let's determine which type of defective argument this is:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This involves a proposition based on a non-exhaustive sample being generalized to all cases. The argument does not seem to make such a generalization.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This involves claiming to have listed all possibilities while missing some. Since the argument does not enumerate possibilities, this doesn't fit.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Inconclusiveness of the reason in demonstrating the proposition. Let's consider this further.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The reason does not provide a compelling basis. This seems quite relevant since the challenge to "prove me wrong" doesn't provide robust reasoning itself.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This involves the reason simply repeating the proposition without adding substance. The statement here doesn't do this, it challenges but does not repeat.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This involves assuming a universal agreement on something in dispute. Not applicable here.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Involves ambiguity in the proof of reason. The argument is straightforward without ambiguity.

Upon close analysis, the string seems to most closely align with:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided, "prove to me that I am," does not logically or conclusively establish the truth of the proposition "I am not wrong."

### Conclusion
The argument "If you believe that I am wrong, prove to me that I am." is best classified under **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. The reasoning provided does not conclusively establish the correctness of the proposition.
