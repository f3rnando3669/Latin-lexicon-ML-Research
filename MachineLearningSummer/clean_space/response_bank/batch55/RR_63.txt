For 
To apply the task of <IDAA> to classify the given string "Circular reasoning occurs when someone makes an argument in which both the premises and the conclusion have to rely on the truthfulness of the other," we will follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for <IDAA>:

1. **Identify the Argument Type:**
   - Determine whether the string is presenting a defective argument type and then attempt to classify it correctly.

2. **Check Each Defective Argument Type:**

   a. **Generalization (<G>)**
      - Does the string make an assertion based on one part or a majority but not necessarily applicable to all? 
      - No, the definition of circular reasoning does not appear to generalize from a part to a whole.

   b. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
      - Does the string claim a complete enumeration of possibilities while missing pertinent ones?
      - No, the string does not enumerate possibilities but rather defines a type of reasoning.

   c. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
      - Does the Reason provided fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition?
      - The string is not arguing for a Proposition but defining circular reasoning.

   d. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
      - Is the causal basis submitted for the Proposition not compelling?
      - Again, this string is defining circular reasoning, not establishing an argument requiring a causal basis.

   e. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**
      - Does the Reason appear to restate the Proposition rather than providing a new supporting argument?
      - Yes, by suggesting that the premises and conclusions support each other, this could be restating the same idea without adding new supporting information. This matches the characteristics of <RR>.

   f. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
      - Is the Proof of Reason assumed certain on the ground of universal agreement, where the matter is still in dispute?
      - No, the string does not rest on the assumption of universal agreement.

   g. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**
      - Can the Proof of Reason be taken in another sense than the speaker intended?
      - The definition does not seem ambiguous. It consistently refers to the mutual reliance of premises and conclusions in circular reasoning.

3. **Determine the Most Appropriate Classification:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most fitting defective argument type is <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition). Circular reasoning involves using premises and conclusions that reiterate each other without adding substantively new information.

### Conclusion:
The string "Circular reasoning occurs when someone makes an argument in which both the premises and the conclusion have to rely on the truthfulness of the other." can be classified as type <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition) within the context of this defective argument identification task.
