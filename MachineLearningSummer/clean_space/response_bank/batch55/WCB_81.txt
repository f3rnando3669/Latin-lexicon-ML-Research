For 
To apply IDAA to the string "It’s cold on a summer day. Global warming is a hoax," we will decompose the task of classifying the string into specific steps and follow them methodically. 

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the parts of the argument.** 
    - Proposition (<P>): What is the assertion or claim being made?
    - Reason (<R>): What is the reasoning given to support the proposition?
    - Proof of Reason (<PR>): Are there additional corroborating arguments?

2. **Analyze for each type of defective argument.**
    - Generalization (<G>)
    - Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
    - Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
    - Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
    - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
    - Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
    - Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)

### Step 1: Identifying the Parts of the Argument

- **Proposition (<P>)**: "Global warming is a hoax."
- **Reason (<R>)**: "It’s cold on a summer day."

There doesn't appear to be an explicit Proof of Reason (<PR>) presented beyond the stated reason.

### Step 2: Analyzing for Each Type of Defective Argument

#### Generalization (<G>):
- The argument takes a single observation (cold on a summer day) and generalizes it to the broad conclusion that "global warming is a hoax."
- This fits the definition: "the <P> is an assertion based on some one part or on a majority of individuals, but not necessarily applicable to all, is referred to all."

#### Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):
- The argument does not attempt to enumerate possibilities or cases leading to the conclusion; therefore, it doesn't fit this type.

#### Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):
- The reasoning (cold on a summer day) does not conclusively prove the proposition (global warming is a hoax). This aligns with the definition: "<R> does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the <P>."

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):
- The causal connection presented (one cold day to the overall hoax of global warming) is weak and not compelling.
- This fits the definition of "<R> is weak if the causal basis which it submits for the <P> is not a compelling one."

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):
- The reason does not repeat the proposition, so it doesn't fit this type.

#### Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):
- This type involves assuming a proof of reason based on presumed universal agreement, which is not seen here.

#### Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):
- The language used ("It’s cold on a summer day") can be interpreted straightforwardly and isn't ambiguous.

### Conclusion

By decomposing and following each step, we find:

- The argument fits the types <G> (Generalization), <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).

Therefore, "It’s cold on a summer day. Global warming is a hoax." can be classified as containing defective arguments of types: **<G>, <IR>, and <WCB>**.
