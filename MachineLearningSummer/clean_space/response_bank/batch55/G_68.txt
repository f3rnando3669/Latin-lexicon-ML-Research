For 
To apply \( IDAA \) to the string "If we legalize marijuana, then more people will try heroin," we need to decompose the task of classifying the defective argument into specific steps and follow them systematically. 

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\( P \))
The proposition is a statement that is set forth to be proved. In the provided string, the proposition is:
- \( P \): "More people will try heroin."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\( R \))
The reason sets forth the causal basis for the proposition. In the provided string, the reason is:
- \( R \): "If we legalize marijuana."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Argument Structure and Identify Defective Reasoning
Given the proposition (\( P \)) and the reason (\( R \)), we need to classify the defective argument type. Let's consider each possible classification:

#### a) Generalization (\( G \)):
This does not fit here. The argument does not generalize from a part or majority to a whole.

#### b) Incomplete Enumeration (\( FE \)):
This does not fit here. The argument is not about enumerating possibilities.

#### c) Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \)):
The reason provided ("If we legalize marijuana") does not conclusively demonstrate why "more people will try heroin." The connection is not adequately justified; hence it lacks a conclusive causal relationship.

#### d) Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \)):
Similar to IR, the causal basis submitted for \( P \) is weak and not compelling. The reason does not provide sufficient evidence to establish the proposition conclusively. 

#### e) Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( RR \)):
This does not fit here. The reason does not merely repeat the proposition in another form.

#### f) Presumptuous Consensus (\( FU \)):
This does not fit here. The argument does not rely on an assumed consensus.

#### g) Ambiguous Language Use (\( DEP \)):
This does not fit here. The language used here is not ambiguous in a way that changes the meaning.

### Step 4: Classification Conclusion
Given the above evaluations, the argument most closely fits the definition of \( IR \) and \( WCB \):
- \( IR \): The reason given does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- \( WCB \): The causal basis provided is weak and not compelling.

### Final Step: Select the Most Appropriate Defective Argument Type
Upon further consideration, \( WCB \) seems to be the most precise classification:
- \( WCB \): The assumption that legalizing marijuana will lead to more heroin use lacks a compelling causal basis.

### Conclusion
Therefore, the classification of the given string "If we legalize marijuana, then more people will try heroin" is \( WCB \) (Insufficient Causal Basis).
