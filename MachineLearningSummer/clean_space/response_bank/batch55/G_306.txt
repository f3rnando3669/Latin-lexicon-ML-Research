For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "1 = a number; 2 = a number; therefore 1 = 2," we need to follow the decomposition of the task into specific steps to classify the argument. Here's how we can approach it:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition is the statement of what we intend to prove. 

- In this case, the proposition is: "1 = 2."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason sets forth the causal basis for <P>.

- The reason given here is composed of the premises: "1 = a number" and "2 = a number."

### Step 3: Check for the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
The proof of reason corroborates the reason through additional arguments.

- There is no additional argument provided here. The proof is merely the premises stated.

### Step 4: Determine Defective Argument Type
Now we analyze the argument to classify it as one of the defective argument types:
  
#### Substep 4.1: Check for Generalization (<G>)
- Is the proposition an assertion based on some one part or on a majority of individuals, but not necessarily applicable to all?
    - No, this string is not a generalization.

#### Substep 4.2: Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- Is the proposition defective because of missing out on some pertinent possibilities claiming to have made complete enumeration?
    - No, this enumeration issue does not apply here.

#### Substep 4.3: Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- Does the reason conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
    - Clearly no. The premises "1 = a number" and "2 = a number" do not logically conclude that "1 = 2."

#### Substep 4.4: Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
- Is the reason merely repeating the proposition without providing additional support?
    - No, the reason is not a repetition of the proposition.

#### Substep 4.5: Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- Is the causal basis of the reason not compelling enough to support the proposition?
    - Arguably, yes. The reason "1 = a number" and "2 = a number" is insufficient to support the conclusion that "1 = 2."

#### Substep 4.6: Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
- Is the proof of reason assumed as certain based on a supposed universal agreement?
    - No, there's no mention of consensus or universal agreement here.

#### Substep 4.7: Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)
- Could the proof of reason be taken in another sense than the speaker intended?
    - Ambiguity doesn't seem to be the issue in this case.

### Conclusion
Based on the steps taken, the most fitting classification for the argument "1 = a number; 2 = a number; therefore 1 = 2," would be: 

**<IR>: Inconclusive Reason**

The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
