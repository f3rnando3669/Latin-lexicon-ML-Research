For 
Let's apply the <IDAA> method to the task of classifying the string "You didn't do your homework, did you?" as one of the defective argument types:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

#### Step 1: Understand the Task <IDA>
The task <IDA> requires us to classify a given string as one of the types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

#### Step 2: Analyze the String <s>
Examine the string: "You didn't do your homework, did you?"

This string is a statement followed by a tag question. It implies an assertion and seeks confirmation or any rebuttal to this assertion.

#### Step 3: Evaluate Against Each Defective Argument Type
We need to consider the definition of each defective argument type and determine if the string "You didn't do your homework, did you?" fits any of them.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: 
   - This type involves making an assertion about a whole group based on a part. 
   - The given string is not generalizing; it is focusing on a specific instance.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: 
   - This type involves claiming a complete list but actually omitting some possibilities.
   - The string does not imply a list of possibilities or any enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: 
   - This type means that the reason provided does not conclusively support the proposition. 
   - The string does not provide a reason but rather makes an assertion with a request for confirmation.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: 
   - This type occurs when the causal basis for a proposition is weak or unconvincing.
   - The string lacks any discussion of cause or basis related to the assertion.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: 
   - This type is when the reason repeats the proposition without providing a new basis.
   - The string does not offer a supporting reason that repeats the initial assertion.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: 
   - This type means assuming something as true based on an assumed universal agreement.
   - The string does not appeal to any consensus or assumed universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: 
   - This type involves ambiguous language that can be taken in another sense than intended.
   - The string is quite clear in its assertion and is not an ambiguous statement.

#### Step 4: Arrive at the Conclusion

Based on the decomposed analysis, the string "You didn't do your homework, did you?" does not match any of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) as it stands. It is a simple assertion seeking confirmation, and it does not show any specific defect in argument logic as defined.

### Conclusion:
The string "You didn't do your homework, did you?" is not an example of any defective argument type as defined (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).
