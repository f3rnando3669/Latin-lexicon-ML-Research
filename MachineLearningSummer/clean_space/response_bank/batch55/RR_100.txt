For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "I am a great leader because I make great leadership decisions. The proof that I make great leadership decisions is that I am a great leader, and that's what leaders do," we will decompose the task of classifying the string <IDA> into the steps necessary to identify the type of defective argument it contains:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <D> for <IDA> (IDAA):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
    - **<P>:** "I am a great leader."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
    - **<R>:** "I make great leadership decisions."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
    - **<PR>:** "The proof that I make great leadership decisions is that I am a great leader, and that's what leaders do."

### Classification (IDA):
Now examine <P>, <R>, and <PR> to determine which defective argument type(s) apply:

4. **Check for Generalization (G)**:
    - Not applicable here, as the argument does not seem to generalize based on some part or majority of individuals but rather makes a circular claim.

5. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
    - Not applicable here, as there is no enumeration of possibilities.

6. **Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
    - <R> tries to support <P>, but to determine if <R> inconclusively supports <P>, we must check other argument flaws more strongly reflected in the structure.

7. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
    - Not strongly applicable here unless we argue the causal relationship is weak. However, a more serious flaw is apparent.

8. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
    - **Applicable.** The reason <R> ("I make great leadership decisions") is essentially the same as the proposition <P> ("I am a great leader"), with different phrasing. Furthermore, the proof of reason <PR> ("The proof that I make great leadership decisions is that I am a great leader, and that's what leaders do") restates the proposition without providing independent evidence.

9. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
    - Not applicable here, as there is no appeal to universal agreement.

10. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
    - Not primarily applicable here since the argument doesn't hinge on ambiguous language but on circular reasoning.

### Conclusion:
The defective argument type is:
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**

This argument is a clear case of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** where the reason provided does not introduce new information but merely restates the proposition in different words, leading to circular reasoning.
