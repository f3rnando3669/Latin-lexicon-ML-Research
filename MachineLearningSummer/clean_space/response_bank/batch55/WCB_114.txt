To apply the IDAA (application of D to IDA) to the given string, we need to decompose the advanced task (IDA: classifying the string into one of the defective argument types) into specific steps (D). Let's break it down.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Extract the Proposition <P>**:
   Identify the main claim or proposition in the argument.
   
2. **Identify the Reason <R>**:
   Identify the causal basis or reason given to support the proposition.
   
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason <PR>**:
   Look for any additional arguments or evidences that are provided to corroborate the reason.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type <IDA>**:
   Determine which of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) the argument falls into based on the proposition, reason, and proof of reason.

### Application to the Given String:

1. **Extract the Proposition <P>**:
   - The proposition in the string is: "Anthony is responsible for Marie being hit by a bus."

2. **Identify the Reason <R>**:
   - The reason given is: "Anthony made a comment during the fight that he wished Marie would get hit by a bus."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason <PR>**:
   - In this context, there is no additional proof provided to support the reason. Anthony's assumption serves as an immediate conclusion rather than a well-supported proof.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type <IDA>**:
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason Anthony provides does not conclusively demonstrate that his comment caused Marie to get hit by a bus.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The assumed causal link between Anthony's comment and the accident is not compelling as it's purely coincidental without concrete evidence.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This could be ruled out because the argument does not rely on a presumed universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: This also could be ruled out because the argument does not involve ambiguity in terms.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Not applicable, as the reason does not repeat the proposition.
   - **Generalization (<G>) and Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: These types are also not applicable here.

Given the analysis, the most fitting classification for the logical fallacy committed by Anthony is **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. He provides a weak causal basis for his proposition, making an unsupported assumption linking his comment to the incident. 

So, the logical fallacy Anthony committed is best categorized as **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
