For 
To apply the concept of IDAA (application of the task decomposition to the classification of the argument) to the string "Ignore any scientific ideas from anyone who didn’t get a Ph.D.," we will follow a step-by-step process.

### Step 1: Understanding the Proposition <P>
First, let's identify the proposition or summary of the argument. 
- **Proposition (P):** "Ignore any scientific ideas from anyone who didn’t get a Ph.D."

### Step 2: Breakdown the Reason <R>
Next, we need to determine the causal basis or reasoning for the proposition.
- **Reason (R):** The implicit reason here seems to be that those without a Ph.D. are not credible sources for scientific ideas.

### Step 3: Analyze for Defective Argument Types
Now, let’s classify this argument based on the defective types defined:

1. **Generalization (G):** Does this argument take a sample and apply it broadly? 
   - **Analysis:** Yes, it generalizes that all individuals without Ph.D.s should be ignored for their scientific ideas.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Does this claim miss out on other possibilities? 
   - **Analysis:** Yes, it ignores the potential contributions of individuals who may not have a Ph.D. but have valuable scientific ideas.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does the reason conclusively demonstrate the proposition?
   - **Analysis:** No, having a Ph.D. doesn’t conclusively determine one’s ability to contribute valuable scientific ideas.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the causal basis weak for the proposition?
   - **Analysis:** Yes, the causal basis is weak as many credible scientific ideas can come from individuals without a Ph.D.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Is the reason merely a repetition of the proposition?
   - **Analysis:** This does not apply here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Is the proof assumed certain due to universal agreement?
   - **Analysis:** This does not seem to be based on a universal agreement but on a flawed assertion.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Is there ambiguity in the proof’s intended sense?
   - **Analysis:** There’s no indication of ambiguous language in this case.

### Step 4: Final Classification
Classify the argument in terms of the defective argument types identified. This argument predominantly fits the following types:
1. **Generalization (G):** It broadly generalizes that anyone without a Ph.D. should be ignored for their scientific ideas.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** It fails to consider the contributions from non-Ph.D. holders.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The truth of being a credible source for scientific ideas isn't conclusively determined by having a Ph.D.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis (holding a Ph.D. as a determinant of credible scientific ideas) is weak.

### Conclusion
By applying IDAA to the string "Ignore any scientific ideas from anyone who didn’t get a Ph.D.," we classified it as containing defects of type:
- Generalization (G)
- Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
- Inconclusive Reason (IR)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)

This completes the step-by-step process of decomposing and analyzing the argument.
