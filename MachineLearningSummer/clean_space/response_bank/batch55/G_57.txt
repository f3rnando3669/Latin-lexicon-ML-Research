To apply the process of IDAA to classify the given string as one of the defective argument types, we will decompose the task into specific steps and classify the argument accordingly.

### Step 1: Breakdown the Argument
First, we'll break down the provided statement into its core components:

Proposition (P): "Most tourists from France are rude."
Reason (R): "My mom says so, and she had an experience where a French tourist threw pancakes on the ground when they were not big enough."

### Step 2: Analyze Each Component
Next, we'll analyze whether the components fit any of the defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G):** This occurs when a claim is based on an insufficient sample size but is applied to a larger group.

    - Analysis: The proposition "Most tourists from France are rude" is derived from a single instance of bad behavior by one tourist. This is a classic case of generalizing from a very small sample size.
    
    - Conclusion: The argument appears to be a type of Generalization (G).

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This happens when a supposed complete list of possibilities is actually missing some relevant elements.

    - Analysis: The argument does not claim to enumerate possibilities, so this does not apply.
    
    - Conclusion: Not Incomplete Enumeration (FE).

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This is when the reason doesn't fully support the claim it is supposed to back up.

    - Analysis: The incident reported by the mother is just an anecdotal account and does not conclusively prove that most tourists are rude. This could also suggest Inconclusive Reason (IR).
    
    - Conclusion: The argument may also exhibit characteristics of Inconclusive Reason (IR).

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Occurs when the causal basis provided for a claim is weak.

    - Analysis: The justification "My mom says so" is a very weak causal basis for asserting the rudeness of an entire demographic.
    
    - Conclusion: This matches Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This is when the reason provided merely restates the claim.

    - Analysis: The reason does provide an anecdote, rather than restating the proposition.
    
    - Conclusion: Not Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR).

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This is when it is assumed that something is universally agreed upon without it actually being settled.

    - Analysis: The argument does not rely on universal agreement for verification.
    
    - Conclusion: Not Presumptuous Consensus (FU).

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Occurs when ambiguous language leads to different interpretations.

    - Analysis: The language used is not particularly ambiguous.
    
    - Conclusion: Not Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

### Step 3: Identify the Defective Argument Type
Considering the analysis, the argument primarily fits into these defective argument categories:

1. Generalization (G): The conclusion about tourists is drawn from a single incident.
2. Inconclusive Reason (IR): The anecdotal evidence does not adequately support the broad claim.
3. Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB): The basis "My mom says so" is weak.

### Final Conclusion
While the argument could exhibit characteristics of multiple defect types (IR and WCB), its most prominent defect is **Generalization (G)**, since it extrapolates a broad conclusion from a very limited number of cases.

**Classified Argument Type: G (Generalization)**
