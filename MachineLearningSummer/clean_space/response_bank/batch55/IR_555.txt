To apply the decomposition of the task IDA (classifying the string into a specific defective argument type) into specific steps (D), we will follow a structured process. Specifically, we will break down the task IDA step by step to identify what kind of defective argument type is present in the string "Of course Lou would want to go biking on field trip day - biking is the only thing he ever does! He shouldn't be allowed to choose an activity."

### Steps to apply IDAA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: The initial claim or assertion in the string.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: The causal basis provided to support (P).
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**: Any additional arguments or evidence given to support the reason.
4. **Analyze the argument for defects**: Compare the identified Proposition, Reason, and Proof of Reason against known defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).
5. **Classify the defect**: Determine which defective argument type the string falls into.

Now let's apply these steps to the given string.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The proposition here is:
- "Lou would want to go biking on field trip day."
  
### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The causal basis provided is:
- "biking is the only thing he ever does."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
There is no additional corroborative argument or evidence provided here; the reason itself is taken as sufficient proof.

### Step 4: Analyze the argument for defects
Here, the reason given to support that Lou would want to go biking is that "biking is the only thing he ever does." This might be seen as an over-generalization, a form of reasoning that can also reflect faulty logic about expectations based on unilateral behavior. No additional evidence or complete enumeration of possibilities is given; the reason is assumed sufficient by itself.

### Step 5: Classify the defect
Now, let's classify this defect:
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Not applicable since the reason (R) is not the same as the proposition (P).
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This could be applicable since the reason might not be compelling enough alone to assume Lou's preference definitively.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not clearly fitting since it does not enumerate possibilities.
- **Generalization (G)**: This seems to fit well as the string is making an assumption about Lou's behavior based on a general observation that "biking is the only thing he ever does".
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Might fit since the given reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (P).
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Not applicable since there's no mentioned universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Not applicable; the language does not show ambiguity of intentions.

Upon reviewing the defect types, it is clear that the string "Of course Lou would want to go biking on field trip day - biking is the only thing he ever does! He shouldn't be allowed to choose an activity." best fits the defective argument type:
  
- **Generalization (G)**

This argument assumes that Lou's behavior on a typical day can be generalized to a field trip day without considering other possible contexts or preferences Lou might have. Therefore, IDAA classifies the string under Generalization (G).
