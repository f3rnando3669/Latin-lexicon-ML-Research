For 
Certainly! Let's apply IDAA (decomposition of the classification task into specific steps) to the provided argument: "Several years ago, a group of 10 psychologists started a psychology training program. Each of those psychologists is efficient, effective, and highly-regarded. Their training program must be efficient, effective, and highly-regarded."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The proposition is a statement that summarizes what is intended to be proved.
- **P**: The psychology training program must be efficient, effective, and highly-regarded.

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason provides the causal basis for the proposition.
- **R**: Each of the 10 psychologists who started the program is efficient, effective, and highly-regarded.

#### Step 3: Identify any Proof of Reason (PR)
The proof of reason includes additional arguments or evidence that corroborates the reason.
- **PR**: In this argument, there does not seem to be an additional proof of reason beyond the presented reason.

#### Step 4: Assess the Argument Type
Next, we determine the type of argument and see if there are any defects based on the defined categories (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

- **Generalization (G)**: The assertion in <P> extends the attributes of a specific group (10 psychologists) to an entity associated with them (the training program), irrespective of additional factors that may influence the program's characteristics.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: There is no enumeration being claimed in this argument, so this category does not apply.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason may be considered inconclusive since the qualities of the psychologists may not necessarily translate to the program's overall efficiency, effectiveness, and regard.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis given is that the individual qualities of the psychologists will translate to the program quality, which can be seen as insufficient without further evidence tying those personal qualities to program outcomes.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason provided is distinct from the proposition, rather than a repetition of it.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There is no claim that it is "universally agreed upon" that the program is efficient, effective, and highly-regarded. Therefore, this category does not apply.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language does not appear ambiguous or open to another interpretation in a way that changes the argument.

#### Step 5: Classify the Defective Argument Type
- The argument primarily fits into two categories: **Generalization (G)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

**Conclusion:**
The given argument, "Several years ago, a group of 10 psychologists started a psychology training program. Each of those psychologists is efficient, effective, and highly-regarded. Their training program must be efficient, effective, and highly-regarded," can be classified as an example of **Generalization (G)** because it extends the qualities of individual psychologists to the training program without considering other factors that affect the program's quality. Additionally, it can be considered an **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because the presented causal basis (individual qualities) is not compelling enough to conclusively establish the proposition about the program.
