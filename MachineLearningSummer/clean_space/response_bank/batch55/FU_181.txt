For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "I guess I should buy my 12-year-old daughter an iPhone. Everyone at her new school has one, and I want her to fit in with the other kids," we need to classify the argument as one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>. Here is the step-by-step decomposition and classification:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition is the primary claim or what is being set forth to be proved:
- "I guess I should buy my 12-year-old daughter an iPhone."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason is the causal basis for the proposition, intended to establish its truth:
- "Everyone at her new school has one, and I want her to fit in with the other kids."

### Step 3: Determine if the Reason is Defective
We examine the reason to see if it fits any of the defective argument types:
- Generalization (<G>): This does not apply since the reason does not involve applying a trait of a part to a whole.
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>): Not applicable here as no enumeration of possibilities is being claimed.
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>): Could be considered, but let's explore other types.
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>): The reason provided may not be a compelling enough reason, but let's consider others.
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>): The reason does not repeat the proposition.
- Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>): This could fit, as the reason assumes universal agreement based on the action of "everyone" as a ground.
- Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>): The reason does not seem to hinge on ambiguous language interpreted in different ways.

### Step 4: Classify the Reason (<R>)
Here, the reason hinges on a presumption that "everyone" having an iPhone makes it universally agreed upon or acceptable to buy one. This presumption is used to justify the decision without directly addressing whether buying an iPhone for fitting in is the right move in itself. This fits well with:

- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):** The reason assumes as certain, on the ground that "it is universally agreed upon," (since "everyone" supposedly does it) something which is still in dispute or not adequately substantiated.

### Conclusion
After decomposing the task and analyzing the different steps, the argument provided can be classified under the defective argument type:

- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**

Thus, applying <IDAA> to "I guess I should buy my 12-year-old daughter an iPhone. Everyone at her new school has one, and I want her to fit in with the other kids," results in the classification: **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**.
