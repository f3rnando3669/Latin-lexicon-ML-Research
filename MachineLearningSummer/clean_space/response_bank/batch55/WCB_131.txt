For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "I'm moving to Connecticut because it is the richest state in the nation and I'm tired of being poor," we need to decompose the task of classifying the defective argument into specific steps. Here's the step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- **Proposition (P)**: "I'm moving to Connecticut."
  
### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- **Reason (R)**: "because it is the richest state in the nation and I'm tired of being poor."

### Step 3: Analyze the Reason (<R>)
- We need to determine whether the reasoning provided (that Connecticut being the richest state and tiredness of poverty) conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the proposition (moving to Connecticut).

### Step 4: Check for Defective Argument Types
- **Generalization (G)**: The statement does not appear to be a generalization error where a part is applied for the whole.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement does not enumerate possibilities; it presents a singular reasoning.
  
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Check if the statement provides sufficient and conclusive evidence for the action.
    - Connecticut being the richest state does not necessarily guarantee that the speaker will no longer be poor.
    - Therefore, the reasoning given ( that the wealth of the state will directly affect personal financial status) does not conclusively support the proposition.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Check if the causal basis of the argument (Connecticutâ€™s wealth) is a compelling reason for the action (moving to Connecticut).
    - Wealth of the state is not a strong causal basis for personal financial improvement without additional factors like employment opportunities, cost of living, etc.
  
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason given does not repeat the proposition itself.
  
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The statement does not rely on universal agreement.
  
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language in the reason is not ambiguous.

### Step 5: Conclude the Classification
Based on the analysis above, the statement falls under the following defective argument types:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning presented does not conclusively demonstrate that moving to Connecticut will resolve the issue of being poor.
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis (the wealth of the state) is not a compelling reason for the proposition (moving to Connecticut).

### Final Classification
The given argument "I'm moving to Connecticut because it is the richest state in the nation and I'm tired of being poor" can be classified as:
- **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason)
- **<WCB>** (Insufficient Causal Basis)
