For 
To apply IDAA (application of decomposition to the task of classifying a string as a defective argument) to the provided string "What did you use to wipe your fingerprints from the gun?", we will decompose the advanced task IDA into specific steps and then apply these steps to the string in question.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine if the string contains a proposition or assertion that sets forth summarily what is intended to be proven.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine if the string provides a reason or causal basis for the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Determine if the string provides a proof or additional arguments that corroborate the reason.

4. **Classify the Type of Defective Argument:**
   - Determine which type of defective argument applies to the string based on the definitions provided: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

### Applying IDAA to "What did you use to wipe your fingerprints from the gun?"

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The string does not explicitly contain a proposition. It is framed as a question.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The string implies a reason by suggesting that fingerprints were wiped from the gun, but it does not state a reason explicitly.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - The string lacks any proof or additional arguments that corroborate a reason.

4. **Classify the Type of Defective Argument:**
   - **Generalization (<G>): Not applicable** - The string does not make a generalization about a group of individuals.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>): Not applicable** - The string does not attempt to enumerate possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>): Not applicable** - The string does not provide reasons that fail to conclusively demonstrate a proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>): Not applicable** - The string does not provide a weak causal basis.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>): Not applicable** - The string does not repeat a proposition as a reason.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>): Not applicable** - The string does not rely on an assumed consensus.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>): Applicable** - The question “What did you use to wipe your fingerprints from the gun?” can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended. The use of "wipe your fingerprints from the gun" presumes that the fingerprints were wiped, which is still under dispute and assumes guilt.

Therefore, the string "What did you use to wipe your fingerprints from the gun?" is best classified as <DEP>, which is Ambiguous Language Use. The string implies guilt by presupposing that the listener wiped their fingerprints from the gun, even though this fact is still in dispute and could be interpreted differently.
