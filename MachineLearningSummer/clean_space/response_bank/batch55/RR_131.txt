Sure, let's apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying defective arguments into specific steps) to classify the given string:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) for IDA:

1. **Identify Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine the main assertion or claim within the statement.

2. **Identify Reason (<R>):**
   - Find the causal basis for the proposition, if explicitly stated.

3. **Identify Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Look for any additional arguments or evidence meant to support the reason.

4. **Compare Against Defective Argument Types:**
   - Compare the identified <P>, <R>, and <PR> with the definitions of defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

5. **Classify the String:**
   - Based on the comparison, classify the string as one of the defective argument types.

### Apply the Steps to the Given String:

#### Given String:
"What I do know is that if a dirty bomb goes off on Wall Street and the winds are blowing this way, then I and much of this part of Brooklyn are possibly toast. Is that worth possible violations of the rights of some psycho-violent street thug? To me it is."

#### Step 1: Identify Proposition (<P>)
- The main assertion here seems to be: "It is worth possible violations of the rights of some psycho-violent street thug."

#### Step 2: Identify Reason (<R>)
- The reason provided for this assertion is the hypothetical scenario where a dirty bomb goes off on Wall Street, and the winds blow towards Brooklyn, leading to the obliteration of parts of Brooklyn.

#### Step 3: Identify Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- There is no additional evidence or secondary argument provided to further support the reason. The assertion is mainly based on a hypothetical scenario.

#### Step 4: Compare Against Defective Argument Types

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - The statement does not generalize based on a single example; rather, it describes a specific hypothetical situation.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - The string does not enumerate possibilities, complete or otherwise.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - The reason hinges on a hypothetical scenario. It's possible that the scenario will not occur, making the reason inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - The causal link between the bomb hypothesis and the justification for violating rights is not compelling. It does not present a strong, unavoidable cause-and-effect relationship.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - The reason provided is not just a repetition of the proposition; it’s a separate, though hypothetical, threat scenario.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - The argument does not rely on the claim of universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - The argument's language is not particularly ambiguous; it is clear in its emotional appeal and hypothetical nature.

#### Step 5: Classify the String
- The primary defect here appears to be related to the claim’s causal base being insufficiently compelling. Therefore, the string is best classified as:
  - **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**

### Conclusion:
The statement "What I do know is that if a dirty bomb goes off on Wall Street and the winds are blowing this way, then I and much of this part of Brooklyn are possibly toast. Is that worth possible violations of the rights of some psycho-violent street thug? To me it is." is classified as **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
