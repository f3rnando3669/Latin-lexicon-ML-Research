For 
Sure, let's proceed with the decomposition of the task (<D>) and apply it to classify the given statement (<IDA>). Here is the step-by-step decomposition and analysis:

### Step 1: Breakdown the Statement
- **Statement (s):** "You can hardly blame President Clinton for having extramarital affairs. Many presidents, when faced with similar situations, have yielded to the same temptations."

### Step 2: Extract the Proposition and Reason Elements
- **Proposition (P):** "You can hardly blame President Clinton for having extramarital affairs."
- **Reason (R):** "Many presidents, when faced with similar situations, have yielded to the same temptations."

### Step 3: Review the Definitions of Defective Argument Types
- **Generalization (G):** The proposition is based on one part or a majority, but is not applicable to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The proposition assumes a complete list of possibilities but misses pertinent ones.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reason is weak as the causal basis is not compelling for the proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason restates the proposition without adding new information.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The proof of reason is assumed based on universal agreement, which is in dispute.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The proof of reason can be misinterpreted and taken another way than intended.

### Step 4: Analyze the Consistency and Strength of the Reasoning (R)
- The reason states that "many presidents have yielded to the same temptations." This implies that President Clinton's actions can be excused because others have done the same.

### Step 5: Match the Statement against Defective Argument Types
1. **Generalization (G):** The statement makes a generalization about presidents who faced similar situations. It assumes that since some presidents have yielded to temptations, this behavior is expectable or excusable. The broader interpretation is generalized across all scenarios.
   Example: One or a group of presidents' actions do not infer that it is acceptable for everyone.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Possible that the statement fails to consider presidents who did not have extramarital affairs when faced with similar situations.
   Example: Not all presidents have yielded to extramarital affairs.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason that "others have done it" does not conclusively explain or justify Clinton's behavior.
   Example: Just because others did it does not logically make it right.

### Step 6: Identify the Most Relevant Defective Argument Type
- **Generalization (G):** Best fits because the statement generalizes from the actions of "many presidents" to excuse the specific actions of one (Clinton). The reasoning does not apply universally.

### Step 7: Classify the Statement (s)
- The statement is classified as **<G>** (Generalization).

### Conclusion
The application of <IDAA> to the given statement classifies it as **<G>**, a defective argument based on Generalization. The reasoning generalizes the behavior of some presidents as an excuse for President Clinton, which is not necessarily applicable universally.
