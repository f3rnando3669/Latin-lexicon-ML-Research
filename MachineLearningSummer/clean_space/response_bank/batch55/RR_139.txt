For 
To apply \(<IDAA>\) to the task of classifying the statement "I shouldn't have flunked the test because I never get F's" as a defective argument, we must first decompose the advanced task \(<t>\) into specific steps \(<D>\). Here are the steps we need to follow for \(<t>\):

1. **Identify the Proposition (\(P\)) and Reason (\(R\)) in the statement.**
2. **Classify the argument type by comparing it against the defective argument types: \(<G>\), \(<FE>\), \(<IR>\), \(<WCB>\), \(<RR>\), \(<FU>\), \(<DEP>\).**
3. **Determine which defective argument type best fits the identified Proposition and Reason.**

Let's apply these steps to the given statement:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\(P\)) and Reason (\(R\))

- \(P\): "I shouldn't have flunked the test."
- \(R\): "because I never get F's."

### Step 2: Classify the Argument Type by Comparing it Against the Defective Argument Types

- **Generalization (\(G\))**: The \(P\) is an assertion based on some one part or majority of individuals but not necessarily applicable to all, referred to all.
  - Here, the statement doesn’t make a general assertion about a group or majority but focuses on the speaker's personal experience.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\(FE\))**: The \(P\) claims to have made a complete enumeration of possibilities but misses pertinent ones.
  - The statement doesn’t enumerate possibilities; rather, it provides a personal historical context.
  
- **Inconclusive Reason (\(IR\))**: The \(R\) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the \(P\).
  - The Reason "I never get F's" does not conclusively prove "I shouldn't have flunked the test". Past performance does not guarantee future results.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(WCB\))**: The \(R\) is weak if the causal basis submitted for the \(P\) is not compelling.
  - The causal basis (past grades) is insufficient to conclude the outcome of a specific test.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(RR\))**: The \(R\) is presented as the \(R\) but says precisely the same as was said in the \(P\).
  - The Reason restates the Proposition in a different form: getting F's is related to flunking a test, so it seems to echo the Proposition without solid proof.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (\(FU\))**: The \(PR\) is assumed as certain on the ground that "it is universally agreed upon," a thing which is still in dispute.
  - This isn’t about a consensus or universal agreement.
  
- **Ambiguous Language Use (\(DEP\))**: The \(PR\) can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended.
  - The language in the statement isn't particularly ambiguous.

### Step 3: Determine Which Defective Argument Type Best Fits

After comparing the argument against the defective types \(<G>\), \(<FE>\), \(<IR>\), \(<WCB>\), \(<RR>\), \(<FU>\), and \(<DEP>\):

- The most fitting defective argument type for the statement "I shouldn't have flunked the test because I never get F's" is **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(RR\))**. This is because the Reason essentially repeats the Proposition in a slightly modified form but does not provide a distinct rationale.

Therefore, the classification of the statement "I shouldn't have flunked the test because I never get F's" under the task \(<IDA>\) is: **<RR>**.
