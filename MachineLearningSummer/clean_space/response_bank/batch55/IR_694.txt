For 
To apply IDAA to the given string, "Some of you have objected to the ethics of my clinic's buying those new test batteries. You claim that the new tests are unreliable, have no published norms, have never demonstrated validity, cannot be used by clients who are physically disabled, have been condemned as bogus by every major scientific organization, and were developed and sold by my brother-in-law, who unfortunately cannot be with us today due to a misunderstanding with his overly controlling and rigidly judgmental parole officer. What you have apparently failed to appreciate, however, is that these new tests are much easier to learn, can be administered and scored in a fraction of the time required by the old tests, and were so inexpensive compared to the old tests that I'll be able to give you each a bonus at the end of the month.", we need to decompose the task IDA into individual steps and classify the argument. Here's the breakdown:

### Steps of IDA Applied to the Given String
1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - The Proposition (P) reflects the main point that is intended to be proven or argued.
   - In the given string: The primary assertion is that the new test batteries are ethically appropriate for the clinic.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - The Reason (R) provides the causal basis or support for the Proposition.
   - In the given string: The reasons given include that the tests are easier to learn, quicker to administer and score, and cost-effective.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - The Proof of Reason (PR) provides additional arguments or evidence supporting the Reason.
   - In the given string: It lacks a proper Proof of Reason; instead, it dismisses the objections and presents the benefits superficially.

4. **Evaluate for Defective Argument Types:**
   - Assess whether the identified argument (P, R, PR) aligns with any defective argument types. 
     - **Generalization (G):** The argument does not seem to generalize based on limited or non-representative instances.
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The original objections enumerate a number of flaws in the tests, which are not directly addressed.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reasons provided do not conclusively support the ethical appropriateness of the tests.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The basis for ethical appropriateness (ease of learning, time-efficient, and cost) is insufficient for an ethical argument.
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reasons provided are distinct from the proposition.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There is no claiming of universal agreement; it is more dismissive of objections.
     - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Language is mostly clear, not ambiguous in a problematic way.

### Classification:
The argument is most likely defective due to **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:

- **FE (Incomplete Enumeration):** The speaker does not address all of the enumerated ethical objections like reliability, validity, norms, use by physically disabled, condemnation by scientific bodies, and conflict of interest with the brother-in-law. Instead, they redirect to other unrelated benefits.
  
- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The given reasons (ease of learning, administration time, cost savings) do not sufficiently address or justify the ethical objections raised (e.g., reliability, validity, normative data).

### Conclusion:
IDAA applied step by step leads to the classification of the given argument as primarily a combination of **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
