The task is to apply the methodology of decomposing the task of classifying a defective argument (IDA) into specific steps (D), and then applying this decomposition (IDAA) to the given statement: "Everyone knows that Japanese DVD players are the best. After all, they outsell American players two-to-one."

Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the proposition (P)
In the given statement, the proposition (\(P\)) is:
- "Japanese DVD players are the best."

### Step 2: Identify the reason (R)
The reason (\(R\)) provided to support the proposition is:
- "They outsell American players two-to-one."

### Step 3: Examine the nature of the argument and identify potential defects
We now need to check if the argument matches any of the defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (\(G\))**: This occurs when an assertion is based on some part or a majority of individuals, but not necessarily applicable to all, is referred to all. 
   - In this case, we are not dealing with individuals, but the idea of sales numbers being generalized to indicate quality.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\(FE\))**: This occurs when we claim to have made a complete enumeration of the possibilities but miss pertinent ones.
   - This doesn't seem to apply because the argument isn't about enumerating possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (\(IR\))**: This happens when the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
   - Whether sales numbers conclusively demonstrate the correctness of best quality is debatable, leaning towards inconclusiveness, but let's verify against other defects.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(WCB\))**: This occurs when the causal basis for the proposition is not a compelling one.
   - The fact that Japanese DVD players outsell American ones does not necessarily mean they are the best. Sales could be influenced by many factors, such as marketing, price, availability, etc. Hence, this seems to fit.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(RR\))**: This occurs when the reason is merely a repetition of the proposition.
   - The given reason is different from the proposition; sales figures are not a repetition of being the best. So, this does not apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\(FU\))**: This occurs when something is asserted on the ground that "it is universally agreed upon," which is still in dispute.
   - The phrase "Everyone knows..." fits this defect well because it assumes universal agreement on the quality without evidence. Thus, this applies.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\(DEP\))**: This occurs when a proof can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended.
   - There's no ambiguity in the language with distinct meaning shifts here.

### Step 4: Classify the defective argument
Based on the examination, the defective argument types applicable to the statement are <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) and <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).

### Conclusion
Applying IDAA to "Everyone knows that Japanese DVD players are the best. After all, they outsell American players two-to-one," we classify it as:

- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The causal basis (sales figures) does not necessarily prove the proposition (best quality).
- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: The argument assumes universal agreement ("Everyone knows") without supporting evidence.

Thus, the statement contains at least two defective arguments: <WCB> and <FU>.
