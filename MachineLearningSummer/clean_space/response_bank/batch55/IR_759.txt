For 
To apply the task IDAA (which stands for the decomposition of a task into specific steps for the purpose of classifying a given string as a certain defective argument type) to the string "You use support from someone who is a trustworthy expert," we need to follow a systematic approach. Here are the steps:

### Step 1: Identify and understand the components of the string
- **String (s)**: "You use support from someone who is a trustworthy expert."

### Step 2: Analyze the argument structure
- Identify the **Proposition (P)**: The string implies, but does not explicitly state, a proposition. We'll need to infer it. In this case, it seems to be something like "This claim is valid."
- Identify the **Reason (R)**: The reason given is the "support from someone who is a trustworthy expert."

### Step 3: Compare to the definitions of defective argument types
- **Generalization (G)**: This does not appear to be an issue of making a broad claim based on limited evidence. It doesn't fit G.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: There's no enumeration involved, so this doesn't fit FE.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason given relies on the trustworthiness of an expert. Depending on context, if this trust is not sufficient to cover the specific claim, it could be considered inconclusive. Let's hold this for further steps.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: If the expert's trustworthiness does not directly relate to the specific issue/person/expertise required, this could be a weak causal basis. This seems like a potential fit. Let's hold this for evaluation.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason and the proposition are not identical in wording and intent. So, this doesn't fit RR.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There's no reference to a universal agreement or consensus, so this doesn't fit FU.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The term "trustworthy expert" is quite clear here, so it doesn’t seem to involve an ambiguous use of language. This doesn't fit DEP.

### Step 4: Evaluate the most promising defective argument types
Given the above eliminations, two potential defective arguments still need more evaluation:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: We consider if the trustworthiness of the expert alone conclusively proves the proposition. If the expertise of the person is not directly relevant to the claim, it would be inconclusive.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: If "someone" is termed as an expert but the provided expertise is not directly supportive or compelling enough for the claimed proposition, it means the causal basis is weak.

### Step 5: Final Classification
Let's assess the context provided in "You use support from someone who is a trustworthy expert":

1. **Inconclusive Reason**: Trustworthiness might still be qualitatively assessed. We need more details to determine conclusiveness.
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis**: Without specific information on how the expert’s trustworthiness correlates with the claim being made, the causal basis can be deemed weak.

Given the context — and the focus on causal linkage being insufficient and spontaneity which doesn't offer complete persuasive support — 
**"You use support from someone who is a trustworthy expert"** best fits under **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** if the expertise does not directly correlate with the claim and is not compelling in logic.

Thus, the classification of the string using IDAA yields **WCB**.
