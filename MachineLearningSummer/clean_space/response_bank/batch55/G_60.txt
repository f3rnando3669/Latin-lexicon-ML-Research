For 
Applying <IDAA> to classify the argument "Ten years ago I got a 170 on the LSAT, so I expect to get the same score again." involves decomposing the task of classification into specific steps, as defined in <D>. Here's the step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
Identify the summarised statement or claim that the argument is trying to prove.

**Proposition (<P>):** "I expect to get the same score again."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Determine the causal basis provided for the proposition.

**Reason (<R>):** "Ten years ago I got a 170 on the LSAT."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
Look for any additional arguments or evidence that corroborate the reason.

**Proof of Reason (<PR>):** None explicitly provided in the sentence.

### Step 4: Evaluate the Reason (<R>)
Assess the reason to see if it meets the criteria required to fully support the proposition or if it might fit into any of the defective argument types.

**Reason Analysis:** The reason provided ("Ten years ago I got a 170 on the LSAT") implies an expectation of the same performance without considering changes in the test-taker's abilities, test format, preparation, or other variables that could affect the outcome after ten years.

### Step 5: Classify the Defective Argument Type
Based on the reason and its relationship to the proposition, choose the most appropriate defective argument type.

**Classification as <G> (Generalization):** This doesn’t quite fit, as it’s not a generalization based on a sample applied to all.

**Classification as <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):** This doesn’t perfectly fit, as it’s not about excluding possibilities from a complete list.

**Classification as <IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** The reason is inconclusive because it does not account for changes over time or provide solid evidence that past performance will predict current performance after ten years.

**Classification as <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** This doesn’t apply because the reason and proposition are not stating the same thing.

**Classification as <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** Yes, the reason given does not provide a compelling causal basis for the proposition. The reasoning doesn’t account for the relevance of the time gap or other situational factors needed to expect the same score.

**Classification as <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):** This doesn’t apply because it doesn’t rely on a presumed universal agreement.

**Classification as <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):** Ambiguity isn't a key issue here.

### Step 6: Determine the Best Fit
Given the above analyses, the defective argument type <WCB> is the most suitable classification.

### Conclusion

Using <IDAA>, the argument “Ten years ago I got a 170 on the LSAT, so I expect to get the same score again.” is classified as having an **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**. The reason provided does not compellingly substantiate the expectation of achieving the same score after a significant time lapse without addressing potential changes in circumstances or abilities.
