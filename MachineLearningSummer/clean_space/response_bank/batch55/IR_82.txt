For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying an argument as one of the given defective argument types) to the statement "Using a double standard or arguing for an unjustified exception," we need to decompose the task of classification into specific steps and then systematically classify the argument.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D):
1. **Understand and Identify the Core Argument:**
   - Analyze the statement provided to understand its components and the type of argument it represents.

2. **Compare with Defective Argument Types:**
   - Examine the characteristics of each defective argument type and compare them with the provided statement to see which matches.

3. **Evaluate for Specific Defects:**
   - Based on the comparison, evaluate which specific defect (if any) is present in the argument.

4. **Classify the Argument:**
   - Determine the classification of the argument based on the evaluation.

### Application to the Given Statement

#### Step 1: Understand and Identify the Core Argument
- The statement "Using a double standard or arguing for an unjustified exception" suggests an argument where different criteria are applied to similar situations or an exception is made without proper justification.

#### Step 2: Compare with Defective Argument Types
- **Generalization (G)**: Not applicable, as the statement doesn't involve an assertion about majority or all individuals.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable, as the statement doesn't involve an incomplete list of possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Not directly applicable, as the statement isn't specifically about the inconclusiveness of the reason.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Not directly applicable, as the statement isn't focused solely on the weakness of causal basis.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Not applicable, as there is no repetition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Not applicable, as the statement is not about assuming consensus.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Potentially applicable but let's evaluate further.

#### Step 3: Evaluate for Specific Defects
- The concept of a "double standard" usually implies the application of different rules or criteria in similar situations without proper justification.
- "Arguing for an unjustified exception" implies giving special treatment to a specific case without solid justification.
- Both situations point towards an inconsistency in reasoning or an ambiguous application of rules and principles.

#### Step 4: Classify the Argument
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: This defect is characterized by the use of language that can be interpreted in more than one way. If the "unjustified exception" or "double standard" is due to ambiguity in rules or criteria, this classification could fit. However, DEP typically refers to ambiguous language use, which isn't the primary issue here.
- A more fitting classification might be akin to the concept of "Special Pleading," but since it's not one of the defined categories (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP), it doesn't precisely match.

Given the provided categories, "Inconclusive Reason (IR)" appears to be the closest category because the argument for an unjustified exception or double standard likely involves reasons that do not conclusively justify why the exception should be made.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the current definitions, the statement "Using a double standard or arguing for an unjustified exception" most closely matches **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the reasons provided in such arguments typically fail to conclusively justify the differential treatment or exception being made.
