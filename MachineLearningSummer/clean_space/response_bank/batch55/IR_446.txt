For 
To apply <IDAA> (decomposing the task of classifying an argument into its specific steps) to the statement "If everyone lived his or her life exactly like Jesus lived his life, the world would be a beautiful place!", we need to follow a systematic process to identify which type of defective argument, if any, is present. Here's the step-by-step decomposition:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The proposition (P) in the statement is:
- "The world would be a beautiful place."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason (R) provided to support the proposition is:
- "If everyone lived his or her life exactly like Jesus lived his life."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Reason (R) for common defects
We need to analyze the reason to see if it falls into any specific defective argument categories:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - Does the reason assert something based on a part or majority but not necessarily applicable to all?
   - In this case, it's not a generalization about all people but hypothesizes a world where everyone lived exactly like Jesus.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Does the reason claim to cover all possibilities but miss out on some?
   - The statement does not enumerate possibilities; it posits a single condition for the premise.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Does the reason conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
   - To verify this, we need to check if living exactly like Jesus would necessarily make the world a beautiful place. The statement doesn’t provide conclusive evidence or detailed argumentation to support that living like Jesus would make the world beautiful. Hence, the reason may be inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Is the causal basis weak or not compelling?
   - The assertion that living like Jesus would make the world beautiful may lack a compelling causal link unless further substantiated with specific arguments or proof.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - Does the reason merely repeat the proposition?
   - The reason is different from the proposition; it’s not merely a repetition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - Does the reason assume consensus on a disputed matter?
   - It doesn’t specifically state that it’s universally agreed upon.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - Could the reason be taken in another sense than intended?
   - This statement is quite clear and directly refers to living like Jesus. There's no ambiguity in what living like Jesus refers to in this context.

### Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on identified defects
Based on the above analysis, multiple defects could be applicable to the given statement:

- **<IR>:** The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. It’s a hypothetical scenario that isn’t sufficiently backed by additional arguments or evidence to conclusively prove the proposition.
- **<WCB>:** The causal basis is weak because it assumes that living like Jesus necessarily leads to a beautiful world without substantiating it adequately.

Thus, the classification for the argument "If everyone lived his or her life exactly like Jesus lived his life, the world would be a beautiful place!" can be summarized under both:

- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**

These reflect the main issues: the reason doesn't conclusively prove the proposition and the causal link provided is weak.
