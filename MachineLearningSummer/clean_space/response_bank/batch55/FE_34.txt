For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of decomposition to the task of identifying defective argument types) to the statement "We should ban all hairspray or the world will end!", we need to break down our task of identifying the defective argument into specific steps. Here's the decomposition of <IDA>:

1. **Extract the Proposition (P):** Identify what is being asserted or proposed.
2. **Identify the Reason (R):** Look for the causal basis or reason that supports the proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Reason (R):** Determine whether the reason provided supports the proposition and check whether it is conclusive, relevant, and strong enough.
4. **Identify Proof of Reason (PR):** Look for additional arguments or evidence provided to corroborate the reason.
5. **Classify the Argument:** Determine if the argument falls into one of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>).

Now, let's apply these steps to the statement "We should ban all hairspray or the world will end!"

### Step-by-Step Application of <IDAA>:

1. **Extract the Proposition (P):**
   - **Proposition (P):** "We should ban all hairspray."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - **Reason (R):** "Or the world will end."

3. **Evaluate the Reason (R):**
   - **Relevance:** The reason provided ("the world will end") is meant to show the consequence of not banning hairspray.
   - **Strength:** This reason is extremely dramatic and implies a catastrophic consequence which is highly unlikely for the mere act of using hairspray.
   - **Conclusiveness:** The reason is not conclusive because it does not provide evidence as to why hairspray would lead to such a catastrophic outcome.

4. **Identify Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - No additional arguments or evidence are provided to support the reason that banning hairspray would prevent the world from ending.

5. **Classify the Argument:**
   - The argument uses an extremely unlikely and drastic consequence to support the proposition. This is a classic example of a slippery slope or an extreme consequence fallacy. It also does not provide sufficient evidence or reasoning to make the proposed outcome believable.
   - Therefore, it most closely falls under the defective argument type of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, as the provided reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
   - Another possible category could be **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, since the reason given for the proposition (world ending) lacks a compelling causal link to the use of hairspray.

### Conclusion:
The defective argument type of the statement "We should ban all hairspray or the world will end!" is primarily **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and possibly **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
