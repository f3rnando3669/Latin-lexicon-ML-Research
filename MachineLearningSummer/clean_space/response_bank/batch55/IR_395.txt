For 
To apply the IDAA (decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument) to the statement "Saying that the burden of proof lies not with the person making the claim, but with someone else to disprove," we will decompose the task into specific steps to identify the type of defective argument.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Understand the Statement:**
   - "Saying that the burden of proof lies not with the person making the claim, but with someone else to disprove."

2. **Identify the Components of the Statement:**
   - **Proposition (P):** The claim is that the burden of proof does not lie with the person making the claim.
   - **Reason (R):** The suggestion is that the responsibility for disproof lies with someone else.

3. **Evaluate the Statement Against Each Type of Defective Argument:**
   - **Generalization (G):** 
     - **Definition:** A proposition based on some part or majority, but not applicable to all.
     - **Evaluation:** The statement is not a generalization of a part or majority to all, so it is not a Generalization.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
     - **Definition:** Defective proposition claiming a complete enumeration of possibilities but missing pertinent ones.
     - **Evaluation:** The statement does not attempt to enumerate possibilities, so it is not an Incomplete Enumeration.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
     - **Definition:** Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
     - **Evaluation:** The proposition itself does not present a reason to demonstrate. It shifts the burden of proof, but there is no conclusive reason provided. However, this is more about misplacing burden rather than the reason not being conclusive.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
     - **Definition:** Weak causal basis for the proposition.
     - **Evaluation:** The statement does not provide a causal basis that can be evaluated as strong or weak.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
     - **Definition:** Reason repeating the proposition.
     - **Evaluation:** The statement does not repeat the proposition as the reason.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
     - **Definition:** Proof of reason assumed as certain based on universal agreement still in dispute.
     - **Evaluation:** The statement does not assert its claim based on universal agreement.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
     - **Definition:** Proof of reason taken in another sense than the speaker intended.
     - **Evaluation:** There is no ambiguity in the language that could lead to different interpretations.

4. **Find the Closest Match - Shifting the Burden of Proof:**
   - The essence of the defective argument here is about the burden of proof. The statement suggests that the person making the claim should not have to prove it, but rather someone else should disprove it.
   - This is known as shifting the burden of proof, a known logical fallacy.

5. **Final Classification:**
   - Upon examining all defective argument types, none of the predefined types exactly fit shifting the burden of proof, but the fallacy of shifting the burden relies on the absence of meeting the initial requirement of providing a reason or proof.
   - Given the focus on who should provide proof and the absence of that proof within the argument:
     - The closest match could be **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the proposition lacks an initial reason (R) demonstrating the correctness and shifts it elsewhere, which is misleading.

**Conclusion:**
- The statement "Saying that the burden of proof lies not with the person making the claim, but with someone else to disprove" should be classified as **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** since it fails to establish the causal basis for the claim properly and improperly shifts this responsibility.
