For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of the decomposition of the advanced task into specific steps) to classify the argument "Dr. McKenzie said all kids can fly, so it must be true!" let's break it down into specific steps to identify the type of defective argument.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA>:
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The proposition is the main statement being argued. In this case, the proposition is: "all kids can fly."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason provided to support the proposition is: "Dr. McKenzie said."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - There is no additional proof of the reason provided in the argument. The argument solely relies on the authority of Dr. McKenzie's statement.

4. **Analyze the Argument for Defective Types:**
   - Examine if the proposition (<P>) is making a broad assertion based on limited evidence (Generalization, <G>).
   - Check if there's an incomplete enumeration of possibilities (<FE>).
   - Determine if the reason (<R>) does not conclusively support the proposition (<IR>).
   - Assess if the reason (<R>) is merely a repetition of the proposition (<RR>).
   - Evaluate if the causal basis provided by the reason (<R>) is insufficient (<WCB>).
   - Look for presumptions of consensus or agreement that are not justified (<FU>).
   - Consider if there is any ambiguity in the language or terms used (<DEP>).

### Application to "Dr. McKenzie said all kids can fly, so it must be true!":
1. **Proposition (<P>):** "All kids can fly."
2. **Reason (<R>):** "Dr. McKenzie said."
3. **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** None provided.

### Classification Based on Defective Argument:

- **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The proposition is asserting a very broad claim without providing evidence that all kids can fly. However, this is not based on specific individuals but rather an appeal to authority.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - There's no claim of making a complete enumeration of possibilities, so this type does not apply.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The reason provided ("Dr. McKenzie said") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition that "all kids can fly." Just because Dr. McKenzie said something does not provide a logical or empirical basis to prove the claim.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - The reason provided is not a direct repetition of the proposition. Thus, this type does not apply.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The reason provided ("Dr. McKenzie said") is insufficient as it does not offer a compelling causal basis for the proposition. It relies on an appeal to authority without further evidence.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - There is no mention of universal agreement in the argument. Thus, this type does not apply.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - There is no ambiguity in the language that can be interpreted in another sense than intended. Thus, this type does not apply.

### Conclusion:
The argument "Dr. McKenzie said all kids can fly, so it must be true!" is primarily a case of:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>),** because the reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>),** because the reliance on Dr. McKenzie's statement alone is not a compelling basis for the claim.

Therefore, based on <IDAA>, the argument is classified as type **<IR>** and **<WCB>**.
