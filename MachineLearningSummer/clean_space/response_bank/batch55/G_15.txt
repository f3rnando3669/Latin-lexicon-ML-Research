To apply the IDAA process to the given argument, we need to decompose the advanced task of classifying the argument as one of the defective types into specific steps. Here’s the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
In this argument, the conclusion or the main proposition intended to be proven is:
- P: "If you don’t go to this party, then you will have no social life."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reasons provided to support the proposition are:
- R1: "If you don’t go to the party, then your friends will have fun without you."
- R2: "If your friends have fun without you, then they will stop inviting you to fun things."
- R3: "If your friends stop inviting you to fun things, you will have no social life."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
The connections between these reasons form the proof:
- PR: The chain of reasoning from R1 to R2 to R3, leading to <P>.

### Step 4: Analyze each part for defects
Now, we need to check if any parts of the argument fall into the defective categories:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This doesn't apply here since each reason is not based on an inadequate sample size or faulty assumption about all individuals.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This doesn't fit because there's no assertion of having covered all possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Checks if <R> does not conclusively support <P>.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Analyze if the causal relationships (R1, R2, R3) are weak or not compelling.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This doesn’t fit as reasons R1, R2, and R3 are different statements.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Not applicable since there’s no reliance on universal agreement.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: No ambiguous terms are apparent in the argument.

### Step 5: Check for specific defects
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** are the primary defects to check here as the reasons provided appear to form a chain of logic but might lack compelling causal connection or conclusiveness.

#### Analysis:
- R1 to R2 causal link: "If you don’t go to the party, then your friends will have fun without you." This seems plausible.
- R2 to R3 causal link: "If your friends have fun without you, then they will stop inviting you to fun things." This is more questionable. Having fun without one instance of attendance does not conclusively lead to ending all future invitations.
- R3 to P causal link: "If your friends stop inviting you to fun things, you will have no social life." Again, this conclusion appears to be an exaggeration since one's social life is not solely dependent on these specific invitations.

Thus, **R2** and **R3** are weak causal claims, making the argument fall under:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The bases which the reasons submit for the proposition are not compelling.

### Conclusion:
The given argument most likely qualifies as an **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because the causality between attending a single party and having no social life is neither compelling nor conclusively demonstrated.
