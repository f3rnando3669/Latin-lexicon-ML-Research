To apply the task of IDAA (decomposition of IDA into steps) to the given string, let's break down the advanced task of classifying the argument into specific steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   Determine the main statement or claim that the argument is attempting to establish.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   Locate the causal basis or reasoning provided to support the Proposition.

3. **Examine the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   Check if additional arguments or evidence are presented to corroborate the Reason.

4. **Analyze for Defective Arguments**:
   Check the argument against known defective argument types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), and Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

Now, we apply these steps to the provided text:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition is what the argument is setting out to prove or assert.
In the text:
“The time that children are vaccinated and the time they're diagnosed do closely correlate, however, leading upset parents to assign blame to the immunizations, for lack of a better explanation.”

The implicit proposition here is:
“Vaccines are blamed for causing autism due to the correlation in timing of vaccination and diagnosis.”

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason provides the basis or support for the proposition.
In the text:
“The time that children are vaccinated and the time they're diagnosed do closely correlate.”

This correlation is being used as the reason for the blame placed on vaccinations.

### Step 3: Examine the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
Proof of Reason corroborates the reasoning through additional arguments or evidence.
In the text:
“Though no scientific link has been found between the administration of vaccines and the onset of autism.”

This statement suggests a lack of proof or additional supporting evidence for the Reason given.

### Step 4: Analyze for Defective Arguments
Let's classify the reasoning in terms of potential defective argument types.

- **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument does not extend a particular instance to a general rule here, so it doesn't fit (<G>).
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not claim to enumerate all possibilities, so it doesn't fit (<FE>).

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason given (correlation) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (causation), so the argument is potentially falling under <IR>.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis (correlation) is weak and not compelling enough, especially considering the lack of scientific link, so it fits <WCB>.
  
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The reason does add a new point (correlation) rather than just repeating the proposition, so it doesn't fit <RR>.
  
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: There is no appeal to universal agreement, so it doesn't fit <FU>.
  
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The language used is specific and not ambiguous, so it doesn't fit <DEP>.

**Conclusion:**
The argument primarily fits **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**, as the reason provided (correlation in timing) is weak and not compelling proof of the proposition (vaccines cause autism), especially since “no scientific link has been found.”

Thus, the defective argument type for the given string is **<WCB>**.
