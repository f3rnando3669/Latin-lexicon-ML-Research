To apply the decomposition of the task of classifying the given string to "What can our new math teacher know? Have you seen how fat she is?" (IDA), I will follow a structured approach. Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Understand the Proposition <P> in the String:**
   - Identify what the string is asserting (the claim or main point).
   - In the given string, the proposition can be interpreted as: "Our new math teacher can't know much."
   
2. **Identify and Assess the Reason <R>:**
   - Determine the causal basis provided for the proposition.
   - In this case, the reason provided is: "She is fat."

3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason <PR> if present:**
   - Look for evidence or arguments supporting the reason provided.
   - Here, there isn't additional evidence beyond the observation of her being fat.

4. **Classify the Argument Type (IDA):**
   - Generalization <G>: Not applicable here, as the statement doesn't generalize from one example to all.
   - Incomplete Enumeration <FE>: Not applicable, as no enumeration or list is given.
   - Inconclusive Reason <IR>: This could be the case if the reason provided (her being fat) doesn’t conclusively support the proposition (her knowledge).
   - Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>: This may also apply since the reason (teacher’s weight) does not logically support the proposition (teacher’s knowledge) in a compelling manner.
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>: Not applicable, as the reason is not the same as the proposition.
   - Presumptuous Consensus <FU>: Not applicable, since no appeal to universal agreement is made.
   - Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>: Not applicable, as the language usage is clear, but potentially irrelevant.

5. **Classify the Argument:**
   - The given argument is "What can our new math teacher know? Have you seen how fat she is?"
   - Evaluate the steps to classify:
     - The reason (R) provided is inconclusive and does not logically establish the proposition (P).
     - The reason (R) also has an insufficient causal basis for the proposition (P).

6. **Classify the String as Defective Argument Type:**
   - The strongest classification for this specific string: 
     - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The observation about the teacher’s weight doesn't logically support or conclusively demonstrate the proposition about her knowledge.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal link between the teacher's weight and her knowledge is weak and not compelling.

Considering these steps and evaluations:

**"What can our new math teacher know? Have you seen how fat she is?"** 
is classified as both:
- **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason) 
- **<WCB>** (Insufficient Causal Basis)

In conclusion, both classifications highlight the logical flaws in the argument's reasoning.
