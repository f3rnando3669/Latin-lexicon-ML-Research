Sure, let's apply the decomposition process (<D>) to the task of classifying a defective argument (<IDA>) for the given statement:

"Since Anna Camacho became vice president of the parent-teacher association, student performance has declined and teacher morale is down. We on the school board believe that Camacho bears sole responsibility for the downtrend."

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- **Proposition (P):** Camacho bears sole responsibility for the downtrend in student performance and teacher morale.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- **Reason (R):** Since Anna Camacho became vice president of the parent-teacher association, student performance has declined and teacher morale is down.

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- In this case, the statement does not explicitly provide additional arguments to corroborate the Reason, so we don't have a distinct <PR>. The argument relies directly on the <R> to move to the <P>.

### Step 4: Evaluate the Argument for Defects
- **Generalization (G):** The statement does not necessarily fall under this category as it does not generalize from a part or majority to a whole.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument does not list out all possibilities or miss any, so this does not apply.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This could be a relevant category, as the statement does not conclusively demonstrate that Julia Camacho alone is responsible for the downtrend.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This seems highly relevant, as the causal basis provided (Camacho becoming vice president) is not compelling enough to establish her sole responsibility.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The <R> does not repeat the <P>, so this is not applicable.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There is no universal agreement mentioned here, so this does not apply.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language is clear and unambiguous, so this is not applicable.

### Step 5: Classification (<IDA>)
Given the steps and the analysis, the most applicable defective argument type for the given statement seems to be **"Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)"**.

### Summary
- **Proposition (P):** Camacho bears sole responsibility for the downtrend in student performance and teacher morale.
- **Reason (R):** Since Anna Camacho became vice president of the parent-teacher association, student performance has declined and teacher morale is down.
- **Classification (IDA):** Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).

After applying the decomposition of the task, it is clear that the argument has an "Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)" as the causal relationship between Camacho assuming vice presidency and the decline in performance and morale is not convincingly demonstrated.
