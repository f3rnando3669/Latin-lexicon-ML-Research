For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string: "There is a lot of commotion regarding saving the environment. We simply cannot make this world into the Garden of Eden. Pursuing perfection is impossible and pointless. And besides, even Adam and Eve got bored in Eden!"

Let's break down this advanced task step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
- **Proposition <P>:** "We simply cannot make this world into the Garden of Eden."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
- **Reason <R>:** "Pursuing perfection is impossible and pointless."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason <PR>
- **Proof of Reason <PR>:** "And besides, even Adam and Eve got bored in Eden!"

### Step 4: Classify the Argument as Defective
- Now we need to classify the type of defective argument by comparing it to defined types of defective arguments.

#### Analysis:
1. **Generalization <G>:**
   - The argument does not seem to be making a sweeping assertion based on limited data. It rather uses a conceptual analogy.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>:**
   - This argument doesn't enumerate possibilities about the environment but rather states an abstract idea about perfection.

3. **Inconclusive Reason <IR>:**
   - The reason ("Pursuing perfection is impossible and pointless") might be seen as not conclusively proving the proposition ("We simply cannot make this world into the Garden of Eden"). There is a conceptual leap here, making it partially fit this category.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>:**
   - The provided reason doesn't have a concrete causal connection to the proposition. This suggests a weak causal basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>:**
   - The reason is not the same as the proposition. So, this is not a case of faulty repetition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>:**
   - There's no explicit appeal to universal agreement in this argument.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>:**
   - There is an ambiguous reference to "perfection" and the "Garden of Eden," but it's more conceptual rather than resulting from ambiguous language use.

Based on this analysis, the argument seems to have an **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>** and possibly elements of an **Inconclusive Reason <IR>** due to the lack of a compelling connection between the reason and the proposition. Additionally, the Proof of Reason is a tangential, non-serious point that doesn't add real support.

### Conclusion:
Therefore, the string can be classified most accurately as primarily **<WCB>** (Insufficient Causal Basis) and secondarily as containing elements of **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason).
