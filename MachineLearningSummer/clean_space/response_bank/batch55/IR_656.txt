To apply the task of classifying the given string (which is <IDA>) by breaking it down into specific steps (which is <D>), we can follow the methodology referred to as <IDAA>. Here is a structured step-by-step approach to identify the type of defective argument in the given string:

### Step 1: Understand the Provided Argument
Examine the content and structure of the argument provided, which is:
```
"Issue A has been raised, and adequately answered.
 Issue B is then raised, and adequately answered.
 .....
 Issue Z is then raised, and adequately answered.
 (despite all issues adequately answered, the opponent refuses to concede or accept the argument."
```

### Step 2: Identify the Proposition and Reason
In this particular string:
- **Proposition (<P>)**: The argument implies that all issues raised have been addressed adequately.
- **Reason (<R>)**: Each issue from A to Z has been raised and adequately answered.

### Step 3: Classify any Supporting Information
Determine if there is a Proof of Reason (<PR>) and analyze its quality and nature if present. However, the provided argument focuses primarily on the process rather than offering explicit additional arguments as proof.

### Step 4: Examine the Argument for Defective Types
Now, evaluate the given argument against the defined defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument does not involve a generalization from a part to a whole. Not applicable here.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Since all issues are mentioned (A to Z) and claimed to be adequately answered, this type might be indirectly related if any potential issues are missing, but this is not explicitly clear from the argument itself.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The argument does not suggest that the reasons given are inconclusive; rather, it asserts that all answers were adequate.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument does not delve into the causal basis in-depth, so it's less about insufficient causality.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This argument doesn't repeat the proposition as the reason.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Here, the argument assumes all issues have been addressed adequately and implies frustration that the opponent won’t concede. This could hint at asserting a universal agreement on the adequacy of responses, potentially leading to <FU>.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The language in the argument seems clear, not suggesting ambiguity or multiple interpretations.

### Step 5: Decision
Based on the analysis, the most fitting classification in the context provided is **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**. The speaker assumes that because they believe every issue from A to Z has been adequately answered, it should be accepted universally, despite the opponent’s disbelief or refusal to concede.

### Conclusion
The argument can be classified under **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**:
- **Reason**: The statement assumes a consensus that all issues have been answered adequately without addressing why the opponent’s refusal to accept might still be valid, leading to the presumption that the opponent should agree.

Hence, applying <IDAA> to the provided text results in classifying it as <FU>.
