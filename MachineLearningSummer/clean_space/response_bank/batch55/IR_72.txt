For 
To apply IDAA (the application of task decomposition to identifying defective arguments) to the given statement, we'll decompose the advanced task (IDA) of classifying the argument type into specific steps. Let's identify and classify the defective argument present in the statement:

**Step 1:** Understand the Structure of the Argument
- Proposition (<P>): "I’m not going to talk to you."
- Reason (<R>): "My best friend says you’re a liar."

**Step 2:** Identify and Analyze the Defective Argument Type
- The statement claims an action ("I’m not going to talk to you") is justified based on the reason provided ("My best friend says you’re a liar").

**Step 3:** Check Against Each Defective Argument Type
1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - Is the proposition based on a generalization that might not apply universally? 
   - No, it does not generalize based on one or a few instances.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - Does it claim completeness without considering all possibilities?
   - No, there is no claim of complete enumeration of possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - Does the reason fail to conclusively support the proposition?
   - Yes. The fact that the speaker’s best friend claims the person is a liar does not conclusively prove the person is untrustworthy.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - Does the causal basis provided not compel belief in the proposition?
   - Yes. The opinion of a third party (the best friend) is not a compelling reason.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - Does the reason simply repeat the proposition?
   - No, the reason does not repeat the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - Is the reason assumed to be universally agreed upon without evidence?
   - No, it does not rely on universal consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
   - Is there ambiguity in language that could lead to misinterpretation?
   - No, the language used is clear and direct.

**Step 4:** Conclusion
- The most fitting classifications for the defective argument are Inconclusive Reason (IR) and Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).
- The reason provided ("My best friend says you’re a liar") is inconclusive and insufficient to support the proposition ("I’m not going to talk to you").

**Outcome:**
The statement "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you" involves defective arguments of type Inconclusive Reason (<IR>) and Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).

By decomposing the task, we have methodically determined that <IR> and <WCB> are the defective argument types present in the statement.
