For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the argument "Since many of the students at St. Cloud State University get A's, St. Cloud State must be a top-rated school," as a type of defective argument, we need to decompose the task into specific steps and classify the argument according to the defined types.

### Decomposition of the Task (IDAA to IDA):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Look for the main assertion or claim in the argument.
2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Identify the causal basis provided to support the proposition.
3. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types:**
   - Check if the proposition or reason falls into any of the defective argument types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).
4. **Classify the Defective Argument:**
   - Based on the analysis, classify the argument as one of the defective types.

### Step-by-Step Application:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Proposition (P): "St. Cloud State must be a top-rated school."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Reason (R): "Since many of the students at St. Cloud State University get A's."

3. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types:**

   - **Generalization (G):**
     - The argument depends on the performance of "many students" getting A's to conclude the overall rating of the school. This assertion is based on a part (students getting A's) and generalizes it to the whole institution.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
     - Not applicable here because the argument doesn't claim to have covered all possibilities but rather bases its conclusion on a specific observation.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
     - The reason provided (students getting A's) doesn't conclusively demonstrate that St. Cloud State is a top-rated school; there could be other factors influencing the grades received by students.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
     - The causality (students getting A's leading to a top-rated school) is not fully compelling because high grades alone do not provide a comprehensive basis for rating a school.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
     - The reason provided is not a repetition of the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
     - The argument doesn't rely on a presumed universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
     - There doesnâ€™t seem to be any ambiguity in language use apparent in this instance.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument:**
   - The argument can be categorized primarily as a Generalization (G) since it generalizes the academic performance of many students to the overall rating of the school.
   - Additionally, it can also be considered to involve an Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB) since the causal link between students getting A's and the school being top-rated is not necessarily strong or compelling.

### Conclusion
The argument "Since many of the students at St. Cloud State University get A's, St. Cloud State must be a top-rated school" can be classified as:
- **Generalization (G)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

These classifications highlight the argument's reliance on a specific observation to make a broad generalization and the weakness of the causal link it presents.
