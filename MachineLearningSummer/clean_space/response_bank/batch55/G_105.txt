For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument, IDA, into specific steps), we need to break down the task of classifying the given argument string into manageable parts. Here are the steps:

**Step-by-Step Decomposition:**

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):** Determine the main assertion or claim being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (R):** Determine the causal basis or reasoning provided to support the Proposition.
3. **Assess the Proof of Reason (PR):** Determine any additional supporting arguments or evidence provided to corroborate the Reason.

**Classification of Defective Arguments:**

4. **Check for Generalization (G):** Is the assertion based on a small sample trying to apply to all instances?
5. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Does the argument claim completeness but omit key possibilities?
6. **Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does the Reason fail to conclusively support the Proposition?
7. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the causal basis for the Reason weak or unconvincing?
8. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Does the Reason simply restate the Proposition without adding new information?
9. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Does the argument assume consensus without proper evidence?
10. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Is the language vague or open to multiple interpretations?

**Applying IDAA to the given string:**

**Given String:**
"The two courses I took at Harvard were not very interesting. I don't think it is a good university."

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**
- **P:** "I don't think it is a good university."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)**
- **R:** "The two courses I took at Harvard were not very interesting."

**Step 3: Assess the Proof of Reason (PR)**
- There are no additional arguments or evidence provided beyond the Reason given.

**Step 4: Check for Generalization (G)**
- This argument generalizes the quality of the entire Harvard University based on the experience from just two courses. This is indicative of Generalization (G).

**Step 5: Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- The argument does not claim completeness, so this defect does not apply.

**Step 6: Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- The Reason provided (two uninteresting courses) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition about the entire university's quality. This could also be categorized as Inconclusive Reason (IR).

**Step 7: Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- The Reason might be argued as weak, but it is more directly an issue of Generalization.

**Step 8: Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
- The Reason does not repeat the Proposition; it provides a basis for it.

**Step 9: Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
- No assumption of universal agreement here, so this does not apply.

**Step 10: Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**
- The language is not ambiguous; it clearly states the individual's limited experience and their conclusion.

**Conclusion/Classification:**
The given argument "The two courses I took at Harvard were not very interesting. I don't think it is a good university." is best classified as a Generalization (G) because it makes a sweeping judgment about the entire university based on a very limited sample size (two courses).
