Alright, let's apply IDAA to classify the given string "Don't listen to Senator Bob's opinion. He is a crook, and a spiteful loony man."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:
1. **Identify the Proposition (`<P>`)**: Determine the primary assertion or claim being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (`<R>`)**: Determine the causal basis or reason given to support the proposition.
3. **Evaluate for Defective Argument Types**: Check the identified `<P>` and `<R>` to see if they fit any defective argument types (`<G>`, `<FE>`, `<IR>`, `<RR>`, `<WCB>`, `<FU>`, or `<DEP>`).

### Applying the Steps:
1. **Identify the Proposition (`<P>`):**
   - In the given string, the proposition is: "Don't listen to Senator Bob's opinion."

2. **Identify the Reason (`<R>`):**
   - The reason given for the proposition is: "He is a crook, and a spiteful loony man."

3. **Evaluate for Defective Argument Types:**

   - **Generalization (`<G>`)**: This type would involve taking a part or majority and claiming it applies to all. The given string does not generalize about a group of things or people.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (`<FE>`)**: This would involve claiming to have considered all possibilities, but missing some. The given string does not enumerate possibilities at all.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (`<IR>`)**: This would involve providing a reason that does not sufficiently demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. Let's consider if the reason "He is a crook, and a spiteful loony man" inconclusively supports "Don't listen to Senator Bob's opinion." This could potentially fit as there is an ad hominem attack rather than providing substantive evidence against his opinion.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (`<WCB>`)**: While closely related to `<IR>`, this specifically refers to the weakness of the causal basis. The insults do not logically connect to why Bob's opinion should be discounted.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (`<RR>`)**: This would involve the reason essentially repeating the proposition. The string does not seem to be a repetition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (`<FU>`)**: This would involve assuming something is true because it is generally agreed upon. The given string does not assert universal consensus.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (`<DEP>`)**: This would involve words that can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended. The insults are clear and not ambiguous.

### Conclusion:
The most fitting classification for the given string is:
- **Inconclusive Reason (`<IR>`)**: The assertion that Senator Bob shouldn't be listened to based on calling him a "crook" and a "spiteful loony man" does not conclusively demonstrate why his opinions should be discounted.

Thus, applying IDAA to the given string results in the classification: **<IR>**.
