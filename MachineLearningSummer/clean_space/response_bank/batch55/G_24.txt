For 
To apply IDAA to classify the string "Saying things like 'ALL teenagers are irresponsible' would be an example of which type of fallacy?" step by step, we need to break down the task into more specific steps. Here we go:

### Step 1: Understand the String <s>
The string in this case is: "Saying things like 'ALL teenagers are irresponsible' would be an example of which type of fallacy?"

### Step 2: Analyze the Proposition Shared in the String
The proposition in the string suggests that making the statement "ALL teenagers are irresponsible" is an example of a specific type of fallacy.

### Step 3: Define the Target of Classification
Identify which type of defective argument (fallacy) category this statement falls into based on the definitions provided.

### Step 4: Match the Proposition to the Defective Argument Definitions
We need to examine each defective argument type and determine which one matches the defective argument implied by the proposition.

- **Generalization** (G): The argument asserts a property (irresponsibility) to all members of a group (teenagers) based on limited evidence.
- **Incomplete Enumeration** (FE): This involves claiming complete possibilities but missing out on pertinent ones. This does not apply since the proposition is not about missing options.
- **Inconclusive Reason** (IR), **Insufficient Causal Basis** (WCB), **Faulty Repetition of Proposition** (RR), **Presumptuous Consensus** (FU), and **Ambiguous Language Use** (DEP): These do not match with the concept of making a broad, unsupported statement about all teenagers.

### Step 5: Decide the Classification
Given the definitions and examining the string, the most fitting classification is:

- **Generalization (G)**

### Step 6: Confirm Classification
Review each definition to ensure that Generalization (G) is indeed the most appropriate classification for the given string. "All teenagers are irresponsible" is an example of asserting a property based on potentially limited evidence.

### Conclusion
The string "Saying things like 'ALL teenagers are irresponsible' would be an example of which type of fallacy?" falls into the category of **Generalization (G)**.
