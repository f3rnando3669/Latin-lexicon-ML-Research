For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of the decomposition of an advanced task into specific steps to the task of identifying a defective argument) to the given string, we first need to decompose the process into clear steps. Here's how we can approach it:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Propositions and Reasons**:
    - Identify any propositions (<P>), reasons (<R>), or proofs of reasons (<PR>) in the string.

2. **Classify the Argument Types**:
    - Determine if the identified arguments fit into any of the defective argument types: 
        - Generalization (<G>)
        - Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
        - Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
        - Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
        - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
        - Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
        - Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)

3. **Analyze the Context**:
    - Understand the context and implicit assumptions in the conversation.
    - See if the argument presented actually attempts to support a proposition or not.

4. **Determine the Specific Defective Argument Type**:
    - Based on steps 1-3, classify the argument.

Now, let's apply these steps to the given string:

### Given String:
"Daughter: Mom, I want that doll!
Mom: Let's get home and I'll get you a popsicle!
Daughter: Ooh, popsicle!"

#### Step 1: Identify the Propositions and Reasons
- **Proposition (<P>) by Daughter**: "I want that doll!"
- **Response by Mom**: "Let's get home and I'll get you a popsicle!" (which serves as a diversion rather than a reason)
- **Reaction by Daughter**: "Ooh, popsicle!" (distraction acceptance)

#### Step 2: Classify the Argument Types
- Mom’s response does not directly address the Daughter’s proposition but rather changes the subject to a different one without providing evidence or reason pertaining to the original proposition.

#### Step 3: Analyze the Context
- The conversation context is a child asking for something specific (the doll), and the parent's tactics to divert attention to an alternative (popsicle).

#### Step 4: Determine the Specific Defective Argument Type
- The defective nature here is that Mom completely shifts the focus away from the original proposition (“I want that doll!”) to a different topic (getting a popsicle). This does not fit into the exact predefined categories like <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP> since it’s more about a diversion tactic rather than a defective structure within an attempted argument.

### Conclusion:
The string does not contain a structured argument but rather a change of subject to divert attention. This diversion is not explicitly defined by the defective argument types provided, suggesting this example might represent a different kind of logical fallacy often called a "Red Herring", which isn't classified here but is pertinent to the analysis of arguments in general.

Given the categories defined, I will conclusively treat this as an instance of implicit Red Herring, which doesn’t fall precisely into any of the predefined defective classes but can be understood within the broader context of argument analysis.
