For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a string), we need to break down the task IDA (classifying the string) into specific steps and then execute those steps for the given string. Below is the step-by-step decomposition and classification process.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D)

1. **Identify the Proposition (P) in the string.**
2. **Identify the Reason (R) that supports the Proposition (P).**
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR) if it exists.**
4. **Check each component (P, R, PR) against the definitions of defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP):**
   - **Generalization (G):** Check if (P) is based on a small sample or generalizing improperly.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Check if (P) claims completeness but misses important elements.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Check if (R) does not conclusively support (P).
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Check if (R) is not compelling or causally weak.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Check if (R) simply repeats (P).
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Check if (PR) relies on the assumption of universal agreement on a disputable matter.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Check if (PR) can be interpreted in multiple ways than intended.

### Application of Decomposition to the Given String

Given string: "Certainly this is the case at most colleges in America nowadays"

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - The Proposition (P) here can be inferred as: "This is the case at most colleges in America nowadays." 
   - For clarity, "this is the case" would need a specific context to provide a concrete proposition. Without additional context, we'll assume "this" refers to a common condition or practice in American colleges.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - There is no explicit reasoning provided in the string itself. It lacks a causal basis (R) directly stated to support the proposition (P).

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - Since there is no explicit reason (R) provided, there can't be a proof of reason (PR) available in the string.

4. **Check against defective argument types:**
   - **Generalization (G):** The use of "most colleges in America" suggests a generalization. It is assuming that a condition widely applies without verifying the extent.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The string does not claim completeness of enumeration.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Since there is no explicit reason (R), we could consider this argument weaker, but the focus would be on its generalization.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Not applicable as there is no reason (R) provided.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Not applicable for the same reason as above.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** "Certainly" may imply a kind of consensus or self-evidence, but it doesn't assert universal agreement on a disputable matter explicitly.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** "Certainly" could introduce ambiguity about the level of agreement, but it's more critically a generalization issue.

### Classification
The closest defective argument type for the given string is **<G> (Generalization)**, because it makes a broad assertion about most colleges in America without providing specific evidence or reasoning, leading to an improper generalization.
