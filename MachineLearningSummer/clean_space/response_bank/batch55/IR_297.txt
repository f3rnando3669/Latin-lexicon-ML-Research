For 
To apply \(\text{IDAA}\) to the string "We must eliminate affirmative action. We can’t rely on laws to end racial prejudice.", we need to decompose the task of classifying the string into specific steps and then apply those steps systematically.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of \(\text{IDA}\) (\(D\)):

1. **Identify the Proposition (\(P\))**: Determine the main claim or what the argument is trying to prove.

2. **Identify the Reason (\(R\))**: Determine the basis or causal explanation provided for the proposition.

3. **Assess Defective Argument Types**: Evaluate if the reason (\(R\)) and proposition (\(P\)) fall into one of the defective argument types defined.

4. **Classify the String as a Defective Argument Type**: Based on the assessment, classify the argument into one of the defective argument types: \(\text{G}\), \(\text{FE}\), \(\text{IR}\), \(\text{RR}\), \(\text{WCB}\), \(\text{FU}\), or \(\text{DEP}\).

### Applying \(\text{IDAA}\) to the String:

1. **Identify the Proposition (\(P\))**:
   - The string is composed of two statements. The first statement "We must eliminate affirmative action" is presented as the main proposition (\(P\)). It is what the argument wants to prove.

2. **Identify the Reason (\(R\))**:
   - The second statement "We can’t rely on laws to end racial prejudice" is presented as the reason (\(R\)) for the proposition.

3. **Assess Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (\(\text{G}\))**: The reason is not a generalization.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (\(\text{FE}\))**: The argument does not claim to have made a complete enumeration of possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (\(\text{IR}\))**: Consider whether the reason provided conclusively supports the proposition.
     - The reason given, "We can’t rely on laws to end racial prejudice," does not directly and conclusively lead to eliminating affirmative action; there might be alternative measures or reasons to support affirmative action despite the claim about laws.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(\text{WCB}\))**: The causal link (reason) provided may not be compelling or sufficient.
     - The statement "We can’t rely on laws to end racial prejudice" does not necessarily imply that affirmative action must be eliminated. The causal basis seems insufficient.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(\text{RR}\))**: The reason does not repeat the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (\(\text{FU}\))**: The reason does not claim a universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (\(\text{DEP}\))**: There does not appear to be ambiguous language in this context.

4. **Classify the String as a Defective Argument Type**:
   - The argument appears to fall into the category of **Inconclusive Reason** (\(\text{IR}\)) and possibly **Insufficient Causal Basis** (\(\text{WCB}\)) and upon further analysis, it leans more towards \(\text{IR}\) as the reason given is not conclusively supporting the proposition. The causal basis given isn't necessarily a compelling reason to eliminate affirmative action.

### Conclusion:
The string "We must eliminate affirmative action. We can’t rely on laws to end racial prejudice." is classified primarily as an **Inconclusive Reason** (\(\text{IR}\)), as the reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
