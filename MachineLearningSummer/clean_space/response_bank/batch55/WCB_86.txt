Sure, let's break down the task of classifying the given string "The accident was caused by the taxi parking in the street" as part of the <IDAA> approach, where we decompose the task of identifying the defective argument into specific steps.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
First, we need to identify the main assertion that the argument is trying to prove.

- **Proposition <P>:** "The accident was caused by the taxi parking in the street."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
Next, we look for any causal basis or reasoning that establishes the truth of the Proposition.

- **Reason <R>:** In this case, the Reason seems to be embedded in the Proposition itself, suggesting a cause-effect relationship without further elaboration.

### Step 3: Identify Proof of Reason <PR>
Examine if there are additional arguments corroborating the Reason.

- **Proof of Reason <PR>:** The statement does not provide any additional arguments or evidence corroborating the Reason.

### Step 4: Evaluate the Reason <R> and Proof of Reason <PR>
We need to check the validity and strength of the Reason and the Proof of Reason.

#### (a) Check for Generalization <G>
- Does the argument draw a conclusion about all accidents from a single incident? No.
  
#### (b) Check for Incomplete Enumeration <FE>
- Does the argument claim to enumerate all possible causes but misses out on some? Not directly, as it's not mentioning other causes.

#### (c) Check for Inconclusive Reason <IR>
- Does the Reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the Proposition? Yes. The mere statement that the accident was caused by the taxi parking in the street does not conclusively prove the causation without more context or evidence.

#### (d) Check for Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>
- Is the causal basis weak or unpersuasive? Yes. The Reason provided does not seem to be inherently strong without additional context or evidence.

#### (e) Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>
- Does the Reason repeat the Proposition without adding new information? Partially. The statement itself is circular in nature but doesn't add any new causal explanation.

#### (f) Check for Presumptuous Consensus <FU>
- Does the argument assume a consensus on a disputed point? No indication of this.

#### (g) Check for Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>
- Can the statement be taken in another sense than intended? Not obviously.

### Conclusion
Based on the steps, we have identified the following:

The statement "The accident was caused by the taxi parking in the street" falls into two main defective arguments:
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** The Reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the Proposition.
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The causal basis presented is weak and unpersuasive without more context or evidence.

### Final Classification
- **Classified as <IR> and <WCB>.**

The argument provided is defective primarily due to having an inconclusive reason and insufficient causal basis.
