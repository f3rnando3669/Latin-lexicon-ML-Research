To apply IDAA to the task of classifying the given string "You know Jane Fonda’s exercise video’s must be worth the money. Look at the great shape she’s in," we will follow a step-by-step approach to decompose and analyze the argument type. Here’s how we can break it down:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - **Proposition:** "Jane Fonda’s exercise video’s must be worth the money."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - **Reason:** "Look at the great shape she’s in."

3. **Examine the type of Reason and correlation to the Proposition:**
   - The reason provided mentions Jane Fonda’s physical shape as the basis for claiming the worth of her exercise videos.
   - We need to determine if this reason conclusively supports the proposition.

4. **Classify the type of defective argument (if any):**
   - The argument implies that because Jane Fonda is in great shape, her exercise videos must be effective or worth the money.
   
5. **Check for common defects:**
   - **Generalization (G):** Whether the assertion covers all pertinent cases based on only one individual.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Whether the argument misses out on other possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Whether the reason provided does not conclusively establish the truth of the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Whether the causal basis presented is compelling.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Whether the reason merely repeats the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Whether the proof is assumed due to universal agreement which is actually in dispute.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Whether the proof can be taken in another sense than intended.

Considering the reason does not conclusively demonstrate that the exercise videos are worth the money and relies on an implied correlation between Jane Fonda's fitness and the effectiveness of her videos without establishing causation, let’s focus on whether the Reason is conclusively strong:

6. **Final Classification:**
   - The given argument falls under **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** as the proposition “Jane Fonda’s exercise video’s must be worth the money” is supported by a reason – “Look at the great shape she’s in,” which does not conclusively demonstrate the effectiveness of the video itself. Her personal fitness might result from other factors unrelated to the videos she promotes or sells.

**Conclusion:**

Applying IDAA, we classify the given string as a type of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
