For 
To apply the process of IDAA to the statement "You should never break traffic laws." "Who are you to speak? You've gotten over fifteen speeding tickets!" we need to decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps and then go through each step methodically.

**Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of the Task (IDA)**:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine the main statement or claim that is intended to be proven.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Identify the causal basis or justification for the proposition.
3. **Identify Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Identify any supporting arguments that further corroborate the Reason.
4. **Classify the Argument**: Compare the identified components with the defined defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) to determine the classification.

**Application of Decomposition (D) to the given argument**:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - The proposition here is: "You should never break traffic laws."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - There is no explicit reason given to support the proposition in the initial statement. Instead, there is a refutation or counter-argument presented: "Who are you to speak? You've gotten over fifteen speeding tickets!"

3. **Identify Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - There is no explicit proof of reason provided here since the argument presented is not supporting the proposition, but rather attacking the person making the claim.

4. **Classify the Argument**:
   - The argument “Who are you to speak? You've gotten over fifteen speeding tickets!” appears to be attacking the person making the initial claim rather than addressing the claim itself. This is typically classified as an **ad hominem** argument. However, based on the types of defective arguments defined, it needs to be matched to one of those types specifically.
   - This is best classified as **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the refutation does not address whether the proposition "You should never break traffic laws" is true or false. Instead, it attacks the credibility of the person making the assertion without directly engaging with the actual argument.

Therefore, the argument provided ("You should never break traffic laws." "Who are you to speak? You've gotten over fifteen speeding tickets!") falls under <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), according to the provided classifications.
