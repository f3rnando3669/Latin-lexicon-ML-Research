For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as a defective argument type) to the statement "Dr. Bloom cannot be a competent marriage counselor because he is divorced," we need to break down the task into specific steps to analyze and classify the argument. Here is the step-by-step process:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P) and Reason (R) in the Argument:**
   - **Proposition (P):** "Dr. Bloom cannot be a competent marriage counselor."
   - **Reason (R):** "He is divorced."

2. **Evaluate the Reason (R) in the Context of the Proposition (P):**
   - Analyze the causal basis for the reason: The reason given is that Dr. Bloom is divorced.
   - Check if this reason establishes the truth of the proposition: The argument implies that being divorced inherently disqualifies someone from being a competent marriage counselor.

3. **Determine if the Reason (R) is Conclusive and Relevant:**
   - Does the reason (R) conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (P)? 
     - No, it does not. Being divorced does not necessarily impact someone's professional competence as a marriage counselor.
   
4. **Check for Defective Argument Types (IDA):**
   - **Generalization (G):** The argument does not generalize from a sample to a whole population.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument does not miss out on enumerating other possibilities; it does not involve enumeration.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Yes, the argument is based on a reason that does not conclusively establish the proposition. Being divorced does not inherently imply incompetence as a marriage counselor.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Yes, the causal basis (divorce) submitted for the proposition is weak and not compelling.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The argument does not simply repeat the proposition as its reason.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument does not involve an assumed universal consensus.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The argument does not involve ambiguous language or a term that could be taken in another sense.

5. **Classify the Defective Argument (IDA):**
   - The argument is classified as an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the reason provided (Dr. Bloom being divorced) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (that he cannot be a competent marriage counselor).
   - Additionally, it could be considered as having an **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because the causal basis (divorce) is not a compelling reason to support the proposition.

6. **Final Classification:**
   - The defective argument in the statement "Dr. Bloom cannot be a competent marriage counselor because he is divorced" primarily falls under **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, and secondarily under **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

By applying IDAA, we have decomposed the task of classifying the argument and determined that the statement exhibits the defective argument types of an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and an **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
