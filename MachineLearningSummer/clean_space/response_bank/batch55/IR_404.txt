For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) (the application of decomposition \( D \) to the task of classifying a defective argument \( IDA \)) to the given argument:

**Given Argument:**
"If there is objective morality, then good moral behavior will be rewarded after death. I want to be rewarded; therefore, morality must be objective."

**Step-by-Step Decomposition and Classification:**

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( P \)):**
   - The Proposition (\( P \)) is the statement we intend to prove or assert.
   - In this case, the Proposition is: "Morality must be objective."

2. **Identify the Reason (\( R \)):**
   - The Reason (\( R \)) sets forth the causal basis for \( P \), establishing what we are urging.
   - Here, the Reason is: "I want to be rewarded."

3. **Determine if there is a Proof of Reason (\( PR \)):**
   - \( PR \) corroborates the Reason with additional arguments.
   - Here, there is no additional argument presented to support the Reason "I want to be rewarded."

4. **Evaluate for Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (\( G \)):** Assertion based on some part or majority and not necessarily applicable to all.
     - Not applicable here as the argument does not involve an improper generalization.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (\( FE \)):** Claiming a complete enumeration of possibilities but missing some.
     - Not applicable here as the argument does not attempt to enumerate possibilities.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \)):** Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.
     - Applicable. The Reason "I want to be rewarded" does not provide conclusive evidence that "Morality must be objective."
   
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \)):** Weak causal basis for the Proposition.
     - Applicable. The desire for a reward is not a sufficiently compelling reason to establish the objectivity of morality.
   
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( RR \)):** Reason says precisely the same as the Proposition.
     - Not applicable here as the Reason is not a verbatim repetition of the Proposition.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (\( FU \)):** Presumes something is certain because it is "universally agreed upon."
     - Not applicable here since the argument does not rely on universal agreement.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (\( DEP \)):** Proof of Reason can be taken in another sense than intended.
     - Not applicable here since the Reason "I want to be rewarded" is clear in its intended meaning.

5. **Final Classification:**
   - The argument primarily suffers from two defective argument types:
     - **Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \))**: because the Reason ("I want to be rewarded") does not logically support the Proposition.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \))**: because wanting to be rewarded is not a compelling causal basis to claim morality is objective.

In conclusion, the given argument can be classified under \( \text{IR} \) (Inconclusive Reason) and \( \text{WCB} \) (Insufficient Causal Basis).
