To apply the decomposition of the task of classifying the provided string as one of the defective argument types, we will follow the specific steps set by <D> to perform <IDA> on the given string. The steps will include breaking down the argument, analyzing each part, and then determining which type of defective argument it might be.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Analysis (IDAA)

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**
Identify the main assertion being made. The argument's main claim is:
- **Proposition (P):** "Surely he must have had some vision of Hitler!"

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)**
Determine the causal basis for the Proposition:
- **Reason (R):** "The “prophet” Nostradamus wrote about 500 years ago: Beasts wild with hunger will cross the rivers, The greater part of the battle will be against Hister. He will cause great men to be dragged in a cage of iron, When the son of Germany obeys no law."

**Step 3: Proof of Reason (PR)**
Look for additional arguments that corroborate the Reason provided. In this case, the argument does not present further proving statements, so we assume this step is skipped.

**Step 4: Check the Defective Argument Types**
Now evaluate if the argument fits any defective types.

### Analysis of Defective Argument Types

1. **Generalization (G):** No generalization is made from a specific instance to the whole.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument does not attempt to list all possibilities; thus, IE is not applicable.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The Reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition. It corresponds events from the writing of Nostradamus to Hitler without conclusive evidence.
4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The Reason is not a repetition of the Proposition.
5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis (the lines written by Nostradamus) is weak for establishing vision of Hitler.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument does not claim universal agreement.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language in Nostradamus' writing is ambiguous, and the interpretation could differ from the intention.

**Step 5: Classification**
Evaluate which classification is most appropriate.
- Given the causal connection proposed (that Nostradamus had a vision of Hitler) is extremely weak and not compelling, and the Reason (R) does not conclusively establish the Proposition (P), and the language in PR can be interpreted variously, we find both **WCB (Weak Causal Basis)** and **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use)** as fitting:
  - Primary defect: **WCB**
  - Secondary defect: **DEP**

### Conclusion

The argument provided has an **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** as it fails to provide a robust causal basis for the Proposition, along with **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)** due to the nature of Nostradamus' writings being open to multiple interpretations and potentially meaning something entirely different.

By performing these steps and analysis, we classify the argument primarily as **WCB** with a secondary possible classification of **DEP**.
