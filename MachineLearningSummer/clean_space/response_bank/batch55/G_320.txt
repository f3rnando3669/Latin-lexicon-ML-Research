For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument into specific steps) to the given statement "Annie must like Starbucks because all white girls like Starbucks," we need to break down the process into individual steps and analyze the argument to classify it into one of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>). Here we go step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
**Proposition (<P>)**: "Annie must like Starbucks."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
**Reason (<R>)**: "All white girls like Starbucks."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Argument for Completeness
We need to determine whether the Reason (<R>) provided is sufficient, complete, and properly substantiated.

### Step 4: Look for Defective Argument Types

- **Generalization (<G>)**: 
  - Definition: When the <P> is an assertion based on some one part or on a majority of individuals, but not necessarily applicable to all, is referred to all.
  - Analysis: The statement "all white girls like Starbucks" is a sweeping generalization based on a stereotype and not necessarily true for every individual categorized under "white girls." This forms the basis for the Proposition.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: 
  - Definition: When we claim to have made a complete enumeration of the possibilities but actually miss out on some pertinent ones.
  - Analysis: We do not claim to have made an enumeration here.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: 
  - Definition: When <R> does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the <P>.
  - Analysis: It can be further checked.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: 
  - Definition: When a <R> is weak if the causal basis which it submits for the <P> is not a compelling one.
  - Analysis: The reason "all white girls like Starbucks" is weak and not compelling as it is a stereotype.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: 
  - Definition: When a <R> is weak when it appears to be presented as the <R>, but says precisely the same as was said in the <P>.
  - Analysis: Here, <R> is not the same as <P>.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: 
  - Definition: When a <PR> is assumed as certain, on the ground that "it is universally agreed upon," a thing which is still in dispute.
  - Analysis: Thereâ€™s no "universally agreed upon" point here, but an assumption.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: 
  - Definition: When a <PR> can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended.
  - Analysis: This does not apply here; there is no ambiguity in the language.

### Step 5: Final Classification
Given the analysis above, the most fitting defective argument type based on the reason provided in the argument ( "all white girls like Starbucks") is **Generalization (<G>)**. This reason generalizes a stereotype to all individuals within a group and uses that as the basis for the proposition.

**Conclusion:** The statement "Annie must like Starbucks because all white girls like Starbucks" is classified as **Generalization (<G>)**.
