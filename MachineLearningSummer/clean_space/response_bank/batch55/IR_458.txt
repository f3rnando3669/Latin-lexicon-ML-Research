For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string ", rather than considering the content of what the person is saying?", let's proceed step-by-step to classify the string using the specified defective argument types. Here is the decomposition and subsequent application:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D)
1. **Extract the Context and Content**: Understanding the specific context or argument that the string is a part of.
2. **Identify the Part of the Argument**: Determine if the string primarily represents a Proposition (P), Reason (R), or Proof of Reason (PR).
3. **Analyze Each Defective Argument Type**: Compare the characteristics of the string with each defective argument type to classify it accurately.

### Execution of Steps 

1. **Context and Content**:
   - The string ", rather than considering the content of what the person is saying?" appears to be an excerpt from a larger argument. The context is needed to fully understand how it fits, but we can infer that it critiques a focus shift from the content of the argument to something else.

2. **Identify the Part of the Argument**:
   - This string doesn't clearly establish a Proposition, Reason, or Proof of Reason on its own. It seems more like a fragment critiquing an approach or strategy within an argument. Given this critique nature, it's likely part of an overall Reason (R).

3. **Analyze Each Defective Argument Type**:

    - **Generalization (G)**: The statement itself doesn’t make a generalization.
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement doesn't enumerate options or possibilities, so it’s not an incomplete enumeration.
    - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The statement seems to criticize a failure in reasoning, questioning focusing elsewhere instead of content. This points towards implying another method is improper without decisively establishing why the content should take precedence. However, it's more contextual.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This could potentially fit if it’s part of an argument where the Reason provided does not compellingly establish the cause-effect for considering content over something else.
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The statement does not reiterate the same point as a given Proposition.
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The statement doesn’t appeal to universal agreement but implies a neglect in considering certain aspects.
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The statement is relatively clear in its intent to focus on considering the content, not ambiguous per se.

Based on this analysis, the string seems to critique a reasoning approach but is somewhat fragmented without a fuller context. Given the closest classification, we might consider:

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: If the statement is implying an inadequate basis for dismissing the content without further compelling reasons.
2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Since it critiques a mental shift without conclusively demonstrating why the content should warrant focused consideration.

Let's classify as **<IR>** in the strongest interpreted form:
   - The phrase critiques an argumentative strategy without conclusively proving why the focus should remain on the content.

Thus, ", rather than considering the content of what the person is saying?" could be classified as **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** when interpreting as part of a critique in reasoning within a larger argument.
