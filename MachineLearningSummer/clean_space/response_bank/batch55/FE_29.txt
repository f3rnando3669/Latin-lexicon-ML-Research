For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposing a given task into specific steps) to the task of classifying a statement as one of the defective argument types, we need to break down the process of identifying the defect in the given statement. Here’s a step-by-step decomposition of the task followed by the actual analysis:

**Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDA (Identify Defective Argument):**

1. **Understand the Statement**:
   - Parse the statement to understand the proposition and the reasoning provided.

2. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - Extract the central assertion or claim made in the statement.

3. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - Determine if there is a rationale given to support the proposition.

4. **Check for Types of Defective Arguments**:
   - Compare the statement against each type of defective argument: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

5. **Assign Classification**:
   - Based on the identified defects, classify the statement into one of the defective argument types.

**Analysis of the given statement:**

"The only solutions I can see to climate change is either mass extinction of humans, or passing this green bill."

1. **Understand the Statement**:
   - The statement suggests that there are only two possible solutions to climate change: mass extinction of humans or passing a specific green bill.

2. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - P: "The only solutions to climate change are mass extinction of humans, or passing this green bill."

3. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - R: "I can see" implies that the claim is based on the speaker's perception or understanding.

4. **Check for Types of Defective Arguments**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: Not applicable as it does not make a general claim based on some part or majority but not necessarily applicable to all.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Applicable because the proposition claims to have made a complete enumeration of the possible solutions to climate change but does not consider other potential solutions.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Not necessarily applicable as there’s not enough detail to conclude if the reason provided is inconclusive by itself.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Could be relevant since the reliance on personal viewpoint ("I can see") is not a compelling causal basis for the proposition.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Not applicable because the reasoning is different from the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Not applicable since the statement is not claiming universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Not evidently ambiguous, although subjective "I can see" might imply some ambiguity in rationale.

5. **Assign Classification**:
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement implies a complete enumeration of solutions but fails to consider other viable options to address climate change.

Therefore, the given statement "The only solutions I can see to climate change is either mass extinction of humans, or passing this green bill." falls under the defective argument type **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**.
