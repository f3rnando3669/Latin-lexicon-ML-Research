For 
To apply IDAA to classify the argument "I called my friend and he didn't answer. He wasn't home or he was dead." as of type <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>, we'll decompose the task into specific steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: This is the main claim or assertion that we intend to prove.
   
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: This is the causal basis or reasoning that supports the Proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**: These are additional arguments or evidence that corroborate the Reason.

4. **Match the argument with defective argument types**: Evaluate whether the identified parts fit any of the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

Let's go through these steps in detail.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)

In the given argument:

- **Statement**: "I called my friend and he didn't answer. He wasn't home or he was dead."
- **Proposition (P)**: "He wasn't home or he was dead."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)

- **Reason (R)**: "I called my friend and he didn't answer."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)

- **Proof of Reason (PR)**: This isn't explicitly provided in the argument. The argument lacks any further evidence to reinforce the Reason.

### Step 4: Match the argument with defective argument types

Given the analysis, the next step is to match the argument with the provided defective argument types:

- **Generalization (G)**: This doesn't apply because it doesn't involve making a broad assertion based on a single instance or incomplete set of instances.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This could be applicable because the Proposition (P) (i.e., "He wasn't home or he was dead") does not consider all possible reasons he didn't answer the phone (he could be asleep, his phone could be off, he could be ignoring the call, etc.).
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This also might apply because the Reason (R) ("I called my friend and he didn't answer") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition (P) ("He wasn't home or he was dead").
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This isn't the strongest classification because it's more about the quality of the causal basis being weak rather than incomplete.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This doesn't apply; the Reason (R) and the Proposition (P) are not the same.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This does not apply because there's no mention of universal agreement or assumption that the proposition is agreed upon.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: This doesn't necessarily apply because there is no indication that the language used is ambiguous or can be taken in another sense.

### Conclusion

The most fitting classification for the argument "I called my friend and he didn't answer. He wasn't home or he was dead." is:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The Proposition (P) incorrectly claims completeness by listing only two possibilities when there could be many other reasons why the friend didn't answer the call.

Therefore, the argument type is <FE>.
