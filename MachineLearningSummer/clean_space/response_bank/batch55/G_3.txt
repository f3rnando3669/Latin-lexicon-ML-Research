For 
To apply IDAA to the given string "Christine has a terrible experience with a boyfriend. She decides that all boys are mean. This is an example of which logical fallacy?", we need to decompose the task of classifying the given argument into specific steps, and then systematically identify which defective argument type it fits.

### Decomposition (D) of the Task (IDA)
1. **Step 1: Understand the Argument.**
   - Identify the proposition (P).
   - Identify the reason (R).

2. **Step 2: Map the Argument Components.**
   - Identify if there is an explicit Proof of Reason (PR), if applicable.

3. **Step 3: Analyze the Argument for Defects.**
   - Check for Generalization (G).
   - Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE).
   - Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR).
   - Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR).
   - Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).
   - Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU).
   - Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

4. **Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type.**
   - Identify which category the argument fits based on the earlier analysis.

### Applying IDAA to the Example

**Step 1: Understand the Argument**

- **Proposition (P):** "All boys are mean."
- **Reason (R):** "Christine has a terrible experience with a boyfriend."

**Step 2: Map the Argument Components**

- In this argument, there isn't an explicit Proof of Reason (PR); the claim is based directly on the single instance of Christine's experience.

**Step 3: Analyze the Argument for Defects**

- **Generalization (G):** The proposition (P) "All boys are mean" is derived from the experience of one individual (Christine’s boyfriend). This broad conclusion is based on a limited sample.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This doesn't apply as there is no enumeration of possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This isn't applicable as the reason isn't simply repeating the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis might be compelling to Christine, but it actually lacks sufficient basis in this context.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There's no appeal to a universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The terms aren’t ambiguous.

**Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type**

Based on the analysis, the argument "Christine has a terrible experience with a boyfriend. She decides that all boys are mean." fits the category of Generalization (G). Christine’s conclusion about all boys based on her limited experience with one is a classic example of a hasty generalization.

### Conclusion
The classification of the argument type for the given string is:
**Generalization (G)**.
