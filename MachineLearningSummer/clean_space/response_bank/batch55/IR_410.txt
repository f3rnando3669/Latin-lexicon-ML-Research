Sure! Let's apply the process of decomposing the classification of the defective argument step-by-step to determine which specific type of defective argument "Lisa was brainwashed as a child into thinking that people are generally good. Therefore, people are not generally good." falls into.

### Step 1: Identify and summarize the Proposition (<P>)
- **Proposition (<P>)**: "People are not generally good."

### Step 2: Identify and summarize the Reason (<R>)
- **Reason (<R>)**: "Lisa was brainwashed as a child into thinking that people are generally good."

### Step 3: Evaluate if the indicated Reason (<R>) supports the Proposition (<P>) appropriately.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - **Check**: Is the assertion based on one part or the majority and generalized to all?
   - **Observation**: This doesn't seem to be a generalization based on a part applied to the whole population.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - **Check**: Are there possibilities unconsidered?
   - **Observation**: Argument isn’t about enumerating possibilities, so it doesn’t look like an incomplete enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - **Check**: Does the Reason conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition?
   - **Observation**: The base assertion makes a personal anecdote ("Lisa was brainwashed") and uses it as "proof" for the broader statement ("people are not generally good").
   
   - **Analysis**: The reason doesn't conclusively prove the Proposition; it fails to logically connect Lisa's belief with the general statement about people's goodness.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - **Check**: Is the causal basis compelling enough?
   - **Observation**: The link is weak and lacks proper rationale connecting the proposition; the anecdote is not a strong cause for the general claim.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - **Check**: Is the Reason simply a repetition of the Proposition?
   - **Observation**: Reason vs. Proposition in this case are not repetitions, so it’s not a faulty repetition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - **Check**: Is it claiming something is universally agreed upon, which is still in dispute?
   - **Observation**: There is no mention of universal agreement or consensus fallacy in argument.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
   - **Check**: Is the argument taking advantage of ambiguous language?
   - **Observation**: Language used ("brainwashed", "generally good") isn’t particularly ambiguous in the context they are used.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the specific defective argument classification for "Lisa was brainwashed as a child into thinking that people are generally good. Therefore, people are not generally good." is best described as **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**. The reason (Lisa's childhood brainwashing) does not conclusively establish the correctness of the proposition (people are not generally good).
