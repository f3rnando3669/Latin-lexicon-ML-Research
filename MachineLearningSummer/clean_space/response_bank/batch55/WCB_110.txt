For 
In order to apply IDAA to the statement "Every girl I've dated has been a nurse. I must only be compatible with nurses!", let's break down the task of classifying this defective argument into specific steps:

### Step-by-Step Breakdown (<D> of <t>):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**
4. **Analyze the Argument for Defective Types**
   - Check for Generalization (<G>)
   - Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
   - Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
   - Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
   - Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
   - Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
   - Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)

### Application of <IDAA> to the Given Statement:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- **Proposition: "I must only be compatible with nurses."**
  - This is the assertion the speaker intends to prove.

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- **Reason: "Every girl I've dated has been a nurse."**
  - This sets forth the causal basis for the proposition.

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- There isn't an explicit Proof of Reason provided in the sentence, as no additional arguments or evidence beyond the personal dating experience are mentioned.

#### Step 4: Analyze the Argument for Defective Types
1. **Check for Generalization (<G>)**
   - The statement generalizes compatibility with nurses based on limited individual experiences.
   - **Conclusion: Likely fits <G> (Generalization)**

2. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
   - The statement does not claim to consider all possibilities explicitly, but it implicitly assumes completeness by concluding compatibility with only nurses based on a small sample size.
   - **Conclusion: Could also fit <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**

3. **Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
   - There is an assumption that dating nurses is indicative of broader compatibility without conclusive evidence.
   - **Conclusion: Fits <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**

4. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
   - The causal link between dating nurses and being compatible only with nurses is weak.
   - **Conclusion: Fits <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**

5. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**
   - The reason and the proposition are not mere repetitions of each other.
   - **Conclusion: Does not fit <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**

6. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
   - There is no mention of universal agreement or a broad consensus basis for the proof.
   - **Conclusion: Does not fit <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**

7. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**
   - The terms and reasoning do not exhibit significant ambiguity.
   - **Conclusion: Does not fit <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**

### Final Classification
The statement "Every girl I've dated has been a nurse. I must only be compatible with nurses!" primarily fits the following defective argument types:
- **Generalization (<G>)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**

Therefore, the most fitting classification is:
- **<G> (Generalization)**
- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**
