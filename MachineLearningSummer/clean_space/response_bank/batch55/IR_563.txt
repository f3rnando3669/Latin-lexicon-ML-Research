For 
To apply IDAA (the application of the decomposition of an advanced task into specific steps) to IDA (the task of classifying a string into one of the designated defective argument types) for the given string, we should follow a systematic process to break down and analyze the argument. We'll break this down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - State the main assertion or claim that the argument is trying to establish.
   - In the given string: "Clearly, riding a skateboard is extremely dangerous." is the primary assertion.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Determine what causal basis or rationale is being provided in support of the <P>.
   - In the given string: "Sometimes kids ride skateboards and fall off, breaking their arms or legs." is the reason provided to support the <P>.

3. **Analyze the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - Check if additional arguments or evidence is provided to support the <R>.
   - In the given string: There isn’t an explicit additional proof provided beyond the initial example of kids falling off skateboards and injuring themselves.

4. **Classify the Argument Type**:
   - Using the definitions of the defective argument types, determine which type fits the given argument best.

Let's break this down further:

### Step 1:
Identify <P>:
- Proposition: "Clearly, riding a skateboard is extremely dangerous."

### Step 2:
Identify <R>:
- Reason: "Sometimes kids ride skateboards and fall off, breaking their arms or legs."

### Step 3:
Analyze <PR>:
- The argument doesn't provide further proof beyond the example given in the Reason.

### Step 4:
Classify the Argument Type:
- Generalization (<G>): This type arises when a proposition is based on a sample and generalized to all.
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>): This occurs when all possibilities are claimed but not enumerated.
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>): Applicable when the reason fails to conclusively support the proposition.
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>): When the provided causal basis is not strong enough.
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>): When the reason repeats the proposition in different words.
- Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>): When a proof is assumed due to supposed universal agreement.
- Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>): When the proof can be interpreted differently than intended.

The given argument can be best classified under **Generalization (<G>)** for the following reason:
- The Reason ("Sometimes kids ride skateboards and fall off, breaking their arms or legs.") is an observation based on specific instances.
- The Proposition ("Clearly, riding a skateboard is extremely dangerous.") is then applied universally.

### Conclusion:
The string "Sometimes kids ride skateboards and fall off, breaking their arms or legs. Clearly, riding a skateboard is extremely dangerous. Don’t you think skateboards should be banned?" should be classified as **<G> (Generalization)**.
