For 
To apply IDAA, or the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument, to the given argument "It is either you are for the US war on terror or against it," we break it down systematically into specific steps to determine which type of defective argument it belongs to. Here are the steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition: "You are either for the US war on terror or against it."

2. **Determine if it sets forth a causal basis (<R>) for the Proposition:**
   - There is no explicit causal basis given for this proposition. It simply presents a binary choice without providing any underlying rationale or cause.

3. **Check if there are additional arguments provided to support the Reason (Proof of Reason <PR>):**
   - There are no additional arguments presented in this statement. It's a standalone proposition.

4. **Evaluate if the argument is defective and classify it as one of the types:**
   - Generalization (<G>): The argument does not generalize based on some parts to all; it presents a binary choice.
   - Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>): This argument presents a binary choice and implicitly claims exhaustiveness, which may miss out on other pertinent possibilities. 
   - Inconclusive Reason (<IR>): There's no reason given in the argument. 
   - Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>): No causal basis is provided.
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>): The argument itself just states the proposition without a repetition.
   - Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>): The argument does not assume consensus; it presents a forced choice.
   - Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>): The language is not ambiguous; it's clear but oversimplifies choices.

After identifying and evaluating the elements, we find:

The argument "It is either you are for the US war on terror or against it" most closely fits the defective argument type **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**. This is because it presents a dichotomy by asserting that there are only two possible options (for or against the US war on terror), disregarding other nuanced positions that may exist.
