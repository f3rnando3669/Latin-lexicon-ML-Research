For 
To apply the decomposition of the advanced task \( <t> \) into specific steps (\( <D> \)) to the task of classifying a defective argument (\( <IDA> \)), we shall follow a systematic approach. The goal is to identify the defects in the argument provided.

Given the statement: "Supreme Court Justice Byron White was an All-American football player while in college, so how can you say that athletes are dumb?"

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( P \))**:
   - The statement implies a proposition that athletes are not dumb.

2. **Identify the Reason (\( R \))** that supports the Proposition:
   - The reason provided is that Supreme Court Justice Byron White was an All-American football player, which is used to imply intelligence.

3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (\( PR \))**:
   - In this case, the proof of reason is the mention of Byron White's achievements to counter the statement that athletes are dumb.

4. **Analyze Possible Defective Argument Types**:
   - We will now determine if any of the defective argument types \(<G>\), \(<FE>\), \(<IR>\), \(<RR>\), \(<WCB>\), \(<FU>\), and \(<DEP>\) apply to the argument.

### Analysis Against Defective Argument Types

1. **Generalization (\\<G\\>)**:
   - The argument generalizes from a single example (Byron White) to refute a claim about all athletes. 
   - This fits the definition of \(<G>\), where an assertion based on one individual is applied to the entire group.
   
   Therefore, the argument can be classified as \(<G>\).

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\\<FE\\>)**:
   - The argument does not attempt to list all possible intelligent athletes, so this defect is not directly applicable here.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (\\<IR\\>)**:
   - The reason provides an example but does not conclusively demonstrate that all athletes are not dumb. This fits, but not as directly as \(<G>\).

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\\<WCB\\>)**:
   - The causal basis is weak because the intelligence of Byron White does not provide a compelling basis for arguing the intelligence of all athletes.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\\<RR\\>)**:
   - The reason is not simply a repetition of the proposition in this case.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\\<FU\\>)**:
   - There is no appeal to universal agreement in the provided argument.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\\<DEP\\>)**:
   - There is no ambiguity in language in this argument.

### Conclusion

The best classification for this argument, based on the analysis, is Generalization (\( <G> \)): "The argument concludes that athletes are not dumb based on the intelligence of one individual, Supreme Court Justice Byron White."

Thus, applying \( <IDAA> \) to the given statement:

"Supreme Court Justice Byron White was an All-American football player while in college, so how can you say that athletes are dumb?" 

results in the classification of the argument as \( <G> \).
