Sure, we will perform the task of classifying the defective argument in the string "How would you know anything about technology? You're too old!" using the steps of decomposing the advanced task into specific steps (IDAA).

### Step-by-Step Breakdown of IDAA

1. **Identify the Proposition (\<P\>):**
   - Determine what specific statement is being made or implied in the argument.

2. **Identify the Reason (\<R\>):**
   - Identify the causal basis or the reasoning provided to support the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\<PR\>):**
   - Look for additional arguments or evidence that corroborate the given reason.

4. **Classify the Argument:**
   - Check if the string falls under one of the defective argument types: \<G\>, \<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<WCB\>, \<RR\>, \<FU\>, or \<DEP\>

Now, let's apply these steps to the given string:

### Analysis

1. **Identify the Proposition (\<P\>):**
   - Proposition: "You don't know anything about technology."

2. **Identify the Reason (\<R\>):**
   - Reason: "You're too old."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\<PR\>):**
   - There is no additional proof provided to corroborate the reason mentioned.

### Step-by-Step Classification

1. **Generalization (\<G\>):**
   - Does the argument make an assertion based on a subset but apply it universally to all? 
   - No, the argument does not exhibit this specific form.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>):**
   - Does the argument claim to have considered all possibilities but actually misses pertinent ones?
   - No, this argument does not enumerate possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>):**
   - Does the provided reason conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
   - Age alone does not conclusively demonstrate someone's knowledge about technology. This looks like a possible match.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>):**
   - Is the reason weak because the causal basis it submits is not compelling?
   - The causal basis "too old" is not inherently a strong or compelling reason since knowledge about technology is not solely dependent on age. This looks like another possible match.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>):**
   - Is the reason repeating what is essentially the same as the proposition?
   - No, "you're too old" is not simply a rephrasing of "you don't know anything about technology."

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>):**
   - Is the proof of reason assumed to be certain based on universal agreement?
   - There is no mention of universal agreement on the issue here.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>):**
   - Can the proof of reason be taken in another sense than what is intended?
   - The argument seems clear and unambiguous in its language.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis:

- The argument fits both the definitions of **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)** because the reason "you're too old" does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition and is a weak causal basis for the argument.

Therefore, "<How would you know anything about technology? You're too old!>" can be classified as both **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
