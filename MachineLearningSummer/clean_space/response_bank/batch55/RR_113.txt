For 
To apply the process of decomposing the task (<D>) of classifying the given statement ("It's important to argue logically because logic is an essential part of argumentation.") as one of the defective argument types (<IDA>), we will take the following steps:

### Step 1: Identify Components of the Argument
- **Proposition (<P>):** The main statement or assertion being made.
- **Reason (<R>):** The causal basis or rationale provided to support the proposition.<P>.

In the given statement:
- **<P>:** "It's important to argue logically."
- **<R>:** "because logic is an essential part of argumentation."

### Step 2: Evaluate the Quality of the Argument
We will now examine the relationship between the <P> and the <R> to see whether they fit any of the defective argument types defined previously.

1. **Generalization (<G>):** <P> is an assertion based on some one part or a majority, not necessarily applicable to all.
   - This does not apply here as the statement does not generalize based on a part or majority.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** <P> claims a complete enumeration of possibilities but misses some pertinent ones.
   - This does not apply, as the argument does not list possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** <R> does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of <P>.
   - This case is not about the conclusiveness of the reason itself in terms of covering all links.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** <R> is weak if the causal basis is not compelling.
   - Not directly related, as the issue doesn't seem to be with the causal connection strength here.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** <R> is a repetition of <P>.
   - Check if the Reason simply restates the Proposition.
     - **<P>:** "It's important to argue logically."
     - **<R>:** "because logic is an essential part of argumentation."
   - Here, the reason seems to be a restatement of the proposition without providing an actual basis; the statement is essentially saying "It's important to argue logically because arguing logically is essential."

Given this repetition, it matches the description for **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** <PR> is assumed as certain due to universal agreement.
   - Not applicable, as no appeal to universal agreement is made.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** <PR> can be taken in another sense than intended.
   - Not applicable here, no ambiguous language use is evident.

### Conclusion:
After decomposing the advanced task of classification and analyzing the given statement step by step, we find that the defective argument type for the statement "Itâ€™s important to argue logically because logic is an essential part of argumentation." is **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**. The reason presented does not add new information or support but simply restates the proposition.
