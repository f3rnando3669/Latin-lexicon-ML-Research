For 
Certainly! Let's apply the task decomposition (D) to the identification task (IDA) step-by-step to classify the given string.

### Given String:
"What type of propaganda uses negative words or feelings against an idea, product or person?"

### Step 1: Understand the String:
- The string is a question asking about a type of propaganda.
- The string specifies that this type of propaganda uses negative words or feelings.
- The negative words or feelings are directed "against an idea, product or person."

### Step 2: Identify Proposition (P):
- Although the string is a question, we can extract an underlying proposition.
- Proposition (P): "There is a type of propaganda that uses negative words or feelings against an idea, product, or person."

### Step 3: Identify Reason (R):
- The reason (R) is implied in the type of attack: "That it is common to use negative words or feelings as a technique in propaganda."

### Step 4: Classify the Argument Type:
We now need to classify the string according to the given defective argument types:
- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**

### Step 5: Inspection Against Defective Argument Types:

#### Generalization (G):
- The string does not seem to be generalizing from a part to a whole group.

#### Incomplete Enumeration (FE):
- The string is not attempting to enumerate possibilities of propaganda types.

#### Inconclusive Reason (IR):
- The reason is not explicitly outlined in the string, so we cannot check its conclusiveness directly from the string itself.

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):
- The string does not provide a specific reason for the Proposition (P).

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):
- Since there is no direct repetition within the string, this does not apply.

#### Presumptuous Consensus (FU):
- The string does not assume universal agreement about the type of propaganda in question.

#### Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):
- The phrase "negative words or feelings" can be subject to interpretation; it can be seen as having ambiguous language since different people might have different perceptions of what counts as negative.

### Conclusion:
Given the steps and analysis, the string "What type of propaganda uses negative words or feelings against an idea, product or person?" can best be classified under:
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**

The classification relies on the ambiguity concerning what constitutes "negative words or feelings," as this can be interpreted in multiple ways.

Thus, applying IDAA to the given string leads us to classify it as `<DEP>`.
