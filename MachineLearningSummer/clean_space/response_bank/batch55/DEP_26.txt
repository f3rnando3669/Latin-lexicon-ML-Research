For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of IDA into specific steps) to the statement "The officer told me to freeze but it was too hot out to be freezing, so I was justified in running away," we'll break down the process step by step.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Classification

1. **Identify the Proposition \(P\)**:
   - This is the main assertion or claim being made.
   - In this case: "I was justified in running away."

2. **Identify the Reason \(R\)**:
   - This is the causal basis provided to support the proposition.
   - In this case: "because it was too hot out to be freezing."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason \(PR\)**:
   - Additional arguments or evidence used to support the reason.
   - In this case, there isn't an additional argument presented for the reason itself.

4. **Check for Defective Argument Types**:

   - **Generalization (\(G\))**: Are there generalizations made?
     - No. The argument does not generalize from a sample to a whole.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (\(FE\))**: Does the argument claim to enumerate possibilities but misses some?
     - No. There is no enumeration of possibilities here.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (\(IR\))**: Does the provided reason conclusively demonstrate the proposition?
     - No. The reason ("it was too hot out to be freezing") is more of a play on words and does not logically or conclusively demonstrate that running away from an officer was justified.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(WCB\))**: Is the causal basis weak?
     - Yes. The causal basis is based on a misunderstanding of the command. The term "freeze" used by the officer means to stop moving, not to literally freeze like in cold weather.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(RR\))**: Is the reason a mere repetition of the proposition?
     - No. The reason provided is not a repetition of the proposition.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (\(FU\))**: Is the reason or proof assumed universally agreed upon without actual proof?
     - No. There isnâ€™t a universal agreement aspect invoked here.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (\(DEP\))**: Is there ambiguous language in the proof or reason?
     - Yes. There is ambiguity in the interpretation of the word "freeze." It's taken in another sense than intended by the officer.

5. **Classify the Argument**:
   - The primary defective argument types present are **Inconclusive Reason \(IR\)** and **Ambiguous Language Use \(DEP\)**.
   - "The officer told me to freeze but it was too hot out to be freezing, so I was justified in running away." uses ambiguous language and does not provide a conclusive reason for justifying running away.

### Final Classification:

The argument should be classified as **\(IR\)** and **\(DEP\)** because it provides an inconclusive reason and involves ambiguous language.

By applying IDAA step by step, we determined that the argument is primarily defective due to \(IR\) (Inconclusive Reason) and \(DEP\) (Ambiguous Language Use).
