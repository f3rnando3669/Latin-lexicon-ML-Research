For 
To apply **IDAA** (the application of the decomposition of a task into specific steps to the identification of defective arguments) to the string **"Compares minor problems with much more serious crimes"** \( <s> \), let's break down the process to classify this string as one of the defective argument types:

### Step-by-step Decomposition Application (IDAA):

#### Step 1: Identify the nature of the statement
First, examine the provided statement to understand what type of argument or reasoning it might be demonstrating.

- The statement **"Compares minor problems with much more serious crimes"** suggests a comparison of vastly different subjects in terms of severity.

#### Step 2: Determine relevant defective argument categories
Next, consider the definitions of the potential defective argument types and see which ones might apply to the nature of the statement identified in Step 1.

1. **Generalization (G)**: Asserting applicability to all based on a part.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Claiming completeness but missing some possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Reason not conclusively proving the proposition.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Reason's causal basis is not compelling.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Reason reiterates proposition without added value.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assuming universal agreement on a disputed matter.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Argument can be interpreted in a way not intended.

#### Step 3: Assess the provided string against each defective argument type

- **Generalization (G):** The statement does not necessarily make a generalized claim based on a part or majority.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This doesn’t fit as the statement does not appear to enumerate possibilities or omit any.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The statement isn't providing an inconclusive reason; it is more about comparison.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** It does not argue a causal relationship insufficiently.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The statement is not repeating a point; it introduces a comparison.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This isn’t about assuming universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** This could fit if the comparison is used ambiguously to mislead.

#### Step 4: Identify the closest fitting argument type from the remaining candidates
Given the decomposed definitions and process of elimination, none fit perfectly, but:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR) and Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)** are the closest, but they still do not aptly describe the reasoning error in this context.

**New step (Adapting our approach):**

After reviewing our steps, we consider a broader reasoning error not explicitly in predefined categories (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP): 

- **False Analogy or Misleading Comparisons:** This additional category might better fit as the statement attempts to make an analogy between minor problems and serious crimes, which is inappropriate due to their differing severity levels.

### Conclusion
**"Compares minor problems with much more serious crimes"** fits better under a **False Analogy**, a broad class often encountered outside predefined faulty categories but closer to standard logical fallacies. Thus, within the IDAA system explicitly detailed, it’s somewhat inconclusively fitting as **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)** but can be more precisely classified as employing a **False Analogy**.
