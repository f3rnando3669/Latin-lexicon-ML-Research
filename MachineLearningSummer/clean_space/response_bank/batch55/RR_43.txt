To apply the process of IDAA to the statement "The reason billions of children starve to death each year is because we live in a world that does not care," we need to decompose IDA into specific steps and systematically classify the statement. Here are the steps for this process:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for IDAA

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The core assertion or claim that the argument is making.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The causal basis or reasoning provided for the proposition.

3. **Evaluate the Argument for Potential Defective Types:**
   - Generalization (<G>)
   - Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
   - Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
   - Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
   - Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
   - Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)

4. **Classify the Statement:**
   - Determine which, if any, of the defective argument types apply to the given statement.

Now let's apply these steps to the given statement.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)

"The reason billions of children starve to death each year is because we live in a world that does not care."

Here, the proposition seems to be: **"Billions of children starve to death each year."**

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)

The reason provided for this proposition is: **"because we live in a world that does not care."**

### Step 3: Evaluate the Argument for Potential Defective Types

1. **Generalization (<G>)**
   - Does the assertion make a sweeping generalization?
   - The statement generalizes the reason for starvation to be due to the apathy of the entire world. This could qualify as a generalization because not all aspects of the global situation may be due to "world does not care."

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
   - Does the argument fail to account for all possibilities?
   - The statement does not address other possible reasons for starvation (e.g., economic systems, conflicts, resource allocation issues). Hence, this is an incomplete enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
   - Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
   - "The world does not care" is a broad, qualitative reason rather than a specific, quantifiable cause. It does not necessarily demonstrate a direct causal link to starvation rates conclusively.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
   - Is the causal basis weak or not compelling?
   - The reasoning "because we live in a world that does not care" might be deemed insufficient as it does not provide a compelling, detailed causal mechanism.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**
   - Is the reason simply a repetition of the proposition?
   - The statement is not a repetition but provides a causal reason.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
   - Is there an assumption of universal agreement that is still in dispute?
   - This argument does not explicitly rely on presumed universal consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**
   - Is there ambiguity in language or meaning?
   - "Does not care" could be taken differently by different people, making the language somewhat ambiguous.

### Step 4: Classify the Statement

Considering the steps and analysis:

- **Generalization (<G>)** and **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** seem applicable because the statement generalizes the reason for starvation and fails to consider other possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** also apply as the reason given is broad and not compelling.

Therefore, the statement "The reason billions of children starve to death each year is because we live in a world that does not care" can be classified as a mix of:
- Generalization (<G>)
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)

The classification is mainly driven by the broad and sweeping nature of the reason that fails to comprehensively and sufficiently support the proposition.
