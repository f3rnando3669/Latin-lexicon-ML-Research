For 
To apply IDAA to the given string "Don’t waste food, people in Marawi are suffering because of hunger," we need to decompose the task of classifying the string as one of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP) into specific steps. Here’s the step-by-step decomposition and classification:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D)

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - What is the main statement or assertion being made?

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - What reason is given to support the proposition?

3. **Analyze the structure and logic:**
   - Evaluate the relationship between the proposition (P) and the reason (R).

4. **Identify the additional argument or Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - Are there any additional arguments given to corroborate the reason?

5. **Classify the identified Reason or Proof of Reason:**
   - Compare it with the definitions of the defective argument types:

   - **Generalization (G)**
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**

6. **Determine the closest defective argument type:**
   - Based on the analysis, classify the defective argument.

### Application to the String

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - "Don’t waste food"

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - "people in Marawi are suffering because of hunger."

3. **Analyze the structure and logic:**
   - The argument posits that food should not be wasted because there are people suffering from hunger in Marawi. However, it implicitly suggests that food wastage directly affects the hunger situation in Marawi, which is not explicitly connected.

4. **Identify the additional argument or Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - There are no additional arguments given; the reason provided is supposed to stand alone.

5. **Classify the identified Reason (R):**
   - **Generalization (G)**: Not applicable, as this does not extend a property of a part to the whole.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable, there is no incomplete listing.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Potentially applicable, as the suffering in Marawi due to hunger does not conclusively establish why one should not waste food.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Applicable, as the causal link between not wasting food and alleviating hunger in Marawi is weak and not compelling. The argument presupposes a connection without sufficient justification.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Not applicable, as the reason is not merely a repetition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Not applicable, no universal agreement is assumed or implied.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Not applicable, the language is clear and unambiguous, albeit not logically rigorous.

6. **Determine the closest defective argument type:**
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This is the most fitting category since the reason provided does not convincingly establish a strong causal link to the proposition.

### Conclusion
The given argument "Don’t waste food, people in Marawi are suffering because of hunger" is classified as **<WCB>** (Insufficient Causal Basis) because it presents a weak causal link between the proposition (not wasting food) and the reason (people suffering from hunger in Marawi).
