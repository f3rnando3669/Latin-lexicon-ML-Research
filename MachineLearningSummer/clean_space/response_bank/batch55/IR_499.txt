To apply the process of identifying and classifying the defective argument type in the given string through <IDAA>, we need to follow a systematic decomposition of the problem into specific steps. Let's break down the task and classify the argument effectively.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (Applying <D> to <IDA>)

#### Step 1: Identify the propositions and dialogue components
We need to deconstruct the dialogue to identify the presented propositions and reasons.

- **Proposition (P)**: Steve argues that, in Sweden, college is free for citizens and questions why this can't be the case in the USA.
- **Response (R)**: Ed responds by attacking Steve personally and suggesting he move to Sweden if he likes its policies.

#### Step 2: Analyze Steve's assertion
Steve's proposition does not, on its own, fit the defective types directly. Instead, it's a factual assertion followed by a question, not a complete argument. Therefore, focus should be on Ed's response.

#### Step 3: Analyze Ed's response for any causal basis or argument structure
Ed's reply does not provide a reasoned argument or causal basis to counter Steve's proposition about free college education in the USA. Instead, it dismisses the proposition through an ad hominem attack.

#### Step 4: Determine defective argument type based on Ed's response
- **Generalization (G)**: This does not apply here, as there's no attempted generalization by Ed.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This does not apply here, as no enumeration is presented by Ed.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Not present, since there is no attempt to provide any reasoning or evidence.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Not applicable, because no causal basis is provided at all.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Ed is not repeating the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Not relevant here, as Ed does not claim universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Not applicable, the language is clear though dismissive.

#### Step 5: Match with best fit
The best fit for Ed’s response is not among the typical defections of formal arguments but is more of an irrelevant or emotional appeal. However, given the existing definitions, it **comes closest to "Inconclusive Reason" (IR)** since Ed's response does not address Steve's point with reasoning.

### Conclusion
Applying <IDAA> to the given string:

"Steve: In Sweden, college is free for citizens. How come we can't do that here?  
Ed: If you like Sweden so much, move there. The USA would be glad to be rid of your liberal ass!"

The string is best classified as **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** because Ed’s response does not provide a reasoned basis to refute or engage with Steve’s original proposition. Instead, it shifts the focus away from the argument through a personal attack and thus fails to address the causal basis or correctness of the proposition made by Steve.
