For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a string into different types of defective arguments), we need to decompose the string and analyze it step by step. Here's how we can proceed with the string "All my friends are doing a low carb diet. That must be the only way to lose weight so I will do it too."

**Step 1: Breakdown the Argument**
1. **Proposition (<P>):** All my friends are doing a low carb diet. That must be the only way to lose weight.
2. **Reason (<R>):** None explicitly provided beyond the observation that friends are following the diet.
3. **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** The implicit assumption is that because friends are doing it, it's universally effective.

**Step 2: Identify Parts and Analyze Defects**
1. **Generalization (G):**
   - **P:** "All my friends are doing a low-carb diet."
   - **Analysis:** This could be an example of Generalization if it implies that what a certain group (friends) is doing applies broadly or universally. Friends are only a subset, not the complete population.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - **P:** "That must be the only way to lose weight."
   - **Analysis:** This suggests that all possibilities for losing weight have not been considered, implying Incomplete Enumeration because there are numerous ways to lose weight.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - **R:** Not explicitly stated but inferred from friends' actions.
   - **Analysis:** This reason does not conclusively demonstrate that a low-carb diet is the only way to lose weight. The reasons friends choose may vary, and their success (or lack thereof) is not conclusively tied to the diet itself.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - **R:** "All my friends are doing a low-carb diet."
   - **Analysis:** The causal basis (friends doing the diet) is weak because there is no compelling evidence that friends' actions will lead to similar results for the person making the statement. 

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - **R:** None explicitly that repeats the proposition.
   - **Analysis:** This does not seem applicable as there is no repetition exactly of the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - **PR:** "That must be the only way to lose weight."
   - **Analysis:** It assumes a consensus based on limited evidence (friends), potentially a form of this fallacy since it presumes "it is universally agreed upon" based on a small, specific group.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - **PR:** No ambiguous term explicitly stated.
   - **Analysis:** Ambiguity doesn't seem to be an issue in this specific statement.

**Step 3: Classify Defects**
- The argument predominantly shows signs of:
  1. **Generalization (G):** Extrapolating from friends to a universal truth.
  2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Claiming the low-carb diet as "the only way" without considering other options.
  3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** No solid reasoning that friends' actions conclusively prove the proposition.
  4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Weak causal link between friends' actions and the conclusion drawn.

Thus, applying IDAA to "All my friends are doing a low-carb diet. That must be the only way to lose weight so I will do it too" results in identifying the defective argument types as <G>, <FE>, <IR>, and <WCB>.
