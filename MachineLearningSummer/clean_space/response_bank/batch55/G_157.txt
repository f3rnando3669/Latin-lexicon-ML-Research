For 
To apply the process of IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types) to the string "All dogs go to heaven," let's go through the steps of decomposition (D) systematically:

### Decomposition Steps (D):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Analyze the given string to determine what is being claimed or asserted.
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine if there is a reason given in support of the proposition. If not, note its absence.

3. **Identify any Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Look for any form of proof or additional arguments that support the reason provided. If absent, note its absence.

4. **Determine if the Proposition fits any Defective Argument Type:**
   - Evaluate the proposition against the definitions of defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).
   - Classify the proposition according to the appropriate defective argument type(s).

### Step-by-Step Application to "All dogs go to heaven":

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>):
The proposition in this case is the statement:
   - <P>: "All dogs go to heaven."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>):
   - No reason (<R>) is explicitly provided in the string. We only have the proposition here.

#### Step 3: Identify any Proof of Reason (<PR>):
   - Since there is no reason given, there cannot be a proof of reason provided. Thus, <PR> is absent.

#### Step 4: Determine if the Proposition fits any Defective Argument Type:
   - **Generalization (<G>):** The proposition "All dogs go to heaven" makes an assertion about all dogs based on an implied but unproven general belief, which likely does not apply to all dogs universally. This fits the definition of Generalization.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The statement does not attempt to enumerate possibilities, so this does not apply.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** There is no reason provided to determine if it is conclusive or not.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** There is no reason, so we cannot evaluate the causal basis.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Since there is no reason, repetition does not apply.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** There is no proof of reason suggesting a universal agreement on the matter, so this does not apply.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The language does not appear ambiguous; it is a clear but broad assertion.

Therefore, the defective argument type for the proposition "All dogs go to heaven" is **Generalization (<G>)**.

### Conclusion:
The result of applying IDAA to "All dogs go to heaven" is the classification of the string as type **<G> (Generalization)**.
