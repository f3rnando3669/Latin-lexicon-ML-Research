To decompose the task of classifying the given string as one of the defective argument types specified, we follow these steps:

### Decomposition of Task <IDA> into Specific Steps

**Step 1**: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
**Step 2**: Identify the Reason (<R>)
**Step 3**: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
**Step 4**: Evaluate <P>, <R>, and <PR> according to the defective argument types:
- **Generalization (<G>)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**

### Application to the Given String

Given string: 

"**'What about Red Herring, ma'am?''**

"**'I'm not sure. Is Red Herring a red herring? Or is it the fact that we're meant to think Red Herring is a red herring that is actually the red herring?'**

"**'Or perhaps the fact you're meant to think Red Herring isn't a red herring is what makes Red Herring a red herring after all.'**

"**'We're talking serious metaherrings here.'"**"

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)

The string contains multiple propositions asking for clarification about whether "Red Herring" is indeed a red herring or if the suggestion that it might be one is misleading.

**Proposition 1 (P1)**: What about Red Herring, ma'am?

**Proposition 2 (P2)**: Is Red Herring a red herring? Or is it the fact that we're meant to think Red Herring is a red herring that is actually the red herring?

**Proposition 3 (P3)**: Or perhaps the fact you're meant to think Red Herring isn't a red herring is what makes Red Herring a red herring after all.

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)

The reasons are inherently embedded within the propositions and are seeking clarity through layered questioning rather than presenting evidence.

**Reason 1 (R1)**: Questioning the nature of Red Herring itself.

**Reason 2 (R2)**: Considering the meta-level confusion that thinking about a red herring can cause.

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)

The given string does not offer direct proof or corroborative arguments for the reasons themselves. It mainly complicates the understanding through recursive questioning.

#### Step 4: Evaluate <P>, <R>, and <PR>

**Under Generalization (<G>)**:
- The given string does not generalize from a part to a whole. No type <G> detected.

**Under Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
- The propositions do not claim a complete enumeration of possibilities.

**Under Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
- The reasons provided do not conclusively establish anything about the nature of the red herring due to recursive questioning.

**Under Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
- The reasons seem weak due to their recursive, self-referential nature, causing confusion rather than establishing a compelling causal basis.

**Under Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
- The propositions repeatedly question the nature of the red herring without adding new information, potentially falling into the category of <RR>.

**Under Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
- There is no appeal to universal agreement.

**Under Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
- Ambiguity is high as the term "red herring" and meta-disputes create multiple possible interpretations of the argument.

### Conclusion
The string is best classified under Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>) for repetitive questioning and Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>) for causing confusion through meta-level ambiguity. 

Hence, the string is identified as types **<RR>** and **<DEP>**.
