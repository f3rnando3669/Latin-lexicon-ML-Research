For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument into specific steps) to "This fallacy isn’t proof of anything except that you don’t know something," we'll follow through these methodical steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - **Proposition:** "This fallacy isn’t proof of anything except that you don’t know something."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - **Reason:** Implicitly, the reason is that the fallacy indicates a lack of knowledge.
   
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - **Proof of Reason:** Not explicitly presented in this statement. For this exercise, we assume it is asserting a proof by referring to a general understanding of fallacies exposing ignorance.

4. **Examine for Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** The statement doesn't seem to make a broad generalization about a majority or minority.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The statement doesn't enumerate possibilities, so it doesn't miss any pertinent ones.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason does seem to lack conclusiveness because it simply defers to "you don’t know something," which isn't specific.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal link (the fallacy only shows a lack of knowledge) is weak without further explanation.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason given does not repeat the proposition; it simply attempts to assert it.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The statement does not appeal to a presumed universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The statement uses somewhat vague language ("you don’t know something") that could be interpreted in different ways.

5. **Final Classification (<IDA>):**
   - The statement "This fallacy isn’t proof of anything except that you don’t know something." shows multiple potential issues:
     - The reason is inconclusive (<IR>), as it doesn't conclusively prove the proposition.
     - It also suffers from insufficient causal basis (<WCB>), because the reason (fallacy showing ignorance) is not compelling.
     - There is ambiguity in the language (<DEP>) since "something" is too vague to pinpoint a specific lack of knowledge.

**Conclusion:**
Assigning a specific defective argument type, "This fallacy isn’t proof of anything except that you don’t know something," can be predominantly classified under <IR>, <WCB>, and <DEP>. However, for simplicity and clarity in categorization, we might focus primarily on <WCB> due to the weak causal basis in the argument.

6. **Classify the Argument:** 
   - The statement is classified as <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
