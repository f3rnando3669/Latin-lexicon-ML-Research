For 
Certainly! Let's apply the decomposition of the task (D) to the task of classifying the string (IDA). Here are the steps broken down for the decomposition (D) and subsequent classification (IDA):

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of IDA:
1. **Identify the Proposition (P) in the string (s):** Determine the statement being put forward as what the speaker intends to prove.
2. **Identify the Reason (R) in the string (s), if present:** Look for any causal basis presented to support the Proposition.
3. **Determine the Proof of Reason (PR), if present:** Search for any additional arguments that corroborate the Reason.
4. **Analyze the Proposition (P) for defects:** Check if the Proposition falls under the categories of Generalization (G) or Incomplete Enumeration (FE).
5. **Evaluate the Reason (R) for defects:** If an explicit Reason is stated, evaluate it for being Inconclusive (IR), Insufficient (WCB), or a Faulty Repetition (RR) of Proposition.
6. **Assess the Proof of Reason (PR) for defects:** If a Proof of Reason is indicated, evaluate it for Presumptuous Consensus (FU) or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).
7. **Classify the string (s) as one or more of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP).**

### Application of IDAA to the provided string:

**String (s):** "People nowadays only vote with their emotions instead of their brains."

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P) in the string (s)
- **Proposition (P):** "People nowadays only vote with their emotions instead of their brains."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R) in the string (s), if present
- There is no specific Reason (R) provided in the string. The statement makes a broad assertion without providing causal basis.

#### Step 3: Determine the Proof of Reason (PR), if present
- There is no Proof of Reason (PR) in the string.

#### Step 4: Analyze the Proposition (P) for defects
- **Generalization (G):** The Proposition (P) seems to make a sweeping generalization. It asserts that all people in modern times vote based solely on emotions rather than rationality, without providing evidence to support this claim.

#### Step 5: Evaluate the Reason (R) for defects
- Since there is no Reason (R) provided, this step is not applicable.

#### Step 6: Assess the Proof of Reason (PR) for defects
- Since there is no Proof of Reason (PR) in the string, this step is not applicable.

#### Step 7: Classify the string (s) as one or more of the defective argument types
- The string can be classified as **Generalization (G)** because it makes an assertion applicable to all people in modern times based on an unspecified subset or observation.

### Final Classification
The string "People nowadays only vote with their emotions instead of their brains." is classified as type **Generalization (G)**.
