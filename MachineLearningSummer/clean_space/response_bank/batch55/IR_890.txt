To apply IDAA (the decomposition of IDA into specific steps) to the task of classifying the string "Our gang will beat up anyone who doesn’t vote our way," we would follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>) and its Parts
- **Proposition (<P>):** This is the main claim or assertion being made. In this case, the proposition could be interpreted as "Our gang will beat up anyone who doesn’t vote our way."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>) and its Validity
- **Reason (<R>):** This would be the statement providing the causal basis for the proposition. However, in this sentence, there's no explicit reason provided to support the action of beating up anyone who doesn’t vote their way. It's more of a threat than a reasoned argument.

### Step 3: Look for Proof of Reason (<PR>) through Additional Supporting Arguments
- **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** This step involves checking whether additional arguments corroborate the given reason. In this statement, there is no proof offered; it's simply a threat without supporting arguments.

### Step 4: Evaluate the Argument Against Defined Defective Argument Types
Using the defective argument types, let's classify the given string:
- **Generalization (<G>):** The statement isn't generalizing a characteristic to all individuals. 
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** There's no enumeration of possibilities here.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** There is no causal reason provided here; the statement is purely a threat and doesn't logically explain why the act of beating up would occur.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** There's a complete lack of causal basis provided; the statement doesn't explain why the action is justified or supported.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This doesn't repeat the proposition as reason; there's no reason stated.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The statement doesn’t assume a consensus; it's a threat rather than relying on a presumed agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The language isn't particularly ambiguous in an interpretative sense; it is a direct threat, so it’s clear in its intent.

Considering the steps and the classifications, the string "Our gang will beat up anyone who doesn’t vote our way" seems to most closely fit the category of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because it does not provide a logical, conclusive reason to support the proposition. It simply states the proposition as a fact without any supportive rationale.
