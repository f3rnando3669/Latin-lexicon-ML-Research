For 
To apply the task of classifying the argument "“Oh, please. What would you know about labor laws? You don’t even have a job.”" as of type Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>), we need to break down the process into specific steps.

**Steps for IDAA:**

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   Determine what is being asserted or intended to be proven.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   Find the causal basis provided for the proposition.

3. **Classify the Reason and Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   Check if the reason (and any corroboration) falls into any defective argument categories.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)

In the given statement, the proposition can be identified as:
- **Proposition (<P>):** The person being addressed does not have knowledge about labor laws.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)

The reason provided for the proposition is:
- **Reason (<R>):** The person being addressed doesn’t have a job.

### Step 3: Classify the Reason and Proof of Reason (<PR>)

To identify the type of defective argument, let's examine the relationship between the proposition and the reason provided.

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - Not applicable because the argument does not involve an assertion based on some part applied to the whole group.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Not applicable because the argument does not involve claiming to have considered all possibilities but missing some.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Potentially applicable. We need to assess if the reason given conclusively proves the proposition. Does lacking a job necessarily mean lacking knowledge about labor laws? No, it does not necessarily follow as one could have the knowledge without currently holding a job.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Potentially applicable. The causal basis seems weak—having a job is not a compelling reason for knowledge about labor laws, as one can be knowledgeable on the topic regardless of employment status.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - Not applicable because the reason does not repeat the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - Not applicable because the argument does not appeal to a universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - Not applicable because the argument does not seem ambiguously interpretable.

### Conclusion:
The argument provided can be classified as <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and potentially <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) since the reason that the person does not have a job does not conclusively prove they lack knowledge about labor laws, nor is it a strong causal basis for the claim.

**FINAL CLASSIFICATION:**
The argument "“Oh, please. What would you know about labor laws? You don’t even have a job.”" is of type:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
