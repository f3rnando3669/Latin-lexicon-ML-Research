For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the classification task <IDA> into specific steps) to the given argument, we need to break down the process of classifying the defective argument into its steps. Let’s do this systematically:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
Read the statement and identify the proposition, which is the summary of what the speaker intends to prove.

**Proposition**:
"I should receive an 'A' in this class."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
Identify the reason given to support the proposition.

**Reason**:
"I had a tough week!"

### Step 3: Check for Compliance or Defectiveness
Determine whether the argument falls into one of the categories of defective arguments. Compare the argument to the definitions of the defective argument types.

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - This involves generalizing from one part or a majority to all. This is not applicable here.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - This involves claiming a complete enumeration of possibilities but missing some. This is not applicable here.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - This is when the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. 
   - "I had a tough week" does not conclusively prove that the speaker should receive an 'A'. It is an irrelevant reason regarding academic performance directly related to the grade.
   
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - This is when the causal basis for the reason is not compelling.
   - The emotional or situational hardship doesn’t establish a direct causal necessity for an 'A' in the class. It is weak because having a tough week doesn't logically justify why the speaker deserves an 'A'.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - This is when the reason simply repeats the proposition. This is not applicable here.
   
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - This is when the proof of reason is assumed certain based on a presumed universal agreement. This is not applicable here.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
   - This is when the proof can be taken in another sense than intended. This is not applicable here.

### Step 4: Confirm Classification
Based on the above analysis, we see that "I had a tough week" does not provide a strong causality to justify the proposition "I should receive an 'A'." There are two potentially applicable defects:

**Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.

**Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
The causal basis for the reason is weak and not compelling.

Given that both IR and WCB seem applicable, we might need to further refine our steps to ensure we're selecting the most precise defect.

### Step 5: Final Classification
**Final Classification**:
The most precise defect here is **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The reason given does not provide a compelling causal link justifying why the grade should be an 'A.' 

Thus, the classification of the argument:

"I should receive an 'A' in this class. I had a tough week!" Hadi begged

is <WCB>.
