For 
To apply the task of IDAA (decomposition and subsequent classification of a defective argument) to the provided argument, the steps will be as follows:

1. **Break down the argument into its component parts**:
   - Proposition (<P>)
   - Reason (<R>)
   - Proof of Reason (<PR>)

2. **Analyze each part to identify any defective argument types**.

Let's begin the decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Proposition (P): "I won't go to the bathroom."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Reason (R): "If I go to the bathroom, I will miss the notes, then I'll do poorly on a test, then I won't get into college."

3. **Identify any Proof of Reason (<PR>)** presented**:
   - Proof of Reason (PR): It appears there's no additional proof provided; the causal chain given serves as the primary reasoning.

Now, analyze the argument parts for defects:

1. **Check for Generalization (G)**:
   - The claim does not appear to be a generalization based on one part or majority applied to all. Instead, it outlines a specific causal chain for this individual scenario.

2. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - The causal chain does not enumerate possibilities but presents a sequential series of events. It's not an enumeration defect.

3. **Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The causal connection between each step is not conclusively demonstrated. For example, missing notes does not inherently lead to poor test performance, and poor test performance does not inherently lead to not getting into college. This can be classified as <IR>.

4. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - The Reason (R) relies on a weak causal basis, claiming a direct and inevitable relationship between going to the bathroom and not getting into college which is not compelling. This can be classified as <WCB>.

5. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - Reason (R) does not repeat the Proposition (P). It provides a sequential reasoning chain.

6. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - No part of the argument relies on a universally agreed assumption to establish proof. Hence, it's not <FU>.

7. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
   - There's no ambiguous language that could be taken differently than intended by the speaker.

**Conclusion**:
After decomposition and analysis, the argument can be classified as having:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasoning does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis submitted for the proposition is not a compelling one.
