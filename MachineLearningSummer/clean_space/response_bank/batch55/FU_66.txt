For 
To apply the defined task \(\texttt{IDAA}\) to classify the given statement "Millions of people are Marxists, so Marxist economic and political theories are correct," we will follow a step-by-step decomposition process to determine the type of defective argument present.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (\(\texttt{D}\))
1. **Identify the Proposition (\(\texttt{P}\))** in the argument.
2. **Identify the Reason (\(\texttt{R}\))** provided for the Proposition.
3. **Check the nature of the Proposition (\(\texttt{P}\))** to see if it matches any defective argument type descriptions.
4. **Check the nature of the Reason (\(\texttt{R}\))** to see if it matches any defective argument type descriptions.
5. **Determine if there is a Proof of Reason (\(\texttt{PR}\))** and check if it matches any defective argument type descriptions.
6. **Evaluate and classify the argument** based on the defective argument types.

### Applying \(\texttt{D}\) to the given statement:

1. **Identify the Proposition (\(\texttt{P}\))**:
   - "Marxist economic and political theories are correct."

2. **Identify the Reason (\(\texttt{R}\))**:
   - "Millions of people are Marxists."

3. **Check the nature of the Proposition (\(\texttt{P}\))**:
   - The Proposition (\(\texttt{P}\)) does not appear to be a Generalization (\(\texttt{G}\)), Incomplete Enumeration (\(\texttt{FE}\)), or have any ambiguity language (\(\texttt{DEP}\)) by itself.

4. **Check the nature of the Reason (\(\texttt{R}\))**:
   - The Reason (\(\texttt{R}\)): "Millions of people are Marxists" does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of Marxist theories. The causal basis is weak because just having a large number of adherents does not logically or causally prove that the theories are correct. This suggests \(\texttt{WCB}\) (Insufficient Causal Basis).
   - Additionally, the Reason appears presumptuous as it implies consensus equates to correctness, aligning with \(\texttt{FU}\) (Presumptuous Consensus).

5. **Determine if there is a Proof of Reason (\(\texttt{PR}\))**:
   - There is no additional argument presented to corroborate the Reason. However, if interpreted broadly that the statement assumes universal agreement among millions to justify correctness, it would lean strongly towards \(\texttt{FU}\).

6. **Evaluate and classify the argument**:
   - The argument primarily fails because the Reason (\(R\)) is weak and centers on a large number of adherents without logical causal support. Therefore, it mostly represents \(\texttt{WCB}\) (Insufficient Causal Basis).
   - It also reflects \(\texttt{FU}\) (Presumptuous Consensus), assuming that the sheer number means correctness, a point still in dispute.

### Conclusion:
The given statement "Millions of people are Marxists, so Marxist economic and political theories are correct" is an argument type best classified as \(\texttt{WCB}\): Insufficient Causal Basis and also fits within \(\texttt{FU}\): Presumptuous Consensus.
