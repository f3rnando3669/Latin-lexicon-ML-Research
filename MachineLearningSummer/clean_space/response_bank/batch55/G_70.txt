For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given statement "Daniel was a precocious child and had a liking for logic. He reasoned that atoms are invisible, and that he was made of atoms and therefore invisible too. Unfortunately, despite his thinky skills, he lost the game of hide and go seek," we need to decompose the task of identifying defective argument types into specific steps.

Here's how to proceed:

1. **Identify and Extract Proposition**:
   - **Proposition (<P>)**: Determine what Daniel is trying to prove or assert.
     - In this case, Daniel's proposition is: "He is invisible."

2. **Identify and Extract Reason**:
   - **Reason (<R>)**: Determine the causal basis or reasoning Daniel provides to support his proposition.
     - Daniel's reason: "Atoms are invisible and he is made of atoms, therefore he is invisible."

3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason**:
   - **Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Look for any supporting statements or other arguments that corroborate the reason.
     - In this statement, there isn't an additional proof beyond Daniel's reasoning.

4. **Classify the Argument Type**:
   - Using the definitions provided for defective argument types, classify the argument of Daniel.

   4.1. Generalization (<G>):
       - Daniel's reasoning doesn't generalize from some individuals to all. So, it's not <G>.

   4.2. Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):
       - Daniel does not enumerate possibilities here. Thus, it's not <FE>.

   4.3. Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):
       - The reason Daniel gives does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition ("he is invisible") as true. The reasoning is flawed because being made of invisible parts does not make the whole invisible.
       - Thus, it is an example of <IR>.

   4.4. Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):
       - The causal link between "atoms are invisible" and "therefore he is invisible" is not compelling or scientifically valid.
       - Therefore, this could also be classified under <WCB>.

   4.5. Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):
       - The statement does not merely repeat the proposition as its reasoning.
       - Therefore, it is not <RR>.

   4.6. Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):
       - Daniel’s argument doesn’t claim universal agreement to support the reason.
       - So it is not <FU>.

   4.7. Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):
       - There's no evident ambiguous language in the reasoning as presented.
       - Thus, it is not <DEP>.

**Conclusion**:
Based on the above decomposition, Daniel’s argument falls under both <IR> and <WCB>, as his reasoning does not conclusively support his proposition, and the causal basis presented is not compelling.

Thus, the string "Daniel was a precocious child and had a liking for logic. He reasoned that atoms are invisible, and that he was made of atoms and therefore invisible too. Unfortunately, despite his thinky skills, he lost the game of hide and go seek." can be classified under <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
