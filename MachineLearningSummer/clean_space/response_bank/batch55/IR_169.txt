Sure, let's break down the task of classifying the given string into specific steps for a clear and methodical approach. Here’s how we’ll apply the decomposition of the task:

**Step 1: Understand the Proposition**
- Identify the proposition in the given string. Here, the proposition is: "A woman decides to visit a certain doctor after only asking advice on the best doctors from ONE friend."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason**
- Determine what reason is being given to support the proposition. The reason here is that she asked advice from one friend about the best doctors.

**Step 3: Analyze for Defective Arguments**
- Examine the proposition and the reason for characteristics that match any of the defined defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

Let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This occurs when a conclusion is drawn about all cases based on one or a few instances. In this string, the woman makes a decision based on the opinion of just one friend.
   - Yes, because the woman’s decision is based on the single opinion of one friend, this fits the definition of a generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This involves claiming all possibilities have been considered when some have not. The string does not make such a claim, so this doesn't apply.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This would be the case if the reason given does not conclusively support the proposition. Although it's a weak basis, the string does not attempt to assert that this reason conclusively proves the doctor is the best.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Here, the reason given for the proposition is not compelling. While asking one friend is not a very strong basis, this term typically refers to the reasoning process more explicitly.
   - Potentially, but generalization seems more fitting.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This occurs when the reason presented is merely a repetition of the proposition, which isn't the case here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This involves assuming universal agreement on something still in dispute. This does not apply; the decision is based on advice from one friend, not consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: This involves ambiguity in language, which does not seem to be an issue in this case.

**Step 4: Classify the Argument**
- Given the analysis, the most fitting faulty argument type is:
  - **<G> (Generalization)**: Because the decision to visit a certain doctor is based on the advice of only one friend, this is a form of generalization.

**Final Classification: Generalization (<G>)**
