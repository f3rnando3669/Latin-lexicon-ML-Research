Sure, let's apply the decomposition of the task "classifying <s> as of type <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU> or <DEP>" to the string "You never even finished law school, so why should I trust you to watch my children?" step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - The argument in this string seems to be "why should I trust you to watch my children?"
   
2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - The reason provided for the proposition appears to be "You never even finished law school."

3. **Analyze the argument structure:**
   - Determine if the Reason (R) provided supports the Proposition (P).

4. **Classify the Argument:**
   - Based on the identified Proposition (P) and Reason (R), we need to classify the argument as one of the defective types.

### Applying the Steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Proposition (P): "Why should I trust you to watch my children?"

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Reason (R): "You never even finished law school."

3. **Analyze the argument structure:**
   - Here, we need to see if not finishing law school serves as a valid Reason (R) for not trusting someone to watch children.

4. **Classify the Argument:**

   - **Generalization (G):** There's no broad assertion based on partial observation here.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** There is no claim of complete enumeration of possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The Reason (R) "You never even finished law school" does not directly relate to the Proposition (P) concerning trust in child-watching capabilities. Not finishing law school does not conclusively demonstrate a lack of trustworthiness in childcare.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis here is quite weak. There’s no evident, compelling connection between legal education and childcare expertise.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The Reason (R) here is not just a repetition of the Proposition (P).
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There’s no assumption of universal agreement on any claim.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language does not seem ambiguous in this case.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the most fitting classification for the argument "You never even finished law school, so why should I trust you to watch my children?" is **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, because the provided Reason (R) "You never even finished law school" does not conclusively support the Proposition (P) of why the speaker should not trust the person to watch their children.
