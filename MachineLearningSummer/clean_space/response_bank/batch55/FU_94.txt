For 
Sure, let's apply \(IDAA\) to the given statement "I guess I should buy my 12-year-old daughter an iPhone. Everyone at her school has one, and I want her to fit in with the other kids." by decomposing the task of classifying it into specific steps.

1. **Identify the Proposition (\(P\)):**
   - The main proposition in the statement is: "I should buy my 12-year-old daughter an iPhone."

2. **Identify the Reason (\(R\)):**
   - The reason given for the proposition is: "Everyone at her school has one, and I want her to fit in with the other kids."

3. **Check the Reason (\(R\)) against Defective Argument Types:** 
   
   a. **Generalization (\(G\)):**
      - Does the \(P\) make a broad assertion based on some part or majority?
      - Yes, the assertion is based on the generalization that "everyone at her school has one."

   b. **Incomplete Enumeration (\(FE\)):**
      - Does the \(P\) claim to have considered all possibilities but misses out on some?
      - The statement does not explicitly enumerate possibilities, so this does not apply as it stands.

   c. **Inconclusive Reason (\(IR\)):**
      - Does the \(P\) not conclusively follow from the \(R\)?
      - The reason may not conclusively prove the necessity of an iPhone for her to fit in.

   d. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(WCB\)):**
      - Is the \(R\) weak in establishing a compelling causal basis for the \(P\)?
      - Yes, the causal basis that "everyone has one" and "I want her to fit in" may not be compelling enough.

   e. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(RR\)):**
      - Is the \(R\) merely a repetition of the \(P\)?
      - No, the reason is different from the proposition.

   f. **Presumptuous Consensus (\(FU\)):**
      - Is the \(R\) assumed as certain based on an assumed universal consensus?
      - Yes, the assumption that "everyone has one" implies a presumed consensus.

   g. **Ambiguous Language Use (\(DEP\)):**
      - Can the \(R\) be taken in another sense than intended?
      - No clear ambiguous language is used in the \(R\).

4. **Classifying the Statement (\(s\)):**
   - The statement primarily matches with the \(G\), \(WCB\), and \(FU\) types.

   **Conclusion:**
   - The defective argument types that apply to the statement "I guess I should buy my 12-year-old daughter an iPhone. Everyone at her school has one, and I want her to fit in with the other kids." are \(G\) (Generalization), \(WCB\) (Insufficient Causal Basis), and \(FU\) (Presumptuous Consensus).

Thus, the statement is classified under \(G\), \(WCB\), and \(FU\) based on the analysis.
