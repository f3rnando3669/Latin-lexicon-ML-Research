For 
Let's apply the process of **IDAA** (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as a specific type of defective argument) to the given string "Oh, please. What would you know about labor laws? You don't even have a job."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify and isolate the Proposition (P):**
   - Here, the implied proposition is questioning the knowledge or authority of the person regarding labor laws.
   - Implied Proposition (\<P>): "You do not have knowledge about labor laws."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - The reason given for the proposition is the statement that the person being addressed does not have a job.
   - Reason (\<R>): "You don't have a job."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - In this case, there is no additional proof provided beyond the stated reason.

4. **Determine if the Reason (R) supports the Proposition (P):**
   - Analyze if "\<R>" (You don't have a job) provides a strong causal basis to support "\<P>" (You do not have knowledge about labor laws).
   - This reason (\<R>) does not necessarily establish knowledge or lack of knowledge about labor laws conclusively.

### Mapping to Defective Argument Types

5. **Evaluate if it matches Generalization (G):**
   - No, Generalization involves asserting something based on limited or non-representative samples as if it applies to all.

6. **Evaluate if it matches Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - No, Incomplete Enumeration involves claiming a complete list while missing out pertinent possibilities.

7. **Evaluate if it matches Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - Partially, because “You don’t have a job” does not conclusively demonstrate the lack of knowledge about labor laws. However, we'll explore further for more precise classification.

8. **Evaluate if it matches Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - Yes, this fits. The causal basis submitted (“You don’t have a job”) for the proposition (“You do not have knowledge about labor laws”) is weak and not compelling. Employment status does not necessarily correlate with one's knowledge about labor laws.

9. **Evaluate if it matches Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - No, the argument does not repeat the proposition; it provides a separate reason.

10. **Evaluate if it matches Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
    - No, there is no appeal to a universal agreement or consensus.

11. **Evaluate if it matches Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
    - No, the argument does not involve ambiguity in interpreting the language used.

### Conclusion

Based on the steps and analysis, the defective argument type for the provided string "Oh, please. What would you know about labor laws? You don't even have a job." is best classified as **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because the reason provided ("You don't have a job") is not a compelling causal basis to support the proposition ("You do not have knowledge about labor laws").
