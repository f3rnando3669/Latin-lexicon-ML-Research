For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "You can't give me a C! I'm an A student, a C is just wrong!", we'll decompose the task into specific steps and then perform the classification.

### Decomposition of the Task <IDA> (Step-by-Step)
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Determine the main assertion or claim being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Find the causal basis or rationale given to support the proposition.
3. **Check for Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Look for any additional arguments or evidence that corroborate the reason.
4. **Classify Defective Argument Type:** Based on the definitions provided, classify the string as one of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Steps to Apply <IDAA> to the Given String

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- Proposition: "You can't give me a C!"

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- Reason: "I'm an A student," implying that because the speaker generally gets A grades, they should not receive a C.

#### Step 3: Check for Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- There is no additional argument or evidence provided to corroborate the reason.

#### Step 4: Classify Defective Argument Type
- **Generalization (G):** The argument is not directly asserting a universal conclusion from a particular case.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument is not about enumerating possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason "I'm an A student" does not conclusively prove the proposition "You can't give me a C." Performance in general ("A student") does not guarantee performance in every instance.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis that being an "A student" should lead to never receiving a lower grade is not compelling.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason given is not a repetition of the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument does not appeal to universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** There is no evident ambiguous language in the argument.

From these classifications, the argument fails because the reason given is not a strong causal basis for the proposition, and it does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.

### Conclusion
The string "You can't give me a C! I'm an A student, a C is just wrong!" can be classified under both:
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** The reason given does not conclusively prove the proposition.
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The reason provided does not present a compelling causal basis for the proposition.

Therefore, the defective argument types for the given string are: **<IR>** and **<WCB>**.
