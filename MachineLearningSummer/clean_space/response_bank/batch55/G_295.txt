For 
To apply the IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of identifying defective arguments) to the given statement, we need to follow systematic steps. Our goal is to classify the argument presented by the shopkeeper into one of the predefined defective argument types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDAA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), and Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
    - **Proposition (<P>):** You are stealing (implicitly accused by the shopkeeper).
    - **Reason (<R>):** You have an empty gum wrapper in your pocket.
    - **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** The shopkeeper's exclamation “I knew it!” implies that the empty gum wrapper serves as proof of the accusation.

2. **Analyze the Defective Argument in the Context:**
    - The shopkeeper sees the empty gum wrapper and immediately concludes that you are stealing without further evidence or context.
    
3. **Determine the specific defective argument type (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP):**
    - **Generalization (G):** The shopkeeper might be generalizing based on the empty gum wrapper that everyone with an empty gum wrapper is a thief, but this is not explicitly stated.
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable since the inference is not from an incomplete set of possibilities but rather a single instance.
    - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The conclusion (you are a thief) is drawn from an inconclusive reason (finding an empty gum wrapper), which is not strong enough to substantiate theft.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Similarly, the causal basis (empty gum wrapper) is insufficient or weak in establishing that someone is stealing.
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Not applicable since the reason is not a verbatim repetition of the proposition.
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Not applicable, as the statement doesn’t rely on a supposed universal agreement.
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Not applicable, as the language used isn’t ambiguous but rather a hasty conclusion.

4. **Classify the Argument:**
    - Considering the steps and analysis, the most fitting defective argument types are **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

The shopkeeper has committed a fallacy of both Inconclusive Reason (**IR**) and Insufficient Causal Basis (**WCB**), wherein the reason provided (empty gum wrapper) does not conclusively or sufficiently demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (you are stealing).
