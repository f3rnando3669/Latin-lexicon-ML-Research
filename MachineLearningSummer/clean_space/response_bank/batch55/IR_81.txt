Sure! Let's break down the task of classifying the given argument according to the steps of <IDAA>. 

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: The proposition is the main statement or assertion that is being made.
   - In this argument, the proposition is: "Canceling the fashion show is the best decision."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: The reason is the causal basis for the proposition which establishes the truth of what is being asserted.
   - In this argument, the reason is: "I believe deeply that canceling the fashion show is the best decision."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: The proof of reason corroborates the reason by means of additional arguments or evidence.
   - In this argument, the proof offered is: "I know it is. I am very certain about it."

4. **Evaluate if the <P>, <R>, and <PR> meet the criteria for a complete argument**:
   - The proposition is clear: "Canceling the fashion show is the best decision."
   - The reason provided is based on the speaker’s personal belief: "I believe deeply..." 
   - The proof of reason is based on the speaker’s certainty: "I know it is. I am very certain about it."

5. **Check for any defective argument types**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: This isn't applicable here since the argument is subjective and personal rather than a generalization of a broader group.
   
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: There's no enumeration in the argument, so this defect does not apply.
   
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason is based on personal belief and certainty, which may not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition to an objective observer.
   
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reason provided ("I believe deeply...") is weak in terms of offering a compelling causal basis for the proposition. It's a subjective feeling rather than an objective or strong reason.
   
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The reason effectively repeats the proposition without adding new information. "I believe deeply that canceling the fashion show is the best decision" essentially restates the proposition with "I believe" as the only addition.
   
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: There's no claim to universal agreement in this argument, so this defect does not apply.
   
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The language isn't ambiguous; it is quite straightforward in expressing personal belief and certainty.

6. **Classify the argument**:
   Based on the evaluation, the argument most clearly fits:
   - **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: The reason ("I believe deeply that canceling the fashion show is the best decision") repeats the proposition rather than providing new information or a compelling reason.
   - **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The subjective belief doesn’t provide a strong causal basis for the proposition.

Therefore, the argument can be classified as both **<RR>** and **<WCB>**.
