For 
To apply IDAA (the application of the decomposition task D to the classification task IDA) to the given string "Some tall people recently vandalized the park. Tall people are so irresponsible," we'll break down the task of classification into specific steps and then execute those steps.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
First, we identify the proposition set forth in the argument. The proposition is a statement summarizing what is being asserted.

In this case, the proposition <P> is: "Tall people are so irresponsible."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
Next, we identify the reason, which sets forth the causal basis for the proposition.

In this case, the reason <R> is: "Some tall people recently vandalized the park."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Argument for Defects
Now, we need to classify the argument based on known defective argument types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

Let's analyze it against these defects:

- **Generalization (G)**: The argument takes specific instances of tall people vandalizing the park and applies this trait (irresponsibility) to all tall people. This matches the definition of Generalization, where an assertion based on a part (some tall people) is referred to all (all tall people).

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This isn't applicable here since the argument does not make any claim about enumerating possibilities or instances exhaustively.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason given does not necessarily establish the conclusion definitively (not all tall people are necessarily irresponsible based on some examples), but this is more accurately captured by the defect of Generalization than Inconclusive Reason.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason and proposition are not exactly repeating the same thing.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This could be argued since the causal connection (vandalism -> irresponsibility of all tall people) is weak, but the primary defect is the leap from few to many, fitting Generalization.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument doesn't invoke universal agreement or consensus.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: There is no ambiguity in the language use that changes meaning.

### Step 4: Determine the Most Relevant Defective Argument Type
Based on the analysis, the argument most fits the defective argument type of **Generalization (G)** because it generalizes the behavior of some individuals to all individuals in the group.

### Conclusion
The string "Some tall people recently vandalized the park. Tall people are so irresponsible." is best classified as **<G> Generalization**.

So, the application of IDAA to the given string results in identifying the defective argument type as **<G>**.
