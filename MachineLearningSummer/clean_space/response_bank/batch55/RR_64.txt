To apply the process of IDAA (the application of task decomposition to the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types) to the given string "Richardson is the most successful mayor the town has ever had because he's the best mayor of our history," we need to break down the task into specific steps and then execute them. Here’s the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P) and the Reason (R)

- **Proposition (P):** "Richardson is the most successful mayor the town has ever had."
- **Reason (R):** "He's the best mayor of our history."

### Step 2: Analyze the Relationship Between P and R

Examine how the Reason (R) supports the Proposition (P). In this case, determine if saying that Richardson is the best mayor of our history adequately demonstrates that he is the most successful mayor the town has ever had.

### Step 3: Classify the Potential Defective Argument Types

Here, we evaluate the Reason (R) in relation to the Proposition (P) and compare it with the definitions of the defective argument types:

- **Generalization (G):** This isn't applicable here since the argument isn’t generalizing from a part to a whole.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This isn’t applicable since the argument isn’t about omitting possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This might be relevant if the Reason (R) doesn’t necessarily lead to the Proposition (P).
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This pertains to weak causal connections, which may be relevant here.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This might be relevant if the Reason (R) is just a restatement of the Proposition (P) in different wording.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This isn’t applicable as the argument doesn’t appeal to a presumed universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** This isn’t applicable as there doesn’t appear to be ambiguity in the terms discussed.

### Step 4: Determine the Most Appropriate Defective Argument Type

- Evaluate if the Reason (R) "He's the best mayor of our history" is simply a restatement of the Proposition (P) "Richardson is the most successful mayor the town has ever had." In this case, it can be seen as a repetition of the same idea using different words.
- Also assess whether "being the best mayor of our history" conclusively proves "most successful mayor the town has ever had." There is no additional evidence or causal explanation provided to support this claim.

### Conclusion

The most appropriate defective argument types for the given string are as follows:

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The Reason (R) "He's the best mayor of our history" appears to restate the same idea expressed in the Proposition (P) using different wording.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The Reason (R) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition (P) as no sufficient causal basis or additional proof is given.

Thus, applying IDAA to the string "Richardson is the most successful mayor the town has ever had because he's the best mayor of our history" classifies it as:
- **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**
- **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**
