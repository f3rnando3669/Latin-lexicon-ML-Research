For 
To apply \( <IDAA> \) (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument into specific steps) to \( "Trump asked Clinton about her ‘33,000‘ deleted emails, but Clinton responds by correcting him rather than addressing the deleted emails: ‘Not — well, we turned over 35,000, so…’" \), we need to follow a structured approach. Let's break it down:

### Step 1: Identify the Parts of the Argument
1. **Proposition (P)**: Trump’s assertion or question about Clinton's “33,000“ deleted emails.
2. **Clinton's Response**: Clinton's statement of having turned over 35,000 emails.

### Step 2: Determine the Type of Defective Argument
Next, we examine if Clinton's response fits any of the defective argument types defined.

1. **Generalization (G)**: This involves an assertion based on a part or majority, but not necessarily applicable to all.
    - Does not seem to fit as the response isn't a sweeping generalization.
  
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This involves claiming to have considered all possibilities but missing pertinent ones.
    - Not directly applicable here as the response doesn't concern an enumeration of possibilities.
  
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided does not conclusively establish the correctness of the proposition.
    - Not applicable as Clinton’s response is not a reason for Trump’s proposition.
  
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis is weak.
    - Not applicable as Clinton’s response itself does not include a causal basis for an argument.
  
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason repeats the proposition.
    - Not applicable as Clinton’s response does not repeat Trump’s assertion.
  
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assuming something is true due to assumed universal agreement.
    - Not applicable as there’s no presumption based on universal agreement.
  
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: A proof can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended.
    - Clinton’s response could be seen as ambiguous because it shifts the focus from the specific 33,000 deleted emails to the 35,000 emails turned over.

### Step 3: Classify the Argument
By ruling out other options, we identify that Clinton’s response could be classified under **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**, since it changes the focus of the discussion without directly addressing the specific issue raised about the 33,000 deleted emails:
- Clinton corrects the number but does not address the crucial point about the deleted emails, which could imply a redirection or ambiguity in addressing the concern.

### Step 4: Validate the Classification
To ensure accuracy, we verify if the response fits the essence of **DEP**:
- Trump asked about 33,000 deleted emails, which is a specific concern.
- Clinton talks about a different number (35,000 turned over emails), which can be interpreted differently and hence ambiguous.

Therefore, the classification of the argument "Trump asked Clinton about her '33,000' deleted emails, but Clinton responds by correcting him rather than addressing the deleted emails: 'Not — well, we turned over 35,000, so…'" as involving **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)** is appropriate.

### Conclusion
Upon decomposing the task and analyzing the components step-by-step, it is clear that Clinton’s response is best classified as **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**.
