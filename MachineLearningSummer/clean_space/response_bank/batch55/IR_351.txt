For 
Applying <IDAA> to classify the given string "The noble forefathers who created this great country did not fail; it is a great country now as it was then, by their very making." involves decomposing the task of classification into specific steps and then applying those steps systematically.

Here are the detailed steps of <D> to perform <IDA>:

1. **Identify and analyze the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition: "The noble forefathers who created this great country did not fail; it is a great country now as it was then, by their very making."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason: "it is a great country now as it was then, by their very making."

3. **Analyze the completeness and conclusiveness of the Reason (<R>), Proof of Reason (<PR>), and their logical connections:**
   - Determine if the reason provided conclusively supports the proposition.
   - Check for corroboration or additional arguments provided as proof.

Now we will apply these steps to our given string:

### Step-by-step Analysis

**Step 1: Identify and analyze the Proposition (<P>):**
- The proposition claims that the noble forefathers did not fail and that the country's greatness is attributed to their creation.

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>):**
- The reason given is that the country is great now as it was then, implying continuous greatness due to the forefathers' actions.

**Step 3: Analyze the Reason (<R>), Proof of Reason (<PR>), and logical connections:**
- The reason states that because the country is great now just as it was then, it must be due to the forefathers' making.

### Classification

- **Generalization (<G>):** The string does not necessarily attempt to generalize from a part to a whole group.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument does not claim completeness in considering all possibilities or scenarios.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason provided does not definitively prove the proposition. While the countryâ€™s greatness is stated, no direct causal link is firmly established between the forefathers' actions and the current state.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The assertion that the country's greatness is solely due to the forefathers lacks a compelling causal explanation. The claim hinges on correlation rather than causation.
- **Faulty Repetition (<RR>):** The statement could be seen as repeating the proposition in the guise of reason. "The country is great now as it was then" essentially rephrases "did not fail" without adding substantive reasoning.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The string does not rely on universal agreement to support the argument.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** No significant ambiguity in language affecting the sense.

Based on the analysis, the defective argument type most fitting is <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), as the reason given essentially rehashes the proposition without providing new, substantial evidence to support it.
