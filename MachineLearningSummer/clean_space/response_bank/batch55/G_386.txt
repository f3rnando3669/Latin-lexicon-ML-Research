To apply the IDAA (application of decomposition to the task of classifying a string as one of the defined defective argument types) to the string "If we allow our 14 year-old to have her first date tonight, what's next? A wedding, kids?", follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand the proposition and argument structure
Identify the main proposition (<P>) and the reason (<R>) presented, if any.

- **Proposition (<P>):** Allowing the 14-year-old to have her first date tonight.
- **Reasoning (<R>):** It will lead to a wedding and kids.

### Step 2: Analyze the type of reasoning used
Identify the nature of the reasoning and whether it falls into any of the defective argument types.

- **Type of reasoning:** The rationale implies a slippery slope where allowing a date is presumed to directly lead to significant life events like a wedding and children in an exaggerated sequence.

### Step 3: Define the relevant defective argument type
Match the analysis with the defective argument types defined earlier.

1. **<G> (Generalization):** Not applicable since it discusses a specific case rather than generalizing from one part to the whole.
2. **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):** Not applicable as there isn't a claim of complete enumeration of possibilities.
3. **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** Potentially applicable since the reasoning does not conclusively demonstrate that the proposition directly leads to the asserted conclusion.
4. **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** Strongly applicable because the causal link between allowing a date and subsequent life events is not compelling or substantiated.
5. **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** Not applicable as the reason is not simply repeating the proposition.
6. **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):** Not applicable since it does not assume any consensus.
7. **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):** Not applicable as there isnâ€™t ambiguity in language usage.

### Step 4: Conclude the classification
Based on the above analysis, classify the string.

**Classification:** The argument primarily fits the type **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)** because the reason given (that a date will lead to a wedding and kids) has a very weak causal basis for the proposition.

Therefore, the defective argument type for the string is **<WCB>**.
