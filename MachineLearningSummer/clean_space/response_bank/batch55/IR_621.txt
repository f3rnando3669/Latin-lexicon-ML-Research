For 
To apply the process of IDAA to the given argument "You say that we have exaggerated the problem with global warming, but have you even considered how much more the homeless suffer when temperatures soar?" we'd follow these steps of decomposition to classify the type of defective argument:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) for IDA:
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Understand and isolate what the speaker intends to prove.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the causal basis provided to establish the truth of the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Look for any additional arguments or evidence intended to support the reason.
4. **Evaluate for Generalization (G)**: Check if the proposition is a general statement based on a limited sample.
5. **Evaluate for Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Determine if the argument claims to have covered all possibilities but might have missed significant ones.
6. **Evaluate for Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Assess if the reason given sufficiently demonstrates the correctness of the proposition.
7. **Evaluate for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Check if the causal basis provided is compelling and sufficient.
8. **Evaluate for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: See if the reason merely repeats the proposition without adding new value.
9. **Evaluate for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Verify if the argument relies on a universally agreed statement that is actually disputed.
10. **Evaluate for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Look for any ambiguity or potential misinterpretation of the terms used.

### Applying IDAA steps to classify the provided string:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - The proposition is that the speaker disagrees with the claim that the problem with global warming is exaggerated.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - The reason is presented in the second part of the sentence: "have you even considered how much more the homeless suffer when temperatures soar?"

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - There is no explicit additional argument or evidence presented within the string. It is assumed but not provided.

4. **Evaluate for Generalization (G)**:
   - The argument does not make a general assertion based on a single part or a majority of individuals.

5. **Evaluate for Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - The argument does not claim to enumerate all possibilities regarding the impacts of global warming.

6. **Evaluate for Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - This step is crucial. The reason provided, "how much more the homeless suffer when temperatures soar," is not conclusively demonstrating that global warming as a whole is not exaggerated. The suffering of the homeless is one aspect and does not address the overall claim comprehensively.

7. **Evaluate for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - The reason given (homeless suffering due to soaring temperatures) does not form a compelling causal basis for the proposition (global warming is not exaggerated). It focuses on a specific consequence without connecting it directly to the larger argument.

8. **Evaluate for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - The reason does not repeat the proposition.

9. **Evaluate for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - The argument does not rely on a universally agreed but disputed statement.

10. **Evaluate for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
   - The term "exaggerated" and the connection between global warming and homeless suffering could be misinterpreted or misunderstood.

### Conclusion:
The most fitting classification for the given argument is **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The reason provided does not compellingly establish the truth of the proposition that the problem with global warming is not exaggerated. Instead, it highlights a specific detrimental effect (homeless suffering) without sufficiently connecting it to the broader context needed to counter the claim of exaggeration.
