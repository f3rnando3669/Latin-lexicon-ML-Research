To apply the IDAA (decomposition of the classification task IDA into specific steps) to the argument "All elephants are big. Some boys are big. Therefore some boys are elephants", let's break it down and classify it as one of the defective argument types. Here are the steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition, Reason, and Proof.

- **Proposition (P):** "Some boys are elephants."
- **Reason (R):** "Some boys are big."
- **Proof of Reason (PR):** "All elephants are big."

### Step 2: Evaluate the relationship between P, R, and PR.

- **Check if R logically supports P:**
    - R states: "Some boys are big."
    - P states: "Some boys are elephants."

    There is no logical connection between the size of boys and the species they belong to.

- **Check if PR corroborates R:**
    - PR states: "All elephants are big."
    - R states: "Some boys are big."

    The fact that all elephants are big does not logically support the claim that some boys being big has any bearing on whether they are elephants.

### Step 3: Classify the types of defects.

- **Check for Generalization (G):**
    - There is no generalization of a statement about a part to the whole.

- **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
    - There is no claim of complete enumeration here.

- **Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
    - The reason, "Some boys are big," does not conclusively demonstrate that "some boys are elephants."

- **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
    - The reason provided does not offer a compelling causal basis for the proposition.

- **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
    - The reason does not repeat the proposition.

- **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
    - There is no assumption that a fact is universally agreed upon.

- **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
    - There is no ambiguous language in the presented statements.

### Step 4: Determine the most fitting defect type.

By evaluating the steps, the most fitting defective argument type is:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason ("Some boys are big") does not logically lead to the proposition ("Some boys are elephants").

Thus, applying IDAA to the argument "All elephants are big. Some boys are big. Therefore some boys are elephants," we classify it as an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** type argument.
