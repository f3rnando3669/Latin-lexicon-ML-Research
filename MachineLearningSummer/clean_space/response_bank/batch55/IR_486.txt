For 
To apply the decomposition of the task \( \text{IDA} \) (classifying a string as a specific defective argument type) to the given statement, we will break down the process into specific steps. This process will be labelled as \( \text{IDAA} \), which involves the application of decomposition (\( \text{D} \)) to \( \text{IDA} \).

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (\( \text{D} \)):

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( \text{P} \)) and the Reason (\( \text{R} \)) in the string.**
2. **Determine if the Reason (\( \text{R} \)) supports the Proposition (\( \text{P} \)) conclusively.**
3. **Examine for the specific types of defective arguments (\( \text{G}, \text{FE}, \text{IR}, \text{RR}, \text{WCB}, \text{FU}, \text{DEP} \)) based on what is identified in step 2.**

Applying this to the given string:

### String: 
"Aristotle thought women were inferior to men. Aristotle is one of the smartest men who ever lived, so he must be right about this."

### Step 1: Identify \( \text{P} \) and \( \text{R} \)

- **Proposition (\( \text{P} \))**: "Women are inferior to men."
  
- **Reason (\( \text{R} \))**: "Aristotle thought women were inferior to men. Aristotle is one of the smartest men who ever lived."

### Step 2: Determine if the Reason (\( \text{R} \)) supports the Proposition (\( \text{P} \)) conclusively

- The Reason asserts that just because Aristotle was highly intelligent, his view on women being inferior is correct.
- This Reason appears more as an appeal to authority than a conclusive causal basis.

### Step 3: Examine for specific types of defective arguments

#### Type Check for \( \text{Generalization (G)} \)
- \( \text{P} \) does not generalize from a small sample to a whole, hence it is not \( \text{G} \).

#### Type Check for \( \text{Incomplete Enumeration (FE)} \)
- There is no enumeration of possibilities, hence it is not \( \text{FE} \).

#### Type Check for \( \text{Inconclusive Reason (IR)} \)
- \( \text{R} \) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of \( \text{P} \). The fact that Aristotle was intelligent does not inherently prove that his view is correct.

#### Type Check for \( \text{Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)} \)
- \( \text{R} \) is not a repetition of \( \text{P} \), it provides additional information about Aristotle.

#### Type Check for \( \text{Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)} \)
- The causal basis for \( \text{P} \) in \( \text{R} \) is weak. Just because Aristotle believed something does not provide a compelling reason for it to be true.

#### Type Check for \( \text{Presumptuous Consensus (FU)} \)
- \( \text{PR} \) is not assumed to be universally agreed upon, so it is not \( \text{FU} \).

#### Type Check for \( \text{Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)} \)
- There is no ambiguous language in \( \text{PR} \) which can be taken in another sense. So, it is not \( \text{DEP} \).

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis:

- The defective argument type primarily fits **Inconclusive Reason (\( \text{IR} \))**. The Reason provided does not conclusively prove the correctness of the Proposition.
- Additionally, it also shows signs of **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( \text{WCB} \))** since the basis (Aristotle's intelligence) is not compelling enough to establish the truth of \( \text{P} \).

Thus, the classification of the given string results in a defective argument that exhibits characteristics of:

- \( \text{IR} \) (Inconclusive Reason)
- \( \text{WCB} \) (Insufficient Causal Basis)
