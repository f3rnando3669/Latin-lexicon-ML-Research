Applying the concept of <IDAA> to the task of classifying the string "attaching an argument to a person of false or appeared authority in order to give credence to their argument," we will decompose the task into specific steps.

### Step 1: Understand the string
- **String**: "attaching an argument to a person of false or appeared authority in order to give credence to their argument"
- This describes a fallacy where the validity of an argument is asserted based on the authority of a person who is not a legitimate expert or whose authority is questionable.

### Step 2: Identify the key elements within the string
- **Main action**: "attaching an argument to a person of false or appeared authority"
- **Purpose**: "in order to give credence to their argument."

### Step 3: Match the elements to the definitions of defective argument types

Based on the definitions provided, let's analyze the elements:
1. **Generalization** (<G>): Applicable to arguments where an assertion is based on a few cases and generalized to all cases.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration** (<FE>): Claiming a complete list of possibilities while missing some.
3. **Inconclusive Reason** (<IR>): The reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis** (<WCB>): The causal basis does not compellingly support the proposition.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition** (<RR>): The reason repeats the proposition without adding new information.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus** (<FU>): Claiming something is certainly true because it is "universally agreed upon."
7. **Ambiguous Language Use** (<DEP>): The proof can be interpreted differently than intended.

The string under analysis seems to involve two main factors:
- **Citation of authority**: Utilizing an authority to back up an argument.
- **Questionable credibility of authority**: The authority cited is either false or has dubious credibility.

### Step 4: Evaluate applicable defective argument types

Evaluate which of the defective argument types is most appropriate:
- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: This would fit if the argument were based on the assumption that the authority is universally accepted.
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: This may fit if the false authority does not conclusively support the argument.
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: This would fit if the authority cited does not compellingly provide a reason to support the argument, making it weak.
- **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: This would fit if the argument's language causes confusion.

Given the specific nature of attaching an argument to questionable authority to give it credence, it most closely resembles <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis), as the reason (authority of the person) is weak and does not compellingly provide a sufficient causal basis for the argument.

### Step 5: Classify the string

The string "attaching an argument to a person of false or appeared authority in order to give credence to their argument" is classified as a:
- **Type**: <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)

### Conclusion

Applying <IDAA> to the string, we have classified it step by step and determined that:
"attaching an argument to a person of false or appeared authority in order to give credence to their argument" is an instance of the defective argument type <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
