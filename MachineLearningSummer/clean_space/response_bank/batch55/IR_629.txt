To apply the decomposition method (IDAA) to classify the given string, let's break down the process into specific steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
This step involves determining the main statement or claim that is being argued.
- **Proposition (P)**: "I didn’t really deserve an F!"

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
This step involves identifying the causal basis or justification provided for the Proposition.
- **Reason (R)**: "In the past week I sprained my ankle, my dog ran away, and my kitchen caught on fire!"

### Step 3: Check if there's a Proof of Reason (PR)
This step involves determining if there are any additional arguments that corroborate the Reason.
- **Proof of Reason (PR)**: There is no additional proof provided beyond the reason itself in this instance.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
Now, we classify the given string by comparing against known defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument does not generalize from one part or majority to all, so it is not G.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The claim does not list possibilities, so it is not FE.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The Reason given (hardships faced) does not logically or conclusively demonstrate that the student does not deserve an F based on performance assessment criteria.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The reasons given (sprained ankle, dog ran away, kitchen caught on fire) may evoke sympathy but do not provide a compelling causal basis for changing the grade.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The Reason does not simply repeat the Proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There is no mention of a consensus or universal agreement.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language is not ambiguous; it is clear and specific.

### Step 5: Final Classification
Based on the steps above, the defective argument classification fits best into:
- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The Reason provided (personal hardships) is not a compelling causal basis for altering the academic result.

Therefore, applying IDAA to the string "Professor, please, PLEASE reconsider my grade on the Final! I know I only answered 7% of the questions correctly, but I didn’t really deserve an F! In the past week I sprained my ankle, my dog ran away, and my kitchen caught on fire! I think it’s only fair I get a chance to retake the test!" concludes that it is of type **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
