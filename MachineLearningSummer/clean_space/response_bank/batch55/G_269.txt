For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of identifying defective argument types) to the statement "All sports car drivers are too aggressive!" step by step, we'll carefully break down the IDA task and then systematically apply each part of the definition to classify the statement. 

Here’s the step-by-step process (D) for IDAA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
    - Set forth summarily what is intended to be proven.
2. **Identify the Reason (R) if present**:
    - Look for the causal basis intended to establish the truth of the Proposition.
3. **Check for any corroborations (PR) if present**:
    - Look for any additional arguments meant to support the Reason.
4. **Evaluate Defective Argument Types**:
    - Examine the statement for characteristics of Generalization (G).
    - Examine the statement for characteristics of Incomplete Enumeration (FE).
    - Examine the statement for characteristics of Inconclusive Reason (IR).
    - Examine the statement for characteristics of Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).
    - Examine the statement for characteristics of Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR).
    - Examine the statement for characteristics of Presumptuous Consensus (FU).
    - Examine the statement for characteristics of Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

Now, let’s apply these steps to the given statement:

**Statement**: "All sports car drivers are too aggressive!"

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
    - The Proposition <P> here is: "All sports car drivers are too aggressive."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
    - There is no Reason <R> provided in the statement. It’s a straightforward assertion without any causal support or basis mentioned.

3. **Check for any corroborations (PR) if present**:
    - Again, there are no additional arguments or corroborations provided to support the Proposition.

4. **Evaluate Defective Argument Types**:

    - **Generalization (G)**:
        - The statement asserts that a characteristic (being too aggressive) applicable to some sports car drivers is applicable to all sports car drivers. Since this is a generalization based on potentially limited evidence, it matches the definition of Generalization.
        
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
        - Not applicable here, since the statement doesn’t enumerate possibilities.
        
    - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
        - There is no Reason provided, so this defect is not applicable.
        
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
        - No causal basis is given, hence this defect is also not applicable.
        
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
        - Not applicable here, since no Reason has been provided.
        
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
        - Not applicable as the statement does not assume universal agreement on a disputable fact.
        
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
        - The language is fairly direct and unambiguous in its intent, so this defect does not apply.

### Conclusion:
The statement "All sports car drivers are too aggressive!" is an example of Generalization (G), as it asserts an attribute of a subgroup to the whole group without sufficient basis to justify the universality of the claim.

Thus, applying IDAA to the statement, we classify it as type <G>.
