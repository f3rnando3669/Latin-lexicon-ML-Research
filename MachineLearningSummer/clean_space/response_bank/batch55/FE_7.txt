For 
To apply the concept of IDAA (the decomposition of IDA into specific steps) to the string "This is an example of," we need to classify the string as one of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP). The process of decomposition will involve breaking down the task IDA into manageable steps. Here’s how we can proceed:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of IDA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine the primary assertion or statement that is being made in the string.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Find the supporting reason or evidence provided to back up the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**: Look for any additional arguments or evidence supporting the reason.
4. **Classify the Defect**:
    - Check for Generalization (G)
    - Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
    - Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR)
    - Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
    - Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
    - Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
    - Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)

### Applying IDAA to "This is an example of":

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
    - The string seems like it is leading towards making a proposition but not a complete one. We can infer it is supposed to demonstrate something but isn't fully articulated.
   
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
    - There is no explicit reason given in the string. It lacks context and does not provide evidence or rationale.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**:
    - Since there is no stated reason, there cannot be any proof of reason provided.

4. **Classify the Defect**:

    **Generalization (G)**:
    - The string does not attempt a generalization based on a part or a majority. This is not applicable.
  
    **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
    - The string does not enumerate possibilities. This is not applicable.

    **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
    - Since it lacks any reason, it can be considered that it does not conclusively demonstrate anything. However, it is more about the absence rather than being inconclusive.

    **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
    - There is no causal basis or reason given, so it cannot be evaluated for insufficiency.
  
    **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
    - The string does not repeat the proposition. It doesn’t fulfill the criteria for RR.

    **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
    - The string does not assume anything is universally agreed upon. This is not applicable.

    **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
    - The phrase "This is an example of" is incomplete and could be taken in multiple senses, depending on what follows. This indicates ambiguity.

### Conclusion:
The string "This is an example of" is incomplete and ambiguous, making DEP (Ambiguous Language Use) the most fitting classification in this context.

### Final Classification:
**DEP (Ambiguous Language Use)**
