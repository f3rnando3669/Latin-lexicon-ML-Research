For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a string as a type of defective argument) to the string "“It must be cool because everyone is doing it..." said Kinza," we need to follow a structured step-by-step approach to identify the specific defective argument type. 

### Step 1: Analyze the Proposition (P) and Reason (R)
1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Proposition (P): "It must be cool."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Reason (R): "because everyone is doing it."

### Step 2: Evaluate the Reason (R)
- Is the reason (R) a strong and logically compelling justification for the proposition (P)?
- Is the reason (R) based on broad consensus or presumption?

### Step 3: Determine if Reason (R) Is Defective
- Cross-check the identified reason (R) with definitions of defective arguments:
  - **Generalization (G):** Is the assertion based on a limited number of cases and presumed for all?
  - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Does it claim completeness but miss significant possibilities?
  - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does it fail to conclusively demonstrate the truth of (P)?
  - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the causal basis weak and not compelling?
  - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Does the reason merely restate the proposition?
  - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Is the assertion based on presumed universal agreement that is actually in dispute?
  - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Is there ambiguity in the sense that could be interpreted differently?

### Step 4: Classification Based on Fitting Defective Argument Type
- Evaluate the identified reason (R) against each defective argument type:

The identified reason is: "because everyone is doing it." This suggests that the proposition "It must be cool" is based on the assumption that an action's popularity is a sufficient and compelling reason to believe in the proposition.

### Applying Evaluation:
- The reason (R) leans towards a presumed broad consensus, which is actually not a logically compelling evidence by itself.
- It assumes that widespread acceptance or popularity is an indicator of truth, which fits the definition of **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.

### Conclusion
To summarize, the string "“It must be cool because everyone is doing it..." said Kinza" is an example of the defective argument type **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.

By following these steps, we've broken down the advanced task of classifying the argument into specific evaluative steps, leading to the identification of the precise defective argument type.
