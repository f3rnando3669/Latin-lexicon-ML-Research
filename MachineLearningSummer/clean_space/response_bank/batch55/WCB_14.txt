For 
To apply the IDAA (Decomposition of an advanced task into specific steps for the classification of a defective argument) to the given string "Bush was 'determined to knock down Saddam Hussein' because of his 'nuclear bomb potential,'" we will take the following steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: This is the assertion or the claim that is being made. 
   - In this case, the proposition is "Bush was determined to knock down Saddam Hussein."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: This is the causal basis for the Proposition, explaining why the proposition is asserted.
   - The reason provided is "because of his nuclear bomb potential."

3. **Evaluate the Reason (R)**: Determine if this reason is conclusive or compelling, and if it provides sufficient support for the proposition.

4. **Classify the Argument Type**: Based on the definitions provided, we need to classify the string into one of the defective argument categories: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

Now, let's decompose each step in detail:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
- Proposition: "Bush was determined to knock down Saddam Hussein."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
- Reason: "because of his nuclear bomb potential."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Reason (R)
To evaluate this reason, consider whether the assertion about Saddam Hussein's nuclear bomb potential sufficiently and conclusively justifies Bush's determination.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument Type (IDA)
Let's consider each defective argument type:

- **<G> Generalization**: The argument doesn’t seem to be a generalization based on one part being referred to all.
  
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: The argument doesn’t claim a complete list of possibilities but fails to present certain pertinent ones.

- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: Does the reason "nuclear bomb potential" conclusively demonstrate the correctness of Bush's determination? This reason doesn't seem to provide conclusive proof—it’s speculative.
  
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: The causal basis, "nuclear bomb potential," might not be a compelling one for the decision to knock down Saddam Hussein, making it a weak reason.

- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: The reason provided does not appear to be a repetition of the proposition.

- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: The argument does not rest on the ground that "it is universally agreed upon."

- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: The statement doesn’t seem to involve ambiguous language usage that can be interpreted in another sense.

### Conclusion
After thoroughly evaluating, the defective argument type that best applies to the given string is either **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** or **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**. Given that the reason is speculatively connecting Saddam Hussein’s potential for nuclear bombs to justify Bush’s determination, it is more inclined towards **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** since it doesn’t conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.

Therefore, the given string can be classified as **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**.
