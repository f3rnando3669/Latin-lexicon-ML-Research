For 
To apply the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as a defective argument type (denoted as \( IDAA \)) to the given string "He’s not a great athlete; he’s a fraud, a cheat and a liar. That’s why not everybody is ‘happy for Lance.’,” let's break it down step by step. This decomposition (\( D \)) involves several specific steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The first step is to identify the main proposition \( P \) in the statement.

**Proposition (\( P \)):**
"He’s not a great athlete."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Next, determine the reason \( R \) given to support the proposition.

**Reason (\( R \)):**
"He’s a fraud, a cheat and a liar."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
Then, identify if there is any proof of the reason \( PR \) provided in the statement.

**Proof of Reason (\( PR \)):**
"That’s why not everybody is ‘happy for Lance.'”

### Step 4: Evaluate for Defective Argument Types
Now, we will evaluate the components identified to classify the argument as any of the defective types:

- **<G> Generalization:** Is the proposition based on a generalization from a specific case to a universal one?
  
  No, "He’s not a great athlete" is not a generalization but an assertion about Lance specifically.

- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:** Does the argument claim complete enumeration of possibilities and miss some pertinent ones?
  
  No, this argument does not involve enumeration of possibilities.

- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** Does the reason provided conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?

  The reason given ("He’s a fraud, a cheat and a liar") questions his character but does not directly conclude that he is not a great athlete, which is more about his athletic ability.

- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** Is the reason provided not a compelling causal basis for the proposition?

  The reason (cheating, fraud, lying) may suggest issues with integrity but these reasons don't directly cause him to not be a great athlete, hence potentially lacking compelling causation.

- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** Does the reason repeat the proposition in different words?
  
  No, the reason differs from the proposition.

- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** Does the argument assume consensus without proof?

  The mention of "not everybody is ‘happy for Lance’" suggests a presumption of consensus but it is not central to the argument's reasoning about athletics; it's used as reinforcement.

- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:** Is there ambiguous language that might mislead the interpretation?

  No, the language used is quite direct and not ambiguous.

### Step 5: Assign Defective Argument Type
Based on the evaluation:

- The Reason (\( R \)) does not conclusively prove the Proposition (\( P \)), indicating potential **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
- The Reason (\( R \)) provided is hinting at character traits that do not causally relate to his athletic ability thoroughly, indicating potential **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

Given these issues, the argument can be classified mainly as both **\( IR \)** and **\( WCB \)**, but the most prominent defect is:

**Classification: \(\textbf{IR} \)** (Inconclusive Reason)

Thus, the string "He’s not a great athlete; he’s a fraud, a cheat and a liar. That’s why not everybody is ‘happy for Lance.’” primarily exemplifies an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** defective argument type.
