For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying an argument as one of the defective types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>) to the argument "President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up. Jones is responsible for the rise in crime," we need to decompose the process into specific steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine what is being asserted or claimed in the argument.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the causal basis provided for the proposition.
3. **Analyze the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Check if there is any additional argument that corroborates the reason.
4. **Check for Defects in the Argument**: Examine if the identified parts fall into any of the defective argument types.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)

The proposition in the given argument is:
- **Proposition (<P>)**: "President Jones is responsible for the rise in crime."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)

The reason provided to support the proposition is:
- **Reason (<R>)**: "President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up."

### Step 3: Analyze the Proof of Reason (<PR>)

There is no explicit additional argument or evidence provided beyond the initial claim that the rise in taxes and the increase in crime rates are connected. Therefore, we can consider the <PR> to be the implicit causation argument claimed by <R>.

### Step 4: Check for Defects in the Argument

Now, we categorize the possible defects by comparing with the definitions provided:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: This defect involves making an assertion applicable to all based on limited data. This does not apply here as the assertion is about a specific individual and event.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This involves missing some possibilities in a supposed complete list. Not applicable here as the argument does not enumerate any possibilities.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: If the reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. It seems likely we need to consider this.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: If the causal basis for the proposition is weak or not compelling. This is closely related and should be considered.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: When the reason repeats the proposition. This is not the case here, as the reason does add new information.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Assuming something is universally agreed upon which is still in dispute. Not applicable, as there is no mention of supposed universal agreement.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: If the language used can be interpreted in another sense. This does not appear to be the case here.

### Conclusion:

The argument "President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up. Jones is responsible for the rise in crime" seems to fit the definitions of:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided (raising taxes) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (President Jones responsible for rise in crime) because correlation does not imply causation.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reason provided suggests a causal relationship between Jones raising taxes and the increase in crime rate without compelling evidence to establish this as a direct cause-and-effect relationship.

Therefore, classifying it involves recognizing it as <IR> and <WCB> defective argument types.
