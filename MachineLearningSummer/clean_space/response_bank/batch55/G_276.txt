For 
To apply <IDAA> to classify the given argument as one of the defective argument types, we need to decompose the task of <IDA> into specific steps and then execute those steps. Here's the detailed decomposition and application:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of IDA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   Determine what is being asserted or claimed.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   Find the causal basis given for the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   Look for additional arguments that support the reason.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument:**
   - Compare <P>, <R>, and <PR> with the definitions of defective argument types and classify accordingly.

### Applying IDAA to "A driver with a New York license plate cuts you off in traffic. You decide that all New York drivers are terrible drivers."

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
"A driver with a New York license plate cuts you off in traffic. You decide that **all New York drivers are terrible drivers**."

- **Proposition (<P>):** All New York drivers are terrible drivers.

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- **Reason (<R>):** A driver with a New York license plate cuts you off in traffic.

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- This particular argument does not provide additional arguments or substantial evidence as proof. The causal link from the reason to the proposition is directly presented without further proof.

#### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type
- We compare the structure of the argument with the definitions provided for defective arguments.

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - **Definition:** Assertion applied to all based on some or a majority but not necessarily all.
   - **Application:** The argument generalizes that all New York drivers are terrible based on the behavior of one driver.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - **Definition:** Misses out on some pertinent possibilities.
   - **Application:** The argument might miss other drivers' behaviors, but the primary fallacy is generalization.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - **Definition:** The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
   - **Application:** The singular instance does not conclusively demonstrate that all New York drivers are terrible.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - **Definition:** The reason provided is not compelling enough.
   - **Application:** The casual basis is weak but directly connects to generalization.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - **Definition:** Reason repeats the proposition.
   - **Application:** Not applicable here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - **Definition:** Proposition is assumed universally agreed upon without proof.
   - **Application:** Not applicable here.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - **Definition:** Proposition can be interpreted in another sense.
   - **Application:** Not applicable here.

From this analysis:

- The argument most closely fits the structure of a **Generalization (<G>)** because it makes a broad assertion about all New York drivers based on the behavior of a single driver.

### Conclusion:
The classification of the given argument string is of type **<G> (Generalization)**.
