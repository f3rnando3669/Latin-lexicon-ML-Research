### Decomposition of IDA (Task D)
To achieve the classification task IDA by decomposing it (D), the steps could be:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine what is being asserted or proposed in the argument.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Find out the causal basis provided to support the Proposition (P).
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**: Look for any arguments that corroborate the Reason (R).

Once the components (P, R, PR) are identified, we can classify any defects in the argument by evaluating if it matches any of the specific defective argument types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

### Applying IDAA to the Given Statement

**Statement**:
"I’m not a doctor, but I play a doctor on TV, and I wouldn’t dream of using anything but Tylenol for my toughest headaches."

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**
- Proposition (P): "I wouldn’t dream of using anything but Tylenol for my toughest headaches."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)**
- Reason (R): The statement "I play a doctor on TV" is indirectly provided as the reason.

**Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**
- Proof of Reason (PR): There is no explicit Proof of Reason provided in the statement.

### Evaluation

1. **Generalization (G)**: Does the argument make a broad claim based on limited evidence?
   - No, the statement does not attempt to generalize beyond the speaker’s personal preference.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Does the argument claim a complete enumeration but miss some possibilities?
   - No, the statement does not enumerate possibilities; instead, it’s a personal preference.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Does the Reason (R) fail to conclusively support the Proposition (P)?
   - Yes, playing a doctor on TV (R) does not provide a conclusive or compelling reason to support the idea of using Tylenol (P).

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Is the Reason (R) weak or unconvincing?
   - Yes, the causal basis that playing a doctor on TV (R) justifies using Tylenol (P) is weak.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Is the Reason (R) merely a restatement of the Proposition (P)?
   - No, the Reason (R) is different from the Proposition (P), although it is still weak.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Does the statement assume something universally without it being settled?
   - No, the consensus isn't claimed or assumed universally here.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Can the Proof of Reason (PR) be taken in another unintended sense?
   - No, there is no ambiguous language in the Proof of Reason.

### Conclusion
The statement "I’m not a doctor, but I play a doctor on TV, and I wouldn’t dream of using anything but Tylenol for my toughest headaches" can be classified as having an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and also as an **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
This is because the reason provided (playing a doctor on TV) does not conclusively support the proposition and is a weak causal basis for recommending Tylenol for headaches.
