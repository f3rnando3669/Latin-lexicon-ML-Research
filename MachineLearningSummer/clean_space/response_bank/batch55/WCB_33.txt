For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of identifying defective arguments) to the string "Since your parents named you 'Harvest,' they must be farmers," we will decompose the task of IDA (identifying the defective argument type) into specific steps and then apply these steps to the given string. Let's break it down:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
First, find the proposition, which is the part of the argument that sets forth what is intended to be proved.

In this case, the proposition (<P>) is:
- "Your parents must be farmers."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Next, determine the reason, which sets forth the causal basis for the proposition.

Here, the reason (<R>) is:
- "Since your parents named you 'Harvest.'"

### Step 3: Analyze the Type of Defective Argument
Compare the components identified with the definitions of defective argument types to classify the argument correctly.

#### Generalization (G)
Would this be a generalization where an assertion is based on some one part or a majority, but not necessarily applicable to all?
- **No, this doesn’t seem like a generalization.**

#### Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
Is this making a complete enumeration of possibilities but missing out on some pertinent ones?
- **No, enumeration doesn't seem to be involved here.**

#### Inconclusive Reason (IR)
Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
- **Yes, the fact that parents named a child 'Harvest' does not conclusively demonstrate that they must be farmers. There could be many other reasons for this name choice.**

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
Is the causal basis weak?
- **Yes, this is also the case here. The naming of a child 'Harvest' is a weak causal basis for concluding that the parents are farmers.**

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
Is the reason just a repetition of the proposition?
- **No, the reason is not simply a repetition of the proposition.**

#### Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
Does the proof rely on asserting it is universally agreed upon?
- **No, there's no appeal to universal agreement here.**

#### Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)
Can the proof be taken in another sense than intended?
- **No, the language isn’t ambiguous in a way that affects the intended meaning.**

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type
From the analysis, the string "Since your parents named you 'Harvest,' they must be farmers" fits best into the categories of Inconclusive Reason (IR) and Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).

### Conclusion:
- **IR (Inconclusive Reason):** The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition.
- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The causal basis which it submits for the proposition is not a compelling one.

Thus, after applying IDAA, we classify the argument as having both an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
