Applying **IDAA** to classify the statement **"How can you argue your case for vegetarianism when you are enjoying your steak?"** according to the defined defective argument types involves decomposing the task into specific steps and then applying each step. Here are the steps for the decomposition (**D**) and their applications to our task (**IDA**):

### Decomposition (**D**) for Task Classification (**IDA**):
1. **Identify the Proposition (P):** Determine the statement or claim intended to be proven.
2. **Identify the Reason (R):** Identify the causal basis or reasoning put forth to support the proposition.
3. **Analyze the Proof of Reason (PR):** Scrutinize additional arguments or evidence meant to corroborate the reason.
4. **Evaluate Argument Integrity:** Assess whether the argument holds logically or falls into any of the defective argument types.
5. **Classify Argument Defect:** Based on the evaluation, classify the identified defects into one of the predefined defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Application of Decomposition (IDAA):
1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Here, the implied proposition is: **"You cannot argue for vegetarianism effectively."**
   
2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - The implied reason for this proposition is: **"You are currently enjoying a steak."**
   
3. **Analyze the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - There does not seem to be an explicit proof of reason provided in the statement. The argument essentially rests on the reason identified.

4. **Evaluate Argument Integrity:**
   - A critical part of this step is to examine whether the reason (R) directly and conclusively supports the proposition (P). In this example, the underlying assumption is that one's current action (eating steak) invalidates one's argument for a vegetarian lifestyle.
   - Therefore, we need to check if this reason is logically sufficient or if it fails for some reason.

5. **Classify Argument Defect:**
   - Let's assess the defective argument types to find a match:
     - **Generalization (G):** Not applicable, since the argument doesn't generalize a claim based on partial observation.
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable, as the argument isnâ€™t about enumerating possibilities.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Generally speaking, a person's actions at a given moment don't necessarily disqualify their argument. One could have valid reasons for supporting vegetarianism despite occasional lapses.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The R here is weak because the act of eating steak does not fundamentally undermine the moral or health-based arguments for vegetarianism.
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Not applicable, no repetition is present.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Not applicable. The argument doesn't rely on a presumed consensus.
     - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Not applicable. The argument doesn't hinge on ambiguous language.

The most applicable defective argument type here is **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The causal basis provided (i.e., eating a steak) is not compelling enough to conclusively negate the proposition that one can advocate for vegetarianism.

### Conclusion
Based on the defined steps and analysis, "How can you argue your case for vegetarianism when you are enjoying your steak?" can be classified as an argument of type **<WCB>** (Insufficient Causal Basis).
