For 
To apply the IDAA (Decomposition of IDA) to the sentence "Kevin's grandparents do not know how to use a computer. Kevin thinks that all older people must be computer illiterate," we need to decompose the task of identifying the type of defective argument into specific steps. Here is how we can proceed step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
First, we need to identify what the main assertion or proposition is in the argument.

- **Proposition (<P>):** "All older people must be computer illiterate."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Next, we need to identify the reason provided to support the proposition.

- **Reason (<R>):** "Kevin's grandparents do not know how to use a computer."

### Step 3: Analyze the Relationship Between <P> and <R>
Examine whether the reason (<R>) provided is a strong and conclusive basis for the proposition (<P>).

### Step 4: Apply Classification Criteria
Apply the criteria for the types of defective arguments to determine which category this argument falls into.

1. **Generalization (<G>):** This type occurs when the proposition is an assertion based on a subset or majority but not necessarily applicable to all.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This type occurs when the argument claims to have made a complete enumeration but misses out on some possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This type occurs when the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This type occurs when the causal basis for the reason is not compelling.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This type occurs when the reason is merely a repetition of the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This type occurs when proof is assumed to be certain on the ground of universal agreement.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** This occurs when the proof can be taken in another sense than intended.

### Step 5: Evaluate
Based on the analysis, determine the most fitting defective argument type.

- **Proposition (<P>):** "All older people must be computer illiterate."
- **Reason (<R>):** "Kevin's grandparents do not know how to use a computer."

Kevin's grandparents are only a small subset of all older people. Therefore, it is not logically sound to generalize this subset to apply to the entire population of older people.

### Step 6: Conclude with Classification
Based on the evaluation, the defective argument type is:

- **Generalization (<G>):** Kevin is making a generalization that because his grandparents do not know how to use a computer, all older people must be computer illiterate. This fits the defective argument type <G>, where the proposition applies to all based on one part or a majority, but not necessarily to all.

### Conclusion
The sentence "Kevin's grandparents do not know how to use a computer. Kevin thinks that all older people must be computer illiterate." is classified as a type <G> defective argument.

So the classification of the given string is:

- **Type <G> (Generalization)**
