For 
To classify the given argument "First we handed out I-pads, now we use Quizizz, next we'll have robot subs!" as one of the defective argument types, we will follow a systematic approach to decompose the task. Here's the step-by-step decomposition of the task (\<D>) applied to the classification task (\<IDA>):

### Step 1: Identify \<P>, \<R>, and \<PR>
- **Proposition (\<P>):** Identify what the argument is trying to prove or assert.
- **Reason (\<R>):** Identify the reason or causal basis provided to support the proposition.
- **Proof of Reason (\<PR>):** Identify any additional evidence or arguments provided to support the reason.

### Step 2: Analyze the Argument Structure
- Examine the argument to see if it is attempting to generalize, enumerate, prove through reason, or repeat the proposition.

### Step 3: Compare with Defective Argument Types
- **Generalization (\<G>):** Does the proposition assert something broadly based on limited evidence?
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE>):** Does it claim completeness but miss some possibilities?
- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>):** Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB>):** Is the reason weak in providing a compelling causal basis?
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR>):** Does the reason repeat the proposition without adding new information?
- **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU>):** Is there an assumed certainty based on "universal agreement" which is still disputed?
- **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP>):** Can the proof or reasoning be taken in another sense than intended?

### Step 4: Classification
- Based on the analysis, classify the argument as one of the defective argument types.

### Applying Steps to Example Argument

#### Step 1: Identify \<P>, \<R>, and \<PR>
- **\<P>:** "Next we'll have robot subs"
- **\<R>:** "First we handed out I-pads, now we use Quizizz"
- **\<PR>:** Implied trend of technological implementation in education.

#### Step 2: Analyze the Argument Structure
- The argument is suggesting a progression in the adoption of technology in education (I-pads, Quizizz, and then robot substitutes).

#### Step 3: Compare with Defective Argument Types
- **Generalization (\<G>):** The final proposition (robot subs) is inferred from current trends (I-pads and Quizizz), assuming the trend will naturally continue.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE>):** The argument does not enumerate all possibilities between current technology and robot substitutes.
- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>):** The reason provided (current tech trends) doesn't conclusively prove that robot subs will be the next step.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB>):** The tech adoption examples given don't necessarily lead to the conclusion that robot subs are a logical next step.
- **Faulty Repetition (\<RR>):** The argument does not simply repeat the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU>):** It doesn't rely on an assumed universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP>):** The language used is straightforward and not ambiguous.

#### Step 4: Classification
The argument most closely fits the definition of:
- **Generalization (\<G>):** The proposition that "we'll have robot subs" is a generalization based on the limited evidence of current trends (I-pads and Quizizz) in technology adoption.

Therefore, the argument "First we handed out I-pads, now we use Quizizz, next we'll have robot subs!" is classified as a Generalization (\<G>).
