For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of decomposing an advanced task into specific steps) to the given string "You've never visited another country, so who cares what you say about immigration reform!", we need to break down the task of identifying the defective argument type step by step.

Here are the specific steps for <IDAA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) in the Argument:**
   - Analyze the statement to find the main assertion being made.
   - In the given string, the assertion appears to be: "who cares what you say about immigration reform".
   - This suggests that the speaker is dismissing the other person’s opinion on immigration reform.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>) Supporting the Proposition:**
   - Look for the causal basis or reason given for the assertion.
   - Here, the reason provided is: "You've never visited another country".

3. **Classify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine the type of reasoning used and evaluate whether it conclusively supports the proposition.
   - In this case, the reason is attacking the individual’s qualification (having never visited another country) rather than addressing the actual argument about immigration reform.

4. **Cross-reference with Defective Argument Types:**
   - Compare the identified <R> with the definitions of defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).
   - The reason given doesn’t logically connect to the qualification of speaking on immigration reform. It is more of an attack on the person rather than the argument itself.

5. **Match with the Appropriate Defective Argument Type:**
   - Generalization (G): Does not fit as it’s not generalizing from a part to a whole.
   - Incomplete Enumeration (FE): Not applicable as no enumeration is being claimed.
   - Inconclusive Reason (IR): The reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
   - Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB): Weak causal basis present, could be a match.
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR): Not applicable as it doesn’t merely repeat the proposition.
   - Presumptuous Consensus (FU): Not applicable as no consensus is assumed.
   - Ambiguous Language Use (DEP): Not relevant here.

**Conclusion:**
The closest match is **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**, as the reason provided ("You've never visited another country") is a weak and insufficient basis for dismissing someone's opinion on immigration reform. It fails to establish a compelling link to the proposition ("who cares what you say about immigration reform").

So, applying <IDAA> to the string "You've never visited another country, so who cares what you say about immigration reform!" results in classifying it as a defective argument type <WCB>.
