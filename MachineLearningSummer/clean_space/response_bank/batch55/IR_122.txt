Applying the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument (<IDAA>) to the provided string, we'll break down the task step by step.

**Step 1: Understand and Break Down the Argument**

- The string "Asking a respected scientist to weigh in on matters of economics is what fallacy?" is a question, asking us to identify the fallacy involved in relying on the expertise of a scientist in one field (science) for matters of another field (economics).

**Step 2: Identify the Components of the Argument**

- Here we identify the parts involved in the argument:
  - **P** (Proposition): We should trust the respected scientist's opinion on matters of economics.
  - **R** (Reason): The scientist is respected in their field.
  - **PR** (Proof of Reason): Generally, respected opinions are trustworthy in their respective areas.

**Step 3: Analyze the Structure and Relation**

- We see how the Reason (R) and Proof of Reason (PR) support the Proposition (P):
  - The Reason (R) claims the respect or reputation of the scientist is generally reliable.
  - However, this is in the context of their own field, not necessarily applicable to economics.

**Step 4: Match Against Definitions of Defective Argument Types**

- **Generalization (G)**: This is not claiming something based on a part or majority for all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This argument is not listing all possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The given reason does not conclusively support the proposition, as respect in one field does not mean expertise in another.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis (respect in one domain) is weak for another domain.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: There's no repetition as such.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: It’s not claiming it’s universally agreed.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: There’s no ambiguous use of language.

**Step 5: Classification**

- The best match here is **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, since the respect in one field does not guarantee authority in another unrelated field.

Upon further refining, **WCB** (Insufficient Causal Basis) is the most specific classification since reliance on respect in one's own field doesn't serve as a compelling reason for expertise in another field.

Thus, the defective argument type for "Asking a respected scientist to weigh in on matters of economics is what fallacy?" is best classified as **<WCB>**.
