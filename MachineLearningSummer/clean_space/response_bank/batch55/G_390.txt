To apply IDAA (the decomposition of IDA into specific steps) to the task of classifying the given statement "Three congressional representatives have had affairs. Members of Congress are adulterers," we will follow a systematic process. Here's the breakdown:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   Determine the main statement or claim being made.
   - In this case, the proposition, or <P>, is "Members of Congress are adulterers."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   Find the causal basis or reason given to support the proposition.
   - The reason given is "Three congressional representatives have had affairs."

3. **Evaluate the Reason (<R>):**
   Assess whether the given reason sufficiently supports the proposition based on typical argument forms.
   - We need to see if "Three congressional representatives have had affairs" logically supports "Members of Congress are adulterers."

4. **Check for Defective Argument Types:**
   Compare the argument against the definitions of defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Classification Process

- **Generalization (<G>):**
   Evaluate if the proposition is an overgeneralization based on insufficient data.
   - "Three congressional representatives have had affairs" refers only to a small subset of members of Congress.
   - The proposition "Members of Congress are adulterers" applies this characteristic to all members of Congress.

Given this evaluation, the argument's conclusion is drawn from a limited sample size and is applied to the entire group. This matches the criteria for a Generalization (<G>):

1. **<P>:** "Members of Congress are adulterers."
2. **<R>:** "Three congressional representatives have had affairs."
3. **Issue Identified:** The argument is assuming that because a few members of a larger group have committed an act, the entire group is characterized by this act.

Therefore, the statement "Three congressional representatives have had affairs. Members of Congress are adulterers" classifies as a **Generalization (<G>)**.
