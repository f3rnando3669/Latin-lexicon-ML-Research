For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "It is the center of the spectrum of two extremes of deficiency and excessiveness", we will follow the process step-by-step to classify it as one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Decomposition of <IDA> into specific steps (<D>):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), and Proof of Reason (<PR>) components of the argument, if present.**
2. **Evaluate the argument for each of the defective types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>)**
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition, Reason, and Proof of Reason
In the given string "It is the center of the spectrum of two extremes of deficiency and excessiveness," we need to identify whether it contains:

- A **Proposition (<P>)**: A statement of what is being claimed or suggested.
- A **Reason (<R>)**: A justification or basis for why the Proposition is true.
- A **Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Corroborating evidence or arguments supporting the Reason.

In this case:
- Proposition (<P>): "It is the center of the spectrum."
- Reason (<R>): "of two extremes of deficiency and excessiveness." (This information, however, appears insufficient and vague, hinting at the nature of the reasoning involved but not providing substantive causal evidence.)

#### Step 2: Evaluate for Defective Argument Types

##### 1. Generalization (<G>)
The given string does not assert something about a part being true for all; hence, it does not appear to be a Generalization.

##### 2. Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
The given argument does not seem to enumerate possibilities; hence, it is unlikely to be an Incomplete Enumeration flaw.

##### 3. Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
The string provides a reason "of two extremes of deficiency and excessiveness" but does not conclusively demonstrate why being at the center of this spectrum is necessarily significant or valid. This suggests a lack of strong causal connection, indicating an Inconclusive Reason.

##### 4. Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
The given reason does not provide a compelling causal basis. It merely states a position without elaboration on why that position is meaningful or how it effectively substantiates the Proposition. This supports a classification under Insufficient Causal Basis.

##### 5. Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
The reason is not a mere repetition of the proposition in different words, so this type does not apply.

##### 6. Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
There is no mention of universal agreement or assumed consensus, so this type does not apply.

##### 7. Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)
There could be ambiguity in what "the center of the spectrum" and "two extremes of deficiency and excessiveness" precisely mean, leaving room for interpretive variance. This does point toward Ambiguous Language Use to some extent.

### Conclusion
Given the evaluation, the primary defects identified in the argument are:
1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The reason does not strongly support or substantiate the proposition.
2. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The terms used can be interpreted in various ways which might not align with the intended meaning.

### Classification
The given string "It is the center of the spectrum of two extremes of deficiency and excessiveness." is best classified under:
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**

Thus, the argument exhibits primarily <WCB> and to some extent <DEP>.
