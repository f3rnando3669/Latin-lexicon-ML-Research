For 
The task <IDAA> involves decomposing the classification of a given string \( <s> \), in this case, the phrase **"everyone is doing it" mentality**, into specific steps to identify its type according to the defective argument types.

### Step-by-Step Application of <IDAA>:

1. **Understand the Proposition (P):**
   - Analyze the core assertion or claim being made.
   - In this case, the proposition \( <P> \) embedded in the phrase is: "Everyone is doing it."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Determine the causal basis or reason supporting the proposition.
   - The implied \( <R> \) here is: "Therefore, it must be correct or a good idea."

3. **Examine the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - Identify any additional support or evidence provided to back up the reason.
   - There is no explicit further proof or argument in the given phrase.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument:**
   - Compare the reasoning with known defective argument types to classify the string.
   
   #### Examination of Defective Argument Types:
   
   - **Generalization (G):**
     - \( <P> \) based on some part or majority but not universally applicable.
     - *Not applicable here.* The proposition does not generalize from a part to a whole.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
     - \( <P> \) claims completeness but misses some possibilities.
     - *Not applicable here.* No enumeration is made.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
     - \( <R> \) does not conclusively demonstrate \( <P> \).
     - *Possible match.* The reason "everyone is doing it" does not demonstrate conclusively that it is a correct or good thing to do.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
     - \( <R> \) is weak or not compelling for \( <P> \).
     - *Possible match.* The causal link “everyone is doing it” might not be a sufficient reason.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
     - \( <R> \) says precisely what \( <P> \) says.
     - *Not applicable here.* The reason is not a repetition of the proposition.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
     - \( <PR> \) assumed as certain because it’s “universally agreed upon.”
     - *Strong match.* The phrase assumes that because everyone agrees (or is doing it), the proposition is validated, ignoring that it might still be in dispute.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
     - \( <PR> \) can be interpreted differently than intended.
     - *Not applicable here.* There is no ambiguous language usage in the phrase.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the examination, the phrase **"everyone is doing it" mentality** most closely fits the defective argument type \( <FU> \) (Presumptuous Consensus), with a secondary consideration for \( <WCB> \) (Insufficient Causal Basis).

### Summary:
By decomposing the task into specific steps, we classified the string **"everyone is doing it" mentality** primarily as \( <FU> \) (Presumptuous Consensus), with a possible secondary classification as \( <WCB> \) (Insufficient Causal Basis).
