For 
To apply IDAA to the statement "I should receive an 'A' in this class. After all, if I don't get an 'A' I won't get the fellowship that I want," we'll decompose the task (IDA) into specific steps (D) and then classify the defective argument type (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

### Decomposition (D):
1. Identify the Proposition (\<P\>).
2. Identify the Reason (\<R\>).
3. Evaluate the Reason against the defective argument types (\G, \FE, \IR, \RR, \WCB, \FU, \DEP\).
4. Classify the string (\<s\>) as one of the defective argument types based on the evaluation.

### Step-by-Step Classification (IDAA):

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\<P\>)
The Proposition is: **"I should receive an 'A' in this class."**

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\<R\>)
The Reason given is: **"If I don't get an 'A' I won't get the fellowship that I want."**

#### Step 3: Evaluate the Reason (\<R\>)

1. **Generalization (\<G\>):**
   - There is no generalization being made from a specific case to a broader context here. So, it isn't a \G.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>):**
   - This argument does not involve listing possibilities and omitting relevant ones. Hence, it isn't an \FE.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>):**
   - The reason provided (\R\>) does not sufficiently connect to the \(P\>). The fellowship criterion (not getting fellowship) doesn't logically support why one should receive an 'A'. This appears to be inconclusive since receiving an 'A' should be based on academic performance, not on the consequences of not getting an 'A'.
   - This may seem like a candidate.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>):**
   - The causal basis for giving an 'A' is about not getting a fellowship. The causal link is weak here because academic grading should be based on performance, not consequences. This is better classified under \IR\ due to the inconclusive nature of the reasoning rather than weak causality.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>):**
   - The reason is not merely a repetition of the proposition stated in different terms. Hence, it isn't an \RR.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>):**
   - The argument does not rely on assumed universal consensus. Hence, it isn't an \FU.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>):**
   - The language used is clear and not ambiguous. Hence, it isn't a \DEP.

#### Step 4: Classify the String (\<s\>)
Based on the evaluation, the defective argument type appears to be \IR\ (Inconclusive Reason).

### Conclusion
The argument "I should receive an 'A' in this class. After all, if I don't get an 'A' I won't get the fellowship that I want," is classified as \IR\ (Inconclusive Reason).
