For 
To apply "IDAA" to the given string "fallacy suggesting that because everyone believes something or does something, it must be valid, accurate, or effective," we will decompose the task of classification (IDA) into specific steps (D) and then apply these steps.

### Step 1: Understanding the String
We first need to understand what the string "fallacy suggesting that because everyone believes something or does something, it must be valid, accurate, or effective" implies. This is a definition or description of a specific type of logical fallacy.

### Step 2: Identifying the Type of Argument/Fallacy
Once we understand the string, we should identify which type of defective argument or fallacy, as defined previously, matches this description.

From the definitions provided, let's review our options and determine which one applies:

- **Generalization (G):** Assertion based on some part or majority, not necessarily applicable to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Claiming complete enumeration while missing out pertinent parts.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Reason doesnâ€™t conclusively demonstrate the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Weak causal basis for the proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Reason says the same as the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Assumes something is certain because it's universally agreed upon, despite being disputed.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The proof can be taken in another sense than intended.

### Step 3: Matching Description to Definition
We now match the description of the fallacy to our list of defective argument types.

The description "fallacy suggesting that because everyone believes something or does something, it must be valid, accurate, or effective" implies that the fallacy relies on the notion that a claim is considered true because many people believe it.

### Step 4: Classification
From our definitions:
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Assumes a proposition is certain because it is "universally agreed upon."

This exactly matches the described fallacy, which states that something is believed to be true because everyone believes it or does it.

### Conclusion
By following the decomposed steps (D) for the task (IDA), we classify the fallacy in the string "fallacy suggesting that because everyone believes something or does something, it must be valid, accurate, or effective" as of type **<FU>** (Presumptuous Consensus).
