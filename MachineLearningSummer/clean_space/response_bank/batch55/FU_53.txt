For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string into specific steps) to the task of classifying the string ", that makes it right/valid.", we need to follow a series of logical steps to identify which of the defective argument types it belongs to. Here is the detailed step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Identify and Understand the Key Components
- **Proposition (\<P\>)**: The main assertion we are trying to prove.
- **Reason (\<R\>)**: The causal basis for the proposition, which supports \<P\>.
- **Proof of Reason (\<PR\>)**: Corroborative evidence or arguments that support \<R\>.

### Step 2: Analyze the Given String
Given the string: ", that makes it right/valid."

#### Initial Interpretation
The phrase ", that makes it right/valid." appears to present a conclusion that suggests something is right or valid because a preceding statement or reason (implied by the comma) supposedly supports it.

### Step 3: Identify if it's a Defective Argument Type
We need to systematically check if it falls into any of the defective argument types such as:
- **Generalization (\<G\>)**: Applying a conclusion based on a small sample to all cases.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)**: Missing out pertinent possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**: The reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**: The submitted reason is not compelling.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)**: The reason just repeats the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)**: Assuming something is true because it is "universally agreed upon."
- **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)**: The reason can be interpreted in another sense.

### Step 4: Decomposition and Evaluation
Let's decompose the string against each category to find the best fit.

#### 4.1: Generalization (\<G\>)
- Does the string imply a generalization from a small or unrepresentative sample to a broader application?
  - No, it does not suggest a broader applicability based on a small sample.

#### 4.2: Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)
- Does the string claim completeness but miss important aspects?
  - The string does not enumerate possibilities, so it doesn’t fit here.

#### 4.3: Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)
- Does the string’s reason fail to conclusively support the proposition?
  - It does not clearly present a specific reason or proposition that can be evaluated.

#### 4.4: Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)
- Is the presented reason weak or not compelling?
  - Since the string itself is too vague to establish a clear causal basis, it is not sufficient for assessment under this category.

#### 4.5: Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)
-The reason repeats the proposition.
  - The string suggests that something is right or valid, but it can be interpreted that the string itself does not introduce any new reasoning different from the proposition “it makes it right/valid.”

#### 4.6: Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)
- Does the string assume universal agreement to support its claim?
  - There is no mention of universal agreement or consensus.

#### 4.7: Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)
- Can the string be interpreted in a different sense than intended?
  - The phrase “that makes it right/valid” can be seen as vague and open to interpretation. It does not provide a clear context or specific grounding for the proposition, leaving it ambiguous.

### Step 5: Conclusion
After systematically analyzing the string against the defective argument types, the most fitting type appears to be **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)**. The string “, that makes it right/valid” is ambiguous and can indeed be interpreted in multiple ways, potentially different from what might have been initially intended by the speaker.

Therefore, the classification of the string ", that makes it right/valid." is of type \(\<DEP\>\).
