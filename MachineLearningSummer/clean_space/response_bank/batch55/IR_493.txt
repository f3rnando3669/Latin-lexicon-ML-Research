For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposing and classifying a defective argument) to the statement "A little boy says that his friends should not go swimming in a river because his Mama said there were germs in the river," we can break this down into specific steps. Here's a detailed decomposition and classification:

### Decomposition Steps (D)

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - What is the main claim that is being made?

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - What is the basis for the Proposition?

3. **Evaluate the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine if the Reason (<R>) sufficiently supports the Proposition (<P>).

4. **Identify any additional Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Look for any further arguments or evidence provided to support the Reason.

5. **Classify the Defective Argument (<IDA>):**
   - Based on the identified elements, classify the type of defective argument.

### Application of Decomposition and Classification (IDAA)

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The boy's claim that his friends should not go swimming in the river.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason given is that his Mama said there were germs in the river.

3. **Evaluate the Reason (<R>):**
   - The Reason relies on an assertion made by the boy's Mama.
   - We need to assess if simply stating that there are germs is a compelling enough reason without any further evidence.

4. **Identify any additional Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - There does not appear to be any additional proof or extended argument provided to support the Reason. The claim is solely based on his Mama’s statement.

5. **Classify the Defective Argument (<IDA>):**
   - Let's analyze the types of defective arguments and see which one fits best:
     - **<G> Generalization:** The Reason does not involve generalizing from a part to a whole.
     - **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:** There’s no attempt at enumeration here.
     - **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** The Reason (his Mama said there were germs) does not provide conclusive evidence that there are indeed harmful germs in the river or that swimming is inevitably harmful.
     - **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** The Reason lacks a compelling evidence to establish that the germs (if they exist) are harmful.
     - **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** The Reason does not merely repeat the Proposition.
     - **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** There’s no reference to a universal agreement.
     - **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:** Ambiguity is not the core issue here.

Based on this analysis, the best fit seems to be:
- **<IR>:** Inconclusive Reason, as the statement from his Mama does not conclusively establish that there are harmful germs in the river or that swimming is dangerous.

### Conclusion

The statement "A little boy says that his friends should not go swimming in a river because his Mama said there were germs in the river" can be classified as an <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) type of defective argument. The reason based on his Mama’s assertion does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition that swimming is dangerous.
