For 
Sure, let's apply <IDAA> to the statement "Politician Running for Public Office: You can all trust what I say. I have never lied in my life." by decomposing the task into specific steps. This will involve classifying the argument as one of the defective argument types.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
The Proposition <P> is a statement that the politician wants to prove.
- **Proposition (P):** "You can all trust what I say."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
The Reason <R> is the causal basis for the Proposition, that is, why the politician thinks the Proposition is true.
- **Reason (R):** "I have never lied in my life."

### Step 3: Analyze the Defective Argument Types
Now, we will analyze the argument to see if it fits any of the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

#### 3.1 Generalization <G>
- Does the argument involve making a general assertion based on one or a majority of instances that may not apply to all? 
  - No, the argument does not make a general statement based on limited instances.

#### 3.2 Incomplete Enumeration <FE>
- Does the argument claim to have considered all possibilities while actually neglecting some relevant ones?
  - No, the argument does not make any claim regarding the enumeration of possibilities.

#### 3.3 Inconclusive Reason <IR>
- Does the Reason conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition?
  - The Reason given is "I have never lied in my life." This does not conclusively prove that one can trust everything the politician says since it hinges solely on the politicianâ€™s claim about their honesty, which cannot be externally verified and does not account for potential biases or misunderstandings.

#### 3.4 Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>
- Is the causal basis for the Proposition compelling?
  - The Reason "I have never lied in my life" may be seen as insufficient because it relies on self-reported information and does not necessarily compel the truth of the Proposition. However, let's check other categories before concluding.

#### 3.5 Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>
- Does the Reason simply restate the Proposition?
  - No, the Reason does provide additional information (a claimed past behavior) rather than just repeating the Proposition.

#### 3.6 Presumptuous Consensus <FU>
- Does the Proof of Reason assume that something is certain merely because it is "universally agreed upon"?
  - No, the argument doesn't hinge on presumptive consensus.

#### 3.7 Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>
- Can the language in the Reason be taken in another sense than the speaker intended?
  - The language here is clear and not particularly ambiguous.

### Step 4: Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the most fitting defective argument type for the given statement appears to be **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**. The Reason given, "I have never lied in my life," does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition, "You can all trust what I say," because it relies solely on the politician's unverifiable self-report and does not address other facets of trustworthiness or truthfulness.

Thus, the statement "Politician Running for Public Office: You can all trust what I say. I have never lied in my life." can be classified as having a defective argument of type <IR>.
