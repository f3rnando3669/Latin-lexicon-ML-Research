For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the classification task into specific steps) to the given string "An influencer posts on Instagram that the restaurant 'EP is poppin'! Everyone worth knowing is here tonight - come on down!'" and classify it into one of the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>, we can follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - The Proposition (P) is the claim being made by the influencer.
   - In this case: "The restaurant 'EP is poppin'!"

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - The Reason (R) provides the causal basis for the Proposition (P).
   - In this case: "Everyone worth knowing is here tonight - come on down!"

3. **Check for Completion of Enumeration (FE)**:
   - Determine if the Proposition (P) claims to have made a complete enumeration of possibilities but misses out on some pertinent ones.
   - Here, the proposition doesn't claim to enumerate all possibilities, thus it's not an Incomplete Enumeration (FE).

4. **Check for Generalization (G)**:
   - Determine if the Proposition (P) is generalized based on a part but not applicable to all.
   - The proposition generalizes the experience for everyone worth knowing based on the presence of some individuals. This could lean towards generalization, but we should continue analysis to be sure.

5. **Evaluate Causal Basis Sufficiency (WCB)**:
   - Analyze if the Reason (R) submits a compelling causal basis for the Proposition (P).
   - The reason "Everyone worth knowing is here tonight" isn't necessarily a compelling causal basis for the claim that the restaurant is "poppin'," leaning towards a weak causal basis, so <WCB> could be considered.

6. **Check for Faulty Repetition (RR)**:
   - Determine if the Reason (R) merely repeats the Proposition (P).
   - The reason does not repeat the proposition; it provides new information implying social validation.

7. **Examine for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - Check if the Proof of Reason (PR) is assumed to be universally agreed upon without dispute.
   - The reason "Everyone worth knowing is here tonight" implies that social agreement is not debatable, which suggests Presumptuous Consensus.

8. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
   - Review if the Proof of Reason (PR) can be taken in another sense than intended by the speaker.
   - The phrase "Everyone worth knowing" can be vague, but it's not immediately ambiguous.

### Conclusion

The string most closely fits the defective argument type:

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**

The statement is assuming that the value of being at EP is certain because of an implied universal agreement concerning the desirability of being where everyone "worth knowing" is. This fits the notion of Presumptuous Consensus where a proposition's proof is assumed to be universally agreed upon, despite it being disputable.

Thus, "An influencer posts on Instagram that the restaurant 'EP is poppin'! Everyone worth knowing is here tonight - come on down!'" is an example of **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.
