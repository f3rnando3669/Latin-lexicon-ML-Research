For 
To classify the given argument using the approach of IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of identifying defective arguments), let's follow a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Decompose the task:**

   a. Identify the Proposition (\<P\>).
   b. Identify the Reason (\<R\>).
   c. Identify the Proof of Reason (\<PR\>), if present.
   d. Classify the defective argument type based on the defined categories (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP).

2. **Apply the decomposition to the given argument:**

   **Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\<P\>)**
   
   The argument states: "We should abolish the death penalty."
   
   Therefore, the Proposition (\<P\>) is:
   \[
   \text{Proposition (\<P\>): We should abolish the death penalty.}
   \]

   **Step 2: Identify the Reason (\<R\>)**
   
   The argument continues: "Even Taylor Swift is opposed to it."
   
   This statement is presented as the reason for the proposition.
   
   Therefore, the Reason (\<R\>) is:
   \[
   \text{Reason (\<R\>): Even Taylor Swift is opposed to it.}
   \]

   **Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (\<PR\>)**
   
   In this argument, there is no further evidence or argument provided to support the Reason (\<R\>).
   
   Therefore, there is no Proof of Reason (\<PR\>).

   **Step 4: Classify the defective argument type:**
   
   Now, we need to determine which, if any, category the argument falls into:

   - **Generalization (G):** The argument doesn't generalize from a part to a whole.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument isn't based on an incomplete list of possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Taylor Swift's opposition does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (\<P\>).
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis (\<R\>) that Taylor Swift opposes it is not compelling in itself.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The statement in the reason is not a repetition of the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument does not rely on a presumptuous consensus.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language in the argument is not ambiguous.

   Considering the Reason (\<R\>) does not conclusively support the Proposition (\<P\>), the argument appears to suffer from **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.

**Conclusion:**
   
Following the IDAA process, we classify the argument "We should abolish the death penalty. Even Taylor Swift is opposed to it." as:

\[
\text{Type: Inconclusive Reason (IR)}
\]
