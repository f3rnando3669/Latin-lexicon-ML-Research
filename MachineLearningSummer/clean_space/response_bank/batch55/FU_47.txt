Sure, let's apply the decomposition process to the task of classifying the argument in the statement, "Not only is paying a higher income tax a patriotic duty, it is also a sacred obligation."

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
First, we identify the main proposition or claim in the statement.

**Proposition (<P>):** Paying a higher income tax is a patriotic duty and a sacred obligation.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R> 
Next, we need to identify the reason provided to support the proposition.

**Reason (<R>):** The statement essentially makes an appeal to emotional and ethical duty without providing clear causal reasons. 

### Step 3: Identify any Proof of Reason <PR>
Then, we check if there are any proof(s) of the reason given, by means of additional arguments or evidence.

**Proof of Reason (<PR>):** The statement does not provide any proof or additional argument; it rests on strong emotional appeal and assertion.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument
Now, we classify the argument based on identified issues. Here are the possible categories:

- **<G> Generalization:** Assertion may apply to some but is generalized for all.
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:** Claim of total possibilities without covering all.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** Reason does not demonstrate correctness.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** Weak causal basis for proposition.
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** Reason is a mere restatement of the proposition.
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** Assumed consensus on a disputed issue.
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:** Language can be interpreted differently than intended.

### Step 5: Analysis and Classification
Now, let's analyze and classify:

**Generalization (<G>):** The argument does not generalize from limited instances to all.
**Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** No enumeration of possibilities is claimed.
**Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The given reason (emotional appeal to patriotism and sacred duty) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition, as it lacks objective evidence.
**Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The reason provided relies on emotional appeal without a compelling causal basis. 
**Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason might be seen as a repetition of the proposition using different terms (patriotic duty and sacred obligation).
**Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** It might imply a presumed societal consensus without evidence.
**Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The terms "patriotic duty" and "sacred obligation" can be open to different interpretations. 

Given this analysis, the argument most prominently exhibits characteristics of both **<IR> Inconclusive Reason** and **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**. Additionally, **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition** and **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use** are applicable to a lesser extent.

### Classification
The statement "Not only is paying a higher income tax a patriotic duty, it is also a sacred obligation." is primarily an **<IR> Inconclusive Reason** and **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**. It also has aspects of **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition** and **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**.

So, the classification is:

**<IR>, <WCB> with elements of <RR> and <DEP>.**
