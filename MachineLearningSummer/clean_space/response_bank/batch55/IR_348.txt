For 
To apply the decomposition of the task of classifying the string "Evolution cannot be true. If it were true, we’d all be smelly apes." as one of the defective argument types, let's break it down step by step (IDAA):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   First, we need to identify the proposition in the given argument.

   Proposition (<P>): 
   "Evolution cannot be true."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   Next, let's identify the reason given to support the proposition.

   Reason (<R>): 
   "If it were true, we’d all be smelly apes."

3. **Evaluate the Reason (<R>):**
   Now, we need to analyze the reason proposed and check if it logically and conclusively supports the proposition.

4. **Classify the Argument Type:**
   Based on the evaluation, classify the argument as one of the defectives as defined: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

Let's go through these steps:

- **Step 1: Identify <P>:**
  The proposition is "Evolution cannot be true."

- **Step 2: Identify <R>:**
  The reason is "If it were true, we’d all be smelly apes."

- **Step 3: Evaluate <R>:**
  Upon evaluation, the reason provided does not logically support the proposition that evolution cannot be true. The reason hinges on an erroneous and overly simplistic understanding of evolutionary biology and falsely implies a direct and immediate transformation that is not supported by scientific evidence. It relies on a misunderstanding of what evolution entails and uses an exaggerated consequence (being "smelly apes") to dismiss a well-supported scientific theory.

- **Step 4: Classify the Argument:**
  - **Generalization (<G>):** The reason does not seem to be a generalization of a few cases to all, so it doesn't fit <G>.
  - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument does not enumerate possibilities, so it doesn't fit <FE>.
  - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason does not logically or conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. It is based on a faulty premise about what evolution implies.
  - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal basis that evolution would lead to us being "smelly apes" is not compelling or logically sound.
  - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason does not repeat the proposition.
  - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The reason does not appeal to a universal agreement.
  - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The language is clear in its meaning, so it doesn't fit <DEP>.

Given these considerations, the most fitting classification would be:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The reason provided is weak and does not offer a compelling causal basis for rejecting the theory of evolution.

So, applying IDAA to the given string, we classify it as <WCB>.
