For 
Certainly, let's decompose the task <IDA> of classifying the string into a set of specific steps as part of the advanced task <t>. Here, we apply these steps to the problem <IDA> for the string "So many people are speaking up about animal rights, but what they should first focus on is human rights."

**Step 1: Understand the Proposition (<P>)**
- Identify the main assertion or statement being made.
- In the given string, the main assertion appears to be: "So many people are speaking up about animal rights, but what they should first focus on is human rights."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**
- Isolate the causal basis or reason provided for the main assertion.
- In this case, the reason given implicitly is that because people are speaking up about animal rights, they should first address human rights.

**Step 3: Check for Proof of Reason (<PR>)**
- Look for additional arguments corroborating the reason.
- The string does not provide additional arguments to prove the reason, so there's no <PR> present in this argument.

**Step 4: Identify Defective Argument Types**
- Now, go through each defective argument type to see if it applies here:

  **<G> Generalization:**
  - Is the assertion based on one part or a majority but not applicable to all?
  - Yes, the statement "So many people are speaking up about animal rights" generalizes the behavior of some people to the entire discussion on animal rights.
  
  **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:**
  - Is there a claim of complete enumeration that misses some possibilities?
  - No, there is no enumeration of possibilities in the string.
  
  **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:**
  - Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
  - The reason provided ("people are speaking up about animal rights") does not conclusively demonstrate why the focus should be on human rights first.
  
  **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:**
  - Is the causal basis weak or not compelling?
  - Yes, the causal basis (focusing on human rights because of people advocating for animal rights) is not compelling.
  
  **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:**
  - Is the reason merely a repetition of the proposition?
  - No, the reason is distinct from the proposition.
  
  **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:**
  - Is there an assumed consensus that is still in dispute?
  - No, there is no claimed consensus in the string.
  
  **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:**
  - Is the proof of reason ambiguous or taken in another sense?
  - The language itself is not ambiguous, so this does not apply.

**Step 5: Conclusion**
- Compare identified defective types and determine the most fitting classification.

From the analysis, the string primarily demonstrates characteristics of:

  - **<G> Generalization:** It overgeneralizes actions of some individuals to a broader context.
  - **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** The provided reasoning does not conclusively support the proposition.
  - **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** The causal basis is weak and not compelling.

Given these considerations, the primary defect most appropriate for the string "So many people are speaking up about animal rights, but what they should first focus on is human rights" is **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**. The reasoning provided does not ensure the necessity of shifting focus from animal rights to human rights conclusively.
