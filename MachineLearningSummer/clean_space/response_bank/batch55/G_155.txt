For 
To apply IDAA (the task of decomposing and classifying a given string as one of the defective argument types), we first need to decompose the task into specific steps. Here’s a step-by-step approach for IDAA:

### Step 1: Understanding the Given String
Analyze the string to understand its meaning and implications.
- String: "The more things change, the more they remain the same."

### Step 2: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- Proposition: Analyze what the sentence is fundamentally trying to assert.
  - In this case: The fundamental assertion is that despite apparent changes, the underlying reality does not change.

### Step 3: Identify Possible Reasoning (<R>)
- Reason: Determine if there is an implicit reasoning within the sentence that supports the proposition.
  - This statement combines a paradoxical idea without a clear causal reasoning but relies on a general observation.

### Step 4: Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- Proof of Reason: Look for any extra support or evidence provided to corroborate the reasoning.
  - There isn't explicit proof or evidence given within the statement itself; it stands alone as a common adage.

### Step 5: Classifying the Defect
- Now, classify the defect in the argument using given categories:

Understanding each category:
1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Is the proposition making a broad generalization based on insufficient data?
   - Not applicable here as it’s more of a paradoxical observation rather than a generalization.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Does the proposition claim to cover all possibilities but misses some?
   - Not applicable as it does not list possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Does the reasoning fail to conclusively support the proposition?
   - N/A - lacks explicit reasoning altogether.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Is the causal basis weak or unconvincing?
   - N/A as it lacks a causal basis.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Does the reasoning merely repeat the proposition?
   - Applicable, the phrase essentially restates the proposition ("changes" versus "remain the same"), providing no substantial reasoning.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Is the proof assumed to be true based on a collective agreement?
   - N/A as it does not refer to a collective agreement.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Could the proof be interpreted in multiple ways?
   - The phrase is metaphorical but not ambiguously multi-interpretative to cause logical defect.

### Final Classification
Based on the analysis, we observe that the statement "The more things change, the more they remain the same" lacks conclusive reasoning and is primarily restating the proposition without additional evidence or backing. Thus, the most appropriate classification under the given defective argument types is:

#### <RR> - Faulty Repetition of Proposition

**Final Answer**: The defective argument type of the string "The more things change, the more they remain the same." is <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
