To apply the process of argument defect identification (IDA) to the given statement, we need to decompose IDA into specific steps and then perform these steps on the given string. Here is the step-by-step breakdown:

**Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of IDA:**
1. **Read and Comprehend the Statement (s):** Carefully read the given argument to understand its components.
2. **Identify the Proposition (P):** Determine what the main claim or proposition is.
3. **Identify the Reason (R):** Identify the reason or causal basis provided to support the proposition.
4. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):** Evaluate if there is any additional argument or evidence presented to corroborate the Reason.
5. **Compare with Defective Argument Types:** Match the components of the argument (P, R, PR) with the definitions of defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP) to classify the argument.

**Example Application of IDAA:**
Given String: "Our soccer team was losing until I bought new shoes. We have not lost a game since I got my lucky shoes!"

**Step 1: Read and Comprehend the Statement (s):**
Statement: "Our soccer team was losing until I bought new shoes. We have not lost a game since I got my lucky shoes!"

**Step 2: Identify the Proposition (P):**
Proposition: The claim being made is that the purchase of new shoes led to the team not losing any games. 
P: "Our soccer team has not lost a game since I got my lucky shoes."

**Step 3: Identify the Reason (R):**
Reason: The casual basis provided for the proposition is the purchase of the new (lucky) shoes.
R: "I bought new shoes."

**Step 4: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
Proof of Reason: There is no additional argument presented to corroborate the reason beyond the mere correlation of events.
PR: Not explicitly provided.

**Step 5: Compare with Defective Argument Types:**
- **G (Generalization):** The proposition is not making a generalization; it's specific to the individual's experience.
- **FE (Incomplete Enumeration):** The reason does not involve enumerating all possibilities.
- **IR (Inconclusive Reason):** The reason does not adequately establish the causal link between the shoes and the team's performance. It's more of a post hoc fallacy.
- **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** The reason does not repeat the proposition verbatim.
- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The reason (buying new shoes) is not a compelling or sufficient causal basis for the proposition. The statement assumes a causal link without strong evidence.
- **FU (Presumptuous Consensus):** There is no consensus mentioned to validate the argument.
- **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use):** There is no ambiguity in language.

By comparing the components of the given statement with the definitions of defective argument types, we can classify it:

The argument primarily fits the type of **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)** because the causal basis provided (buying new shoes) is weak and does not compellingly support the proposition (team's improved performance).

**Result:**
The argument "Our soccer team was losing until I bought new shoes. We have not lost a game since I got my lucky shoes!" is classified as <WCB>.
