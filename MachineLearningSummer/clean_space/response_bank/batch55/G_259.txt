For 
To apply \(<IDAA>\) to the statement "MeowMeowTweet is American-made skincare. I used it, and it gave me zits. American-made skincare gives people acne," we need to decompose the advanced task \(<IDA>\), which is the classification of the given string into one of the defective argument types. 

Here's the step-by-step decomposition of the advanced task \(<t>\):

1. **Identify the Structure of the Argument:**
   - Recognize the \(\text{Proposition}\) \((P)\), \(\text{Reason}\) \((R)\), and \(\text{Proof of Reason}\) \((PR)\) in the statement.
   - Proposition \((P)\): "American-made skincare gives people acne."
   - Reason \((R)\): "MeowMeowTweet is American-made skincare. I used it, and it gave me zits."

2. **Analyze the Argument Components for Defects:**
   - Check if the Proposition \((P)\) involves \(\text{Generalization}\) \((G)\).
     - The argument's proposition is a broad generalization based on a limited example.

3. **Compare with Definitions of Defective Argument Types:**
   - Apply each defective argument definition to the components:
     - **Generalization \((G)\)**: Yes, the proposition \((P)\) is asserting that "American-made skincare gives people acne" based on a personal experience with a single brand, MeowMeowTweet.
     - **Incomplete Enumeration \((FE)\)**: Not applicable because it doesn't claim a complete enumeration of possibilities.
     - **Inconclusive Reason \((IR)\)**: The reason doesn't conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition, but this is more about generalization in this context.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis \((WCB)\)**: The causal basis (a single personal experience) isn't substantial, but generalization more closely fits.
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition \((RR)\)**: Not applicable, as the reason isn't just a repetition of the proposition.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus \((FU)\)**: Not applicable, as it doesn't claim universal agreement.
     - **Ambiguous Language Use \((DEP)\)**: Not applicable, as there's no ambiguous language use.

4. **Finalize Classification:**
   - Based on the analysis, classify the argument type.

**Final Classification:**
- The argument in the string "MeowMeowTweet is American-made skincare. I used it, and it gave me zits. American-made skincare gives people acne." falls under the **defective argument type \(\text{Generalization} \((G)\)**. 

This is because the proposition (\(P\)) is a broad generalization about American-made skincare based on a single personal experience with one product.
