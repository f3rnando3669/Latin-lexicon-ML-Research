For 
Certainly! Let’s apply IDAA to the statement "The Cardinals are the best football team because they're better than all the other teams" step by step.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Analysis:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - **<P>**: "The Cardinals are the best football team."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - **<R>**: "because they're better than all the other teams."

3. **Check for Defective Argument Types:**
   - Since we are dealing with the task <IDA>, we need to classify the argument as one of the defective types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

4. **Analyze the Argument:**
   - **Examine the Proposition (<P>):**
     - The statement claims that "The Cardinals are the best football team."
   
   - **Examine the Reason (<R>):**
     - The supporting reason is that "they're better than all the other teams."

### Classification of Defects:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - Does the argument generalize unnecessarily from a subset to the whole? No, it does not seem to generalize from a subset, so this defect does not apply.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Does the argument assume a complete list of possibilities without covering all options? Not applicable here as the argument doesn’t involve enumerating possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Does the reason fail to conclusively support the proposition? Yes, the reason "they're better than all the other teams" is essentially restating the proposition without providing concrete evidence or a basis to support the claim.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Is the causal basis weak or not compelling? By itself, "they're better than all the other teams" is not a compelling causal basis because it doesn't provide actual evidence or criteria of "better".

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - Does the reason repeat the proposition? Yes, "they're better than all the other teams" is essentially another way of stating "The Cardinals are the best football team." It doesn't add new information.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - Does the argument assume something universally agreed upon which is still in dispute? No clear presumption of universal agreement is stated, so this defect doesn’t apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - Is the argument's language ambiguous or open to multiple interpretations? The language isn’t particularly ambiguous; it’s clear but flawed in reasoning.

### Conclusion:
The argument falls under the defective argument type **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)** and to some extent, **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** because the reason given does not establish the proposition conclusively and merely echoes the proposition itself without offering substantial evidence.

Therefore, the best fit for classification would be:

- **Defective Argument Type**: **<RR>** with some characteristics of **<IR>**.
