For 
To apply IDAA to the given string "We can’t freeze the academic year because then students won’t graduate on time. Next thing you know most people will be unemployed and will resort to crime. The crime rate will skyrocket and society will collapse," we will decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps to identify the defective argument type. 

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**
The Proposition (P) is a statement that sets forth what we intend to prove.
- In this case, the proposition is: "We can’t freeze the academic year."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)**
The Reason (R) sets forth the causal basis for the Proposition.
- The reason given is: "because then students won’t graduate on time."

**Step 3: Identify the additional arguments or Proof of Reason (PR)**
The Proof of Reason (PR) corroborates, by means of additional arguments, the briefly presented Reason.
- The additional arguments presented are: "Next thing you know most people will be unemployed and will resort to crime. The crime rate will skyrocket and society will collapse."

**Step 4: Check for defective argument types**
Next, we'll check if the argument falls into any defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This is when a proposition is based on one part or a majority of individuals but isn't necessarily applicable to all.
    - This does not apply here as the proposition is a specific case, not a generalization about a group.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This involves a claim of complete enumeration of possibilities but actually misses some.
    - Graduation on time might be one possibility, but not all other possibilities (like adjustments to the curriculum) are considered. However, this doesn't capture the essence of the argument.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This is when the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
    - The main reason ("students won’t graduate on time") does not conclusively demonstrate that freezing the academic year is detrimental enough to avoid it.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This is when the reason's causal basis is not compelling.
    - This could apply since the link between "students won’t graduate on time" and the subsequent extreme outcomes (unemployment, crime) is very weak and not directly caused by delaying graduation.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This is when the reasoning essentially repeats the proposition without providing a new argument.
    - The argument does provide new consequences rather than just repeating the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This is when a proof is assumed certain simply because it's universally agreed upon, which is still in dispute.
    - This is not applicable here as there’s no mention of universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: This is when the proof can be taken in another sense than intended.
    - The language used here seems clear, not ambiguous.

**Step 5: Conclusion**
Based on the analysis, the argument most closely fits the defective argument type **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)** because the causal chain suggested (from students not graduating on time to society collapsing) is weak and not compelling enough to establish the Proposition.

Thus, the classification of the argument "We can’t freeze the academic year because then students won’t graduate on time. Next thing you know most people will be unemployed and will resort to crime. The crime rate will skyrocket and society will collapse." is <WCB>.
