For 
To apply the task of IDAA (decomposition of IDA) to classify the given string "Of course, your minister says he believes in God. He would be unemployed otherwise." as one of the defective argument types, we will take the decomposition process step by step:

### Step 1: Understanding the Components of the Argument
- **Proposition (<P>):** This is what the argument intends to prove.
  - In this case, the implied proposition is that "the minister does not genuinely believe in God."
  
- **Reason (<R>):** This sets forth the causal basis for the proposition.
  - The reason given is "He would be unemployed otherwise."

### Step 2: Identify the Premises and Conclusion
- **Premises:** 
  - "The minister says he believes in God."
  - "He would be unemployed otherwise."
  
- **Conclusion:**
  - "The minister does not genuinely believe in God."

### Step 3: Check the Defective Argument Types Against the Argument
We will now examine the argument against each defective argument type to determine which, if any, it fits:

1. **Generalization (G):** 
   - The argument does not make a broad generalization about all ministers or all people.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - The argument does not present an incomplete set of possibilities but focuses on one specific minister.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - The reason provided (employment) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (minister's belief). The reason presented (he would be unemployed otherwise) does not logically prove that the minister does not genuinely believe in God, just that he has a motive to say he does. Other factors could determine genuine belief.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - The causal basis (employment) is not a compelling one to conclude the minister's lack of genuine belief. It assumes ulterior motives without evidence to support that they override genuine belief.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - The argument does not simply repeat the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - The argument does not appeal to universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - The argument does not hinge on ambiguous terms or language.

### Step 4: Determine the Most Appropriate Defective Argument Type
- The string "Of course, your minister says he believes in God. He would be unemployed otherwise." appears to be a case of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
  - The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. The employment factor suggested as a reason for the minister's declaration of belief does not invalidate the possibility that he genuinely believes in God. This reasoning fails to provide conclusive proof against the proposition.

Therefore, the argument should be classified as **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
