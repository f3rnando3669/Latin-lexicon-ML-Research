For 
Applying the process defined by IDAA (the decomposition of the task into specific steps) to classify the given string:

**String:** "God exists. How do you know? Because it says so in the Bible."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition (\<P\>)**:
   - The proposition is the primary assertion that something is true.
   - **Proposition (P)**: "God exists."

2. **Identify the Reason (\<R\>)**:
   - The reason is the causal basis or justification given to support the proposition.
   - **Reason (R)**: "Because it says so in the Bible."

3. **Identify if a Proof of Reason (\<PR\>) is provided**:
   - Proof of reason would consist of additional arguments that corroborate the reason.
   - **Proof of Reason (PR)**: Not explicitly provided in this string. The reason itself is based on authority (the Bible), but no further argument is given to substantiate why the Bible should be accepted as an ultimate authority.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: The proposition doesn't make a generalized assertion based on incomplete data, so G doesn't apply.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument isn't trying to classify all possibilities exhaustively, so FE doesn't apply.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition; it assumes the authority without further proof.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal link provided is weak because it relies solely on scriptural authority without external substantiation.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason isn't a mere repetition of the proposition; rather, it offers the Bible as evidence, so RR doesn't apply.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument doesn't rest on the universality of agreement, so FU doesn't apply.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language used about the proof isn't ambiguous, so DEP doesn't apply.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the argument "God exists. How do you know? Because it says so in the Bible." can be classified under two defective argument types:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided ("Because it says so in the Bible") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition ("God exists").
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The reason relies solely on the authority of the Bible without providing a compelling causal basis for the proposition.

Thus, the string can be classified as having an Inconclusive Reason (IR) as well as an Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).
