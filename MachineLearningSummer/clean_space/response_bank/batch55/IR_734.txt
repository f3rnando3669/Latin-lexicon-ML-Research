For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string into specific steps) to the given string, we will follow a systematic approach:

### Decomposition of the Task <t> (Decomposition Steps)
Let's first break down the classification task into a series of steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Determine what the initial statement or assertion is.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Determine the causal basis that is provided to support the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Determine if there are any additional arguments that support the reason provided.
4. **Evaluate the Validity of the Argument:** Analyze the quality and sufficiency of the Reason (<R>) and Proof of Reason (<PR>) in establishing the truth of the Proposition (<P>).
5. **Classify the Argument:** Based on the evaluation, classify the argument as one of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Application of <IDAA> to the Given String

For the string: "The purpose of the Cadet Program is to prepare youth for Air Force Basic Military Training.” REPLY: “This is true because I heard it from the Wing Commander.”"

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- **Proposition (<P>):** "The purpose of the Cadet Program is to prepare youth for Air Force Basic Military Training."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- **Reason (<R>):** "I heard it from the Wing Commander."

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- There isn't an explicit Proof of Reason (<PR>) provided in the given string.

#### Step 4: Evaluate the Validity of the Argument
- We need to evaluate whether the Reason (<R>) provided is a sufficient and compelling basis to establish the truth of the Proposition (<P>).
- In this case, the Reason (<R>) "I heard it from the Wing Commander" is relying on the authority or credibility of the Wing Commander.

#### Step 5: Classify the Argument
- Here, the argument relies solely on the authority of an individual (the Wing Commander) without providing additional evidence or reasoning to substantiate the Proposition (<P>).
- This seems to fall into the category of an **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, because the reason given is not a compelling or sufficient basis to conclusively establish the truth of the proposition.

### Final Classification
The argument presented is a type of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, as the reason provided (the authority of the Wing Commander) is not a compelling or sufficient basis to establish the truth of the proposition.

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the given string results in the classification <WCB>.
