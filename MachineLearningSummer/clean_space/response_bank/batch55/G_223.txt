For 
To apply IDAA to the given statement "If we legalize pot, the next thing you know people will want to legalize meth and heroin," we will perform a step-by-step decomposition of the task <IDA> (classifying the type of defective argument) and then apply these steps to analyze the statement.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA> (D):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine what the statement is trying to prove or assert.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Look for the causal basis or reasoning that connects to the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Check if there's any supporting evidence or arguments that underpin the Reason.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:**
   - Assess if the argument falls under any of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) by matching the features of the statement to these types.

### Applying <IDAA> to the Statement:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition in the statement is:
- "People will want to legalize meth and heroin."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason given is:
- "If we legalize pot."

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
There is no additional supporting evidence or argument provided to underpin the Reason in this case. The statement directly attempts to connect the legalization of pot to a broader desire to legalize harder drugs.

#### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type
Now we analyze to classify the type of defective argument:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement does not make a generalization based on a limited sample; rather, it is a sequence of events being hypothesized.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This does not apply here because the statement isn't attempting to enumerate all relevant possibilities.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The Reason does not provide a conclusive link to the Proposition. Legalizing pot does not necessarily lead to the desire to legalize meth and heroin without further evidence or a more plausible causal link.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: It can be argued that the Reason provided does not present a compelling causal basis. Legalizing pot does not sufficiently imply that there will be an automatic shift towards the legalization of much harder drugs such as meth and heroin.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The Reason is not a repetition of the Proposition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The statement does not rely on presumed universal agreement.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: There is no ambiguous language in the statement that could lead to multiple interpretations.

#### Conclusion
The most fitting defective argument type is **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**. The Reason provided ("if we legalize pot") does not establish a compelling or logical causal link to the Proposition ("people will want to legalize meth and heroin"). The statement suggests a slippery slope fallacy without strong supporting evidence that one event (legalizing marijuana) would directly lead to the other (desire to legalize much harder drugs).

Thus, after applying IDAA, the classification of the statement is:
- Type: **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**
