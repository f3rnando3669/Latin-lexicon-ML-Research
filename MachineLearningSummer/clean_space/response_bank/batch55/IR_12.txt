For 
To classify the statement "Kerry’s plan will raise taxes by at least $900 billion his first hundred days" as one of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP) by decomposing this task (IDA) into specific steps (D), we can follow the structured process of IDAA:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: This is the statement being argued or asserted in the sentence.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: This is the causal basis provided in support of the proposition.
3. **Evaluate the completeness of enumeration (<FE>)**: Check if the argument fails by missing pertinent possibilities.
4. **Assess generalizations (<G>)**: Investigate if the argument makes a broad claim based on insufficient evidence.
5. **Evaluate inconclusiveness of reason (<IR>)**: Determine if the reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
6. **Assess insufficient causal basis (<WCB>)**: Check if the causal basis for the proposition is not strong or compelling.
7. **Check for faulty repetition of the proposition (<RR>)**: See if the reason provided merely restates the proposition without adding substantive support.
8. **Identify presumptuous consensus (<FU>)**: Look for assumptions based on supposed universal agreement for a disputed point.
9. **Examine for ambiguous language use (<DEP>)**: Ensure that the terms used are clear and not open to misinterpretation.

### Application to the Given Statement:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition
- **Proposition (<P>):** "Kerry’s plan will raise taxes by at least $900 billion in his first hundred days."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason
- There is no explicit reason provided in the sentence itself, so it might be implied or missing.

#### Step 3: Evaluate the Completeness of Enumeration (<FE>)
- The statement does not list possibilities but makes a definitive claim without alternate scenarios, thus FE is not directly applicable here.

#### Step 4: Assess Generalizations (<G>)
- The statement makes a specific assertion without indicating it’s based on observed parts or a majority. It does not appear to generalize from incomplete data.

#### Step 5: Evaluate Inconclusiveness of Reason (<IR>)
- Since no reason is given for the proposition, its correctness cannot be conclusively demonstrated, which means this might fall under IR.

#### Step 6: Assess Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- No causal basis is provided for the assertion. This means the causal reason if there is one, is absent or very weak. This could imply WCB.

#### Step 7: Check for Faulty Repetition of the Proposition (<RR>)
- No repetition of the proposition in the form of a reason is apparent in the given text.

#### Step 8: Identify Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
- There’s no mention of universal agreement or assumed consensus in the statement.

#### Step 9: Examine Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)
- The statement itself is clear and does not seem to use ambiguous language.

### Conclusion:
Given that no reason is explicitly provided for the proposition within the statement, the statement seems to suffer primarily from the lack of a clear causal basis. Hence, it can be classified as having an **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. Additionally, since it makes a direct assertion without supporting reasons, it might also fit under the category of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.

Final classification:
- The statement "Kerry’s plan will raise taxes by at least $900 billion his first hundred days." is defective primarily due to **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** and **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
