For 
To classify the argument "My child was diagnosed with autism after receiving vaccinations. That is proof that vaccines are to blame," we will apply the task of decomposition <D> to <IDA> step by step.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Determine what is being asserted or claimed.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Determine the causal basis that is presented to support the Proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Relationship Between <P> and <R>:** Assess whether the Reason provided conclusively supports the Proposition.
4. **Identify Additional Elements of Proof (<PR>):** Check if there are any additional arguments or proofs provided to substantiate the Reason.
5. **Identify Any Defective Argument Types:** Based on the relationship between <P>, <R>, and <PR>, determine if the argument falls into one of the defective argument types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

### Application of <D> to <IDA> for the Given Argument:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition: "Vaccines are to blame for my child's autism."
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason: "My child was diagnosed with autism after receiving vaccinations."
   
3. **Evaluate the Relationship Between <P> and <R>:**
   - The Reason provided is temporal association, suggesting that because the child was diagnosed with autism after receiving vaccinations, the vaccines must be the cause.
   
4. **Identify Additional Elements of Proof (<PR>):**
   - No additional arguments or proofs are provided in the statement to substantiate the Reason.

5. **Identify Any Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** Not applicable, as this does not rely on applying a majority observation to all.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Not applicable, as no claim of complete enumeration is made.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Partially applicable, as the temporal association reason does not necessarily demonstrate the correctness of the proposition that vaccines cause autism, it merely suggests a correlation without establishing causation.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Applicable. The Reason provided (temporal association) is weak and does not present a compelling causal basis that proves vaccines are to blame for autism.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Not applicable, as the Reason is not merely a restatement of the Proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Not applicable, as there is no appeal to universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Not applicable, as the language is clear in its intended meaning.

### Conclusion

The argument "My child was diagnosed with autism after receiving vaccinations. That is proof that vaccines are to blame" is classified as having an Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>. The Reason provided does not present a compelling causal basis for the Proposition, as it relies on temporal association without demonstrating a direct causative link.
