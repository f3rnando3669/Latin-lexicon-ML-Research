For 
To apply the decomposition of the advanced task \(\text{<IDAA>}\) to the classification task \(\text{<IDA>}\) for the given string, "Animal experimentation reduces our respect for life. If we don't respect life, we are likely to be more and more tolerant of violent acts like war and murder. Soon our society will become a battlefield in which everyone constantly fears for their lives. It will be the end of civilization," we break down the task into specific steps as follows:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for \(\text{<IDAA>}\)

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Determine the main assertion or claim that the argument intends to prove.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Look for the causal basis or reasoning provided to support the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - Find any corroborative statements or arguments that support the reasoning provided.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**:
   - Analyze the argument to determine if it fits any of the defective argument categories: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Conclude with the classification of the given argument based on the analysis.

---

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)

The main assertion in the string is: 
"Animal experimentation reduces our respect for life."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)

The reasoning provided to support the proposition is:
"If we don't respect life, we are likely to be more and more tolerant of violent acts like war and murder."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)

The corroborative statements or arguments provided to solidify the reason are:
"Soon our society will become a battlefield in which everyone constantly fears for their lives. It will be the end of civilization."

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type

- **Generalization (G)**: This argument does not seem to generalize from a part to the whole.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: There is no claim of having made a complete enumeration of possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This needs to be checked more closely.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Evaluate if the causal link between the respect for life and increase in violent acts is compelling.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Check if the reason is merely the restatement of the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Check if the proof of reason assumes universal agreement without evidence.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Check if the terms in the proof of reason could be interpreted differently.

Upon analysis:

- The reasoning that not respecting life leads to violent acts and ultimately the end of civilization might be viewed as an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because it does not conclusively demonstrate that animal experimentation will lead to such extreme outcomes.
- The connection between disrespect for life and societal collapse is an **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** as it’s a significant leap without compelling evidence directly linking these steps.
- There’s an element of **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**, assuming without substantial evidence that lack of respect for life universally leads to more tolerance of violence.

### Step 5: Conclusion

The defective argument types for the given string are primarily **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, with a potential element of **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.

Thus, the argument "Animal experimentation reduces our respect for life. If we don't respect life, we are likely to be more and more tolerant of violent acts like war and murder. Soon our society will become a battlefield in which everyone constantly fears for their lives. It will be the end of civilization." can be classified as containing **IR** and **WCB**, and potentially **FU**.
