For 
To apply \( <IDAA> \) (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a string as a specific type of defective argument) to the string "We haven’t found the ruins of Troy, so the city of Troy didn’t really exist.", we will systematically break down the process into specific steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( <P> \)) and Reason (\( <R> \))**:
    - **\( <P> \): "The city of Troy didn’t really exist."**
    - **\( <R> \): "We haven’t found the ruins of Troy."**

2. **Understand the Causal Relationship**:
    - The argument is suggesting that based on not finding the ruins of Troy (\( <R> \)), it is concluded that the city didn't exist (\( <P> \)). 

3. **Check for Generalization (\( <G> \))**:
    - Is \( <P> \) an assertion applied to all based on only some part or majority? 
        - No, this is not a generalization. It’s not deriving a universal conclusion from limited data; rather, it’s a binary assertion about the existence of Troy.

4. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (\( <FE> \))**:
    - Is the argument assuming a complete enumeration of possibilities but potentially missing out on some? 
        - Yes, the argument assumes that not finding the ruins is the only relevant factor in determining the existence of Troy. It overlooks other pertinent possibilities, such as ruins not having been discovered yet or archaeological evidence being lost.

5. **Check for Inconclusive Reason (\( <IR> \))**:
    - Does \( <R> \) conclusively demonstrate the correctness of \( <P> \)? 
        - No, the absence of evidence (ruins) doesn't conclusively prove the non-existence of Troy. It’s a weak reasoning.

6. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (\( <WCB> \))**:
    - Is \( <R> \) weak due to an insufficient causal basis for \( <P> \)? 
        - Similar to the previous step, yes—the reason provided is weak because it’s not compelling enough to establish \( <P> \).

7. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( <RR> \))**:
    - Is \( <R> \) simply a repeat of \( <P> \) in different words? 
        - No, \( <R> \) ("We haven’t found the ruins of Troy") isn’t a repetition of \( <P> \) ("The city of Troy didn’t really exist").

8. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (\( <FU> \))**:
    - Is \( <PR> \) assumed certain based on a disputed consensus? 
        - This isn’t the case here since no presumption of universal agreement is presented.

9. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (\( <DEP> \))**:
    - Could \( <PR> \) be taken in another sense than intended? 
        - No ambiguity in language affects the understanding of this argument.

Based on the breakdown and analysis, the argument "We haven’t found the ruins of Troy, so the city of Troy didn’t really exist." fits the types \( <FE> \) (Incomplete Enumeration) and \( <IR> \) (Inconclusive Reason). It assumes a complete understanding of all possibilities by only presenting the absence of ruins as proof, which is not wholly conclusive or exhaustive. \( <WCB> \) (Insufficient Causal Basis) can also be argued as relevant since the causal basis presented isn't strong enough.

Thus, the primary classifications for this argument are:
- \( <FE> \)
- \( <IR> \)
- \( <WCB> \)
