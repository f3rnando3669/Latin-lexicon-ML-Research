For 
To apply IDAA (the application of the decomposition of an advanced task into specific steps) to the task of identifying which defective argument type is exemplified by "Intentionally using negatively charged words is an example of which technique?" we can break down the task as follows:

1. **Identify and Understand the Advanced Task (<t>):**
   - The advanced task here is to classify the given string into one of the defective argument types (Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Presumptuous Consensus, Ambiguous Language Use).

2. **Decompose <t> into Specific Steps (<D>):**
   - **Step 1:** Parse the string to extract the main components.
   - **Step 2:** Identify the type of argument or reasoning presented in the string.
   - **Step 3:** Compare the identified argument type with the definitions of the defective argument types provided.
   - **Step 4:** Classify the string into one of the defective argument types based on the comparison.

3. **Application of Steps to the Given String (Apply <D> to <IDA>):**

   **Step 1: Parse the string to extract the main components.**
   - The string is: "Intentionally using negatively charged words is an example of which technique?"
   - Here, we are dealing with the technique of using negatively charged words.

   **Step 2: Identify the type of argument or reasoning presented in the string.**
   - The string is discussing a rhetorical technique, specifically the use of negatively charged words. However, it does not directly present a Proposition, Reason, or Proof of Reason.

   **Step 3: Compare the identified argument type with the definitions of the defective argument types provided.**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** Refers to applying a generalization based on partial evidence.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Claiming complete knowledge while missing some points.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Reason that doesn't conclusively support the Proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Weak causal connection for the Reason presented.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Repeating the Proposition as the Reason.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Assuming something is true because it is "universally agreed upon."
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Using language that can be interpreted in multiple ways.

   **Step 4: Classify the string into one of the defective argument types based on the comparison.**
   - The string does not necessarily match any of the specific defective argument types by itself, because it doesn’t present a defective argument but rather asks which technique is being used.

However, if we were to infer that the technique discussed might involve a specific type of defective argument, we could consider whether the use of negatively charged words might lead to:

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** If the negative connotation leads to misunderstandings or multiple interpretations.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** If negative words create an impression that a negative view is universally accepted, though that seems less relevant here.

Because the given string doesn’t directly showcase any of the defective argument types but asks about a rhetorical technique, it doesn’t neatly fit into our defined categories. Thus, based on this analysis, none of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP) directly apply to the string itself. It is asking about a technique rather than presenting an argument.
