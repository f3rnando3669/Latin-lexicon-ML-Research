For 
To apply the task of <IDAA> to the argument "If you eat a good diet, you will never have a heart attack," we need to decompose the advanced task of classification into specific steps and then follow those steps to classify the given string.

Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition <P>:** 
   - The statement or claim being made.
2. **Identify the Reason <R>:** 
   - The causal basis or reason supporting the proposition.
3. **Formulate the Proof of Reason <PR>:** 
   - Any additional arguments or evidence that support the reason.
4. **Check for Defective Argument Types:** 
   - Compare identified elements (<P>, <R>, and <PR>) with the characteristics of each defective argument type (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>).

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
- Proposition: "If you eat a good diet, you will never have a heart attack."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
- Reason: Implicit in this statement is the reason that a good diet is sufficient to prevent heart attacks.

### Step 3: Formulate the Proof of Reason <PR>
- There is no explicit proof provided in the statement itself. It assumes the reason given is sufficient without additional evidence.

### Step 4: Check for Defective Argument Types
Now, let's check the specific defective argument types:

- **Generalization (<G>):**
  - The statement implies that all individuals will avoid heart attacks if they eat a good diet. This is a broad generalization that might not hold true for every case, as other factors (genetics, lifestyle, etc.) can contribute to heart attacks.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
  - The statement does not enumerate all possible factors affecting heart attacks. It only considers diet and neglects other relevant possibilities like exercise, genetics, smoking, etc.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
  - The reason (good diet) does not conclusively demonstrate that heart attacks will never occur.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
  - The causal basis provided (good diet) is not compelling enough to conclusively prevent heart attacks, as other factors also play a crucial role.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
  - No repetition of the proposition as a reason.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
  - No claim of universal agreement on this assertion being provided in the statement.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
  - The statement is clear and straightforward without ambiguity.

Based on these checks, the argument most closely aligns with:

- **Generalization (<G>),**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>),**
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>),**
- and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).**

### Classification:

The argument "If you eat a good diet, you will never have a heart attack" can be classified under multiple defective argument types: <G> (Generalization), <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration), <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
