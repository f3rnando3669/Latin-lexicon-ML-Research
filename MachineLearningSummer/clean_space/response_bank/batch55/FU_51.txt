For 
To apply IDAA (Decomposition and Identification of Argument Analysis) to classify the string "This is how most schools evaluate their students, so it must be effective," we'll follow a step-by-step decomposition process.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The proposition (P) in the given string is:
**"It must be effective."**

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason (R) provided to support the proposition is:
**"This is how most schools evaluate their students."**

### Step 3: Classify the Argument
Now, we need to classify the argument type based on the given definitions of defective argument types.

1. **Generalization (G):** Assertion based on some or a majority, not necessarily applicable to all.
   - The argument asserts something is effective because it is how most schools do it.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Claims complete enumeration of possibilities but misses some.
   - The argument does not enumerate all methods of student evaluation, just states that most schools use this method.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
   - The reason provided ("most schools use it") does not conclusively demonstrate that it is effective.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Weak causal basis for the proposition.
   - The basis that "most schools use it" is a weak causal basis for the effectiveness claim without further support.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Reason is just a repetition of the proposition.
   - The reason ("most schools use it") is not simply repeating the proposition ("it must be effective").

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Assumes universal agreement on something still in dispute.
   - The claim does imply a consensus (most schools), but it's problematic because it does not address effectiveness directly.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The proposition can be taken in another sense than intended.
   - The terms "most" and "effective" are not particularly ambiguous in this context.

### Step 4: Determine the Defective Argument Type
Based on these classifications, the defective argument types that fit best are:
- **Generalization (G)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

### Conclusion

A good match is **Generalization (G)** because it asserts a particular method is effective based on its usage by most schools, which is not necessarily applicable to all evaluations or effectiveness claims.

### Final Classification

The given string **"This is how most schools evaluate their students, so it must be effective."** is best classified as:
- **Defective Argument Type: Generalization (G)**
