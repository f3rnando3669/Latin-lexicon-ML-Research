For 
To apply \(<IDAA>\) to the argument "Marco cusses a lot, so you can't listen to a thing he says. He's not a good guy," we need to decompose the task of classifying the string into specific steps and identify any defective argument types present. Let's proceed with the decomposition and analysis step by step:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (\(P\)):** 
   - Determine the main point or assertion trying to be proved.
   - In this case, the central proposition seems to be "You can't listen to a thing Marco says" or "Marco is not a good guy."

2. **Identify the Reason (\(R\)):** 
   - Determine the causal basis or reasoning provided to support the proposition.
   - Here, the reason given is "Marco cusses a lot."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\(PR\)):** 
   - Check if there are any supporting arguments or additional evidence provided to substantiate the reason.
   - In this argument, no further proof or evidence is provided beyond the initial reason.

4. **Evaluate for Defective Argument Types:** 
   - Compare the identified \(P\), \(R\), and \(PR\) against defective argument types (\(G\), \(FE\), \(IR\), \(RR\), \(WCB\), \(FU\), \(DEP\)).

### Analysis:

- **Proposition (\(P\)):**
  "Marco cusses a lot, so you can't listen to a thing he says." 
  (Alternatively, "He's not a good guy.")

- **Reason (\(R\)):**
  "Marco cusses a lot."

- **Proof of Reason (\(PR\)):**
  Not explicitly provided in the argument. 

Now we evaluate for defects:

1. **Generalization (\(G\)):** 
   - The argument makes an assumption about Marco based on one specific behavior (cussing) and generalizes it to his overall character and trustworthiness.
   - Possible match since it implies that because Marco cusses, he can’t be trusted at all.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\(FE\)):**
   - The argument doesn’t claim a complete enumeration of possibilities.
   - Not a match.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (\(IR\)):**
   - The reason ("Marco cusses a lot") does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition ("You can't listen to a thing he says" or "He's not a good guy").
   - This seems applicable because cussing alone does not prove someone cannot be listened to or is morally deficient.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(RR\)):**
   - No parts of the reason simply repeat the proposition.
   - Not a match.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(WCB\)):**
   - The argument presents a reason that is weak or not compelling enough to prove the proposition.
   - This is applicable because cussing alone is not a sufficient basis to determine someone’s overall trustworthiness or character.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\(FU\)):**
   - The argument does not rely on an assumed universal agreement.
   - Not a match.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\(DEP\)):**
   - The argument does not use ambiguous terms in a misleading way.
   - Not a match.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the string "Marco cusses a lot, so you can't listen to a thing he says. He's not a good guy." can be classified under:

- **Inconclusive Reason (\(IR\)):** The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(WCB\)):** The causal basis (cussing) is weak and not compelling enough to prove the point.

Thus, the argument has at least two defects: \(<IR>\) and \(<WCB>\).
