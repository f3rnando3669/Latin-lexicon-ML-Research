To apply the IDA (Identification of Defective Argument) task to the statement "Running the government is like running a business. You can’t keep running into debt and expect to be successful.", let's break down the process into specific steps (D) and apply it step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)

The first step is to identify what the statement is trying to prove or assert.

**Proposition (P):** "Running the government is like running a business."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)

Next, we need to identify the reasoning provided to support the proposition.

**Reason (R):** "You can’t keep running into debt and expect to be successful."

### Step 3: Detect Defective Arguments

Now, we can evaluate the statement to classify it under the defective argument types provided:

1. **Generalization (G):** This occurs when a proposition is an assertion based on one part or a majority, but is applied to all. We check if here a broad assertion is made from limited evidence.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This occurs when we claim a complete enumeration of possibilities but miss some.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This occurs when the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
   
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This occurs when the reason provided for the proposition is not compelling.
   
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This occurs when the reason merely repeats the proposition.
   
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This occurs when a proof is taken as certain merely because it is universally agreed upon but is still in dispute.
   
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** This occurs when the proof can be taken in another sense than intended.

### Step 4: Analyze the Statement

Let's analyze the statement against these defective argument types:

- **Generalization (G):** The proposition "Running the government is like running a business" could be considered a generalization if it assumes that because businesses operate under certain principles, governments must follow the same principles, which might not necessarily apply given the different nature and goals of governments versus businesses.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The statement does not appear to make a complete enumeration of possibilities or alternatives, so FE does not directly apply here.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason "You can’t keep running into debt and expect to be successful" might not conclusively prove that running a government should be like running a business because government debt operates under different principles than business debt, often with entirely different implications and solutions.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis provided ("debt avoidance") may not be strong enough to support the proposition since governments can manage debt differently from businesses, including through taxation, monetary policy, and other economic tools.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason provided is not a mere repetition of the proposition. Instead, it provides an example related to the proposition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There is no assumption of universal agreement presented for the proof in this statement, so FU does not apply here.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The terms “successful” and “debt” could be ambiguous without further context. What constitutes “success” for a government vs. a business can vary significantly.

### Step 5: Classify the Defective Argument

Based on the analysis, the primary defective argument type that applies here is:

- **Generalization (G):** The proposition is making a generalization by equating government operations to business operations without considering the different roles and responsibilities each has. 
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason given does not conclusively prove that the principles of not running into debt (as applied in business) should be directly applicable to government operations due to their differing natures.

By following these steps, we have decomposed and analyzed the statement, classifying it primarily as a Generalization (G) with aspects of an Inconclusive Reason (IR).
