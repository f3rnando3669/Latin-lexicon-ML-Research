For 
To apply the process of <IDAA> (the application of decomposing an advanced task into specific steps) to the task of classifying the string "You are clearly just too young to understand this issue!" as one of the defective argument types, we will follow a series of steps to achieve this classification. 

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- The string provided does not explicitly specify the proposition. However, it implies a proposition such as:
  **P**: The listener does not understand the issue.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- The reason given for the proposition is that the listener is "just too young".
  **R**: The listener's age is the reason they do not understand the issue.

### Step 3: Analyze the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- There is no explicit additional argument or evidence provided to support the reason that age causes a lack of understanding. 

### Step 4: Check for Defective Arguments
We will go through each defective argument type and see if it fits the classification for the string.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - This does not seem to be based on a generalization about a group of individuals. It specifically targets the listener's age.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The argument does not enumerate all possible reasons for not understanding an issue. It singularly focuses on age.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The reason given (age) does not conclusively justify the proposition that the listener cannot understand the issue. Simply being young does not directly equate to an inability to understand an issue.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - The reason (age) is used as a causal basis but is weak since young age alone is not a strong or compelling reason to assert that one cannot understand a specific issue.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - The reason differs from the proposition. The statement does not just repeat the proposition using different words.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - There is no mention of it being a universally agreed-upon fact. The speaker states it as a personal assertion.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
   - The language used does not seem ambiguous. The terms used are clear in their intended meaning.

### Step 5: Classify the String
After evaluating the string against each defective argument type, the most fitting type is:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**

The reason given (youth) is insufficient and not compelling enough to prove the proposition that the listener cannot understand the issue effectively.

### Conclusion
Thus, the string "You are clearly just too young to understand this issue!" is classified as type **<WCB>**: Insufficient Causal Basis.
