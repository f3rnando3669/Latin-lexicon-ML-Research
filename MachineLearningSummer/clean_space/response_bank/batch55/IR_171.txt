To apply the process of decomposing the task of classifying the string to identify the logical fallacy, we'll break down the task into clear steps.

### Step 1: Identify and Understand the Proposition (\<P\>)
- **Proposition (\<P\>)**: Determine what the string is intending to assert or prove.

### Step 2: Identify and Understand the Reason (\<R\>)
- **Reason (\<R\>)**: Identify the causal basis or reasoning provided for the proposition (\<P\>).

### Step 3: Check if Proof of Reason (\<PR\>) is Present
- **Proof of Reason (\<PR\>)**: Look for additional arguments that support the reason (\<R\>).

### Step 4: Determine the Type of Defective Argument
- Based on the definitions provided for defective argument types (\<G\>, \<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<RR\>, \<WCB\>, \<FU\>, \<DEP\>), classify the argument in the string by comparing these definitions with the argument's structure.

### Application of Steps to the Given String:

#### String: "Let's look instead at what my opponent proposes to do with your hard-earned money!"

### Step 1: Identify and Understand the Proposition (\<P\>)
- **Proposition (\<P\>)**: The string is urging to shift focus from the speaker's argument to the opponent's proposal. However, it doesn't explicitly state an assertion that can be evaluated for truth.

### Step 2: Identify and Understand the Reason (\<R\>)
- **Reason (\<R\>)**: The reason implied is suggesting avoidance of discussing the speaker’s current topic, deflecting instead to criticizing the opponent.

### Step 3: Check if Proof of Reason (\<PR\>) is Present
- There is no additional argument supporting why focusing on the opponent's proposal is warranted. The string is primarily an attempt to divert.

### Step 4: Determine the Type of Defective Argument
- **Type of Defective Argument**: The statement is a classic example of a deflection or red herring—a tactic to avoid responding to a proposition by diverting attention.

### Conclusion:
The string "Let's look instead at what my opponent proposes to do with your hard-earned money!" uses an argument that redirects attention away from the current proposition or argument without addressing it directly. Therefore, this fits the characteristics of a **red herring fallacy**, which isn't exactly one of the predefined types given (\<G\>, \<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<RR\>, \<WCB\>, \<FU\>, \<DEP\>).

However, since \Red Herring isn't among \(the predefined classifications, depending on its close properties, it could indirectly be linked with faulty repetition as it distracts without addressing the proposition directly. Hence, this argument could arguably be related to <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition) as it repeats the act of deflection without contributing new arguments substantively.

### Final Classification:
Given the options provided, the argument most closely resembles \<RR\> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), although a more accurate classification aligns with a red herring logical fallacy.
