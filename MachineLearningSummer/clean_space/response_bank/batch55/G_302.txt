To apply the process of IDAA (the decomposition of the task of identifying defective arguments into steps) to the given statement, we will break down the process into specific steps to classify the argument correctly.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (`D`)

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Find the main claim or assertion being made.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine the causal basis given for the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Look for any additional arguments that support the Reason.

4. **Classify the Type of Defective Argument:**
   - Compare the given proposition, reason, and proof of reason to the types of defective arguments (Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Presumptuous Consensus, Ambiguous Language Use).
   - Recognize any patterns or indicators that match these types.

### Application to the Provided Statement

**The Statement:** "One of our clients doubled their conversions after changing all their landing page text to bright red. Therefore, changing all text to red is a proven way to double conversions."

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)

- **Proposition (<P>):** "Changing all text to red is a proven way to double conversions."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)

- **Reason (<R>):** "One of our clients doubled their conversions after changing all their landing page text to bright red."

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)

- **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Not explicitly provided in the statement. The Proof of Reason here is implied by the client's individual success story.

#### Step 4: Classify the Type of Defective Argument

- We need to compare the Proposition and Reason against the types of defective arguments to classify this argument correctly.

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The proposition generalizes the outcome of one client to all cases without sufficient evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The argument does not claim to be an exhaustive analysis, so this type doesn’t apply.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition’s correctness, as one instance is not sufficient proof.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The causal basis (one client's success) is weak as definitive evidence for the proposition being effective universally.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - The reason provided is not simply a restatement of the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - The argument does not rely on an assumed consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - The language used is not particularly ambiguous or open to alternative interpretations.

### Conclusion

Upon evaluating the provided statement against the types of defective arguments, the argument falls into the types of **Generalization (G)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. It generalizes from a single case and has a weak causal foundation for the asserted proposition.

**Classification:** The statement is of type **<G>** (Generalization) and **<WCB>** (Insufficient Causal Basis).

Thus, the complete IDAA is applied, and the defective argument has been classified correctly.
