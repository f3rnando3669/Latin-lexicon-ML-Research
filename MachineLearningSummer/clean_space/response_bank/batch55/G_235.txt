For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition and classification of the statement as one of the defective argument types) to the statement "Asserting that if we allow 'A' to happen, then 'Z' will consequently happen too, therefore 'A' should not happen," we need to break this task down into specific steps and then classify the argument. Let's do this step by step:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition, or <P>, is the statement or assertion that we intend to prove. In this case, the proposition is "A should not happen."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason sets forth the causal basis for the proposition. Here, the reason given is "if we allow 'A' to happen, then 'Z' will consequently happen too."

3. **Classify the Argument:**
   - Now, we need to determine which defective argument type this statement belongs to with the given definitions. We will consider each defective argument type:

   - **Generalization (G):**
     - This does not fit as it involves making a claim about all individuals based on some individuals.
   
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
     - This does not fit as it involves claiming to have covered all possibilities but actually omitting some.
     
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
     - This could be applicable if the reason given does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
     - This might fit if the causal link between 'A' and 'Z' is weak or not compelling.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
     - This does not fit as it involves repeating the proposition as if it were the reason itself.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
     - This does not fit as it involves assuming something is true because it is universally agreed upon, which is not the case here.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
     - This does not fit as it is not necessarily about ambiguous language.

### Classification

Looking at the argument "Asserting that if we allow 'A' to happen, then 'Z' will consequently happen too, therefore 'A' should not happen," more closely, it seems to assume a direct and unavoidable cause-effect relationship between 'A' and 'Z'. If this relationship isn't well-established or is weakly supported, it can fall under:

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - The causal link between 'A' and 'Z' needs to be demonstrably strong to justify the proposition. If it is not, the argument is weak. Hence, this argument assumes a slippery slope without strong evidence that 'A' will inevitably lead to 'Z'.

5. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - If the cause-effect relationship (reason) provided does not conclusively demonstrate why 'A' should not happen, it falls into this category. Given the assertion without sufficient backing, it seems the reason is inconclusive.

### Conclusion

The argument "Asserting that if we allow 'A' to happen, then 'Z' will consequently happen too, therefore 'A' should not happen" can be classified under two types of defective arguments:

- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**
- **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**

Both classifications hinge on the strength and conclusiveness of the causal link between 'A' and 'Z'.
