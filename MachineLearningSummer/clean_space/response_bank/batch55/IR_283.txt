For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the IDA task into specific steps) to the given string, we need to identify and classify the type of defective argument present in the string step by step.

Here is the given string:
"I believe that when we die, we are all given new, young, perfect bodies, and we spend eternity with those whom we love. I can’t imagine the point of life if it all just ends when we die!"

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) for IDA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - The proposition in this string is: "when we die, we are all given new, young, perfect bodies, and we spend eternity with those whom we love."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - The reason provided is: "I can’t imagine the point of life if it all just ends when we die!"

3. **Evaluate Reason (R) in relation to Proposition (P):**
   - Assess whether the reason conclusively supports the proposition.

### Application of IDA (Identifying Defective Argument Types):

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - The string does not assert a proposition based on a sample applied to all. So, it does not seem to fit the type Generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - The string does not list possibilities and is not claiming a complete enumeration. Hence, it does not fit the type Incomplete Enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - Evaluate if the reason "I can’t imagine the point of life if it all just ends when we die!" conclusively demonstrates the proposition "when we die, we are all given new, young, perfect bodies, and we spend eternity with those whom we love." 
   - The reason provided is subjective and based on personal belief rather than objective evidence. It does not conclusively support the proposition. Thus, it fits the type Inconclusive Reason (IR).

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - Check if the causal basis is compelling.
   - The provided reason lacks a compelling causal basis for the proposition. Here it appears that the belief about afterlife is based more on personal comfort than evidence.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - The reason is different from the proposition, so it doesn’t repeat the proposition. Hence, it does not fit Faulty Repetition of Proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - The argument does not assume consensus based on universal agreement. So, it does not fit Presumptuous Consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - The argument does not rely on ambiguous language that could be taken in another sense. So, it does not fit Ambiguous Language Use.

### Conclusion:
The defective argument type that fits best for the given string is **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. The reason presented does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition; it’s more of a subjective feeling rather than an objective proof.
