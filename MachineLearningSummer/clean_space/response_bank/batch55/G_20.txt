For 
To apply the IDAA (Decomposition + Identification of Defective Argument) to the string "I work out in the morning because it worked for my friend," we will decompose the task into specific steps and classify the argument type step-by-step.

Here's how we can do it:

### Step 1: Identify the Different Components of the Argument
1. **Identify the Proposition <P>**: 
   - In this case, the proposition is "I work out in the morning."
   
2. **Identify the Reason <R>**:
   - The reason provided is "because it worked for my friend."

### Step 2: Evaluate the Reason and the Relationship to the Proposition
3. **Examine the Reason**:
   - "because it worked for my friend" serves as the causal basis for the proposition.
   
4. **Determine if the Reason <R> is Defective**:
   - Determine if it fits any defective argument type.

### Step 3: Classify the Argument
5. **Check for Generalization <G>**:
   - Does the argument generalize the experience of one individual to all individuals? Yes. It is based on the experience of one friend and assumes the same outcome for the speaker.

6. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration <FE>**:
   - Is the argument missing out on other pertinent possibilities? No, this error type does not seem to directly apply here.

7. **Check for Inconclusive Reason <IR>**:
   - Does the reason conclusively justify the proposition? No, the success of one friend working out in the morning does not conclusively prove it will work for the speaker.

8. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>**:
   - Is the causal basis sufficient and compelling? No, the fact that it worked for one friend is not sufficient to establish it as a compelling reason for the proposition.

9. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>**:
   - Is the reason a mere repetition of the proposition? No, the reason is related but not a repetition.

10. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus <FU>**:
   - Is there an assumed consensus that is actually in dispute? No indication of such consensus here.

11. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>**:
   - Is the proof taken in another sense than intended? No ambiguity in language is evident in this case.

### Classification:
The argument fits the criteria for Generalization <G> because it generalizes the experience of a single friend to apply universally to the speaker's situation. It also fits Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB> as the reason given (it worked for a friend) is not a compelling causal basis to establish the truth of the proposition.

### Conclusion:
The argument "I work out in the morning because it worked for my friend" can be classified as both <G> (Generalization) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).

Thus, the identified defective argument types for <s> are **<G>** and **<WCB>**.
