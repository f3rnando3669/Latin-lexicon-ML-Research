For 
To apply \( <IDAA> \) to the proposition "She was wearing cowboy boots in her last Instagram picture so she must be into country music," we need to decompose the task of classifying the argument (\( <IDA> \)) into specific steps (\( <D> \)). Here is the decomposition and application step-by-step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\( <P> \))
- The proposition is the statement we intend to prove.
- In this case, the proposition (\( <P> \)) is: "She must be into country music."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\( <R> \))
- The reason sets forth the causal basis for \( <P> \).
- In this case, the reason (\( <R> \)) is: "She was wearing cowboy boots in her last Instagram picture."

### Step 3: Identify the Type of Defective Argument
- Compare the structure of the given argument to the definitions of known defective argument types (\( <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP> \)).
- The given statement attempts to infer a broad preference ("into country music") based on a specific observation ("wearing cowboy boots").

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
Based on the specific structure of the argument:

- \( <G> \) (Generalization) typically involves inferring a general conclusion from a specific instance or a small sample.
- The conclusion "She must be into country music" is a generalization about her musical preferences based on the specific instance of "wearing cowboy boots."

### Step 5: Verify the Classification
- Evaluate if the generalization fits the description of \( <G> \).
- The proposition "She must be into country music" based solely on the observation of "wearing cowboy boots" meets the criteria for a generalization because it extends a specific observation to make a broader claim.

### Conclusion
The argument "She was wearing cowboy boots in her last Instagram picture so she must be into country music" can be classified as a defective argument of type \( <G> \) (Generalization).

Thus, the application of \( <IDAA> \) to the given statement classifies it as \( <G> \).
