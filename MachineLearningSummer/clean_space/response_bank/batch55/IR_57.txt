For 
To apply the IDAA (Decomposition of Task to Classifying Defective Arguments) to the given string, we'll break down the process into specific steps and classify the text using the defective argument types defined above.

### Decomposition Steps for IDAA:

1. **Identify and Isolate the Proposition (\<P\>):** Determine the main assertion or claim that is being made.
2. **Identify and Isolate the Reason (\<R\>):** Find the causal basis provided to support the proposition.
3. **Identify and Isolate the Proof of Reason (\<PR\>):** Look for any supporting arguments or evidence provided to corroborate the reason.
4. **Evaluate for Defective Argument Types:** Check if the \[P\], \[R\], or \[PR\] match any of the defined defective argument types (\<G\>, \<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<RR\>, \<WCB\>, \<FU\>, or \<DEP\>).

### Applying IDAA

1. **Identify and Isolate the Proposition (\<P\>)**
   - "Ghosts must be real, and spiritualism must be true."

2. **Identify and Isolate the Reason (\<R\>)**
   - "My philosophy professor believes in ghosts and goes to séances."
   - "She’s an intelligent, educated person, so..."

3. **Identify and Isolate the Proof of Reason (\<PR\>)**
   - There isn’t a clear additional argument beyond the reason itself. The reasons provided are used to support the proposition directly without further corroboration.

4. **Evaluate for Defective Argument Types**

   - **Generalization (\<G\>):**
     - The statement does not generalize from a small sample to a broad assertion about all cases or people.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>):**
     - The statement does not claim a complete list of possibilities but is making a direct assertion.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>):**
     - The reason given (professor's belief and intelligence) does not conclusively prove the proposition. The professor's intelligence and educational background do not provide evidence that ghosts or spiritualism are real.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>):**
     - The causal basis provided (beliefs of an educated person) is weak. The intelligence and education of an individual do not serve as compelling proof for the existence of ghosts or the truth of spiritualism.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>):**
     - The reason provided is not a mere repetition of the proposition.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>):**
     - The argument does not claim "universal agreement" but directly relates to the belief of one individual.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>):**
     - There is no ambiguous language that could be taken in a different sense.

### Conclusion:
The string "My philosophy professor believes in ghosts and goes to séances. She’s an intelligent, educated person, so ghosts must be real, and spiritualism must be true." contains two defective argument types:

- Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>): The intelligence and beliefs of one individual do not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition that ghosts are real.
- Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>): The causal basis (the professor’s belief and education) is not compelling enough to establish the truth of the proposition.
