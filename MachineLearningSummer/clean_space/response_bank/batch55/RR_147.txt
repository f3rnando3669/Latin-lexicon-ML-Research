For 
Certainly! To apply the task \( IDAA \) to the given string "George Bush is a good communicator because he speaks effectively," we need to first decompose \( IDA \) into specific steps and then classify the string as one of the defective argument types \( <G> \), \( <FE> \), \( <IR> \), \( <RR> \), \( <WCB> \), \( <FU> \), or \( <DEP> \).

### Decomposition of \( IDA \) (\( D \)):
1. **Identify the Proposition (\( P \))**: Determine the main claim or assertion set forth.
2. **Identify the Reason (\( R \))**: Determine the causal basis or reason given to support the proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Reason**: Assess the strength and validity of the reason provided in supporting the proposition.
4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**: Match the evaluated reason to any of the defective argument types based on its characteristics.

### Step-by-Step Application to the Given String

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( P \))**:
   - The Proposition (\( P \)) is "George Bush is a good communicator."

2. **Identify the Reason (\( R \))**:
   - The Reason (\( R \)) given is "because he speaks effectively."

3. **Evaluate the Reason**:
   - To evaluate the Reason, we need to assess if "speaking effectively" sufficiently supports the claim that "George Bush is a good communicator."

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**:
   - Let's consider if the Reason "because he speaks effectively" is satisfactory:
     - We observe that the Reason provided, "he speaks effectively," essentially restates the idea of being a good communicator without offering a new or additional causal basis.

   - Given this restating nature, the defective argument type it falls under is:
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( RR \))**: Where a Reason is weak when it appears to be presented as the Reason, but says precisely the same as was said in the Proposition.

Therefore, applying \( IDAA \) to the string "George Bush is a good communicator because he speaks effectively," we classify the defective argument type as \( <RR> \) (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
