For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string, we need to follow a systematic decomposition of the task of classifying the defective argument type. Here are the steps we will follow:

1. **Identify the components of the argument**: Determine the Proposition (P), Reason (R), and Proof of Reason (PR) if they are present.

2. **Evaluate each identified component**: Check each identified component to see if it fits the definition of the defective argument types provided.

3. **Classify the defective argument type (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, or DEP)** based on the evaluation.

Now let's apply <IDAA> step-by-step to the given string:

### Step 1: Identify the components of the argument
- **P (Proposition)**: "Dad, it's difficult to make a living on my salary."
- **R (Reason)**: "Consider yourself lucky. When I was your age, I was living on $40 a week."

### Step 2: Evaluate each identified component
- **Evaluate P**: The son/daughter claims it is difficult to make a living on their current salary.
- **Evaluate R**: The dad's response states that the son/daughter should consider themselves lucky because the dad managed on a significantly lower salary ($40 a week) when he was of the same age.

### Step 3: Check for defects in the argument
Evaluate whether R sufficiently and relevantly supports P or not by examining if it falls into any defective argument types:

- **Generalization (G)**: Doesn't fit because there is no assertion based on one part or majority.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Doesn't fit because it doesn't involve missing out possibilities during enumeration.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided by the dad does not conclusively support the proposition. Just because the dad lived on $40 a week does not relate directly to whether the current salary is sufficient for making a living. It ignores other factors like inflation, cost of living, etc.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This fits as a potential defect. The reason provided lacks a compelling causal basis to support the proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Does not fit since the reason is not merely a repetition of the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Does not fit, as it does not assume a universal agreement on a disputed point.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Does not fit since the language isn't ambiguous in the way described.

### Conclusion
Based on the evaluation, the dad's response is best classified as an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because it does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition ("it's difficult to make a living on my salary"). While it can also be seen as lacking a compelling causal basis, IR is the more fitting classification since the reason given is not conclusive or directly relevant to the current economic context.

Thus, the defective argument type for the provided string is **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**.
