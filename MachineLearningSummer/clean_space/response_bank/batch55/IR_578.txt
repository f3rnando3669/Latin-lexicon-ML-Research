For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given argument "Every 0.008 seconds in the United States, a teen accidentally shatters his/her phone screen. You can help put an end to these devastating tragedies: donate now to my Kickstarter fund, the new Bubble-wrap Phone Case X.", we will decompose the task of classifying the string with respect to defective argument types into specific steps.

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The proposition in the argument appears to be: "Every 0.008 seconds in the United States, a teen accidentally shatters his/her phone screen."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason provided for the proposition is: "You can help put an end to these devastating tragedies."

3. **Identify Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - The proof of reason given is: "Donate now to my Kickstarter fund, the new Bubble-wrap Phone Case X."

4. **Evaluate for Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (G):** Check if the proposition is a generic assertion based on insufficient data.
     - Claiming "Every 0.008 seconds in the United States, a teen accidentally shatters his/her phone screen" without specifying the source of this figure or providing substantial evidence implies a potential over-generalization. 
     - The argument is intended to imply a high frequency which may not be universally applicable or correctly measured.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Check if all possibilities are considered or if pertinent aspects are omitted.
     - The argument focuses on a single cause of screen shattering (accident by teens) without considering other demographics or circumstances. 
     - It fails to enumerate other causes or incidents.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Check if the reason conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the proposition.
     - Stating "You can help put an end to these devastating tragedies" does not conclusively connect the statement to the statistic provided.
     - The causal link between donations and the end of phone accidental breakages is weak and not demonstrated.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Check if the causal basis is compelling.
     - The causal basis that donating to the Kickstarter would end phone shatter incidents is unsupported by evidence and thus insufficiently compelling.
    
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Check if the reason merely repeats the proposition.
     - The reason does not appear to be a repetition of the proposition.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Check if the proof of reason is assumed certain based on universal agreement.
     - The PR does not base its certainty on presumed universal agreement; however, it assumes people will donate based on the stated statistic without providing actual consensus or data of such donations ending phone breakages.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Check for potential ambiguous interpretation of the language used.
     - The term "devastating tragedies" is highly emotionally charged and vague, creating potential ambiguity. The tragedy in question is the shattering of phone screens, which might not be universally perceived as "devastating."

### Classification:
Given the steps and the evaluation:
- The statement primarily exhibits **Generalization (G)** as it makes a sweeping assertion about phone screen breakages among teens based on an uncertain figure.
- It also shows potential **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** by not considering other demographics or environments in which phone screen breakages could happen.

Therefore, the argument classifies primarily as:
- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
