To apply the process of IDAA, we'll follow a step-by-step approach to decompose and classify the given argument "{{It is ridiculous to have spent thousands of dollars to rescue those two whales trapped in the Arctic ice. Why look at all the people trapped in jobs they don’t like.}}" into its components and identify any defective argument types.

### Step-by-Step Approach (D) for IDA (Identification of Defective Argument):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine what the main argument or assertion is.
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Look for the causal basis or support provided for the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Check if any additional arguments or evidence is provided for the reason.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:**
   - Based on the identified <P>, <R>, and <PR>, classify the argument into one or more of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Application of IDAA

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition is the main claim the speaker is making:
- **<P>:** "It is ridiculous to have spent thousands of dollars to rescue those two whales trapped in the Arctic ice."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason given to support the proposition:
- **<R>:** "Why look at all the people trapped in jobs they don’t like."

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
Examine if there is any additional evidence or argument provided to support the Reason:
- There is no further evidence or detailed argument provided to support why we should prioritize people in jobs they don't like over rescuing whales.

#### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type
- We will now classify the argument into one or more defective types listed:

##### Analysis:

- **Generalization (<G>):** The argument does not generalize from a few instances to all instances, so it is not type G.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument does not claim completeness based on an incomplete list, so it is not type FE.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason provided about people being trapped in jobs they don’t like does not logically invalidate the importance or validity of spending money to rescue whales. Therefore, it does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. This matches the description of <IR>.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The argument suggests that the existence of people in jobs they don’t like is a compelling reason to criticize spending money on whale rescue, but without further connection or explanation, this rationale appears weak. This matches <WCB> as well.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason provided does not repeat the proposition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** There is no assumption of universal agreement presented here.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The language use does not seem ambiguous.

##### Conclusion:
The argument can be classified predominantly as an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The reason provided does not conclusively support the proposition, and the causal basis is not sufficiently compelling.

#### Final Classification:
- **<IR>**: Inconclusive Reason
- **<WCB>**: Insufficient Causal Basis

Therefore, applying IDAA to the argument classifies it as:
- **"It is ridiculous to have spent thousands of dollars to rescue those two whales trapped in the Arctic ice. Why look at all the people trapped in jobs they don’t like."**
- Classification: **<IR> and <WCB>**
