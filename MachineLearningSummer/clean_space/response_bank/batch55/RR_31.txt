For 
To apply the steps for <IDAA> to the string "A is true because B is true, and B is true because A is true," we'll perform the task of decomposing <IDA> into specific steps and then apply it to classify the given string. Hereâ€™s the detailed breakdown:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine what is being claimed or intended to be proven.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the causal basis or reason provided for the Proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Find any additional arguments that support the Reason.
4. **Evaluate for Defective Arguments**:
   - Check for **Generalization (<G>)**.
   - Check for **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**.
   - Check for **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**.
   - Check for **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
   - Check for **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**.
   - Check for **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**.
   - Check for **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**.

### Applying the Steps to the String (IDAA):

**String**: "A is true because B is true, and B is true because A is true."

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Proposition for the first statement: A is true.
   - Proposition for the second statement: B is true.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Reason for the first statement: B is true.
   - Reason for the second statement: A is true.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - There are no additional arguments provided beyond the circular reasoning.

4. **Evaluate for Defective Arguments**:
   - **Generalization (<G>):** Not applicable.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Not applicable.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Not applicable since reason provided is clear but circular.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Not applicable as the problem isn't a weak causal basis.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This seems relevant because the reason provided essentially repeats the proposition. Specifically, "A is true because B is true," and "B is true because A is true" offers no new information.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Not applicable.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Not applicable.

### Conclusion:
The given string "A is true because B is true, and B is true because A is true" is classified as:

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**

This is because the reasons given are essentially restatements of the propositions themselves, creating a circular argument with no independent proof, making it fall under the category of <RR>.
