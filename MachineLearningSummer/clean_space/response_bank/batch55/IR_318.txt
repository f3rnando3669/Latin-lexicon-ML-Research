Certainly! To apply the task of classifying the argument as defective into specific steps, we can break it down into a series of structured steps. Here’s how we can approach this:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
Identify the main statement or conclusion of the argument.

In this case: "it is acceptable for Tommy to steal Jimmy’s lunch today."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
Identify the reasoning provided to support the proposition.

In this case: "Jimmy stole Tommy’s lunch in the past."

### Step 3: Examine the Proof of Reason (PR)
Look for any additional arguments or proofs that are provided to support the reason.

In this case: There is no additional argument provided beyond the reason that Jimmy stole Tommy’s lunch in the past.

### Step 4: Determine if the Proposition (P) is a Generalization (G)
Check if the proposition extends the assertion to all cases without necessary justification.

In this case: The proposition is specific to Jimmy and Tommy, so it doesn't appear to be a Generalization.

### Step 5: Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
Determine if the argument claims to have considered all possibilities but misses out on relevant ones.

In this case: The argument does not appear to enumerate possibilities at all, so FE is not applicable.

### Step 6: Evaluate for Inconclusive Reason (IR)
Assess if the reason provided is inconclusive in demonstrating the correctness of the proposition.

In this case: The reason provided (past behavior of Jimmy) does not clearly justify the morality or acceptability of Tommy's current behavior. This seems to fit IR.

### Step 7: Inspect for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
Examine if the causal basis submitted is compelling enough for supporting the proposition.

In this case: The causal basis is weak since it is not morally compelling to justify one act of theft by citing a previous act of theft. Another possible fit is WCB.

### Step 8: Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
Check if the reason merely repeats the proposition without adding new evidence.

In this case: The reason is not a direct repetition of the proposition, so RR does not fit.

### Step 9: Evaluate for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
Determine if the proof assumes consensus on a point still in dispute.

In this case: There is no claim of universal agreement or consensus mentioned, so FU is not applicable.

### Step 10: Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)
Determine if the proof of the reason can be taken in another sense than intended by the speaker.

In this case: The language used is clear and does not present ambiguity. Therefore, DEP does not apply.

### Conclusion
By following this systematic approach, we can classify the argument into one of the defective types based on the identified reason and proof.

The argument can be identified as **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because:
- The reason given does not conclusively prove the proposition (IR).
- The causal basis provided for the proposition is weak and not compelling (WCB).

Therefore, the classification of the argument "Jimmy stole Tommy’s lunch in the past. Therefore, it is acceptable for Tommy to steal Jimmy’s lunch today." is **IR** and **WCB**.
