For 
To apply the task IDAA to the given statement "Students never used to have cell phones so they don't need them now," we need to decompose the classification task of IDA into specific steps. Then, we'll classify the statement into one of the defective argument types.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDA (Task D):
1. **Identify the Proposition (\<P\>) and Reason (\<R\>):**
    - **Proposition (\<P\>):** Students don't need cell phones now.
    - **Reason (\<R\>):** Students never used to have cell phones.

2. **Determine if the Reason conclusively supports the Proposition (\<IR\>):**
    - Check if there is a logical connection showing that the historic lack of cell phones means a present-day lack of need.

3. **Identify if the Proposition is a Defective Argument (\<G\>, \<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<RR\>, \<WCB\>, \<FU\>, or \<DEP\>):**
    - **Generalization (\<G\>):** Is the statement making a broad, unsupported assertion?
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>):** Does it fail to consider all relevant possibilities?
    - **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>):** Does the Reason provided fail to conclusively support the Proposition?
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>):** Is the causal basis weak or not compelling?
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>):** Does the Reason merely repeat the Proposition?
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>):** Is it assuming consensus without proof?
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>):** Is there ambiguous or unclear meaning?

### Application of IDA to the Given Statement:
1. **Identify the Proposition (\<P\>) and Reason (\<R\>):**
    - **Proposition (\<P\>):** Students don't need cell phones now.
    - **Reason (\<R\>):** Students never used to have cell phones.

2. **Determine if the Reason conclusively supports the Proposition (\<IR\>):**
    - We need to examine if the fact that students didn't have cell phones in the past logically implies that they don't need them now. This does not conclusively support the proposition because the circumstances, needs, and technologies have changed over time, which could make the argument inconclusive.

3. **Identify the Defective Argument Type:**
    - **Generalization (\<G\>):** The statement is not necessarily generalizing from a small sample to a larger population.
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>):** The statement does not claim to have made a complete enumeration of possibilities.
    - **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>):** The Reason provided does not conclusively support the correctness of the Proposition.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>):** The causal link between the Reason and the Proposition is not compelling.
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>):** The Reason provided does not merely repeat the Proposition.
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>):** The statement does not claim consensus.
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>):** The language used does not appear to be ambiguous.

Given the reasoning, the most suitable classification for the given statement "Students never used to have cell phones so they don't need them now" is **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**.

### Final Result:
The given statement "Students never used to have cell phones so they don't need them now." is classified as **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**.
