For 
To apply the IDAA (the decomposition of IDA) to the string "Running a marathon is very tiring because it is so exhausting," we will take the task IDA of classifying the string as one of the identified defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP) and break it down step by step.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of IDA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - The proposition (P) is the statement or assertion that is intended to be proven.
   - **In this case**: "Running a marathon is very tiring."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - The reason (R) is the causal basis provided to establish the truth of the proposition (P).
   - **In this case**: "because it is so exhausting."

3. **Evaluate the Quality of the Reason (R)**:
   - Determine if the reason given provides a compelling and conclusive basis for the proposition.
   - Also, check if the reason is simply restating the proposition in different words or if it provides new justification.

4. **Classification for Defective Argument (IDA)**:
   - Based on the identified defects (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP), classify the argument.

### Step-by-Step Application to Given String:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - "Running a marathon is very tiring."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - "because it is so exhausting."

3. **Evaluate the Quality of the Reason (R)**:
   - The reason "because it is so exhausting" expresses the same idea as the proposition "Running a marathon is very tiring." It provides no new causal basis or justification beyond restating the same concept in different words.

4. **Classification for Defective Argument (IDA)**:
   - **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: This is a case where the reason (R) appears to be presented as causal, but it merely repeats what was stated in the proposition (P). The reason is not providing new information but just rephrasing the proposition.

### Conclusion:
The string "Running a marathon is very tiring because it is so exhausting." is classified as **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**.
