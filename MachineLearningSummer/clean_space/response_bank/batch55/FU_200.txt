For 
To apply IDAA to the string "Everyone seems to support the changes in the vacation policy, and if everyone likes them, they must be good.", we'll follow a step-by-step decomposition process to classify the argument.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
**<P>:** "The changes in the vacation policy must be good."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
**<R>:** "Everyone seems to support the changes in the vacation policy."

### Step 3: Check for Proof of Reason (<PR>)
**<PR>:** Not explicitly present. The argument seems to rest solely on the claim of universal support without additional corroboration.

### Step 4: Determine if the argument is Defective
We need to classify the argument type using the provided defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>:

1. **Generalization (G):** The argument does not appear to generalize based on a small or biased sample.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument does not present a complete list of possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. This seems relevant.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reason may not provide a strong causal basis. This also seems relevant.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason is not a mere repetition of the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument is based on an assumed universal agreement. This seems very relevant.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language is not notably ambiguous in this context.

### Step 5: Analyze and Classify
Based on the analysis:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason "everyone seems to support" does not necessarily demonstrate that the changes are inherently good.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reason supplied does not provide a compelling causal link to the goodness of the changes.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument assumes that universal agreement ("everyone seems to support") directly implies quality or goodness, which is a presumption subject to debate.

### Conclusion
The defective argument types most applicable to the string "Everyone seems to support the changes in the vacation policy, and if everyone likes them, they must be good." are:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
3. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**

Given the strongest match, we can classify this as an instance of **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.

Thus, the final classification of the string is:

**<FU>**
