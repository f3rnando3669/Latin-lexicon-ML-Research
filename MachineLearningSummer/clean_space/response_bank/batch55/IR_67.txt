To apply the principles of IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument into specific steps) to the given string, we need to break down the process systematically.

Here's the string we are analyzing: 
"Sure, we haven't given raises in over five years to our employees, but we work really hard to make a good product. We try to ensure the best customer service, too."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - Look for the main assertion or claim made in the statement.
   - In this case, the claim is: "we haven't given raises in over five years to our employees."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - Determine the causal basis or reasoning supporting the main claim.
   - The provided reasons are: "we work really hard to make a good product" and "we try to ensure the best customer service."

3. **Assess the Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   - Check if there are additional arguments that support the Reason. 
   - In this context, the statement does not include further arguments but rather relies on the reasons provided.

4. **Classify the Argument**:
   - Using the definitions of defective argument types, determine which category the statement falls into.
   - Evaluate each type to see if it matches the defectiveness of the argument:

   - **Generalization (G)**: The argument doesn't generalize from a part to a whole.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument doesn't make a claim of completeness.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The provided reasons ("work really hard to make a good product" and "ensure the best customer service") do not directly address the issue of not giving raises. They are orthogonal points and do not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition. This seems applicable here.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis doesn't directly address the issue of raises—it is irrelevant or insufficient. This also seems applicable.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reasons are not repeating the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument doesn't appeal to universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language used isn’t ambiguous.

### Conclusion:
The statement "Sure, we haven't given raises in over five years to our employees, but we work really hard to make a good product. We try to ensure the best customer service, too." is defective because the provided reasons are unrelated to—or do not directly support—the main proposition about not giving raises. Therefore, it can be classified under both **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. 

Either classification is valid, but let's choose **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** as the most fitting because the reasons given do not provide sufficient causal support for why raises haven't been given.
