For 
Certainly! To apply the task of decomposing the advanced task (<t>) of identifying the defective argument type (<IDA>) for the statement "Nobody thinks homelessness is a good thing," we will proceed step by step.

### Step 1: Identify Components of <t>
For the task of identifying the defective argument type <IDA>, we need to:
1. Analyze the given string <s> to understand its nature.
2. Match the identified nature against the defined defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Step 2: Analyze the Given String <s>
Analyze the statement "Nobody thinks homelessness is a good thing."
- The statement makes a universal claim.
- The claim involves the consensus or belief of people regarding homelessness.
- There is no explicit Reason (<R>) or Proof of Reason (<PR>) provided.

### Step 3: Match Against Defective Argument Types
- **Generalization (<G>)**: This involves making an assertion about a whole group based on a part or majority. The statement "Nobody thinks..." implies a sweeping generalization about the beliefs of all people.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This involves claiming complete enumeration but missing some possibilities. The statement does not enumerate possibilities or options.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This involves <R> not conclusively demonstrating <P>. The statement lacks any reasoning or causality provided.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This involves a weak causal link. The statement does not present any causal reasoning.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This involves <R> merely repeating <P>. There is no reasoning for the statement to be considered repetitive.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This involves assuming something is certain because it is universally agreed upon. The statement "Nobody thinks homelessness is a good thing" suggests a universal agreement that homelessness is a bad thing.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: This involves ambiguous language that can be taken in another sense. The language in the statement appears straightforward.

### Step 4: Identify the Best Match
Among the defective argument types, "Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)" seems to be the closest fit:
- The statement presumes a universal agreement on the negativity of homelessness without providing evidence.
- It is effectively saying that since "nobody" disagrees, it must be universally accepted as true, even though this consensus is still in dispute.

### Conclusion
The statement "Nobody thinks homelessness is a good thing" falls under the defective argument type **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)** because it assumes a universal agreement on a disputed matter without substantiating evidence.

### Output for <IDAA> Applied to the String <s>
The classification for the string "Nobody thinks homelessness is a good thing" is: **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**.
