### Decomposition of the Task (D)
To classify the given string as one of the defective argument types, we can break down the task into specific steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Determine the main assertion or claim in the string.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Look for any causal basis or supporting statement provided for the Proposition.

3. **Evaluate the Claim (P) and Reason (R) Together:**
   - Determine if there is a Proof of Reason (PR), and if so, examine it.
   - Assess whether the argument falls into one of the defect categories based on the relationship between P, R, and PR.

4. **Classification:**
   - Review the identified parts and their quality to classify the argument as one of the defective argument types.

### Apply IDAA to the String:

#### 1. Identify the Proposition (P):
- The string does not explicitly state a Proposition (P), but implicitly we can assume that the proposition is: "This product is a good source of Vitamin D."

#### 2. Identify the Reason (R):
- The string implicitly suggests a Reason (R) that supports the Proposition by highlighting the health benefit: "The product contains Vitamin D."

#### 3. Evaluate the Claim (P) and Reason (R) Together:
- The latter part of the string mentions: "*doesn't mention the terrible amounts of sugar," pointing out an important factor that was omitted in the Reason.

#### 4. Classification:
- Based on the evaluation, the argument fits under the defective argument type called "Incomplete Enumeration (FE)." This is because the proposition claims a health benefit, but the reason provided is incomplete as it fails to mention an important downside (the high sugar content).

### Conclusion:
The string "Good source of Vitamin D... *doesn't mention the terrible amounts of sugar." is classified as an <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration).
