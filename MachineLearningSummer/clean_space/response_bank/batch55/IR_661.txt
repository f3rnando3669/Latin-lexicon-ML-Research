For 
To apply the decomposition method (IDAA) to classify the argument "Your mom thinks you spend too much time playing video games. You bring up that she spends too much time shopping," we need to follow a structured approach to break down the problem. Here are the specific steps involved:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The Proposition (<P>) is the claim or assertion that we intend to prove. In this case, it is:
- "Your mom thinks you spend too much time playing video games."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The Reason (<R>) is the causal basis provided to establish the truth of the proposition. In this case, it is:
- "She spends too much time shopping."

### Step 3: Identify whether there's a Proof of Reason (<PR>)
The Proof of Reason (<PR>) would be an additional argument used to support the Reason. However, in this case, no additional argument is provided to support the Reason.

### Step 4: Check for Types of Defective Arguments
Now, we check if this argument falls under any of the defective types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

#### Detailed Classification Analysis:
1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The proposition is not based on a specific part or majority but reflects a straightforward concern. Therefore, it does not involve generalization.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: We are not dealing with an enumeration of possibilities. Therefore, it does not fit this type.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason given ("she spends too much time shopping") does not logically address the proposition ("your mom thinks you spend too much time playing video games"). Instead, it diverts attention to another issue. Therefore, it is an inconclusive reason (the causal basis does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition).

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis is weak since shopping habits do not logically relate to the gaming issue. Itâ€™s a form of weak causal basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The Reason does not simply repeat the proposition. Instead, it introduces an unrelated point.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: There is no claim of universal agreement in the Reason provided.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The language use is clear and not ambiguous in another sense.

### Conclusion:
Given the inconclusive nature of the reason provided and its failure to directly address the Proposition, it most closely fits the definition of:
- **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**: Where <R> does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the <P>.

### Final Classification:
Therefore, the argument "Your mom thinks you spend too much time playing video games. You bring up that she spends too much time shopping." should be classified as <IR>.
