For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "The writer, speaker, or an ad supports a claim with restatements of the same claim. (The argument goes around and around in a circle)," we'll follow a structured decomposition process:

### Decomposition of Task <IDA> (Classification of Defective Argument)

1. **Identify the Proposition <P>**: Determine the main claim or proposition being put forth.
2. **Identify the Reason <R>**: Determine the reasoning or argument given to support the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason <PR>**: Determine any additional support given to corroborate the Reason.
4. **Classify the Argument Based on Definitions**:
    - Generalization (<G>)
    - Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
    - Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
    - Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
    - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
    - Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
    - Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)

### Applying the Steps to the Given String

Step 1: **Identify the Proposition <P>**
- The main proposition here is that the argument by the writer, speaker, or ad is defective.

Step 2: **Identify the Reason <R>**
- The reason provided is that the argument supports a claim with restatements of the same claim.

Step 3: **Identify the Proof of Reason <PR>**
- There is no additional proof of reason given explicitly in the string beyond the reason itself.

Step 4: **Classify the Argument Based on Definitions**
- We need to evaluate which type of defective argument the description corresponds to:
    - **Generalization (<G>):** Not applicable, as there is no mention of generalizing based on limited data.
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Not applicable, as there is no enumeration involved.
    - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Not applicable, as the issue isn't about the reason failing to conclusively support the proposition.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Not applicable, since the argument isn't rooted in a weak causal basis.
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This matches because the argument supports a claim by merely restating the same claim, leading to circular reasoning.
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Not applicable, as there is no mention of universal agreement.
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Not applicable, as ambiguity in language is not mentioned.

By analyzing according to these steps, we can classify the string as a defective argument of type **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**.

In conclusion, applying <IDAA> to "The writer, speaker, or an ad supports a claim with restatements of the same claim. (The argument goes around and around in a circle)" results in the classification of the defective argument as **<RR>**.
