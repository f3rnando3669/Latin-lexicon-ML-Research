Certainly! To apply IDAA to classify the statement "You said that because an authority thinks something, it must therefore be true." we'll decompose the task into specific steps and follow each one carefully. Let's proceed step by step:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Summarize what is being asserted.
    - **Proposition (<P>)**: The assertion is that something must be true because an authority thinks it.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the causal basis for the Proposition.
    - **Reason (<R>)**: The causal basis for the Proposition is the belief of an authority.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: See if there's any additional corroborative argument or evidence provided.
    - **Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: In this case, there is no detailed proof provided. The statement is relying solely on the authority's belief.

4. **Check for Defective Argument Types**:
    - **Generalization (<G>)**: Is the assertion based on the action or attribute of a few being applied broadly? 
        - **No**, the statement is not a broad generalization based on limited instances.
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Does it claim to have covered all possibilities but missed some?
        - **No**, the statement doesn't enumerate possibilities.
    - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition?
        - **Partly yes**, the reason relies on authority but does not conclusively prove the truth.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Is the causal basis not compelling enough?
        - **Yes**, authority's belief is not necessarily a compelling reason for the Proposition.
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Is the reason presented the same as the Proposition itself?
        - **No**, the reason (authority's belief) and the Proposition (something is true) are distinct.
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Is the Proof of Reason assumed as certain inappropriately?
        - **No**, the argument doesn't involve a presumed universal agreement.
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Is the Proof of Reason ambiguous or taken in a different sense?
        - **No**, the language does not appear ambiguous.

5. **Determine the Defective Argument Type (<IDA>)**: Based on the checks above, identify the argument type.
    - The primary defective arguments applicable here are:
       - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** because the reason does not conclusively prove the Proposition.
       - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** because an authority saying something is true is not compelling enough to establish its truth definitively.

**Conclusion**: The statement "You said that because an authority thinks something, it must therefore be true." falls under both <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).

By following these steps, we've classified the statement appropriately considering the identified defective arguments.
