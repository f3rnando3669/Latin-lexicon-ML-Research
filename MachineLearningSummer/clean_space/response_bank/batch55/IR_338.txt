For 
Alright, let's apply the decomposition of the task (IDAA) to classify the statement "Of course Marx' theories about the ideal society are bunk. The guy spent all his time in the library." into one of the defective argument types (IDA). We'll break this down into specific steps (D):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - What is the main claim or assertion being made?
   - *In this case, the proposition (P) is*: "Marx' theories about the ideal society are bunk."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - What is the basis or rationale provided to support the proposition?
   - *In this case, the reason (R) is*: "The guy spent all his time in the library."

3. **Evaluate the Reason (R) for Defects**:
   - Now we'll check if the reason provided falls into any of the defective argument types. This involves checking if:
     - The reason is a generalization (G).
     - The reason is an incomplete enumeration (FE).
     - The reason is inconclusive (IR).
     - The reason provides an insufficient causal basis (WCB).
     - The reason is a faulty repetition of the proposition (RR).
     - The reason relies on a presumptuous consensus (FU).
     - The reason uses ambiguous language (DEP).

4. **Classify the Defect**:
   - *Checking each defective argument type against the reason:*
   
   *Generalization (G)*: The assertion about Marx' theories does not appear to be based on a specific or a generalizable part, but it's a different type of claim.
   
   *Incomplete Enumeration (FE)*: This doesn't seem to be an attempt to enumerate possibilities but rather provide a single piece of information.
   
   *Inconclusive Reason (IR)*: The statement "The guy spent all his time in the library" doesn't conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition "Marx' theories about the ideal society are bunk." It's more of an ad hominem attack rather than a logically conclusive reason.
   
   *Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)*: The reason provided doesn't establish a compelling causal connection. Spending time in the library does not inherently disprove someone's theories about society. This could fit under WCB since the causal basis is weak.
   
   *Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)*: The reason does not simply repeat the proposition.
   
   *Presumptuous Consensus (FU)*: The argument isn't making an appeal to a universal agreement so this doesnâ€™t fit.
   
   *Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)*: The language used is not particularly ambiguous in this context.

Based on the evaluation:

5. **Conclusion**:
   The defective argument type (IDA) for the statement: "Of course Marx' theories about the ideal society are bunk. The guy spent all his time in the library." most closely matches **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The reason provided does not offer a strong or compelling causal link to support the proposition. Instead, it undermines the argument by presenting a weak and irrelevant causal basis.
