To apply the advanced task of decomposing the classification of the argument into specific steps (IDAA) for the given string, "My friend said that if you sneeze more than three times, you have the corona virus," we need to follow a structured approach. Let's proceed step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
- **Proposition (P):** "If you sneeze more than three times, you have the corona virus."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
- **Reason (R):** The proposition is based on a statement made by a friend.

### Step 3: Determine if Proof of Reason <PR> is Provided
- **Proof of Reason (PR):** There is no additional argument corroborating the reason provided by the friend.

### Step 4: Evaluate if the Argument is Defective
- To identify the defect in the argument, we need to evaluate the <P>, <R>, and <PR> for any of the specified defective argument types:
  - **Generalization (G):**
    - Is the proposition a generalized statement based on limited observation?
    - Yes, the claim that sneezing more than three times means having the corona virus is a sweeping generalization based on an unverified source.

  - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
    - Is the proposition missing out on possible alternatives?
    - Yes, the argument ignores other possible reasons for sneezing (such as allergies, common cold, etc.), implying it attempts to fully enumerate the reason but fails.

  - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
    - Does the reason conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
    - No, the statement made by the friend is not a conclusive scientific proof.

  - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
    - Is the reason presented for the proposition compelling enough?
    - No, relying on a friend's statement is not a sufficient causal basis.

  - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
    - Is the reason merely a repetition of the proposition?
    - No, the reason is a statement made by a friend, not a repetition of the proposition.

  - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
    - Is the proof of reason assumed certain because "it is universally agreed upon"?
    - No, the argument does not claim universal agreement.

  - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
    - Is there ambiguity in the language that could be misinterpreted?
    - No, the language is clear but unverified.

### Step 5: Final Classification
- Based on the evaluation:
  - The proposition is an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the claim based on a friend's statement does not provide conclusive evidence.
  - The proposition also fits **Generalization (G)** because it makes a broad assertion based on a limited observation.
  - Additionally, it could be **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** because it ignores other possible reasons for sneezing.

**Final Classification:** The argument is of types **<IR>**, **<G>**, and **<FE>**.
