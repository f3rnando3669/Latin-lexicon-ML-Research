Sure, let's decompose the task of classifying the defective argument in the given string step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The Proposition (<P>) is the claim or assertion that the argument is seeking to prove or support.

**Proposition in the given string:**
"We should abolish the death penalty."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The Reason (<R>) provides the causal basis or justification for the Proposition.

**Reason in the given string:**
"Many respected people, such as actor, Chewbacca, have publicly stated their opposition to it."

### Step 3: Check for the Defective Argument Types
Now we will go through each defective argument type one by one to see which one accurately describes the argument presented.

#### <G>: Generalization
- This argument would generalize a situation based on a few instances, suggesting the Proposition applies to all cases based on limited evidence.
- **Not applicable here:** This argument does not make a generalization based on limited evidence.

#### <FE>: Incomplete Enumeration
- This argument claims to have exhausted all possibilities but misses out on some pertinent ones.
- **Not applicable here:** The argument does not enumerate possibilities about the death penalty.

#### <IR>: Inconclusive Reason
- In this argument, the Reason does not conclusively support the Proposition.
- **Applicable here:** The Reason provided (respected people, including Chewbacca, oppose it) does not conclusively support the Proposition that the death penalty should be abolished.

#### <RR>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition
- The Reason merely restates the Proposition without adding new information.
- **Not applicable here:** The Reason does introduce additional information about respected people's opinions.

#### <WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis
- The Reason is weak because it does not provide a compelling causal basis for the Proposition.
- **Not applicable here:** Although the Reason is insufficient, it does attempt to provide a causal basis.

#### <FU>: Presumptuous Consensus
- This argument assumes something is certain because it is supposedly universally agreed upon.
- **Not applicable here:** The argument does not claim universal agreement, just the opinion of respected people.

#### <DEP>: Ambiguous Language Use
- The argument's Proof of Reason could be misinterpreted in another sense than intended.
- **Not applicable here:** There is no significant ambiguity in the language used.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the Reason provided ("Many respected people, such as actor, Chewbacca, have openly stated their opposition to it.") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition ("We should abolish the death penalty").

Therefore, the defective argument type in this case is:

**Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**

This conclusion is reached by recognizing that the Reason fails to provide a strong, conclusive cause to support the Proposition.
