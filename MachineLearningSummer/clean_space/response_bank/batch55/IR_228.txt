Sure, let's apply the decomposition of the task into specific steps (IDAA) to classify the given string as one of the defective argument types (IDA).

The given string is:
"Violent video games are directly related to gun violence in schools and should be banned for teens. The school day should start an hour later."

### Step 1: Break Down the Given String
First, we'll break down the given string into its component parts and analyze them:

1. "Violent video games are directly related to gun violence in schools and should be banned for teens."
2. "The school day should start an hour later."

### Step 2: Identify Propositions and Reasons
Next, we need to identify the propositions (\<P>) and reasons (\<R>) in the string:

1. Proposition 1 (P1): "Violent video games are directly related to gun violence in schools."
2. Proposition 2 (P2): "Violent video games should be banned for teens."
3. Proposition 3 (P3): "The school day should start an hour later."

Reason (\<R>) is inherently assumed but not explicitly stated for P2 and P3. This lack of reason makes it harder to evaluate in full. 

### Step 3: Check for Defective Argument Types

**For Proposition 1 (P1): "Violent video games are directly related to gun violence in schools."**

- **Generalization (G):** This could be a generalization if the argument asserts this relationship based on specific incidents without sufficient data to support it for all contexts.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This does not seem to apply directly as the proposition does not enumerate possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** If the reasoning provided (which is implied but missing) does not conclusively support P1, this could apply.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The Reason is weak because claiming a direct relationship may not account for other causes or contributing factors.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Not applicable here, as there's no repetition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This is not claiming universal agreement; hence, this does not apply.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** "Directly related" might be ambiguous, but it is not explicitly clear enough to determine DEF.

Conclusively, P1 can be identified as **WCB** due to the weak and potentially oversimplified causal basis.

**For Proposition 2 (P2): "Violent video games should be banned for teens."**

- **Generalization (G):** This does not generalize but rather makes a policy recommendation.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This doesn't apply directly as it's a directive, not an enumeration.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This could apply if the reason for banning (implied from P1) does not conclusively support P2.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This applies if the reasoning behind P2 relies on the insufficient causal basis of P1.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Not applicable.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Not claiming universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Not clearly ambiguous.

Conclusively, P2 can also be identified as **IR** due to relying on an inconclusive reason (\<R>).

**For Proposition 3 (P3): "The school day should start an hour later."**

- **Generalization (G):** Not a generalization.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Not an enumeration.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Not discussed; reasoning is entirely missing.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Not based on causal arguments as it's unrelated to previous sentiment.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Detached from the first part of the argument with no repetition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Not applicable.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Not ambiguous.

Conclusively, this proposition doesnâ€™t directly connect or inherently show a defective argument type on its own. It lacks context or supporting reason

### Summary:
- P1 fits \(**WCB**\) due to insufficient causal basis.
- P2 fits \(**IR**\) due to reliance on an inconclusive reason.
- P3 lacks context for classification but doesn't show an inherent argumentative defect.

Conclusively, the overall defective argument types (IDA) identified are **WCB** and **IR**.
