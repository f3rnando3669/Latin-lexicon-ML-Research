Sure, let's apply the decomposition of the task (D) to the task of classifying the string "We should move to the Midwest because the Wall Street Journal says the cost of living is cheaper there." (IDA). Here is the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The Proposition is the statement or claim that we intend to prove.

**P:** "We should move to the Midwest."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The Reason is the causal basis for the Proposition.

**R:** "The Wall Street Journal says the cost of living is cheaper there."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Reason
Assess the strength and relevance of the Reason for supporting the Proposition.

### Step 4: Check for Defective Argument Types
Examine the identified Reason (R) and Proposition (P) using the criteria for defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

- **Generalization (G):** Is the Proposition based on an assertion applicable to some but not all, generalized to all?
  - No, the proposition is specific to the Midwest and doesn't generalize to all regions.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Does the argument claim completeness in listing possibilities while actually missing pertinent ones?
  - No, it doesn't claim to list all possibilities.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does the Reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition?
  - Yes, the mere statement that the Wall Street Journal says the cost of living is cheaper isn't enough to conclusively establish that we should move there. Other factors such as job market, personal preferences, and other living conditions are not considered.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the Reason weak because the causal basis submitted is not compelling?
  - Yes, relying solely on one source without further verification or consideration of individual circumstances could be deemed insufficient.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Does the Reason simply repeat the Proposition in a different form?
  - No, the Reason is providing new information (though potentially weak) rather than simply restating the Proposition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Does the argument assume something is universally agreed upon when it is still in dispute?
  - No, it references a specific source rather than claiming universal agreement.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Can the Reason or Proof be taken in another sense than intended?
  - No, the language is fairly clear and specific.

### Step 5: Classify the Defective Argument Type
Based on the evaluation:

- **Most likely defect type for the argument:** **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)** and **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**

The conclusion that the cost of living is cheaper, as suggested by one publication, doesn’t provide a comprehensive or compelling basis to decide on moving to the Midwest. The Reason provided is weak because it doesn’t convincingly establish the Proposition by considering all necessary factors or providing compelling evidence.

### Final Classification

**Classification of <s>:** **IR (Inconclusive Reason)** and **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**

By following this step-by-step method, we determine that the argument primarily suffers from providing an insufficient causal basis and inconclusive reasoning to support the proposition.
