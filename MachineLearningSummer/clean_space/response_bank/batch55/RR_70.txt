For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument <IDA> into specific steps) to the given string "This has to work so it will work," let's break it down into clear steps:

### Step 1: Understand the String
First, we need to understand the string "This has to work so it will work." This is a statement that seems to argue that a certain outcome (it will work) is inevitable because it is necessary (has to work).

### Step 2: Identify the Type of Argument
Next, examine the nature of the argument:
- **Proposition (<P>)**: This has to work.
- **Reason (<R>)**: So it will work.

### Step 3: Evaluate the Reason
We need to evaluate whether the reason provided genuinely supports the proposition, or if it fits into a defective argument category.

### Step 4: Compare with Defective Argument Types
Compare the structure and reasoning in the string to the defined defective argument types:

- **<G> Generalization**: This argument does not appear to generalize from one part to a whole.
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: There is no enumeration of possibilities here.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: Let's consider this. Does the reason "so it will work" conclusively demonstrate "This has to work"?
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: Does the reason "so it will work" provide a compelling causal basis?
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: This seems likely. "This has to work" and "so it will work" are essentially the same statement.
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: There's no appeal to consensus in the string.
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: The language does not appear to be ambiguous.

### Step 5: Classify the Argument
After comparing, it seems the argument fits **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition** best, because the reason provided simply restates the proposition without adding new information or a compelling causal basis.

### Step 6: Conclusion
Thus, applying <IDAA> to the string "This has to work so it will work" results in classifying it as **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**.
