For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task IDA into specific steps) to classify the argument "Adultery, as well as philandering, is wrong. Therefore, we have no biological tendency for multiple sex partners." as one of the defective argument types, we will proceed step by step as follows:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P) and the Reason (R)
First, we'll identify the key components within the argument:

**Proposition (P):** "We have no biological tendency for multiple sex partners."
   - This is the statement that the argument intends to prove.

**Reason (R):** "Adultery, as well as philandering, is wrong."
   - This is the causal basis that supports the Proposition.

### Step 2: Check for Defective Argument Types
Next, we'll examine the argument to classify it as one of the defective argument types:

#### Generalization (G)
- **Does the argument assert something about all people based on a limited observation?** 
  - No, the argument does not seem to fall into this category.

#### Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
- **Is the argument based on an incomplete listing of possibilities?**
  - No, this doesn't seem to apply here either; the argument isn't about listing possibilities.

#### Inconclusive Reason (IR)
- **Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?**
  - Potentially. The wrongness of adultery and philandering is a moral or ethical judgment and does not necessarily disprove a biological tendency. This points to a lack of conclusive support.

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
- **Is the causal basis weak or not compelling?**
  - Yes, the moral statement does not provide a scientifically compelling basis for the biological claim.

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
- **Does the reason say the same as the proposition?**
  - No, the Reason and the Proposition are different statements.

#### Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
- **Is the argument assuming something is universally agreed upon, which is still in dispute?**
  - The argument does not specifically claim universal agreement.

#### Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)
- **Can the Proof of Reason be taken in another sense than intended?**
  - This does not seem to be an issue.

### Step 3: Classify the Argument
Having evaluated the potential defective argument types, it seems we have identified two probable issues:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided (adultery and philandering being wrong) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (that there is no biological tendency for multiple sex partners) because it is an ethical assertion rather than scientific evidence.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis (moral judgment) for the proposition is weak and not compelling in relation to the biological claim being made.

### Conclusion
Based on the steps and the evaluation, the argument "Adultery, as well as philandering, is wrong. Therefore, we have no biological tendency for multiple sex partners." can be classified as having defects of type **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
