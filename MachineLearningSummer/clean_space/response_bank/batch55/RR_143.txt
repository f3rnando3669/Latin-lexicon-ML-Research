For 
To apply the process of IDAA (Decomposition followed by Application) to the task of classifying the argument "You must obey the law, because it’s illegal to break the law," we should first decompose the task (D) into specific steps and then use those steps to classify the argument as one of the defective types defined earlier.

### Decomposition (D) of the Task (IDA):
1. **Identify the parts of the argument:**
   - Proposition (P)
   - Reason (R)
   - Proof of Reason (PR) if present

2. **Examine the Reason (R):**
   - Determine if it sufficiently supports the Proposition (P).
   - Check for any fallacies or weaknesses (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP).

3. **Classify the argument based on identified defects:**
   - Match the specific defect to the argument given.

### Application of Decomposition (IDAA) to "You must obey the law, because it’s illegal to break the law":

1. **Identify the parts of the argument:**
   - Proposition (P): "You must obey the law."
   - Reason (R): "Because it’s illegal to break the law."

2. **Examine the Reason (R):**
   - Does the Reason (R) sufficiently support the Proposition (P)?
     - The Reason (R) essentially says, "You must obey the law because disobeying the law is illegal," which rephrases the Proposition (P) in another way without providing new information or a compelling basis.

3. **Classify the argument based on identified defects:**
   - The Reason (R) here does not provide a new or additional basis for the Proposition (P). Instead, it merely repeats the Proposition (P) in different words.
   - This is indicative of a **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**, where the Reason (R) restates the Proposition (P) without adding substantive proof or explanation.

### Conclusion:
The argument "You must obey the law, because it’s illegal to break the law" is classified as a **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**.
