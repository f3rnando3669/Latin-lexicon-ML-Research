For 
To apply the defined process of IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of identifying defective arguments) to the statement "I wore my lucky red shirt when I took the test, so that is probably why I did so well on the test," we first need to break down the task IDA into specific steps.

Let's proceed step by step:

### Step 1: Identify and Extract the Components of the Argument
- **Proposition (<P>)**: "I did so well on the test."
- **Reason (<R>)**: "I wore my lucky red shirt when I took the test."
- **Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Not explicitly present in the statement, but the implicit argument suggests correlation as proof, without additional evidence.

### Step 2: Determine Defective Argument Types
- **Generalization (<G>)**: Check if the argument applies a general rule based on limited evidence. 
  - The argument does not generalize to other situations or people; it is specific to this one instance.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Consider if the argument claims to cover all possibilities but misses some.
  - The argument does not claim to enumerate all factors contributing to test performance.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Determine if the reason fails to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
  - The causal link between wearing the red shirt and test performance is not solidly established, suggesting <IR>.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Evaluate if the causal basis is not compelling.
  - The reason given (wearing a lucky shirt) is weak as it lacks substantial evidence, implying <WCB>.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Check if the reason merely repeats the proposition.
  - The reason does not simply restate the proposition; it offers a separate, though weak, basis.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Assess if the proof of reason relies on presumed universal agreement.
  - There is no assumption of universal agreement explicitly stated or implied.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Determine if the proof of reason could be interpreted differently than intended.
  - There is no apparent ambiguous language used in the reason.

### Step 3: Classify the Argument
Based on the analysis, the argument appears to have the characteristics of both <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis). The reason provided (wearing a lucky red shirt) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (doing well on the test), and the causal basis is not compelling.

### Conclusion
The statement "I wore my lucky red shirt when I took the test, so that is probably why I did so well on the test" can be classified as:
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: The reason provided does not conclusively support the proposition.
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The causal basis for the proposition is weak and not compelling.

Thus, applying IDAA to the given statement results in the identification of multiple defective argument types: <IR> and <WCB>.
