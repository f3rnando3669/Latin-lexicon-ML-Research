To apply IDAA, or the step-by-step application of task decomposition to the classification of the defective argument, let’s break down the process into specific identifiable steps:

### Decomposition of <IDA> into Specific Steps
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine what is intended to be proven.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the causal basis for <P>.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Examine any corroborating additional arguments for the Reason.
4. **Evaluate the Defective Argument Types**: Check if the argument falls into any of the defective argument categories: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

### Apply IDAA to the Given Argument
Given Argument: "Because the last words spoken by either the pilot or co-pilot were "Good night, Malaysia Three-Seven-Zero," the pilot fell asleep and accidentally crashed the plane into the ocean."

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
**Proposition (<P>):** The pilot fell asleep and accidentally crashed the plane into the ocean.

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
**Reason (<R>):** The last words spoken by either the pilot or co-pilot were "Good night, Malaysia Three-Seven-Zero."

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
In this argument, there does not appear to be any additional argument or corroboration presented, so there does not seem to be a <PR>.

#### Step 4: Evaluate the Defective Argument Types
Now, let’s check if the given argument falls into any of the defective argument categories.

- **Generalization (<G>):** This doesn't seem to be a generalization. There’s no assertion based on a part or majority being applied to all.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument does not involve a false claim of complete enumeration of possibilities.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Here, the reason "the last words were 'Good night, Malaysia Three-Seven-Zero'" does not necessarily imply that the pilot fell asleep. The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The reason that the last words were "Good night" is weak and does not provide a compelling causal basis for the proposition that the pilot fell asleep and crashed the plane.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason is not simply repeating the proposition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The argument does not assume any consensus or universal agreement.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** There does not appear to be ambiguous language in the argument that can be taken in another sense.

Based on the evaluation, the argument most closely fits into:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis submitted for the proposition is not compelling.

### Conclusion
The argument "Because the last words spoken by either the pilot or co-pilot were 'Good night, Malaysia Three-Seven-Zero,' the pilot fell asleep and accidentally crashed the plane into the ocean" can be classified as both **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
