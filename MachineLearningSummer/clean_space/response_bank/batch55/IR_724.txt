For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types into specific steps) to the given statement "Why worry about taking attendance when there are so many starving children in the world?", we need to break down the process into manageable steps. We'll start by analyzing the statement and then methodically consider each defective argument type to determine which one best classifies the statement.

### Decomposition of the Classification Task (<D> for <IDA>):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Parse the statement to identify what is being asserted or questioned.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine the causal basis provided in the statement to support the proposition.

3. **Evaluate the Argument:**
   - Analyze the proposition and the reason to determine if they fit any of the defective argument types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

4. **Match against Defective Argument Types:**
   - Assess the proposition and the reason against the definitions of the defective argument types to classify the argument.

### Step-by-Step Application of <IDAA>:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**

The statement suggests not to worry about taking attendance because there is a larger, more significant issue at hand ("starving children in the world"). 

**Proposition (<P>):** "Why worry about taking attendance?"

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**

The reason given for not worrying about taking attendance is that there are many starving children in the world.

**Reason (<R>):** "There are so many starving children in the world."

**Step 3: Evaluate the Argument**

Now we need to evaluate the connection between the proposition and the reason to determine if it fits any of the defective argument types.

**Step 4: Match against Defective Argument Types**

1. **Generalization (<G>):** 
   - The statement does not generalize a proposition from specific instances to a whole group.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The statement doesn't claim a complete enumeration of possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The reason provided (starving children) does not directly address the relevance or importance of attendance. It introduces an unrelated issue, thus failing to conclusively demonstrate why attendance should not be worried about.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - The reason does not repeat the proposition.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The causal basis (starving children) is not compelling or directly relevant to the necessity of taking attendance. It introduces a separate issue, making the reason insufficient to support the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - No universal agreement is assumed in the reasoning process.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - The statement does not seem to rely on ambiguous language.

From the steps above, the most fitting classification is that the statement suffers from **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, as the provided reason does not directly support the proposition and introduces an irrelevant topic.

Thus, the classification by applying <IDAA> to "Why worry about taking attendance when there are so many starving children in the world?" would be:

**Result:** **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** and **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
