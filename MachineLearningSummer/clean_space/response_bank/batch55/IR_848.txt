For 
To apply \( <IDAA> \) to the string "The art teacher spoke in the trial as a witness in support of testing perfumes on animals, and he persuaded me," we need to follow a series of steps to decompose and classify the argument according to the defective argument types \( <G> \), \( <FE> \), \( <IR> \), \( <RR> \), \( <WCB> \), \( <FU> \), and \( <DEP> \).

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (\( <D> \)) Applied to \( <IDA> \)
1. **Identify the Proposition \( <P> \):**
   - Proposition \( <P> \): "The art teacher spoke in the trial as a witness in support of testing perfumes on animals, and he persuaded me."

2. **Identify the Reason \( <R> \):**
   - Reason \( <R> \): The reason can be inferred as something like, "The art teacher's credibility or arguments were convincing."

3. **Identify if there is a Proof of Reason \( <PR> \):**
   - \( <PR> \): There doesn't appear to be a clear \( <PR> \) provided in this sentence.

4. **Classify the Argument Type \( <IDA> \):**
   - Evaluate if the argument falls into any of the defective argument categories.

### Analysis of Defective Argument Types

- **\( <G> \) (Generalization):**
  - The statement does not claim applicability to a general class based on insufficient evidence from a part or majority.

- **\( <FE> \) (Incomplete Enumeration):**
  - The statement does not claim complete enumeration of possibilities.

- **\( <IR> \) (Inconclusive Reason):**
  - The reason provided ("he persuaded me") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition regarding the ethical support of testing perfumes on animals.

- **\( <RR> \) (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):**
  - The reason provided appears to be more of a personal sentiment ("he persuaded me") rather than a repetition of the proposition.

- **\( <WCB> \) (Insufficient Causal Basis):**
  - The causal basis (the art teacher persuaded me) is weak as it relies on authority without demonstrating strong evidence or logical support for testing on animals.

- **\( <FU> \) (Presumptuous Consensus):**
  - There is no indication of universal agreement presumed in this argument.

- **\( <DEP> \) (Ambiguous Language Use):**
  - The language is not ambiguous; it is clear and direct.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the statement falls under two defective argument types:

1. **\( <IR> \)** (Inconclusive Reason): The reason ("he persuaded me") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
2. **\( <WCB> \)** (Insufficient Causal Basis): The causal basis for supporting the proposition (the art teacher persuaded me) is not sufficiently compelling.

The classification under \( <IDA> \) for the string "The art teacher spoke in the trial as a witness in support of testing perfumes on animals, and he persuaded me" would be \( <IR> \) and \( <WCB> \).
