For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "Argues that because something is popular, it must be right," we need to decompose the task of classifying this argument into specific steps and then follow those steps to identify the type of defective argument.

First, let's define the steps in <D> for <IDA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Determine the main assertion being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Determine the rationale or basis given to support the proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Check if there is any evidence or argument provided to support the reason.
4. **Classify the Argument:** Based on the identified components, classify the defective argument type according to the defined categories (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>).

Now, let's apply these steps to "Argues that because something is popular, it must be right."

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition is the main assertion being made.
- Proposition (<P>): "Something (a belief, idea, etc.) must be right."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason sets forth the causal basis for the proposition.
- Reason (<R>): "Because something is popular."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- There is no additional proof given. The reason "something is popular" is assumed to be sufficient evidence for the proposition.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
Now we classify the argument based on the defective argument types:

1. **<G> Generalization:** The argument is not necessarily a generalization.
2. **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:** The argument does not enumerate possibilities.
3. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** The reason given (popularity) is not a conclusive demonstration of correctness.
4. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** Popularity is a weak causal basis for the proposition's truth.
5. **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** The reason is not saying exactly the same thing as the proposition.
6. **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** It assumes that the popularity (consensus) is equivalent to correctness, but could be reasonable for consideration.
7. **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:** There is no ambiguity in the language used.

Based on this evaluation, the defective argument primarily fits the categories of:

- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The reason, popularity, does not conclusively establish the truth of the proposition.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: The causal link between popularity and correctness is weak.

Thus, applying <IDAA> to "Argues that because something is popular, it must be right" primarily classifies it as:

- <IR> Inconclusive Reason
- <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis
