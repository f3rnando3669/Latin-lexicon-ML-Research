For 
To apply the procedure <IDAA> (the decomposition of <IDA> into specific steps) to classify the given string "U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn says that lesbianism is rampant in the Oklahoma schools. This must, indeed, be true, because surely the senator couldn't be mistaken about the schools in his own state," we'll systematically decompose the task of classifying the argument as one of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

Here’s the step-by-step decomposition and the application:

1. **Identify and define the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Define what the argument intends to prove.
   - Proposition (<P>): "Lesbianism is rampant in the Oklahoma schools."

2. **Identify and define the Reason (<R>):**
   - Establish the causal basis for the Proposition.
   - Reason (<R>): "Surely the senator couldn't be mistaken about the schools in his own state."

3. **Evaluate the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine if <R> conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the <P>.
   - Reason R Analysis: The reason given relies on the senator's authority and knowledge about his own state, assuming infallibility.

4. **Check for defective argument types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** The argument does not make a generalization based on an inadequately small sample.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument does not claim to have enumerated all possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** 
     - Assess whether the reason conclusively demonstrates the proposition.
     - In this case, the Reason (<R>) is inconclusive as it relies on the authority figure’s credibility rather than concrete evidence.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** 
     - Assess if the reason is weak or lacking in compelling causal basis.
     - The reason given does not provide a compelling causal basis; it relies on presumed infallibility.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason does not merely repeat the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The argument does not rely on it being universally agreed upon.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** There is no ambiguity in the language use; the argument is clear in its terms.

5. **Identify the defective argument type:**
   - Given the steps, the argument primarily fits into the category of **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, as the reason provided does not conclusively establish the truth of the proposition but places undue reliance on the senator's authority.
   - Furthermore, it might also fall under **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**, considering the weakness of the causal basis that relies solely on the senator's presumed infallibility.

**Final Classification:**
- The given string "U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn says that lesbianism is rampant in the Oklahoma schools. This must, indeed, be true, because surely the senator couldn't be mistaken about the schools in his own state." is classified as both **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** due to the lack of compelling evidence and over-reliance on the authority's infallibility.
