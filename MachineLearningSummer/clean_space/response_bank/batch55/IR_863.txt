To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the classification task into specific steps) to the given argument, we should break down the process of identifying the type of defective argument used. Here are the steps to follow for decomposing and classifying the argument:

### Step 1: Identify the Propositional Structure
- **Speaker 1's Proposition (\<P\>):** "No fault divorce is really harmful to the family and the larger society."
- **Speaker 2's Counter (\<s\>):** "Well, you must not really think that since you’re divorced yourself."

### Step 2: Analyze Speaker 2’s Response
- **Is Speaker 2's Response Relevant to the Proposition?**
  - Examine if Speaker 2's response is addressing the content and reasoning presented by Speaker 1 or if it diverts into another direction.

### Step 3: Determine if the Response Provides a Valid Reason or Proof
- **Speaker 2's Reasoning (\<R\>):** "You must not really think that since you’re divorced yourself."
  - Does this provide any causal basis or reasoning that challenges the original proposition's validity?

### Step 4: Check for Defective Argument Types
1. **Generalization (\<G\>):** Does Speaker 2’s response generalize a particular instance to discredit the proposition?
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>):** Does it list options but miss out on key possibilities?
3. **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>):** Does the reason provided fail to conclusively address the truth of the original proposition?
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>):** Is the reasoning provided by Speaker 2 weak and not compelling?
5. **Faulty Repetition (\<RR\>):** Does it simply restate the proposition without adding new reasoning?
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>):** Does it assume agreement without providing substantiation?
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>):** Is ambiguous language used in a misleading way?

### Step 5: Apply the Types to the Argument
- **Analysis of Speaker 2’s Response:** Speaker 2 does not directly address the harmfulness of "no fault divorce" which is the original proposition. Instead, they attack Speaker 1's personal circumstance (being divorced) as a reason to invalidate Speaker 1’s stance.

### Classification:
The argument made by Speaker 2 can be identified as involving **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)** and **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**:
- **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>):** The implicit presumption that Speaker 1 must not mean what they say because they are divorced, on the false notion that their personal circumstances determine their stance.
- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>):** The reasoning ("since you're divorced yourself") does not conclusively address or refute the actual proposition about the harmfulness of no fault divorce.

### Conclusion:
By following the IDAA steps, we have determined that Speaker 2's response contains elements of Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>) and Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>), as the response fails to provide a direct, conclusive rebuttal to Speaker 1's proposition, and instead makes an irrelevant associative argument based on personal status.
