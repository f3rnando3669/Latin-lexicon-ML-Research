To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument type into specific steps) to the given statement "My grandmother smoked for 80 years and died at 100. Obviously, smoking isn’t harmful," follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
First, we need to identify the proposition in the statement which the argument is intending to prove.

**Proposition (P):** "Smoking isn’t harmful."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
Next, we identify the causal basis for the proposition that establishes the truth of the claim.

**Reason (R):** "My grandmother smoked for 80 years and died at 100."

### Step 3: Identify the Type of Defective Argument
Now we need to classify the argument as one of the defective argument types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

From the given argument, observe that the reason provided is based on an individual case (the grandmother who smoked for 80 years and died at age 100) to make a broad assertion about smoking in general. This suggests the argument is extending the result from a single case to apply it universally.

The defective argument type that best fits this description is:

**Defective Argument Type (G) - Generalization:**
This argument type involves making a claim based on a single example or a small sample size and erroneously generalizing it to apply to all cases.

### Conclusion
Therefore, the given statement "My grandmother smoked for 80 years and died at 100. Obviously, smoking isn’t harmful," is classified as a defective argument of type:

**<G> (Generalization)**

This concludes the application of IDAA to the statement.
