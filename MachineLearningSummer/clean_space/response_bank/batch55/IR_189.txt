For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task into specific steps) to the statement "We will teach this miserable traitor (Snowball) that he cannot undo our work so easily," we'll proceed as follows:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for IDAA

1. **Identify the proposition (<P>) in the statement:**
   - The proposition appears to be: "We will teach this miserable traitor (Snowball) that he cannot undo our work so easily."

2. **Determine if there is a Reason (<R>) provided:**
   - The statement does not explicitly provide a reason. It is more of a declaration or threat rather than a supported argument. 

3. **Evaluate if a Proof of Reason (<PR>) is provided:**
   - Since no explicit reason (<R>) was provided, there is no proof of reason (<PR>) present in the statement.

4. **Classify the statement according to the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>):**

Let's carefully examine the statement to see which defective argument type it fits:
   
- **Generalization (<G>):** 
  - The statement does not seem to make a generalization based on one or a majority of individuals. It is directed at a specific individual, Snowball.
   
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
  - There is no claim of having exhausted all possibilities present in this statement. Hence, <FE> does not apply.
   
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
  - Since the statement does not provide a reason, it's not a case of <IR>.
   
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
  - Again, without an explicit reason to evaluate, <WCB> is not applicable here.
   
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
  - The statement does not repeat its proposition in a faulty manner.
   
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
  - The statement does not assume consensus or agreement on the proposition for it being in dispute.
   
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
  - The statement could be seen as ambiguous. It mentions "work" but does not specify what work Snowball was attempting to undo. The phrase "teach this miserable traitor" might be unclear in its exact meaning.

Given the above evaluations, the closest fit for the defective argument type could be **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)** due to the vagueness of "our work" and "teach this miserable traitor." However, it's important to note that this case is more about an emotional assertion rather than a structured argument attempting to persuade based on reason.

To summarize:

**String <s>:** "We will teach this miserable traitor (Snowball) that he cannot undo our work so easily."
**Classified Argument Type:** <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use) due to the vague and unclear terms used in the statement.
