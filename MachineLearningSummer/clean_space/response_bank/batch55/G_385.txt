For 
Let's apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task IDA into specific steps) to classify the argument "I saw a student texting in my class yesterday; all my students must be texting, so cell phones should be banned."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDA into Specific Steps (D):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Determine the proposition or assertion the argument is making.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Determine the causal basis or reason provided to support the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - Find any additional argument or proof that corroborates the reason.

4. **Check for Defective Argument Types:**
   - Determine whether the argument falls under any of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, or DEP).

5. **Classify the Argument:**
   - Based on the identification of defective types, classify the argument accordingly.

### Applying IDA to the Given Argument:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - "All my students must be texting, so cell phones should be banned."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - "I saw a student texting in my class yesterday."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - In this argument, there doesn't seem to be an additional argument or evidence provided to corroborate the reason.

4. **Check for Defective Argument Types:**

   - **Generalization (G):**
     - The argument makes a general assertion about all students based on observing one student.
     - **Type:** <G>

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
     - Does not apply, since the argument does not claim to enumerate possibilities.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
     - The reason does not conclusively demonstrate that all students are texting.
     - **Type:** <IR>

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
     - The causal basis for banning phones (one student texting) is weak for such a sweeping policy.
     - **Type:** <WCB>

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
     - Not applicable, since the reason is not a repetition of the proposition.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
     - Not applicable, as the argument is not assuming universal agreement.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
     - Not applicable, as there is no ambiguity in the language.

5. **Classify the Argument:**
   - Based on the above identifications, the argument can be classified as a combination of Generalization <G>, Inconclusive Reason <IR>, and Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>.

### Conclusion:
The argument "I saw a student texting in my class yesterday; all my students must be texting, so cell phones should be banned" can be classified as containing multiple defective types: **<G>**, **<IR>**, and **<WCB>**.
