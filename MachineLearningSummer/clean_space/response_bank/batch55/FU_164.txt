For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "You should listen to Ellie Goulding because everyone is listening to her music," we need to classify this statement as one of the defective argument types defined earlier. Let's break down this task step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), and Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - **<P>:** The proposition is the main statement or claim being made. In this case, it is "You should listen to Ellie Goulding."
   - **<R>:** The reason given to support the proposition is "because everyone is listening to her music."

2. **Analyze the Reason (<R>):**
   - Evaluate whether the Reason conclusively supports the Proposition.
   - Determine whether the Reason involves any of the defects described.

3. **Classify the Reason (<R>) based on the defective argument types (<IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>):**
   - **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** Does the Reason conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition? In this case, saying "everyone is listening to her music" does not conclusively demonstrate why an individual should also listen to it.
   - **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** Is the Reason just a repetition of the Proposition using different words? No, it is not.
   - **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** Does the Reason provide a weak causal basis for the Proposition? Arguably, yes. Just because everyone is listening to her music does not necessarily provide a strong or compelling reason for the individual to do so.
   - **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):** Is the Reason assuming correctness based on universal agreement? Yes, it is based on the idea that "everyone is listening to her music," which assumes that just because it is a consensus, it is correct.
   - **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):** Does the Reason use ambiguous language? No, it is quite clear.

4. **Determine the most fitting defective argument type:**
   - The Reason assumes that the action of "listening to Ellie Goulding" is justified simply because it is universally agreed upon or commonly practiced by others. This fits the description of <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus). The argument hinges on the assertion that something is valid because it's widely accepted or done by others.

**Conclusion:**
The string "You should listen to Ellie Goulding because everyone is listening to her music" can be classified as <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).
