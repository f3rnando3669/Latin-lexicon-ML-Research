For 
To apply the IDAA to "Marie notices that many of her friends have started eating a low-carb diet and drinking protein shakes. Marie decides that this must be the healthy way to eat, so she joins them." we will decompose the task of classifying the string into specific steps.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDA (Task: Classifying the String)

1. **Extract the Proposition (P)**:
   - Identify the main proposition or assertion being made.
   
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - Determine the causal basis or reasoning presented to support the proposition.
  
3. **Determine the Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   - Check if there is any corroboration or evidence provided to support the reason.
   
4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**:
   - Analyze the provided proposition, reason, and proof (if any) to classify the argument as one of the defective types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Applying the Steps to the Given String

1. **Extract the Proposition (P)**
   - **P**: "This [low-carb diet and drinking protein shakes] must be the healthy way to eat."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**
   - **R**: "Marie notices that many of her friends have started eating a low-carb diet and drinking protein shakes."

3. **Determine the Proof of Reason (PR)**
   - There is no additional proof or corroborating evidence provided in the string. The reason is purely based on observation.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**
   - Analyze the logical structure:
     - Marie assumes the diet is healthy based on the behavior of her friends.
     - There is no explicit proof or data supporting the health benefits of the diet provided.
   
   - Given that the proposition "This must be the healthy way to eat" is based on her friends' behavior and not on comprehensive evidence:
     - This can be classified as **Generalization (G)** because Marie is making an overall assertion based on her observations of a limited group of people (her friends). This generalization implies a universal claim ("this must be the healthy way to eat") without evidentiary support that it is true for all cases or a broader context. 

### Conclusion
The given argument can be classified as *Generalization (G)* because the proposition is an assertion made based on a partial or limited observation, and it implies an application to a wider context without comprehensive evidence.
