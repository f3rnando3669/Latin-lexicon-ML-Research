For 
To classify the given string "Yesterday you were 5 minutes late, today 10, and tomorrow you won't even show up!" using the task <IDA>, we need to break down the advanced task <t> into specific steps. Here are the steps to follow for <IDAA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Determine what the statement is trying to assert or prove.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Evaluate the causal basis or rationale provided for the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Check for any supporting evidence or arguments that bolster the reason.
4. **Evaluate Defective Argument Types:** Compare the identified argument against each defective argument type (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) to see if it matches any of them.

Let's apply each step to the given string:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The string is making an assertion about future behavior based on past behavior.
- **Proposition (<P>):** "Tomorrow you won't even show up!"

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason given for the proposition is based on a pattern observed over the past few days.
- **Reason (<R>):** "Yesterday you were 5 minutes late, today 10."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
There is no explicit additional proof provided in this string beyond the mentioned pattern of past behavior.
- **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Not explicitly stated beyond the observed pattern.

### Step 4: Evaluate Defective Argument Types

- **Generalization (<G>):**
  - Does the statement generalize from a limited number of instances? Yes. The conclusion about not showing up tomorrow is based on just two instances of being late.
  - This matches the definition of ***Generalization*** where <P> is an assertion based on some part or majority, but not necessarily applicable to all.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
  - Does the statement claim to have complete enumeration? No, it doesn't explicitly state that it has all possibilities considered, just an observed pattern.
  
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
  - Does the reason provided conclusively demonstrate <P>? No, because being late does not conclusively lead to not showing up at all.
  - This characteristic is also present in this case since <R> does not conclusively demonstrate <P>.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
  - Is the reason simply a restatement of the proposition? No, the reasons given are instances of being late, not the same as the proposition.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
  - The claim has a weak causal basis; an increasing trend in being late does not necessarily mean the person will not show up.
  - This matches the definition of ***Insufficient Causal Basis***.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
  - Is there an assumption of consensus? No such assumption is made in the statement.
  
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
  - Is the language used ambiguous? The language is quite direct and doesn't seem to have multiple interpretations.
  
### Classification

Given the analysis, the string "Yesterday you were 5 minutes late, today 10, and tomorrow you won't even show up!" can be classified as a combination of:

1. **Generalization (<G>)** - making an assertion based on a limited sample of past behavior.
2. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** - the reason does not conclusively lead to the proposition.
3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** - a weak causal link between being late and not showing up.

Thus, it principally falls under the categories of **Generalization (G)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** as it encompasses aspects of all three defective argument types.
