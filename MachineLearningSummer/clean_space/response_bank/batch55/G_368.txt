For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types) to the statement "She has always associated with shady people, so she must not be trustworthy," we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Proposition (<P>): "She must not be trustworthy."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Reason (<R>): "She has always associated with shady people."

3. **Analyze the Causal Basis for the Proposition**:
   - We need to check if the Reason (<R>) convincingly supports the Proposition (<P>).

### Step-by-Step Analysis to Identify Defective Argument Type

1. **Check for Generalization (<G>)**:
   - Does the Proposition (<P>) make a broad assertion that isn't universally applicable?
   - In this case, the assertion is quite specific to one individual and doesn't generalize to all people who associate with shady characters, so it doesn't fit <G>.

2. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - Does the Proposition (<P>) claim to have considered all possibilities but miss some pertinent ones?
   - This example doesn't enumerate possibilities or claim to consider all relevant factors explicitly, so it doesn’t fit <FE>.

3. **Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - Does the Reason (<R>) fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition (<P>)?
   - This statement seems vulnerable here; the association with shady people does not conclusively demonstrate untrustworthiness—it may be suggestive but not conclusive. We'll keep <IR> as a potential category but will continue with the other checks.

4. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - Is the Reason (<R>) provided a weak causal basis for the Proposition (<P>)?
   - "Association with shady people" provides a weak causal basis for concluding untrustworthiness because it assumes a correlation between association and character without more concrete evidence. So, <WCB> fits this argument.

5. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - Does the Reason (<R>) merely restate the Proposition (<P>) in different terms?
   - This isn't the case here; the Reason is different from the Proposition.

6. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - Is the Proof of Reason (<PR>) assumed as certain based on a disputed consensus?
   - This statement does not reference any universal agreement or consensus, so it does not fit <FU>.

7. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
   - Could the Proof of Reason (<PR>) be taken in another sense than intended by the speaker?
   - The language in this statement is not particularly ambiguous; the meanings are clear, making <DEP> not applicable.

### Conclusion

After a thorough analysis of the statement against the defective argument types, we can conclude that the most fitting classification is:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The Reason (<R>) that she has always associated with shady people is a weak causal basis for concluding the Proposition (<P>) that she must not be trustworthy.
