For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a given string as a type of defective argument to specific steps) to the statement "Green Peace's strategies aren't effective because they are all dirty, lazy hippies," we will break down the process into clear steps to discern the type of defective argument presented.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition \(\mathbf{<P>}\)
- The proposition (\(\mathbf{<P>}\)) is the main assertion or claim in the statement.
- In this case: "Green Peace's strategies aren't effective."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason \(\mathbf{<R>}\)
- The Reason (\(\mathbf{<R>}\)) is the causal basis for the Proposition.
- In this case: "because they are all dirty, lazy hippies."

### Step 3: Analyze the Reason \(\mathbf{<R>}\)
- Determine whether the Reason (\(\mathbf{<R>}\)) is logically valid and appropriate for supporting the Proposition (\(\mathbf{<P>}\)).
- Here, the Reason attacks the character of the individuals involved ("they are all dirty, lazy hippies") instead of providing a logical basis for the effectiveness of Green Peace's strategies.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument
- Review the types of defective arguments to identify which category applies to the given statement.

1. **Generalization (\(G\))**: Asserts something based on one part or a majority, but not necessarily applicable to all.
   - Unlikely, as the focus is not on generalizing something specific to the entirety but making a broad derogatory statement.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\(FE\))**: Claims complete enumeration of possibilities but misses some.
   - Not applicable; there's no enumeration of possibilities here.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (\(IR\))**: Reason does not conclusively demonstrate correctness of Proposition.
   - The reason given ("they are all dirty, lazy hippies") does not provide a conclusive demonstration of why the strategies are ineffective.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(WCB\))**: Causal basis submitted is not compelling.
   - The causal basis in the argument is an ad hominem attack, which is not a compelling or valid causal basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(RR\))**: Reason repeats the Proposition in a different form.
   - Not applicable; the reason is not a repetition but an unrelated personal attack.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\(FU\))**: Proof assumed as certain, claiming it is universally agreed upon.
   - Not applicable; no claim of universal agreement is made.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\(DEP\))**: Proof taken in another sense than intended.
   - Not applicable; the language is derogatory but not particularly ambiguous in intention.

### Step 5: Conclusion
- Based on the analysis, the primary classification is that the argument exhibits an **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(WCB\))** because the reason given is a personal attack rather than a logical, compelling reason for the proposition.
- Additionally, it could be seen as an **Inconclusive Reason (\(IR\))** because the reason given does not effectively support the proposition at all.

### Final Classification
The given string "Green Peace's strategies aren't effective because they are all dirty, lazy hippies" can primarily be classified under **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(WCB\))** and secondarily seen as **Inconclusive Reason (\(IR\))**.
