To apply IDAA to the classification task of "My friend said her Math class was hard, and the one I’m in is hard, too. All Math classes must be hard!" let's decompose the task of classification (IDA) into specific steps (D). Here’s the step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
Identify the main assertion or statement that is being made.
- Proposition (<P>): "All Math classes must be hard!"

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Identify the reasoning provided to support the Proposition.
- Reason (<R>): "My friend said her Math class was hard, and the one I’m in is hard, too."

### Step 3: Classify the Type of Defective Argument
Determine which type of defective argument (if any) the reasoning represents based on the definitions provided.

### Step 4: Compare the Argument to the Defective Types
Compare the identified Proposition and Reason to the definitions of the defective argument types:
- **Generalization (<G>)**: Assertion based on some one part or a majority, but not necessarily applicable to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Claiming complete enumeration but actually missing pertinent possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Weak causal basis for the Proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Reason repeats what is said in the Proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Assuming Proof of Reason based on universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Proof of Reason taken in another sense than intended.

### Step 5: Determine the Best Fit
Analyze the argument to find the most fitting defective argument type:

- The Reason provided ("My friend said her Math class was hard, and the one I’m in is hard, too.") offers specific instances rather than a comprehensive analysis of all Math classes.
- The Proposition ("All Math classes must be hard!") makes a general statement based on these few instances without accounting for all possible Math classes.
- This matches the definition of **Generalization (<G>)**, which occurs when an assertion based on some one part or a majority, but not necessarily applicable to all, is referred to all.

### Conclusion
- The defective argument type <s> = "My friend said her Math class was hard, and the one I’m in is hard, too. All Math classes must be hard!" is best classified as **Generalization (<G>)**.

Thus, applying IDAA to "My friend said her Math class was hard, and the one I’m in is hard, too. All Math classes must be hard!" results in the classification of the argument type as **Generalization (<G>)**.
