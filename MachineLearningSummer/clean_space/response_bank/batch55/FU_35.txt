For 
To apply \(<IDAA>\) to the given string ", if everyone else is doing something, it must be right/good," we will first break down the advanced task \(<IDA>\) into specific steps, and then apply these steps to classify the string according to the defective argument types defined. Here are the steps \(<D>\):

1. **Identify the Proposition (\(P\)) from the string.**
2. **Identify the Reason (\(R\)) underpinning the Proposition (\(P\)).**
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\(PR\)) if it exists in the string.**
4. **Evaluate the argument based on the definition of each defective type (\(G\), \(FE\), \(IR\), \(RR\), \(WCB\), \(FU\), and \(DEP\)) to classify the argument.**

Let's apply each step to the string ", if everyone else is doing something, it must be right/good."

### Step-by-Step Application:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\(P\)).**

The Proposition (\(P\)) is what we are attempting to prove. In the string:
- \(P\): "It must be right/good."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (\(R\)).**

The Reason (\(R\)) sets forth the causal basis for \(P\):
- \(R\): "If everyone else is doing something."

**Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (\(PR\)).**

Identify any additional supports or proofs offered for the reason:
- In this string, no additional proof or detailed argumentation appears to be provided for the reason. So, \(PR\) is absent or not explicitly given.

**Step 4: Evaluate the argument based on the defective argument types.**

1. **Generalization (\(G\)):** 
   - This type involves making a broad assertion based on limited examples. This does not apply here directly; the argument does not generalize individual examples to a whole.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\(FE\)):**
   - Occurs when the argument falsely claims to account for all possibilities. This type does not apply here either, as the argument doesn't enumerate possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (\(IR\)):**
   - This suggests that \(R\) does not conclusively prove \(P\). The given reason "if everyone else is doing something" does not conclusively prove that it is "right/good." This seems relevant as \(R\) is assumed without solid proof.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(WCB\)):**
   - This applies when \(R\) provides a weak causal basis for \(P\). There is a weak basis to claim that a majority action is inherently right/good just because it is prevalent.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(RR\)):**
   - This involves \(R\) merely restating \(P\). That's not the case here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\(FU\)):**
   - Applies when \(PR\) is assumed certain due to alleged consensus. There is a presumption that the act being good/right is because everyone does it, appealing to a false or fallacious consensus. This fits well with the type.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\(DEP\)):**
   - This involves ambiguity in \(PR\). The language isnâ€™t particularly ambiguous in another sense in this context.

### Classification:
The string ", if everyone else is doing something, it must be right/good," primarily exhibits the defective argument type **Presumptuous Consensus (\(FU\))**. It relies on a presumed universal agreement that does not necessarily validate the truth of the proposition. Thus, the correct classification is \(FU\).
