For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given statement, we need to perform the decomposition <D> of the <IDA> task into specific steps, as follows:

### Step 1: Identify the components of the argument
The given text will likely contain a <P>, <R>, and <PR>. We need to break down the argument and identify these parts.

### Step 2: Analyze each component for defects
Using the classifications provided, we'll check each identified component to see if it falls into any of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step 3: Classify the defects found
Once we have identified potential defects in each component, we'll classify them according to the provided definitions.

Now, let's apply these steps to the argument in the text:

#### Step 1: Identify the components of the argument
- <P> (Proposition): "We can’t freeze the academic year because then students won’t graduate on time."
- <R> (Reason): "Then students won’t graduate on time."
- <PR> (Proof of Reason): 
  - "Next thing you know most people will be unemployed and will resort to crime."
  - "The crime rate will skyrocket and society will collapse."

#### Step 2: Analyze each component for defects
1. **<P> Analysis:** "We can’t freeze the academic year because then students won’t graduate on time."
   - This is straightforward and acts as the main claim.

2. **<R> Analysis:** "Then students won’t graduate on time."
   - The reason is given for the proposition. This doesn’t seem to have a defect on the surface but let’s check in context.

3. **<PR> Analysis:** 
   - "Next thing you know most people will be unemployed and will resort to crime."
   - "The crime rate will skyrocket and society will collapse."

#### Step 3: Classify the defects found
1. **<P> Classification:** No immediate defect identifiable based on the definitions.
2. **<R> Classification:** 
   - The reason itself does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition about societal collapse. So it might suffer from <IR> Inconclusive Reason if evaluated in detail. However, the more pressing issues seem to lie in the <PR>.
3. **<PR> Classification:**
   - "Next thing you know most people will be unemployed and will resort to crime." 
     - This appears to assume an inevitable sequence of events without sufficient evidence, potentially falling under <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis.
   - "The crime rate will skyrocket and society will collapse."
     - This continues the chain of severe consequences without adequate causal justification, also suggesting <WCB>.

We should also consider if the overall argument assumes a universally agreed-upon outcome without providing proof, classifying it under <FU> Presumptuous Consensus.

**Final Classification:**
- The <R> and <PR> combination seems primarily to indicate <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis), as the asserted outcomes (unemployment leading to crime, then skyrocketing crime rate, then societal collapse) are not compellingly established causally. 

Thus, the statement's argument is classified as having the defective type <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
