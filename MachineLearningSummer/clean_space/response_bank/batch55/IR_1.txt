For 
To apply the procedure defined by <IDAA> to the given string, we would follow a step-by-step decomposition to identify the defective argument type. Here is the decomposition and the application on the given string:

Step 1: Understand the given string:
"World-renowned physicist Dr. Patricia Mitchell assures me that exposure to natural sunlight, even exposure resulting in mild sunburn, is still significantly less of a cancer risk than brief exposure to the artificial light in a tanning bed. So I make sure to tell all of my friends that if they’re looking to get a tan this summer they should do it outdoors, and not at the tanning salon!"

Step 2: Identify the Proposition <P>:
Proposition <P>: "Exposure to natural sunlight, even resulting in mild sunburn, is significantly less of a cancer risk than brief exposure to the artificial light in a tanning bed."

Step 3: Identify the Reason <R>:
Reason <R>: "World-renowned physicist Dr. Patricia Mitchell assures me."

Step 4: Identify if there is a Proof of Reason <PR>:
Proof of Reason <PR>: There is no additional argument or evidence provided to support Dr. Patricia Mitchell’s assurance apart from the appeal to her authority.

Step 5: Determine if the <P> or <R> present any characteristics of defective argument types:
- Check for Generalization <G>: The <P> does not apply a limited observation to a broader group than warranted.
- Check for Incomplete Enumeration <FE>: The <P> does not claim complete enumeration of all possibilities.
- Check for Inconclusive Reason <IR>: The <R> does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the <P> since it relies solely on an appeal to authority.
- Check for Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>: The <R> may not provide a compelling causal basis for <P>, relying entirely on authority without evidence.
- Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>: <R> does not merely restate <P>.
- Check for Presumptuous Consensus <FU>: <PR> does attempt to invoke universal agreement but authority, which is not necessarily consensus.
- Check for Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>: There is no significant ambiguity in the linguistic usage in <PR>.

Step 6: Verify the presence of multiple defect types and select the most fitting one:
- The most fitting defective argument type appears to be Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>, as the causal basis provided (the assurance by Dr. Patricia Mitchell) is weak without further evidence or reasoning. Additionally, Inconclusive Reason <IR> is also a fit because the reason provided does not conclusively establish the truth of the proposition.

Conclusion based on steps:
The argument fits the definitions of both <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) and <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), with <WCB> being a stronger fit as the causal connection provided is not adequately compelling and relies on authority without supporting evidence.

Therefore, the given string can be classified primarily as type <WCB> with possibilities of <IR> as well.
