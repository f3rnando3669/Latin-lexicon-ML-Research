For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to the given string "Dean, the company you work for just filed for bankruptcy! How can I trust you with our money?", we will follow a systematic decomposition \( \text{D} \) of the task \( \text{IDA} \) into specific steps. Here is the step-by-step process:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
    - The statement or assertion that needs to be analyzed is: "How can I trust you with our money?"

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
    - The reason given for the proposition is: "the company you work for just filed for bankruptcy."

3. **Determine if the Reason (<R>) sufficiently supports the Proposition (<P>)**:
    - Evaluate whether the fact that "the company you work for just filed for bankruptcy" provides a compelling, conclusive reason to question trust in managing money.

4. **Classify the defective argument type**:
    - Based on analysis, classify the argument as one of the defective argument types:
      - \( G \) (Generalization)
      - \( FE \) (Incomplete Enumeration)
      - \( IR \) (Inconclusive Reason)
      - \( WCB \) (Insufficient Causal Basis)
      - \( RR \) (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)
      - \( FU \) (Presumptuous Consensus)
      - \( DEP \) (Ambiguous Language Use)

Let’s break this down:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)

- **Proposition (<P>)**: "How can I trust you with our money?"

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)

- **Reason (<R>)**: "the company you work for just filed for bankruptcy."

### Step 3: Determine if the Reason (<R>) sufficiently supports the Proposition (<P>)

- Analyzing whether the company's bankruptcy provides a strong cause to question Dean’s trustworthiness with money:
  - The fact that the company filed for bankruptcy does not directly correlate to Dean’s personal financial reliability or professional integrity.
  - There are numerous factors that can lead to a company filing for bankruptcy that might have nothing to do with Dean's abilities or trustworthiness.

### Step 4: Classify the defective argument type

After evaluation, the argument appears to assume that Dean’s trustworthiness with money is directly linked to his company's financial state. This reasoning does not conclusively demonstrate Dean’s personal untrustworthiness with money, making it an **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**. The reason provided does not sufficiently or conclusively support the proposition because it does not consider the individual circumstances and attributes of Dean separately from the company he works for.

- **Classification**: <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)

In conclusion, applying \( \text{IDAA} \) to "Dean, the company you work for just filed for bankruptcy! How can I trust you with our money?" results in the classification of the argument as \( \text{<IR>} \) (Inconclusive Reason).
