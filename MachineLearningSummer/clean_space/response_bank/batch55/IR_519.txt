For 
To apply the decomposition of a task, \( <D> \), to the task of identifying defective arguments, \( <IDA> \), known as \( <IDAA> \), we'll break down the process into specific steps. We'll analyze the given argument to identify which, if any, of the defective argument types it fits (\( <G> \), \( <FE> \), \( <IR> \), \( <RR> \), \( <WCB> \), \( <FU> \), or \( <DEP> \)).

Here is the argument we need to analyze:
```
"In a study designed by a famous academic to test the effects of pleasant imagery on motivation, employees were shown images of baby animals and beautiful nature scenes for their first five minutes at work.

Amazingly, results showed a 10 percent leap in profits in the first quarter and record earnings over the course of a year. So, showing employees pleasant images is a great way to increase their motivation and improve productivity."
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( <P> \))**:
   - **Proposition (\( <P> \))**: Showing employees pleasant images is a great way to increase their motivation and improve productivity.

2. **Identify the Reason (\( <R> \))**:
   - **Reason (\( <R> \))**: Results showed a 10 percent leap in profits in the first quarter and record earnings over the course of a year after employees were shown images of baby animals and beautiful nature scenes.

3. **Attempt to Identify the Proof of Reason (\( <PR> \))**:
   - **Proof of Reason (\( <PR> \))**: The study designed by a famous academic indicates that this causal relationship exists.

4. **Check for Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (\( <G> \))**: Is the assertion based on one part or a majority, but not necessarily applicable to all?
     - No, the argument does not seem to generalize from a single instance or a majority improperly.
  
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (\( <FE> \))**: Is the Proposition based on a supposedly complete list of possibilities that is actually incomplete?
     - No, the argument does not claim to have enumerated all possible ways of improving productivity and motivation.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (\( <IR> \))**: Does the Reason fail to demonstrably show the correctness of the Proposition?
     - Yes, the argument might represent an Inconclusive Reason since the leap in profits could be due to numerous other factors besides showing pleasant images. Therefore, causation is not conclusively established.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( <WCB> \))**: Is the Reason for the Proposition weakly established?
     - Yes, similar to \( <IR> \), the Reason provided (leap in profits) may not be compelling enough to establish a causal link, making it an Insufficient Causal Basis.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( <RR> \))**: Does the Reason just repeat the Proposition in different words?
     - No, the Reason does not merely repeat the Proposition.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (\( <FU> \))**: Is the Proof of Reason assumed based on "universal agreement" rather than evidence?
     - No, the Proof of Reason is based on a study, even though it has other flaws.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (\( <DEP> \))**: Could the Proof of Reason be interpreted in a different way than intended by the speaker?
     - No, the language used in \( <PR> \) does not seem particularly ambiguous.

### Conclusion:
The argument "In a study designed by a famous academic to test the effects of pleasant imagery on motivation, employees were shown images of baby animals and beautiful nature scenes for their first five minutes at work. Amazingly, results showed a 10 percent leap in profits in the first quarter and record earnings over the course of a year. So, showing employees pleasant images is a great way to increase their motivation and improve productivity" most directly falls under the defective argument types:
- **Inconclusive Reason (\( <IR> \))**: The Reason (\( <R> \)) does not conclusively show that the increase in productivity is due to showing pleasant images rather than other factors.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( <WCB> \))**: The Reason (\( <R> \)) provides a weak causal basis. 

Thus, the argument is classified as containing elements of both \( <IR> \) and \( <WCB> \).
