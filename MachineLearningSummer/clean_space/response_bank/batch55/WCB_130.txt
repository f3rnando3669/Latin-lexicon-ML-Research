For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "Children who play violent video games act more violently than those who don’t," we need to decompose the task of classifying the argument type into specific steps. Here is the structured decomposition:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
- Proposition (P): Identify the main assertion or claim in the statement.

### Step 2: Check for Generalization <G>
- Generalization (G): Determine if the assertion is based on some members or a majority but is applied to all. We need to verify if the statement is overgeneralizing based on some cases.

### Step 3: Check for Incomplete Enumeration <FE>
- Incomplete Enumeration (FE): Verify if the claim suggests a complete enumeration of possibilities but misses some pertinent ones.

### Step 4: Check for Inconclusive Reason <IR>
- Inconclusive Reason (IR): Assess if any provided reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.

### Step 5: Check for Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>
- Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB): Examine whether the causal basis for the proposition is weak and not compelling.

### Step 6: Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR): Ensure the reason isn’t just repeating the proposition in slightly different terms.

### Step 7: Check for Presumptuous Consensus <FU>
- Presumptuous Consensus (FU): Determine if a proof of reason assumes consensus without evidence, stating "it is universally agreed upon."

### Step 8: Check for Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>
- Ambiguous Language Use (DEP): Check if the statement or proof of reason is ambiguous or can be interpreted in multiple ways.

Now let's apply these steps to the argument provided:

### Step 1:
- Proposition (P): "Children who play violent video games act more violently than those who don’t."

### Step 2:
- Generalization (G): This assertion seems to generalize the behavior of all children based on playing violent video games. Since it applies the behavior universally to all children who play violent games, it is likely a Generalization.

### Step 3:
- Incomplete Enumeration (FE): The proposition does not enumerate all possible factors influencing violent behavior, such as environment, upbringing, etc. Hence, it could be an Incomplete Enumeration.

### Step 4:
- Inconclusive Reason (IR): No explicit reason is provided within the statement, making it harder to evaluate this directly from the string alone.

### Step 5:
- Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB): No causal basis is presented directly within the string. Thus, evaluating this would require additional justification outside of the string.

### Step 6:
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR): No reason is provided to fudge with, so this type cannot be directly applied.

### Step 7:
- Presumptuous Consensus (FU): The statement doesn't claim universal agreement, thus not making it a Presumptuous Consensus.

### Step 8:
- Ambiguous Language Use (DEP): The proposition is fairly straightforward without ambiguous terms, so it doesn't seem to fall under Ambiguous Language Use.

Given the analysis, the primary classification for the argument type is:
- **Generalization (G)**: The argument asserts a behavior for children based on part of a population but applies it to all, which is a characteristic of overgeneralization.

Secondary classification could be:
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The proposition does not consider all other potential causes or influences on violent behavior.

Therefore, the type of defective argument for the given string "Children who play violent video games act more violently than those who don’t" would primarily be classified under **Generalization (G)** and secondarily potentially under **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**.
