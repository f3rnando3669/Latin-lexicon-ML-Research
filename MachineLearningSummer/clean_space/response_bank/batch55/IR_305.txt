For 
To apply the task of classifying the argument "Joseph can’t be class president, he’s poor!" into one of the defective argument types, let's break down the process step by step. This breakdown will help ensure clarity and allow us to systematically identify the most suitable classification. We will follow the defined steps for decomposition (<D>) and then apply them to <IDA>.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D> for <IDA>):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Determine what is being asserted or intended to be proved.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Determine the causal basis or rationale provided for the proposition.
3. **Analyze the Argument's Flow:** Examine how the reason supports the proposition.
4. **Compare to Defective Argument Types:** Match the identified components to the definitions of defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).
5. **Classification:** Determine which defective argument type best fits the given string.

### Step-by-Step Application of <IDAA> to "Joseph can’t be class president, he’s poor!”

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** 
   - Proposition: "Joseph can’t be class president."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason: "He’s poor."

3. **Analyze the Argument's Flow:**
   - The argument suggests that Joseph's financial status (being poor) is the reason he cannot be class president. The connection between poverty and the inability to be class president needs to be scrutinized for logical consistency and completeness.

4. **Compare to Defective Argument Types:**
   - **<G> Generalization:** Is the argument based on a generalization that may not apply to all cases?
        - Not applicable. The argument does not generalize from a subset to a whole but rather makes a direct statement about Joseph.
   - **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:** Does the argument fail to consider all possibilities?
        - Not directly. This argument is not about a failing in enumeration.
   - **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** Does the reason provided fail to conclusively support the proposition?
        - Relevant. The link between being poor and not being able to be class president is not conclusively demonstrated.
   - **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** Is the reason provided weak or not compelling as a causal basis for the proposition?
        - Highly relevant. The reason is weak because being poor does not necessarily preclude someone from being class president.
   - **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** Does the reason simply restate the proposition?
        - Not applicable. The reason is not a restatement.
   - **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** Is the proof assumed universally agreed upon when it is not?
        - Not applicable here as there is no appeal to universal agreement.
   - **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:** Is the reason ambiguous in a way that misleads?
        - Not directly relevant. The language in the argument is clear.

5. **Classification:**
   - The argument "Joseph can’t be class president, he’s poor!" best fits the category of **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**. The reason provided (poverty) is not a compelling or sufficient cause to support the proposition that Joseph cannot be class president.

In summary, upon decomposing the task and analyzing the argument step-by-step, we classify the given argument as **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**.
