For 
To apply the decomposition <IDAA> to the task of classifying the given string into one of the defective argument types, we need to break this task into specific steps. Here's how we can do this step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Proposition <P>
Identify the assertion that is being put forward.

**Proposition Identification:**
"People are turning to God everywhere!"

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
Determine the causal basis for the Proposition.

**Reason Identification:**
"9 out of 10 people I interviewed said that they had a personal relationship with Jesus Christ."

### Step 3: Examine the Context for Proof of Reason <PR>
Evaluate where and how the Reason was corroborated.

Pastor Pete indicates the context:
"Where did you find these people you interviewed?"
"In my church."

### Step 4: Analyze Whether the Argument is Defective
Match the identified parts of the argument against the definitions of defective arguments to identify which one it might belong to.

**Defective Argument Analysis:**

- **Generalization (<G>):** The assertion is generalized from a specific group ("9 out of 10 people") to "everywhere".
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** There's no claim of a complete enumeration.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason does not conclusively demonstrate "everywhere".
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The Reason might not have a compelling causal basis due to the sample bias (interviews only at the church).
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The Reason closely mirrors the Proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** There's no reference to a universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** There's no indication of ambiguous language.

### Step 5: Conclusion and Classification
Based on the above analyses, determine the most fitting defective argument type.

**Final Classification:**

- **Generalization (<G>):** This seems applicable because Pastor Pete is generalizing the experience of his church members to "people everywhere".
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** There's a potential sample bias as interviews were conducted within the church.

**Most Appropriate Classification:**
<**G**> (Generalization) - Pastor Pete is generalizing the situation within his church to everyone, making the broad claim that "People are turning to God everywhere" based on a biased, small sample.

### Result
The argument can be classified as a defective argument type <**G**>.

Applying <IDAA> step-by-step to the given string leads us to classify it as a Generalization (<G>).
