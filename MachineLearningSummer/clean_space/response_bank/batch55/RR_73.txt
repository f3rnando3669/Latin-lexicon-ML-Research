For 
To apply the process of IDAA to the given string "President Reagan was a great communicator because he had the gift of talking effectively to the people," let's follow the step-by-step decomposition of the task (D) to classify the string into one of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

### Decomposition of Task (D):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine the main assertion being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Determine the causal basis presented to support the proposition.
3. **Analyze the Reason (R)** for defects: Determine if the reason presented is weak or faulty.
4. **Match with Defective Argument Types**: Compare the identified defect against the predefined defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

### Step-by-Step Application of IDAA:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**
- Proposition (P): "President Reagan was a great communicator."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)**
- Reason (R): "Because he had the gift of talking effectively to the people."

**Step 3: Analyze the Reason (R) for defects**
- The reason given is that Reagan was a great communicator because he had the gift of talking effectively to the people. This reason appears to be merely restating the proposition in different words without providing additional causal basis or evidence to support the claim.

**Step 4: Match with Defective Argument Types**
- The reason (R) does not provide new information or a compelling causal basis to substantiate the proposition (P). It effectively repeats the proposition with slightly different wording.

### Classification:
- This is a case of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**, where the reason (R) is weak because it merely repeats the proposition (P) using different words without adding substantive argument or evidence.

### Conclusion:
The string "President Reagan was a great communicator because he had the gift of talking effectively to the people" is classified under defective argument type **<RR>** (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
