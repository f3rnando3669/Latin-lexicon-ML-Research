Sure! Let's break down the process step-by-step according to the definition of IDAA (the decomposition of the IDA task into specific steps) to classify the statement: "We shouldn’t even bother to interview that job applicant. He has a beard."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**
   - The statement sets forth summarily what is intended to be proven.
   - In this case, the proposition (P) is: "We shouldn’t even bother to interview that job applicant."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**
   - The statement provides a reason for the proposition, which sets forth the causal basis for establishing its truth.
   - In this case, the reason (R) is: "He has a beard."

3. **Classify Based on Known Defective Argument Types**
   - Now we compare the identified proposition and reason against the definitions of defective argument types:
     - **Generalization (G)**: Assertion based on some part or majority and applied to all.
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Claiming a complete enumeration of possibilities but missing some.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Reason does not conclusively demonstrate correctness.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Reason is weak as the causal basis is not compelling.
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Reason says the same as the proposition.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Proof assumed as certain based on presumed universal agreement.
     - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Argument can be taken in another sense than intended.

### Application of Classification:
- Let's analyze the reason given: "He has a beard."
- The proposition is rejecting an interview based solely on the applicant having a beard.

Using our classifications:
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This fits because the reason given ("he has a beard") is a weak and uncompelling causal basis to justify the proposition ("We shouldn’t even bother to interview that job applicant."). There is no strong, logical connection between having a beard and not being suitable for an interview.

Therefore, applying IDAA to the statement "We shouldn’t even bother to interview that job applicant. He has a beard," the statement is best classified as <WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis.
