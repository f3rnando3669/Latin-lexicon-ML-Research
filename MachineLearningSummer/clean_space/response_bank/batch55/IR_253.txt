For 
Let's apply the methodology for IDAA to classify the argument type of the given string. We will decompose this task (IDA) into specific steps.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
Examine the string to locate the primary assertion or claim that it sets forth. 

**Given string:** "The level of mercury in seafood may be unsafe, but what will fishers do to support their families?"

**Identified Proposition (P):** The level of mercury in seafood may be unsafe.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
Determine if the string provides a causal basis for the proposition.

**Reason (R):** There is no causal basis provided directly linking the proposition to the conclusion. Instead, there is a distraction by raising an unrelated issue.

### Step 3: Identify Possible Defects
Analyze the string to match it with the defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G):** No assertion about applying to all based on some part of a set.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** No enumeration claim is made here.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** There is no conclusive reason provided to support P. The argument shifts the focus rather than providing a conclusive reason.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Not applicable because there is no causal basis provided to judge its sufficiency.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** R does not repeat P; it diverges from the topic.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** No consensus is assumed.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Language "unsafe" is clear; not applicable.

### Step 4: Classification Conclusion
Based on the analysis in Step 3, the argument type that fits best is Inconclusive Reason (IR) because the reason provided ("what will fishers do to support their families?") does not support the proposition ("The level of mercury in seafood may be unsafe.") and instead introduces an irrelevant concern.

**Classified as:** <IR>

So, the string "The level of mercury in seafood may be unsafe, but what will fishers do to support their families?" is classified as <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
