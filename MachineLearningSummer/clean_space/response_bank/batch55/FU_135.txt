For 
To apply the process of <IDAA> (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a defective argument), we need to systematically break down the task into specific steps and then classify the given string. Below are the steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition <D> Applied to <IDA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine what the given argument is trying to assert or prove.

2. **Parse the Reason (<R>):**
   - Identify the reason provided to support the proposition.

3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Check if there is any additional corroboration provided for the reason.

4. **Determine Defective Argument Types:**
   - Check if the argument fits into any of the defective argument categories: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

Now, let's apply these steps to the given string:

**String: "Everyone is wearing the new skinny jeans from American Eagle. Are you?"**

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition can be inferred as: "You should be wearing the new skinny jeans from American Eagle."

### Step 2: Parse the Reason (<R>)
The reason given is implied in the first sentence: "Everyone is wearing the new skinny jeans from American Eagle."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
There is no additional corroboration provided for the reason other than the claim that "everyone" is wearing them.

### Step 4: Determine Defective Argument Types

- **Generalization (<G>):** The proposition ("You should be wearing the new skinny jeans from American Eagle") is based on the claim that "everyone" is wearing them, which is a generalization. This generalization is not necessarily applicable to all, making it a more specific instance of a hasty generalization.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** There is no enumeration of possibilities in the argument. Rather, it relies on a sweeping generalization.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason ("Everyone is wearing the new skinny jeans from American Eagle") does not conclusively demonstrate why you should follow the trend. The assumption that everyone is doing something is not a conclusive reason for an individual to act likewise.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The reason provided for the proposition is weak. The mere fact that "everyone" is doing something does not present a compelling causal basis for "you" to do it as well.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** There is no faulty repetition here where the reason would simply restate the proposition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The reasoning implies that there is a consensus ("everyone is wearing it"), appealing to the idea that since it's universally agreed upon, you should too. This falls under seeking presumptuous consensus for something which might still be in dispute (not everyone might actually be wearing them).

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The phrase "everyone" can be ambiguous, but the argument doesnâ€™t hinge on an ambiguous meaning in a crucial way.

Given the analysis, the argument can be classified under multiple defective argument types. However, the most prominent issues are related to:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: Because it applies a general statement to suggest an action for all.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Because it assumes universal agreement to drive the action. 

### Conclusion:
The given string "Everyone is wearing the new skinny jeans from American Eagle. Are you?" can best be classified under defective argument types **Generalization (<G>)** and **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**.
