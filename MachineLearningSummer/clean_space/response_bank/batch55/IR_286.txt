To apply the advanced task of decomposing and classifying the given argument as a defective argument type, we will follow these specific steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
    - Summarize what the argument intends to prove or assert.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine the causal basis or reasoning supporting the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Look for any corroborating evidence or arguments supporting the Reason.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument (<IDA>):**
   - Compare the argument components against the definitions of defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) to classify the defect in the argument.

Let's apply these steps to the argument: "My friend told me to quit singing in the car since I have a 'bad voice.' She sings in the car all of the time!"

### Application of Steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
    - The assertion being made here is: "I should quit singing in the car."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
    - The reason given is: "I have a 'bad voice.'"

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
    - The argument doesn't provide additional evidence or arguments to directly corroborate the "bad voice" claim, but it does mention that the friend also sings in the car, implying a contrast or inconsistency.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument (<IDA>):**
    - Let's analyze against the defective arguments:

       - **Generalization (<G>):** Not applicable. The argument doesn't generalize from a small sample to a broad conclusion.
       - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Not applicable. The argument isn't making an enumeration of possibilities.
       - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This is possible as declaring a "bad voice" does not conclusively support why one should quit singing in the car.
       - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The reason is also weak because "having a bad voice" might be subjective and not a strong enough causal basis.
       - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Not applicable. The Reason is not a repetition of the Proposition.
       - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Not applicable. It doesn’t rely on universal agreement.
       - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Not directly applicable here either, as there doesn’t seem to be ambiguous language in use.

Given the analysis, the argument shows a weak causal basis because the reason provided ("bad voice") isn't compelling or sufficient to justify the assertion made (quitting singing in the car). Thus, the best classification for this argument would be:

**<WCB> - Insufficient Causal Basis.**
