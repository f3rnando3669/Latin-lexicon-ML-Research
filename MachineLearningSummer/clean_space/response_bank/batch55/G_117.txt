For 
Let's apply the process of decomposing the task of classifying "All Muslims are terrorists" into specific steps (defined as <IDAA>).

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>) of <IDA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine the main assertion being made in the string.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Look for any given causal basis that supports the Proposition.
3. **Assess Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Check for any additional arguments provided to support the Reason.
4. **Classify the Defects**: Determine the defect(s) based on the definitions provided (e.g., <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>).
   - Determine if it's an overgeneralization (<G>).
   - Check if the enumeration is incomplete (<FE>).
   - Assess if the Reason is inconclusive (<IR>).
   - Evaluate if the Reason has insufficient causal basis (<WCB>).
   - See if the Reason is just a repetition of the Proposition (<RR>).
   - Determine if there's a presumptuous consensus (<FU>).
   - Identify any ambiguous language use (<DEP>).
5. **Classify the Argument Type**: Assign one or more defective argument types to the string based on the assessment.

### Applying <IDAA> to "All Muslims are terrorists":

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: The main assertion here is "All Muslims are terrorists."
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: The string does not provide a Reason explicitly, so we might assume it relies on an implied general observation or stereotype without a specific causal basis.

3. **Assess Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: There is no additional argument provided to support the Reason.

4. **Classify the Defects**:
   - **Overgeneralization (<G>)**: The statement "All Muslims are terrorists" is a sweeping assertion made about the entire group of Muslims based on an assumption, implying that from observing some individuals (or hearing about a few cases) the trait is applied to the whole group. This fits the defect of a Generalization.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement does not enumerate all possibilities, it dismisses the large majority of Muslims who are not terrorists.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Since there is no Reason provided, we can infer that any implied reasoning would be inconclusive in demonstrating such a sweeping claim.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Without a concrete Reason, any implied basis is inherently weak.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Not applicable here as the string does not repeat its Proposition as a Reason.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Not applicable since it doesnâ€™t cite a presumed universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Not strongly applicable either as the language itself is quite direct and unambiguous in its assertion.

In conclusion, the string "All Muslims are terrorists" is an example of a defective argument of type <G> (Generalization), <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration), <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis). The primary classification would be under <G> as it is an overgeneralization.

### Final Output:
"All Muslims are terrorists" is an example of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, and <WCB> with the primary classification being <G>.
