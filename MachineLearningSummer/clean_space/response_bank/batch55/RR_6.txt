For 
To apply \( <IDAA> \) (the decomposition and step-by-step approach) to \( <IDA> \) (the task of classifying the argument string) with the given argument "You should drive on the right side of the road because that is what the law says, and the law is the law," let's decompose and analyze each part systematically.

1. **Identify the Proposition (\(<P>\))**: Determine what is being asserted or what we intend to prove.
   
   Proposition (\(<P>\)): "You should drive on the right side of the road."

2. **Identify the Reason (\(<R>\))**: Determine the reason provided to support the proposition.
   
   Reason (\(<R>\)): "That is what the law says."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\(<PR>\))**: Determine any additional arguments provided to corroborate the reason.

   Proof of Reason (\(<PR>\)): "The law is the law."

4. **Evaluate the Argument**: According to the definitions of defective argument types, identify any defects in the argument based on the relationship between \( <P> \), \( <R> \), and \( <PR> \).

   - Check for \( <RR> \) (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):
     - This defect occurs when the reason (\(<R>\)) is essentially a repetition of the proposition (\(<P>\)) in different words, without providing additional support or information.
     - Analysis:
       - \( <P> \): "You should drive on the right side of the road."
       - \( <R> \): "That is what the law says."
       - \( <PR>\): "The law is the law."
       - The reason (\(<R>\)) and the proof of the reason (\(<PR>\)) are both essentially stating the law's requirement without providing further justification or rationale. This means that the \( <R> \) ("That is what the law says") is effectively a restatement of the proposition (\(<P>\)) in a different form and does not provide independent support.
   
   - Check for other defective argument types (\(<G>\), \(<FE>\), \(<IR>\), \(<WCB>\), \(<FU>\), \(<DEP>\)):
     - \( <G> \) (Generalization): Not applicable as the argument does not generalize based on a subset.
     - \( <FE> \) (Incomplete Enumeration): Not applicable as the argument does not claim a complete list of possibilities.
     - \( <IR> \) (Inconclusive Reason): This could apply if we focused on the idea that the reason alone might not demonstrate the correctness, but more so it fits with \( <RR> \).
     - \( <WCB> \) (Insufficient Causal Basis): Not directly fitting here as the issue is more of repetition rather than weakness of the causal basis.
     - \( <FU> \) (Presumptuous Consensus): Not applicable as it does not hinge on assumed consensus.
     - \( <DEP> \) (Ambiguous Language Use): Not applicable as there is no ambiguous language.

5. **Classification**: Based on the evaluation, classify the type of defective argument.

   The argument "You should drive on the right side of the road because that is what the law says, and the law is the law," fits the definition of \( <RR> \) (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).

**Conclusion**: The given argument is best classified as \( <RR> \) (Faulty Repetition of Proposition) because the reason provided does not add new information or justification but merely restates the proposition in a different way.
