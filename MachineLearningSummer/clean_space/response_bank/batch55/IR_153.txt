For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given statement "We haven’t found King David’s tomb, so King David didn’t really exist," we will decompose the task <IDA> into specific steps, each aimed at classifying the statement as one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
Examine the statement and identify the proposition that is being put forth for validation.

**Proposition (<P>):**
King David didn’t really exist.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Examine the statement and identify the causal basis or reason supporting the proposition.

**Reason (<R>):**
We haven’t found King David’s tomb.

### Step 3: Examine the Relationship Between <P> and <R>
Determine whether the reason provided sufficiently supports the proposition. The goal is to see if the reason conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the proposition as claimed.

### Step 4: Identify Potential Defective Argument Types
Using the definitions of defective argument types, identify which category (if any) the argument falls into:

- **Generalization (<G>):** Is an assertion based on a part or majority, but not necessarily applicable to all, applied universally?
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Does it claim to provide a complete enumeration of possibilities but actually misses out on some pertinent ones?
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Does the reason not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Is the causal basis weak or not compelling?
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Is the reason essentially a restatement of the proposition?
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Is the proof assumed as certain on the grounds of universal agreement?
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Could the proof be taken in another sense than intended?

### Step 5: Classify the Argument
Based on the analysis, select the defective argument type that most accurately describes the relationship between <P> and <R>.

**Analysis:**

- The reason provided ("We haven’t found King David’s tomb") does not necessarily prove the proposition ("King David didn’t really exist"). The non-discovery of a tomb does not conclusively demonstrate that the person never existed.
- The argument has an issue where the reason given for the proposition does not conclusively support the proposition. There could be many other reasons why King David’s tomb has not been found (e.g., it could be lost, destroyed, or undiscovered).

**Classification:**
The statement can be classified as <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) because the reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition that King David didn’t really exist.

### Conclusion

By decomposing the task of classifying the argument into specific steps, we have identified the defective argument type for the statement: “We haven’t found King David’s tomb, so King David didn’t really exist” falls under <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
