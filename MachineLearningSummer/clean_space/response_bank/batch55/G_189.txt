For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the complex task IDA into specific steps) to the string "Teacher: If I let you go to the bathroom pretty soon everybody will want to go to the bathroom. This is an example of", we need to classify this argument according to the types of defective arguments specified. Here is the decomposition of the task into specific steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - *Proposition (P):* The implied proposition is that the student should not be allowed to go to the bathroom.
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - *Reason (R):* Allowing one student to go to the bathroom will result in everyone wanting to go to the bathroom.

3. **Evaluate the Reason's Adequacy and Specificity:**
   - The reason given is not a direct causal basis but an attempt to generalize the situation based on a single instance or hypothetical scenario.

4. **Determine the Type of Defective Argument:**
   - The argument falls under <G> Generalization. Letâ€™s explain:
     - The teacher is asserting that what is true for one student (wanting to go to the bathroom) will inevitably be true for the majority or all students.
     - This is a hasty generalization because it doesn't necessarily follow that allowing one student to go to the bathroom will cause all students to want to go. The reasoning jumps from a specific instance to a general conclusion without sufficient evidence to support it.

### Conclusion:
The argument "Teacher: If I let you go to the bathroom pretty soon everybody will want to go to the bathroom" is best classified as a <G> Generalization.

**Therefore, the IDAA applied classification for the given string is:** **<G>**
