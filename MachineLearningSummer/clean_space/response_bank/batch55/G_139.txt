For 
To apply \(\text{IDAA}\) to the string "Miller Lite is cheap beer, so the Guinness will be cheap, too,"  we need to decompose the task of classifying this string into specific steps. We will then apply each step methodically to determine if the argument falls into one of the defective argument types: \(\text{G}\), \(\text{FE}\), \(\text{IR}\), \(\text{RR}\), \(\text{WCB}\), \(\text{FU}\), or \(\text{DEP}\). Here's the \(\text{IDAA}\) process broken down:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\(\text{P}\)) and Reason (\(\text{R}\))
- **Proposition (\(\text{P}\))**: "the Guinness will be cheap"
- **Reason (\(\text{R}\))**: "Miller Lite is cheap beer"

### Step 2: Assess the provided Reason (\(\text{R}\)) in relation to the Proposition (\(\text{P}\))
Here we evaluate if the reason properly supports the proposition and if it has a strong causal basis.

### Step 3: Match the argument to the potential defective argument types
We compare the identified argument structure to the definitions of \(\text{G}\), \(\text{FE}\), \(\text{IR}\), \(\text{RR}\), \(\text{WCB}\), \(\text{FU}\), and \(\text{DEP}\):

1. **Generalization (\(\text{G}\))**: This argument does not seem to involve an assertion based on one or several parts representing the whole. Thus, it is likely not a generalization.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\(\text{FE}\))**: This argument is not claiming to make a complete enumeration of possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (\(\text{IR}\))**: This is worth exploring since the reason given ("Miller Lite is cheap beer") does not necessarily demonstrate the proposition ("the Guinness will be cheap, too"). The two beers are distinct products, and the price of one does not determine the price of the other.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(\text{RR}\))**: The reason and the proposition are not the same statement, so this does not apply.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(\text{WCB}\))**: The reason here does not provide a strong causal basis for the proposition. The price of Miller Lite has no causal relationship to the price of Guinness.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\(\text{FU}\))**: There is no mention of a universal agreement upon the reason, so this does not apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\(\text{DEP}\))**: The statement does not hinge on ambiguous language or multiple interpretations, so this likely does not apply.

### Step 4: Determine the classification
Given the analysis, the argument can be classified into one of the defective types based on the strongest match identified from Step 3.

### Conclusion
The argument "Miller Lite is cheap beer, so the Guinness will be cheap, too" is most appropriately classified as either \(\text{IR}\) (Inconclusive Reason) or \(\text{WCB}\) (Insufficient Causal Basis). 

**Primary classification**: \(\text{IR}\) (Inconclusive Reason), because the reason provided does not demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.

**Secondary classification**: \(\text{WCB}\) (Insufficient Causal Basis), because the causal basis submitted (the price of one type of beer) does not compellingly support the proposition regarding the price of another type of beer. 

Therefore, by \(\text{IDAA}\), the argument is classified primarily as \( \text{IR}\).
