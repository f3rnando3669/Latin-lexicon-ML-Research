To apply the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument (IDA) to the given string, let's proceed step by step, breaking down the advanced task into specific steps and applying these steps to classify the defective argument.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
First, we need to identify the core assertion or proposition being made in the string.

- **Proposition <P>:** "The Supreme Court has just flinched from its responsibility to stop the unjust jailing of two journalists by a runaway prosecutor."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
Next, we need to look for the causal basis or reasoning provided to support the proposition.

- **Reason <R>:** "A runaway prosecutor will go to any lengths to use the government's contempt power to force them to betray their confidential sources."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason <PR>
Look for any additional arguments or evidence that corroborate or support the reason.

- **Proof of Reason <PR>:** There is no explicit additional argument or evidence presented in the given string to support the reason.

### Step 4: Assess the Validity of Each Component
We now assess if each component is valid or falls into one of the defective argument types.

#### Assessing the Proposition <P>
- The proposition asserts a specific failure by the Supreme Court based on one instance. It does not represent a generalized assertion.
  - **Conclusion:** The <P> does not indicate a Generalization (G).

#### Assessing the Reason <R>
- The reason suggests that the prosecutor's actions justify the Supreme Court's failure. However, it does not conclusively demonstrate that the Supreme Court indeed neglected its responsibility.
  - **Conclusion:** The <R> is very much indicating an Inconclusive Reason (IR).

#### Assessing the Proof of Reason <PR>
- There is no explicit Proof of Reason provided; thus, the argument does not explicitly imply incorrect universality (<FU>), ambiguous language (<DEP>), nor incompletely enumerate the possibilities (<FE>). It makes a presumptive statement about the prosecutorâ€™s motivations without substantial proof.

### Step 5: Identify Defective Argument Type
From the assessment:
- The Reason (R) about the prosecutor's actions does not conclusively guarantee the proposition (P) that the Supreme Court has flinched from its responsibility.
  
### Conclusion
By following the steps, the defective argument type for the given string primarily points to **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, as the reasoning provided does not conclusively establish the truth of the proposition.

Hence, the string is classified as type **IR**.
