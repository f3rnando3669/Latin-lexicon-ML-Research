For 
To apply IDAA to the string "Fred, the Australian, stole my wallet. Thus, all Australians are thieves," we'll decompose the task into specific steps required to classify the argument as one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
The proposition in the string is: "all Australians are thieves."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
The reason given to support the proposition is: "Fred, the Australian, stole my wallet."

### Step 3: Analyze the Structure of the Argument
Based on the identified parts:
- <P>: "all Australians are thieves."
- <R>: "Fred, the Australian, stole my wallet."

### Step 4: Identify Potential Defective Argument Types
- **Generalization <G>**: This type involves making a broad assertion based on a small or incomplete sample.
- **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>**: This type involves claiming to have considered all possibilities but missing pertinent ones.
- **Inconclusive Reason <IR>**: This type involves a reason that does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>**: This involves a weak causal basis for the proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>**: This involves the reason repeating the proposition without adding new information.
- **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>**: This involves assuming consensus where there may be none.
- **Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>**: This involves using language that can be interpreted differently.

### Step 5: Match the Argument with the Defective Types
- **Generalization <G>**: The argument generalizes from a single instance (Fred stole the wallet) to all Australians.
- **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>**: This is not applicable since the argument doesn't claim to enumerate possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason <IR>**: While the reason provided does not conclusively prove the proposition, the issue is more about overgeneralization than being inconclusive.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>**: The causal basis is not weak; instead, it's the leap from the specific to the general that's problematic.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>**: The reason does not merely repeat the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>**: The argument does not rely on an assumed consensus.
- **Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>**: The language used is not ambiguous in this context.

### Step 6: Classify the Argument
The argument fits the definition of a **Generalization <G>** because it makes a broad assertion based on one specific instance (Fred's theft).

### Result
The classification <s> for the string "Fred, the Australian, stole my wallet. Thus, all Australians are thieves." is <G>.

By following these steps, we have successfully applied IDAA to classify the argument.
