For 
Alright, let's apply <IDAA> to the statement "You're too ugly to be class president!" step by step.

### Decomposition of the Task (D):

1. **Identify the Proposition <P>**: Determine what the statement is trying to prove.
2. **Identify the Reason <R>**: Determine the causal basis or reasoning behind the proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Reason <R>**: Check the strength and validity of the reason.
4. **Test for Defective Argument Types**: Check whether the identified reason and any supporting proof fall into any of the defective argument categories <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Applying the Decomposition (IDAA):

1. **Identify the Proposition <P>**:
   - **<P>**: The proposition here is "You should not be class president."
   
2. **Identify the Reason <R>**:
   - **<R>**: The reason given is "You're too ugly."

3. **Evaluate the Reason <R>**:
   - The reason "You're too ugly" is not a relevant or substantial causal basis for the proposition "You should not be class president." It lacks a logical connection because physical appearance is not a valid criterion for the role of class president.

4. **Test for Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization <G>**: This does not apply as it is not based on generalizing from a part to a whole.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>**: This does not apply as it is not enumerating possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason <IR>**: This can be argued as applicable, because the reason provided ("You're too ugly") does not conclusively demonstrate that one should not be class president.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>**: This also applies since "You're too ugly" is an insufficient and irrelevant causal basis for the proposition.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>**: This does not apply as it is not repeating the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>**: This does not apply as there's no claim of universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>**: This does not apply as the language used is clear, though inappropriate.

### Conclusion:

The statement "You're too ugly to be class president!" can be classified into multiple defective argument types, with the primary classifications being:
   - **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: because the reason fails to conclusively support the proposition.
   - **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: because the reason given does not provide a compelling basis for the proposition.
