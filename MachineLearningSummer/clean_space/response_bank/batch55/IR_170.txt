For 
To apply <IDAA> to "My teacher says the Earth is flat, so it definitely is flat," we'll begin by decomposing the task into specific steps and then follow those steps to classify the argument correctly.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for IDAA

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>):**
   - <P>: "The Earth is flat."
   - <R>: "My teacher says so."

2. **Analyze the strength of the Reason (<R>) in supporting the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine if the Reason provides a strong and compelling basis for the Proposition.

3. **Assess for Defective Argument Types:**
   - Check if the Reason is an example of:
     - <G> (Generalization)
     - <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)
     - <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)
     - <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)
     - <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)
     - <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)
     - <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)

### Applying the Steps to the Given Sentence

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>):**
   - <P>: "The Earth is flat."
   - <R>: "My teacher says the Earth is flat."

2. **Analyze the strength of the Reason (<R>) in supporting the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The Reason provided is an appeal to authority: "My teacher says so."
   - This type of Reason doesn't inherently provide objective evidence or logical arguments to support the Proposition.

3. **Assess for Defective Argument Types:**
   - **<G> (Generalization):** Not applicable, as the argument doesn't generalize from a small sample to a larger population.
   - **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):** Not applicable, as there is no claim of a complete enumeration of possibilities here.
   - **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** Applicable. The Reason relies solely on the teacher's assertion rather than conclusive evidence.
   - **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** Applicable. The causal basis (authority of the teacher) is insufficient to compel the truth of the Proposition.
   - **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** Not applicable. The Reason does provide additional information beyond restating the Proposition.
   - **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):** Not applicable, as there is no claim of universal agreement.
   - **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):** Not applicable. The language used here is clear and unambiguous.

### Conclusion

After decomposing the task and applying the steps, we can classify "My teacher says the Earth is flat, so it definitely is flat" primarily as:

- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** The Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The Reason provided (my teacher says so) does not provide a compelling causal basis.

Thus, the argument is defective due to both Inconclusive Reason and Insufficient Causal Basis.
