To apply IDAA (the application of decomposing a task into specific steps) to IDA (classifying the given string as one of the defective argument types), let's break down the steps required to identify the appropriate defective argument type for the given string:

**Step 1: Understand the Argument**
Read and comprehend the argument thoroughly:
- Proposition (P): "If we don’t bail out the big automakers, the US economy will collapse."
- Conclusion: "Therefore, we need to bail out the automakers."

**Step 2: Identify the Component Parts**
Identify the components of the argument:
- P: "We need to bail out the automakers."
- R (Reason): "If we don’t bail out the big automakers, the US economy will collapse."

**Step 3: Analyze the Reason (R) Component**
Analyze whether the reason provided (R) conclusively establishes the truth of the proposition (P):
- Does R conclusively demonstrate that bailing out the big automakers is necessary to prevent the collapse of the US economy?

**Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type**
Compare the given argument to the definitions of the defective argument types:

- **Generalization (G)**: This involves taking some individual cases and applying them to all cases. This doesn't fit as the argument isn't generalizing but rather making a specific prediction.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This involves claiming to have enumerated all possibilities when pertinent ones are missed. This doesn't fit here.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This occurs when the Reason (R) does not conclusively demonstrate the Proposition (P). The argument makes a bold assertion that not bailing out automakers will lead the US economy to collapse, which is a speculative prediction and not conclusively proven.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This is present when the causal basis for P is weak. This is close, as the reason provided ("US economy will collapse") may not be entirely compelling without further data or evidence.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This argument isn't simply repeating the proposition; the Reason and Proposition are different statements.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This involves assuming something is true because it is universally agreed upon. The argument doesn't claim universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: This involves ambiguity in language usage. The argument is fairly clear in its terms.

**Step 5: Select the Closest Match**
By evaluating the above analysis, the argument most closely fits:

- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The reason given does not provide a sufficiently compelling causal basis to necessitate the bailout without further substantiation.

Given the provided steps, the defective argument type for the given string "If we don’t bail out the big automakers, the US economy will collapse. Therefore, we need to bail out the automakers." is best classified as:

**Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
