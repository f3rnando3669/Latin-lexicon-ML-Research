To apply *IDAA* to the given string, "My new way of obtaining informed consent helps prevent dropouts. I chose the three therapists in our clinic who had the highest dropout rates and taught them my new informed consent procedure. The first month that they started using it, all three had significantly lower dropout rates," we will follow the decomposition steps of analyzing the string and classifying it under the defined defective argument types. 

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (*D*)

1. **Identify and Extract the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - The statement that expresses the main idea or claim being proposed.
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Look for the statement providing a causal basis for the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - Identify the supporting details or examples provided to back the reason.

4. **Classify Any Defective Argument Types (<IDA>)**:
   - Examine whether the arguments fall under any of the defective argument categories: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>.

### Application of IDAA

**Step 1: Identify and Extract the Proposition (<P>)**
- Proposition: "My new way of obtaining informed consent helps prevent dropouts."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**
- Reason: "I chose the three therapists in our clinic who had the highest dropout rates and taught them my new informed consent procedure."

**Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**
- Proof of Reason: "The first month that they started using it, all three had significantly lower dropout rates."

**Step 4: Classify Any Defective Argument Types (<IDA>)**

Now, let's analyze the identified <P>, <R>, and <PR> to classify them under any defective argument types:

- Assess <P> for defects:
  - The proposition <P>: "My new way of obtaining informed consent helps prevent dropouts."
  - No immediate defect is identified purely in the proposition.

- Assess <R> and <PR> for defects:
  - **Possibility of Generalization (<G>)**:
    - This argues based on selecting three therapists with the highest dropout rates and might not necessarily apply to all therapists or situations.
    - Classification: **<G>**

  - **Possibility of Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
    - This would apply if the argument claims a complete enumeration of cases but only includes specific therapists.
    - Classification: **<FE>** (This is not implied directly; hence, not selecting as the primary defect).

  - **Possibility of Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
    - The reason given does not conclusively prove the proposition because there could be other factors affecting the dropouts decrease.
    - Classification: **<IR>**

  - **Possibility of Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
    - The causal basis provided is weak unless it's shown that merely changing informed consent procedures would result in lower dropouts.
    - Classification: **<WCB>**

  - **Possibility of Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
    - The reason repeats the proposition but framed slightly differently.
    - Not present here.

  - **Possibility of Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
    - There is no mention of universal agreement; this defect is not present here.
    
  - **Possibility of Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
    - Ambiguity about what aspect of the informed consent procedure led to the decrease in dropout rates could be an issue.
    - Classification: **<DEP>** (This still seems weakly implied).

### Final Classification

The primary classifications that best fit the analysis are:

- **<G>**: The string generalizes the effectiveness of the new informed consent procedure based on the experience with three therapists, which may not necessarily apply universally.
- **<IR>**: The reason given does not conclusively support the proposition, as other factors could also explain the decrease in dropout rates, making the causal link between the new consent procedure and the outcome weak.
- **<WCB>**: The causal basis provided (the new way of obtaining informed consent) may not afford a compelling argument on its own accord without further substantiation.

Thus, the string can be classified under <G>, <IR>, and <WCB>, with each classification highlighting a specific aspect of its logical shortcomings.
