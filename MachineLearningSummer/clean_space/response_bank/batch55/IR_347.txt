For 
To apply the decomposition method (IDAA) to classify the statement "We should abolish the death penalty. Many respected people, such as actor Guy Handsome, have publicly stated their opposition to it,” we will take it step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
A Proposition is a part of a complete argument through which we set forth summarily what we intend to prove.

**Proposition (P):**
"We should abolish the death penalty."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
A Reason sets forth the causal basis for P, establishing the truth of what we are urging.

**Reason (R):**
"Many respected people, such as actor Guy Handsome, have publicly stated their opposition to it."

### Step 3: Identify potential Proof of Reason (PR)
A Proof of Reason supports the Reason by means of additional arguments.

**Proof of Reason (PR)**:
There is no additional argument provided in the statement to support the Reason. It relies solely on the invocation of the opinions of respected people.

### Step 4: Analyze the Reason for validity 
Determine if the Reason (R) conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the Proposition (P).

### Step 5: Classify the Argument according to the given defective argument types 
We now apply <D> to <IDA> to identify the specific type of defective argument from among the given possibilities.

### Classifying the Argument:
1. **Generalization (G):** The Reason does not attempt to apply the opinions of respected people to all people.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The Reason does not claim to represent a complete enumeration of all respected people’s opinions.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This Reason might be considered inconclusive because the opinions of respected people do not necessarily prove the merit or demerit of the death penalty itself.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The Reason is based on the opinions of respected people, but these opinions alone do not provide a compelling causal basis for abolishing the death penalty.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The Reason does not merely repeat the Proposition but adds that respected people oppose the death penalty.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The Reason relies on the sentiment that because many respected people oppose it, it must be correct, assuming a consensus which could still be in dispute.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** There is no clear ambiguous language use in the statement.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the statement against all defective argument types, we can classify it as:

**<IR> Inconclusive Reason**
- The statement's Reason does not conclusively demonstrate why the death penalty should be abolished; it merely points to the opinions of respected individuals without providing substantive evidence or arguments against the death penalty itself.

**<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**
- The Reason provided is weak because invoking the opinions of respected people does not constitute a compelling causal basis for abolishing the death penalty.

### Final Classification:
The argument is primarily classified as **<IR> Inconclusive Reason** and **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**.
