To apply the process of decomposing the task of classifying a defect in an argument (IDA) into specific steps (D), let's proceed with the classification step by step.

### Task: Classify "harmful atheists favor cloning, so cloning is wrong" as one of the defective argument types

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - The proposition (P) in the argument is "cloning is wrong."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - The reason (R) given to support the proposition is "harmful atheists favor cloning."

3. **Classify the Defective Argument Type (IDA):**
   - Evaluate the provided reason (R) in light of the possible defective argument types to determine which, if any, apply.

#### Step-by-Step Classification (D):

1. **Check for Generalization (G):**
   - Is the proposition a broad assertion based on a limited sample?
   - In this case, the proposition isn't based on a sample size but rather on linking the favoring of cloning by a specific group to the conclusion that cloning is wrong. So, it doesn't directly fit Generalization.

2. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - Is the proposition attempting to enumerate all possibilities but missing some?
   - The argument does not enumerate possibilities; it states a causal relation, so this doesn't fit Incomplete Enumeration.

3. **Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
   - The reason "harmful atheists favor cloning" does not provide a direct logical connection to the proposition "cloning is wrong," so it remains inconclusive.

4. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - Does the reason merely restate the proposition?
   - The reason here doesn't simply restate the proposition using different words.

5. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - Is the causal basis submitted for the proposition a compelling one?
   - The causal basis is weak. The favoring of cloning by a group labeled as "harmful atheists" is not a strong or directly relevant reason to conclude that cloning itself is wrong.

6. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - Is the reason or proof based on assumed agreement?
   - This doesn't apply since there's no claim of universal agreement.

7. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - Can the proof or reason be taken in another sense than intended?
   - The terms "harmful atheists" and how they "favor" cloning are vague but not necessarily ambiguous enough to fit this definition.

### Final Classification:

Upon careful analysis, the argument "harmful atheists favor cloning, so cloning is wrong" is best classified as **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, as the reason provided does not offer a compelling causal basis to establish the proposition that cloning is wrong. The fact that a certain group (labeled as harmful) favors a practice does not inherently demonstrate the moral or ethical status of that practice.
