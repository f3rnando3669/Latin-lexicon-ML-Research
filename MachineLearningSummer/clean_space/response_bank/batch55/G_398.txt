For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task, we need to decompose the task of identifying the defective argument into clear steps. Here, we will follow a systematic approach to classify the given string as one of the defective argument types defined.

### Step 1: Examine the Proposition \( <P> \)
The first step is to clearly identify the Proposition \( <P> \) put forth in the argument.

**Given Argument:**
"If you don’t eat breakfast, you’ll slouch in your desk. If you slouch in your desk, you’ll hurt your back. If you hurt your back, you’ll never become President."

- **Propositions:** 
  1. If you don’t eat breakfast, you’ll slouch in your desk.
  2. If you slouch in your desk, you’ll hurt your back.
  3. If you hurt your back, you’ll never become President.

**Conclusion \( <P> \):**
- If you don’t eat breakfast, you’ll never become President.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason \( <R> \)
Next, identify the causal basis (\( <R> \)) provided for the Proposition \( <P> \):

- **Reasons \( <R> \):**
  1. Not eating breakfast causes slouching in your desk.
  2. Slouching in your desk causes hurting your back.
  3. Hurting your back prevents you from becoming President.

### Step 3: Check for Proof of Reason \( <PR> \)
Examine if there is additional argument or proof provided to support the reasons (\( <PR> \)):

- In this case, the reasons are not really corroborated with any additional arguments but are sequentially linked within the argument.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type
Determine which defective argument applies based on the analysis above. 

#### Analyzing Various Defective Arguments:

1. **Generalization \( <G> \)**:
   - This does not apply, as each part is not asserting a generalized statement about all scenarios but rather a sequence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration \( <FE> \)**:
   - Again, this does not fit. The argument is not about enumerating possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason \( <IR> \)**:
   - This is a possibility, because the reasons given do not conclusively prove the propositions in each step.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis \( <WCB> \)**:
   - This is also a possibility, given that the causal connections (not eating → slouching, slouching → back pain, back pain → not becoming President) are weak and not compelling.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition \( <RR> \)**:
   - This does not fit as the reasons are not mere repetitions of the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus \( <FU> \)**:
   - This does not apply, there's no assumption of universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use \( <DEP> \)**:
   - This does not fit as well, as there's no ambiguous language.

The likely defective arguments here are:
- **Inconclusive Reason \( <IR> \)**: Each reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the preceding proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis \( <WCB> \)**: The causal basis for the steps in the argument is weak and not compelling.

### Conclusion of Classification

The argument exhibits characteristics of both:
- **Inconclusive Reason \( <IR> \)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis \( <WCB> \)**

Given the sequence and the weak cause-effect relations between each proposition and reason, the dominant fallacy here is mostly **Insufficient Causal Basis \( <WCB> \)**. The causal links are not strong enough to conclusively lead from eating breakfast to becoming President.
