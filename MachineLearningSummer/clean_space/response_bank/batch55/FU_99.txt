To apply the process of decomposing and classifying the argument to identify its fallacy, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition**: Determine what is being claimed or asserted in the argument.
2. **Identify the Reason**: Determine the reasoning or evidence provided to support the Proposition.
3. **Classify the type of defective argument**: Analyze the argument to classify it as one of the defective argument types.

### Step-by-Step Application

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\<P\>)**
- The Proposition (\<P\>) in the statement is: "McDonalds is better than Burger King."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (\<R\>)**
- The Reason (\<R\>) given is: "Almost everyone that was asked said so."

**Step 3: Classify the type of defective argument (\<IDA\>)**

Let's review the given options to see which one fits the argument:

1. **Generalization (\<G\>)**: This would be if \(\<P\>\) is an assertion based on some one part or majority but not necessarily applicable to all. The statement is based on the opinions of most people asked, but it's applied as a universal truth.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)**: This would involve missing out on potential possibilities. The argument does not enumerate possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**: This is when the Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition. The reason (opinions of those asked) may not be conclusive evidence.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**: The Reason's causal basis is weak. The basis here is subjective opinions.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)**: This occurs when the Reason merely repeats the Proposition. This is not the case here.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)**: This involves assuming a PR as certain because "it is universally agreed upon". This is quite similar to Generalization.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)**: This involves ambiguous language. The language here is straightforward, not ambiguous.

The closest fit is **Generalization (\<G\>)** because the argument is asserting a universal truth ("McDonalds is better than Burger King") based on the opinions of a subset of people (“Almost everyone that was asked”). This fits the definition of generalizing from a sample to the whole.

### Conclusion
The fallacy in the argument "The phrase, 'Almost everyone that was asked said that McDonalds is better than Burger King, so it must be true,' represents which fallacy?" is **Generalization (\<G\>)**.
