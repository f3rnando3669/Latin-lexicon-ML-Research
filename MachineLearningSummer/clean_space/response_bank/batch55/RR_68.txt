For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument into specific steps) to the given string "He's the best teacher I've ever had because he's the best teacher I've known," we break down the process step-by-step as follows:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of the Task <IDA>:
1. **Identify the Proposition (P):** 
   Examine the string to determine the main proposition being stated.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   Determine the reason given in support of the proposition.

3. **Evaluate the Reason (R) Relative to the Proposition (P):**
   Check whether the reason actually supports the proposition and whether it suffers from any specific defects.

4. **Match with Defective Argument Types:**
   Compare the structure and content of the argument with the definitions of defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP).

### Application:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
In the string, the main proposition being stated is:
- P: "He's the best teacher I've ever had."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason given for this proposition is:
- R: "He's the best teacher I've known."

#### Step 3: Evaluate the Reason (R) Relative to the Proposition (P)
Now, we need to see if the reason provided (R) correctly and conclusively supports the proposition (P). We assess whether it introduces any logical defects as defined.

- R: "He's the best teacher I've known" is essentially repeating the assertion "Heâ€™s the best teacher" from the proposition (P), but in slightly different wording.

#### Step 4: Match with Defective Argument Types
Compare the reasoning (R) and the proposition (P) to our list of defective arguments:

- **<G> (Generalization):** Not applicable here, as there's no indication of generalizing from one or some to all.
- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):** Not applicable, no enumeration of possibilities is presented.
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** Could be applicable, but needs specific analysis.
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The reason does not provide a compelling causal link; merely restates the same thing.
- **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** The reason given is essentially reiterating the proposition: "He's the best teacher I've ever had because he's the best teacher I've known."
- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):** Not applicable here; there is no assertion of universal agreement.
- **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):** Not applicable, as the language is not ambiguous but rather repetitive.

From the analysis, it becomes clear that the argument's defect is a **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**, because the reason given merely repeats the assertion made in the proposition without adding any substantive support.

### Conclusion:
The instance "He's the best teacher I've ever had because he's the best teacher I've known" is classified as a defective argument of type **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**.
