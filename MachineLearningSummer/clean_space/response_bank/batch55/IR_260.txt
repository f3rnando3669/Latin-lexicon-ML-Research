Certainly! To apply IDAA to the given string and classify it as one of the defective argument types, we will decompose the task into specific steps, analyze the argument step-by-step, and identify which defective argument type it fits.

String to Analyze:
"I have been accused of using an ad hominem approach in trying to defend my research. But those who attack me and my research are also using ad hominem. And they started it!"

Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - "I have been accused of using an ad hominem approach in trying to defend my research."
   - This sets forth what the speaker is trying to prove: that an accusation has been made against their approach.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - "But those who attack me and my research are also using ad hominem."
   - This sets forth the causal basis for the proposition: others are also using ad hominem attacks.

3. **Analyze the Reason (<R>):**
   - We need to determine if the Reason actually supports the Proposition effectively.
   - The Reason asserts that the accusers are also using ad hominem attacks.

4. **Identify potential Defective Argument Types:**

   - **Generalization (G):** The argument does not extend the proposition beyond what was specifically stated about a group or majority.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument does not claim to examine all possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Check if the Reason conclusively supports the Proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Check if the Reason provides a compelling causal basis for the Proposition.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Check if the Reason is just a repetition of the Proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The Reason does not claim universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Check for ambiguous language or misinterpretation.

5. **Evaluate the Reason (<R>) against Defective Argument Types:**
   - The Reason "those who attack me and my research are also using ad hominem" attempts to justify the Proposition by highlighting that others are doing the same.
   - This does not truly logically support or negate the original accusation. It merely shifts the focus to the accusers' actions without addressing the validity of the ad hominem criticism itself.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The Reason provided falls short of providing a sufficient causal basis for the Proposition. The critique that others are also engaging in ad hominem does not invalidate or substantiate the original accusation against the speaker.
   - This fits the definition of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because the Reason is not a compelling or logically sound basis for refuting the initial Proposition.

So the classification of the argument is:
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).**
