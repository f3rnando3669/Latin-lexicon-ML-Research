For 
To apply the concept of <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as one of the recognized defective arguments), let's take it step by step for the given statement "Which fallacy literally means 'He did it himself?'":

1. **Understand the Task (<t>):**
   Our advanced task (<t>) is to classify the given statement as one of the defective argument types (<IDA>).

2. **Decompose the Task (<D>):**
   Break down the task into specific steps to classify the given statement. Hereâ€™s how we can decompose it:
   - Read and comprehend the statement thoroughly.
   - Identify the nature of the statement.
   - Check what the statement implies or assumes.
   - Match the identified characteristic with the definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

3. **Apply the Steps to the Given String:**
   Let's apply the above steps to "Which fallacy literally means 'He did it himself?'":
   
   - **Step 1:** Read and comprehend the statement thoroughly.
     - The statement "Which fallacy literally means 'He did it himself?'" is asking for the name of a fallacy that implies self-caused action.
   
   - **Step 2:** Identify the nature of the statement.
     - The nature here is to provide a label or classification of a specific fallacy.
   
   - **Step 3:** Check what the statement implies or assumes.
     - The statement implies that there is a literal fallacy corresponding to the meaning "He did it himself."
   
   - **Step 4:** Match the identified characteristic with the definitions of defective arguments.
     - **Generalization (<G>):** Not an over-generalization.
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Does not claim to account for all possibilities.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** There is no causal basis presented.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** No causal basis is presented, insufficient or otherwise.
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** No repetition of proposition.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** There's no assumption of universal agreement.
     - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The phrase "literally means" may be ambiguous in what it intends to highlight. It could be taken to mean something concretely self-caused, but this is not strictly technical or logical as per formal argument fallacies.
   
   Based on the analysis, the closest classification could be indicative of ambiguous language use because the phrase "literally means 'He did it himself?'" can be taken in various senses, even though it might seem straightforward.

Therefore, **the classification of the given string "Which fallacy literally means 'He did it himself?'" falls under <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use).**
