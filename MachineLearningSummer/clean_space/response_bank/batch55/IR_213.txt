For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a string as a type of defective argument) to the given statement "You’re a vegetarian? You do realize that Hitler was a vegetarian, too?", we will follow a structured approach to break down the process of identifying the defective argument type. Here are the steps:

### Step 1: Identify Proposition (\<P\>)
First, identify the proposition in the statement. In this case, the implied proposition is:

**P:** "Being a vegetarian is bad or wrong."

### Step 2: Identify Reason (\<R\>)
Next, identify the reason provided to support the proposition. In this case, the reason offered is:

**R:** "Hitler was a vegetarian."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Quality of the Argument
Assess whether the reason (\<R\>) effectively supports the proposition (\<P\>).

- Does the reason have a causal basis for the proposition?
- Is the reason conclusive?
- Is the reason merely reiterating the proposition?
- Can the reason be taken differently than intended?

### Step 4: Identify Defective Argument Type
Based on the given definitions of defective arguments, determine which type applies to the statement:

1. **Generalization (\<G\>)**: The proposition does not seem to generalize a characteristic from a part or majority to all; thus, it doesn't fit here.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)**: The argument doesn't involve an enumeration of possibilities, so this doesn't apply.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**: The reason (\<R\>) that “Hitler was a vegetarian” does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (\<P\>) that “being a vegetarian is bad or wrong.”
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**: The reason provided lacks a compelling causal basis since being a vegetarian and being Hitler are unrelated in terms of morality, ethics, or diet.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)**: The reason is not a mere repetition of the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)**: The reason does not appeal to a universal agreement.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)**: The statement does not primarily rely on ambiguity of language.

### Step 5: Conclude the Classification
From the evaluation, the defective argument types that apply most clearly are **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**. The reason provided does not conclusively establish the truth of the proposition, and the causal basis presented is not compelling.

### Detailed Breakdown of Classification
**Conclusion:** The statement "You’re a vegetarian? You do realize that Hitler was a vegetarian, too?" is a defective argument type of both **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)** because the reason given does not convincingly support the proposition and lacks a strong causal link.
