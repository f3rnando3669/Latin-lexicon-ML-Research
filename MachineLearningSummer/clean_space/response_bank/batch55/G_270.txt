For 
To apply IDAA to "If indoor smoking laws are passed for bars, the bars will go out of business since people who drink, smoke while they drink," we will decompose the task of classifying the string as one of the defective argument types into specific steps. Here's the step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
First, pinpoint the assertion that encapsulates what the argument is trying to prove. In this case:

**Proposition (P):** "Bars will go out of business if indoor smoking laws are passed."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
Identify the part of the argument that provides the causal basis for the proposition. For this argument:

**Reason (R):** "People who drink, smoke while they drink."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Reason <R>
Determine if the reason provided conclusively or sufficiently supports the proposition.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type
Compare the argument to the definitions of defective argument types to see which one it matches:

- **Generalization (G):** The Proposition is based on a subset but applied to all. 
  - Does not seem applicable here.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The Proposition claims complete enumeration but misses some possibilities.
  - Again, does not seem applicable.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.
  - **Analysis:** The Reason given that "People who drink, smoke while they drink" does not conclusively prove that all bars will go out of business if indoor smoking laws are passed. There could be people who drink and do not smoke, or who would still frequent bars even if they can't smoke inside.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Reason is not compelling.
  - **Analysis:** The Reason provided might not be sufficient because it assumes all customers will stop coming to bars due to smoking restrictions, which is not necessarily a compelling conclusion.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The Reason is essentially a restatement of the Proposition.
  - This doesn't apply here since the Reason is not a restatement.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Proof of Reason is assumed certain by "universal agreement."
  - This concept does not apply here as it doesn't rely on presumed universal agreement.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Proof of Reason can be interpreted differently than intended.
  - Not applicable here as the language isnâ€™t ambiguous in this context.

### Step 5: Conclude and Classify
Based on the steps above, the most fitting classification for this argument is:

**Type IR (Inconclusive Reason):** The Reason provided ("People who drink, smoke while they drink") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition ("Bars will go out of business if indoor smoking laws are passed"), as it fails to account for all the nuances and possibilities.

### Final Classification
The argument "If indoor smoking laws are passed for bars, the bars will go out of business since people who drink, smoke while they drink" falls under the defective argument type: **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
