For 
To apply IDAA (decomposition of IDA into specific steps) to the string ""You can't believe that theory. No one would believe that. It's too unbelievable."" we need to break down the advanced task IDA (classifying the string as one of the defective argument types) into specific steps. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)

- **Proposition (P)**: The assertion or claim that the speaker intends to prove.
- In the given string, the proposition seems to be "You can't believe that theory." This is an assertion being made.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R) and Proof of Reason (PR)

- **Reason (R)**: The basis provided to support the proposition.
- In the given string, the reason appears to be "No one would believe that."

- **Proof of Reason (PR)**: Additional arguments corroborating the reason.
- In this case, "It's too unbelievable" serves as an explanation or proof that the reason "No one would believe that" is valid.

### Step 3: Evaluate the Argument for Defective Types

1. **Generalization (G)**: This does not apply as the argument is not based on a generalization from parts to the whole.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This does not apply because the argument does not rely on an incomplete enumeration of possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This does not apply because the reason is not discussed in terms of being inconclusive by evidence.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Considering this, the argument may potentially fall here, since the causal basis for the proposition is not compelling. The mere fact that "no one would believe it" does not provide a strong causal reason for why the theory can't be believed.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This does not apply because the reason isn't merely a repetition of the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This applies here because the argument asserts a consensus ("No one would believe that") as proof, assuming universal agreement on the disbelief, which is still in dispute.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: This does not apply because the language is not particularly ambiguous.

### Step 4: Conclusion

Based on the evaluation, the defective argument type for the given string is:

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument assumes that because it is presumed no one would believe the theory, that is a valid reason for its dismissal. The consensus is presupposed rather than proven.

So the classification of the string `s = "You can't believe that theory. No one would believe that. It's too unbelievable."` is **FU (Presumptuous Consensus)**.
