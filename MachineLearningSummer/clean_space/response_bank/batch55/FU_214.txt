For 
Applying \(<IDAA>\) to the given string "If you are a true American, you will ask your congressman to vote against NAFTA" involves decomposing the task of classifying the argument type (\(IDA\)) into specific steps (\(D\)) and then carrying out these steps. Let's go through this systematically:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition** (\(P\)): Determine the main assertion or claim being made.

2. **Identify the Reason** (\(R\)): Determine the causal basis or reason given for the proposition.

3. **Identify Possible Defective Argument Types**: Use the definitions of defective argument types to analyze and classify the argument:
    - Generalization (\(G\))
    - Incomplete Enumeration (\(FE\))
    - Inconclusive Reason (\(IR\))
    - Insufficient Causal Basis (\(WCB\))
    - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(RR\))
    - Presumptuous Consensus (\(FU\))
    - Ambiguous Language Use (\(DEP\))

4. **Classify the Defective Argument**: Assign one or more of the defective argument types based on the analysis.

### Application of \(IDAA\):

1. **Identify the Proposition** (\(P\)):
   - **Proposition (P)**: "You will ask your congressman to vote against NAFTA."

2. **Identify the Reason** (\(R\)):
   - **Reason (R)**: "If you are a true American."

3. **Identify Possible Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: Not applicable. There is no generalizing assertion about a group.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable. No claim of complete enumeration is made.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Not directly applicable. The reason given "If you are a true American" is not an evidence-based reason that can be evaluated conclusively or inconclusively.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Not directly applicable. The statement does not present an insufficient causal link.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Not applicable. There is no repetition of the same statement.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Potentially applicable. The statement hinges on a presumption that all "true Americans" would share the same viewpoint.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Potentially applicable. The term "true American" is ambiguous and can be interpreted in multiple ways.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument**:
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The reason assumes consensus on what it means to be a "true American" and presumes this consensus to dictate a specific political action.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The term "true American" is ambiguous and subjective, leading to multiple interpretations.

### Conclusion:

The string "If you are a true American, you will ask your congressman to vote against NAFTA" can be classified as exhibiting defective argument types:

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assumes that being a "true American" necessarily implies opposition to NAFTA.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Uses the ambiguous term "true American" which can be understood in various ways.

Thus, applying \(IDAA\) to the given string reveals that it involves defective argument types \(FU\) and \(DEP\).
