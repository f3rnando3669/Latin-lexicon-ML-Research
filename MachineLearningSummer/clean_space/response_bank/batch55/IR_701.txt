Certainly! Let's apply the process of decomposing the task and classifying the argument step by step as outlined by IDAA. We'll first break down the categorization task (IDA) into specific steps.

### Steps for IDAA:
1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   Find what the argument is trying to assert or prove.

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   Determine what causal basis or support is given for the Proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   Look for any corroborative evidence or arguments that strengthen the Reason.

4. **Evaluate the Argument for Defects**:
   Check if the argument falls into any of the defective types defined (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>).

### Application to the given string:
1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - The Proposition (P) seems to be: The origin of life was an “accident”.

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - The Reason (R) presented against Tony's assertion focuses on attacking his character: "Tony is a godless SOB who has spent more time in jail than in church."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   - There is no direct additional proof provided to corroborate the Reason (character attack). However, there is a conclusion drawn that implies the dismissal of Tony's credibility: "so the only information we should consider from him is the best way to make license plates."

4. **Evaluate the Argument for Defects**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: Not applicable, as the argument isn't based on some individual cases being applied to all.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable, as the argument doesn't claim to list all possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Somewhat applicable, as the Reason provided (character attack) doesn't conclusively disprove the Proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Applicable, the causal basis (Tony's character) is weak for discrediting the assertion about the origin of life.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Not applicable, as the argument doesn't repeat the Proposition as the Reason.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Not applicable, as there isn't an appeal to a universally agreed-upon truth.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Not applicable, as the language and terms used are clear, not ambiguous.

### Conclusion:
The given argument primarily falls under **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because it dismisses the Proposition on the weak causal basis of attacking Tony's character, which doesn't compellingly address the truth or falsity of his claim about the origin of life being an accident. Additionally, it can be seen as having elements of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** since character attacks do not conclusively refute the Proposition.

Therefore, the final classification (<IDA>) of the given string is **<WCB>** with hints of **<IR>**.
