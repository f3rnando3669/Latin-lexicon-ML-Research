For 
To apply IDAA to the given statement "I can't trust that doctor's advice on how to raise my child. He has never been a mother," we'll first decompose the task of classifying the defective argument into specific steps.

### Step-by-step Decomposition (D) for IDA

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine the main assertion or claim being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Identify the reasoning or basis provided to support the Proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (PR)**: Check whether additional evidence is given to support the Reason.
4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**: Determine which type of defective argument (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP) the statement falls into, based on the nature of the Proposition, Reason, and Proof of Reason.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The main proposition (P) in the statement is:
> "I can't trust that doctor's advice on how to raise my child."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason (R) provided to support this proposition is:
> "He has never been a mother."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Proof of Reason (PR)
In this particular statement, there is no additional evidence or proof provided to support the reason. Therefore, PR is absent or implied.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type
Now, we need to classify the defective argument type based on the observed Proposition and Reason.

1. **Generalization (G)**: The assertion is not about a majority or minority conclusion applied universally, so G is not applicable.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not claim a complete enumeration of possibilities; so FE is not applicable.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness. The fact that the doctor has never been a mother does not necessarily mean he cannot provide good advice on raising children. This is a weak or irrelevant reason.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This could fit, as the causal link between being a mother and the ability to give advice on child-raising is not compelling.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason does not simply repeat the proposition, so RR is not applicable.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There is no consensus-based assertion in the argument, so FU is not applicable.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: There is no ambiguous language or phrase that can be taken differently here, so DEP is not applicable.

### Conclusion
Upon decomposing and evaluating the argument step by step, we identify that the defective argument type could be best classified as **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The reasoning that "He has never been a mother" is not a compelling or sufficient causal basis to establish the truth of the proposition "I can't trust that doctor's advice on how to raise my child."

Therefore, the classification of the defective argument (IDA) is:
> **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
