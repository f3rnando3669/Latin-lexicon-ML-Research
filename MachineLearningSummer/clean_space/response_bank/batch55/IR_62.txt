For 
Let's apply <IDAA> to the statement "America keeps telling China to be more respecting of journalism, but why don't they stop the American propaganda first?" by decomposing the task of classifying the string into specific defective argument types:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition and Reason in the statement
- **Proposition (<P>):** "America keeps telling China to be more respecting of journalism."
- **Reason (<R>):** "Why don't they stop the American propaganda first?"

### Step 2: Analyze the Reason (<R>) with respect to the Proposition (<P>)
- We need to determine whether the Reason (<R>) presented effectively establishes a causal basis for the Proposition (<P>).

### Step 3: Identify possible defective argument types 

#### Generalization (G):
- Does the statement incorrectly generalize a specific instance or majority of cases to all cases?
  - No, the statement does not seem to make a generalization about all instances or individuals.

#### Incomplete Enumeration (FE):
- Does the statement claim to have covered all possibilities but omit some?
  - The statement does not enumerate possibilities, so this defect does not seem applicable.

#### Inconclusive Reason (IR):
- Does the Reason (<R>) fail to conclusively prove the Proposition (<P>)?
  - The Reason provided ("Why don't they stop the American propaganda first?") does not directly address whether America should or should not tell China to respect journalism. Rather, it shifts focus to American actions.

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):
- Is the causal basis provided for the Proposition weak or not compelling?
  - The Reason provided does not create a compelling causal link explaining why America's stance on China's journalism should be dismissed or changed. Instead, it suggests hypocrisy without directly addressing the principal issue.

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):
- Does the Reason repeat the Proposition in different words?
  - The Reason does not merely reiterate the Proposition.

#### Presumptuous Consensus (FU):
- Is there an assumption that the Reason is universally agreed upon without basis?
  - The statement does not appear to assume a universal consensus on the issue.

#### Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):
- Is there ambiguity in the language that allows for multiple interpretations?
  - The use of the term “propaganda” could be seen as ambiguous because what constitutes propaganda could vary significantly between different viewpoints. However, this specific reasoning does not seem to mislead interpretation of the overall argument structure.

### Step 4: Classify the statement under the most fitting defective argument type
Based on this analysis, the statement most closely fits:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The Reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition. Instead, it introduces a separate issue (American propaganda) which does not directly refute or validate the proposition regarding America's stance toward China's respect for journalism.

Therefore, the classification of the string is <IR>.
