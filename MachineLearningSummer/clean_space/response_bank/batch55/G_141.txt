To apply the process of IDAA (the decomposition of the task IDA) to classify the argument in question, we need to break down IDA into specific steps, and then we can apply those steps to the provided argument:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine the main assertion being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Determine the causal basis or reasoning provided to support the proposition.
3. **Analyze for Defects**: Assess the Proposition (P), Reason (R), and any Proof of Reason (PR) against the possible types of defective arguments: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), and Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

Let’s apply these steps to the argument provided: “If we let teenagers wear whatever they want to school, they will no longer respect the rules and academic performance will decline.”

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
In this argument, the main proposition (P) is:
- **P**: "Teenagers will no longer respect the rules and academic performance will decline if they are allowed to wear whatever they want to school."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason (R) provided for this proposition is:
- **R**: "Allowing teenagers to wear whatever they want will cause them to no longer respect the rules."

### Step 3: Analyze the Defects
We now assess the proposition and reason against the types of defective arguments:

- **Generalization (G)**: The proposition suggests that allowing teenagers to wear whatever they want will universally result in a lack of respect for rules and a decline in academic performance. This could be seen as a Generalization, since it applies a specific outcome to all cases without sufficient evidence.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument doesn’t enumerate other potential factors that could influence respect for rules and academic performance. It presumes a complete enumeration without considering other factors, which makes it an Incomplete Enumeration.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. There is no clear causal link presented between wearing whatever they want and a decline in respecting rules or academic performance, making it an Inconclusive Reason.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The reasoning lacks sufficient causal evidence. Merely stating that allowing certain clothing will lead to lack of respect for rules isn't a compelling causal basis, so it can also be categorized as Insufficient Causal Basis.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason essentially restates a part of the proposition but doesn't provide new information or a separate argument. This is a Faulty Repetition of Proposition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument does not rely on presumptive consensus, so this defect type doesn’t apply.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: There's no ambiguous use of language that confounds the intended meaning in a significant way, so this doesn't apply here either.

### Conclusion:
The argument “If we let teenagers wear whatever they want to school, they will no longer respect the rules and academic performance will decline” can be classified under multiple defective argument categories:

1. **Generalization (G)**
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**

The argument largely suffers from a weak causative link and overgeneralization without sufficient evidence.
