For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "Oh, please. What would you know about labor laws? You don’t even have a job.", we need to decompose the advanced task of classifying the defective argument type into specific steps and then apply these steps systematically. Here is the detailed step-by-step decomposition:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The first step is to identify the proposition. This is the part where the assertion that is intended to be proved is set forth.

**Proposition in the argument:**
"You don’t even have a job."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Next, we need to identify the reason or the causal basis for the proposition. This is the part where the explanation or basis for the assertion is provided.

**Reason in the argument:**
"What would you know about labor laws?"

(or)

The reason is implied: "not having a job means lack of knowledge about labor laws."

### Step 3: Check for Proof of Reason (<PR>)
Identify if there is any proof presented to substantiate the reason. This may involve additional arguments or evidence supporting the reason.

**Proof of Reason in the argument:**
No explicit proof is presented. The argument relies on an implied assumption that only employed individuals can understand labor laws.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument
Using the classification types defined, we need to identify which type best fits the given argument:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument does not generalize a few instances to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: There is no enumeration of possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Whether the reason conclusively supports the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Whether the reason presents a weak causal link.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Whether the reason repeats the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Whether the argument relies on a disputed consensus.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: If any ambiguity in language usage is observed.

### Step 5: Evaluate the Reason
Assess whether the reason logically and sufficiently supports the proposition.

**Evaluation:**
The reason "You don’t even have a job" implies that lacking a job means one has no knowledge of labor laws. However, having a job or not does not inherently determine someone's knowledge about labor laws. This makes the causal basis weak.

### Step 6: Determine the Type
Using the evaluation, identify the best match among the defective argument types.

**Classification:**
The argument fits best with **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**. The causal basis provided (not having a job) is not compelling evidence for the proposition (lack of knowledge about labor laws).

Therefore, applying <IDAA> to the string "Oh, please. What would you know about labor laws? You don’t even have a job." results in the classification:

**Defective Argument Type: <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**
