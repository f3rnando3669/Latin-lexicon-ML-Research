For 
To apply IDAA to the given statement “No one has ever been able to prove definitively that extra-terrestrials exist, so they must not be real.”, we first need to decompose the advanced task (IDAA) into specific steps and then classify the statement accordingly.

### Steps of Decomposition (D)
1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: This is the statement that is being made or the conclusion that is being drawn.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: This is the rationale or basis offered for the Proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (PR)**: Determine if there is any corroborating proof or argument for the Reason.
4. **Check for Defects**: Evaluate the Proposition, Reason, and Proof of Reason against the types of defective arguments defined: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), and Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

Let's now apply these steps to the given statement:

### Step-by-Step Application (IDAA)

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - **P**: "Extra-terrestrials must not be real."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - **R**: "No one has ever been able to prove definitively that extra-terrestrials exist."

3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   - In this case, there is no additional corroboration provided for the Reason.

4. **Check for Defects**:
   - **Check for Generalization (G)**:
     - **G** is not directly applicable since the argument does not make a general assertion based on a part or majority of individuals.

   - **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
     - **FE** is not directly applicable since no claim of an exhaustive list of possibilities is made.

   - **Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
     - **IR** could be applicable. The Reason ("No one has ever been able to prove definitively that extra-terrestrials exist") does not conclusively demonstrate the truth of the Proposition ("Extra-terrestrials must not be real"). The lack of proof does not necessarily imply non-existence.

   - **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
     - **WCB** is related but slightly broader. It considers whether the causal basis is compelling. Here, the lack of definitive proof is presented as a causal basis for non-existence, which is not compelling.

   - **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
     - **RR** is not applicable because the Reason is not a mere repetition of the Proposition. 

   - **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
     - **FU** is not directly applicable since the argument does not rely on a supposed universal agreement.

   - **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
     - **DEP** is not applicable as the language used here is quite specific and not ambiguous.

### Conclusion
The defective argument in this statement is best classified under **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. The reasoning provided does not conclusively establish the truth of the proposition that extra-terrestrials must not be real. The lack of definitive proof is not sufficient to conclude non-existence.
