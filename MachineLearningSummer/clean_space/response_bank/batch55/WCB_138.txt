For 
To apply the process of IDAA (the application of decomposition D to the task IDA) to the statement "Suggesting that John F. Kennedy won the presidency over Richard Nixon exclusively because of the debate on TV," we need to break down the task IDA (classifying the given string into one of the defective argument types) into specific steps. Hereâ€™s how we can do it step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
Examine the statement to identify what is being asserted or proposed.
- **Statement:** "Suggesting that John F. Kennedy won the presidency over Richard Nixon exclusively because of the debate on TV."
- **Proposition (P):** "John F. Kennedy won the presidency over Richard Nixon exclusively because of the debate on TV."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
Look for the causal basis or reason that supports the proposition.
- **Reason (R):** "The debate on TV caused John F. Kennedy to win the presidency."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
Check if there are any additional arguments or evidence presented to corroborate the reason (R).
- **Proof of Reason (PR):** The statement does not specifically mention additional proof; it relies on the assertion that the TV debate was the decisive factor.

### Step 4: Classify any Defective Argument Types (ID) within the Proposition, Reason, or Proof of Reason
Compare the identified parts of the argument with the definitions of defective argument types to classify it.

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - **Definition:** An assertion based on some part or majority of individuals, but not necessarily applicable to all.
   - **Evaluation:** The statement does not generalize individuals; it instead cites a specific event (the TV debate) as the cause.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - **Definition:** Claiming a complete enumeration of possibilities but missing some pertinent ones.
   - **Evaluation:** The statement asserts a singular cause (the TV debate) without acknowledging other potential factors. This fits the pattern of incomplete enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - **Definition:** The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
   - **Evaluation:** While the TV debate could have been a factor, it is not necessarily conclusive evidence that it was the exclusive reason for JFK's victory. This weakens the reason.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - **Definition:** The causal basis submitted for the proposition is not compelling.
   - **Evaluation:** Suggesting that the TV debate alone caused the win might lack a compelling causal basis, given other potential factors at play.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - **Definition:** The reason repeats the proposition without additional information.
   - **Evaluation:** The reason (TV debate caused the win) is not a repetition of the proposition (JFK won), so this does not apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - **Definition:** Assuming proof as certain because "it is universally agreed upon."
   - **Evaluation:** The statement does not rely on a presumed universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - **Definition:** The proof can be taken in another sense than intended.
   - **Evaluation:** The language in the proposition is not ambiguous and conveys a clear point.

### Step 5: Determine the Most Appropriate Defective Argument Type
Based on the above evaluations, the statement primarily appears to exhibit characteristics of both "Incomplete Enumeration (FE)" by failing to consider other factors and "Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)" due to the weak causal connection asserted.

### Conclusion:
- **Classification:** The argument can be classified primarily as **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, with aspects of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
