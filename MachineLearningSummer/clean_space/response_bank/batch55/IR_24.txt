To apply the decomposition of the task (IDAA) to the classification task (IDA) for the given argument, we first need to break down the process into specific steps. Afterward, we'll apply each step to the argument in question.

### Decomposition of the Task (D)
1. **Identify the Parts of the Argument**:
    - Identify the Proposition <P>.
    - Identify the Reason <R>.
    - Identify any Proof of Reason <PR> if present.
2. **Evaluate Each Part for Defectiveness**:
    - Determine if the Proposition <P> fits any defective argument type.
    - Determine if the Reason <R> fits any defective argument type.
    - Determine if the Proof of Reason <PR> fits any defective argument type.
3. **Classify the Argument**:
    - Based on the evaluation, classify the overall argument into one of the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step-by-Step Application (IDAA)

#### 1. Identify the Parts of the Argument
- **Proposition <P>**: "Jesus’ favorite snack was raisins dipped in wine."
- **Reason <R>**: "I hold a doctorate in theology, have written 12 books, and personally met the Pope."
- **Proof of Reason <PR>**: There is no explicit additional argument to corroborate the Reason, so we'll treat Reason as the main support for the Proposition.

#### 2. Evaluate Each Part for Defectiveness
- **Evaluating Proposition <P>**:
  - It's a specific claim about Jesus' favorite snack, but its defectiveness would come from how the Reason supports it.
  
- **Evaluating Reason <R>**:
  - Check if <R> provides a causal basis that is compelling (<WCB>).
  - Check if <R> is simply a repetition of <P> (<RR>).
  - Check if <R> is inconclusive (<IR>).

- **Reason <R>** does not directly support the Proposition <P> in a meaningful way. The claim about the author's credentials relates more to their personal authority rather than providing a direct causal basis for the proposition. Therefore, it could be considered as not conclusively demonstrating the correctness of <P>. This fits as an **Inconclusive Reason** (<IR>).

#### 3. Classify the Argument
- Based on our evaluation, the argument's Reason does not directly support the Proposition in a compelling or necessary causal manner. Instead, it relies on the author's authority and credentials without providing specific evidence for the Proposition. This is characteristic of a defective argument type where the Reason is inconclusive.

### Classification
The argument can be classified as **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:

"I hold a doctorate in theology, have written 12 books, and personally met the Pope. Therefore, when I say that Jesus’ favorite snack was raisins dipped in wine, you should believe me." showcases an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, as the credentials of the speaker are insufficient to conclusively prove the claim about Jesus' favorite snack.
