Sure, let's apply the decomposition method \(<D>\) to the task of identifying the defective argument type in the given string \(<s>\) through \(<IDAA>\). The string is: "The CEO of that company hates the environment, so I hate him and won’t buy their products."

Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition \(<P>\)
The Proposition \(<P>\) is the main statement set forth to prove. Here, it is:
- "The CEO of that company hates the environment, so I hate him and won’t buy their products."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason \(<R>\)
The Reason \(<R>\) provides the causal basis for \(<P>\). Here, it seems to be:
- "The CEO of that company hates the environment."

### Step 3: Identify the Defective Argument Type
Next, identify which of the defective argument types the given statement falls under.

#### Analysis:
- **Generalization \(<G>\):** Not applicable here, since there is no broad assertion based on a part or majority referring to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration \(<FE>\):** Not applicable, as there is no claim of missed possibilities here.
- **Inconclusive Reason \(<IR>\):** Could be considered, but the reason is specific.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis \(<WCB>\):** This could apply if the reason "The CEO hates the environment" is not sufficiently compelling to establish why someone else should hate him and not buy their products.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition \(<RR>\):** Not applicable as \(R\) is not just a rephrase of \(<P>\).
- **Presumptuous Consensus \(<FU>\):** Not applicable because there's no consensus assumed.
- **Ambiguous Language Use \(<DEP>\):** Not applicable as there is no ambiguous language.

### Step 4: Match Against the Most Suitable Type
Through the process of elimination and matching, it seems that the best fit is:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis \(<WCB>\):** The reason "The CEO hates the environment" is not a compelling or sufficient basis for the conclusion that one should hate the CEO and avoid purchasing their products. 

Thus, the defective argument type for the given string \(<s>\) "The CEO of that company hates the environment, so I hate him and won’t buy their products." is \(<WCB>\).

### Conclusion
Therefore, applying \(<IDAA>\), we classify the given statement under the defective argument type \(<WCB>\), indicating an insufficient causal basis.
