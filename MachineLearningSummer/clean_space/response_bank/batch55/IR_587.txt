For 
To apply IDAA to the string provided, we need to decompose the advanced task of classifying the given argument into specific steps and then follow these steps to classify the argument as one or more of the defined defective argument types.

### Decomposition (\<D>) of the Advanced Task (\<IDA>):
1. **Identify Proposition (\<P>) and Reason (\<R>):**
   - Determine the main assertion or proposition (\<P>) that someone in the conversation is intending to prove.
   - Identify the reason (\<R>) provided to establish the truth of that proposition.

2. **Classify the Argument for Defect Types (\<IDA>):**
   - Analyze both the proposition (\<P>) and reason (\<R>) for any defects based on the defined defective argument types (\<G>, \<FE>, \<IR>, \<WCB>, \<RR>, \<FU>, and \<DEP>).
   - Identify which specific type of defect, if any, characterizes the argument.

3. **Provide Justification for Classification:**
   - Explain the rationale behind why the argument fits into the identified defect type.

### Apply Decomposition (\<D>) to the Given String:

#### 1. Identify Proposition (\<P>) and Reason (\<R>):

**Conversation:**
- Mike: "It is morally wrong to cheat on your spouse, why on earth would you have done that?"
  - **Proposition (\<P>):** It is morally wrong to cheat on your spouse.
  - **Reason (\<R>):** Not explicitly provided in this statement.
- Ken: "But what is morality exactly?"
  - **Challenging the definition of morality, no direct Proposition or Reason.**
- Mike: "It’s a code of conduct shared by cultures."
  - **Proposition (\<P>):** Morality is a code of conduct shared by cultures.
  - **Reason (\<R>):** This Reason is supporting the definition of morality.
- Ken: "But who creates this code?"
  - **Further challenging the basis of Mike’s definition, no direct Proposition or Reason.**

#### 2. Classify the Argument for Defect Types (\<IDA>):

Given the identified parts:
- The initial assertion by Mike that "It is morally wrong to cheat on your spouse" stands as the proposition.
- The supporting reason provided later by Mike is that "It’s a code of conduct shared by cultures."

Analyzing this:
1. **Generalization (\<G>):** Not applicable here; the argument doesn’t generalize from a specific instance to a broader claim.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE>):** Not applicable; the argument doesn’t claim a complete enumeration of possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>):** Could apply if the provided reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB>):** May apply if the reason provided is not compelling enough.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR>):** Not applicable; the reason doesn’t just repeat the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU>):** Could apply since Mike’s reason is based on a presumed consensus about morality being a cultural code, which could be disputed.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP>):** Could apply if the meaning of "morality" or "code of conduct" is ambiguous.

#### 3. Provide Justification for Classification:

- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>):** The reason ("It’s a code of conduct shared by cultures") does not conclusively establish why cheating on a spouse is morally wrong; it simply offers one cultural perspective on morality.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB>):** The causal basis (morality as a cultural code) might be considered weak or insufficiently developed, especially since morality can be argued from various other perspectives (philosophical, religious, personal).
- **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP>):** There is ambiguity in the definition of "morality" and "code of conduct." Ken’s follow-up question ("But who creates this code?") indicates that there is a misunderstanding or lack of clarity in how morality is defined or understood.

### Classification of the Argument:

Based on our analysis, the string "Mike: It is morally wrong to cheat on your spouse, why on earth would you have done that? Ken: But what is morality exactly? Mike: It’s a code of conduct shared by cultures. Ken: But who creates this code?..." can be classified as:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>)**
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB>)**
3. **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP>)**

This concludes the application of IDAA to the given string.
