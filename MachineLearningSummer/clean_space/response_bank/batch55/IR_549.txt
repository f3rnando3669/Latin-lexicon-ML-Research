For 
To apply \(\text{IDAA}\) to the string "We are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which the God of nature hath placed in our power," we need to break down the task of classifying the type of defective argument (IDA) step-by-step (D).

### Step 1: Understand the String (s)
In this step, we need to fully understand the argument presented in the string. The sentence implies that weakness is not a condition if a specific action—utilizing the means provided by nature—is taken. 

### Step 2: Identify the Proposition (P)
Examine the string to identify the main proposition:
\[ P = \text{"We are not weak"} \]
This is the assertion that is being put forth.

### Step 3: Identify the Reason (R)
Identify the causal basis for the proposition that is being provided:
\[ R = \text{"if we make a proper use of those means which the God of nature hath placed in our power"} \]
This is the reasoning given to support the proposition.

### Step 4: Decompose and Evaluate the Reason (R)
Evaluate the reasoning to see if it constitutes a proper justification for the proposition. 

### Step 5: Compare with Defective Arguments
Now we compare the reasoning with types of defective arguments to see if \( R \) fits into any category:
- **Generalization (\(G\))**: The statement does not generalize a specific instance to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\(FE\))**: The statement does not claim a complete enumeration.
- **Inconclusive Reason (\(IR\))**: \( R \) does not seem to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of \( P \). It is possible to make a "proper use" of natural means and still be weak due to other factors.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(WCB\))**: The causal basis might be weak as there's no compelling connection shown that proper use of natural means is sufficient to prevent weakness.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(RR\))**: \( R \) and \( P \) are not saying the same thing.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (\(FU\))**: The argument does not base its truth on universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (\(DEP\))**: The language seems clear enough and is not taken in another sense than intended.

### Step 6: Classify the Type
Based on the evaluation:
- \( \text{IR} \): \( R \) does not conclusively demonstrate \( P \). While proper use of means provided by nature could contribute to not being weak, it does not conclusively establish this.
- \( \text{WCB} \): The causal basis is weak; proper use of natural means alone may not be compelling enough to prevent weakness, as there might be other necessary factors involved.

In summary, applying \(\text{IDAA}\) to the string, we can classify it primarily under \( \text{IR} \) (Inconclusive Reason) and possibly under \( \text{WCB} \) (Insufficient Causal Basis).
