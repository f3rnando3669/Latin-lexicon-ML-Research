For 
Let's apply the method of decomposing the task <IDA> (classifying the argument) into specific steps using <IDAA> (application of decomposition) to the provided argument.

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**
In the given argument, the assertion or the proposition is:
"**Eating five candy bars and drinking two sodas before a test helps me get better grades.**"

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**
The causal basis stated for the proposition is:
"**I did that and got an A on my last test in history.**"

**Step 3: Classify the Defective Argument Type**
Now we need to determine which defective argument type best matches the identified components:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** This applies if the proposition is an assertion based on one instance or a majority but not universally applicable.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This applies if the proposition claims a complete set of possibilities but misses out on some pertinent ones.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This applies if the reason given does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This applies if the causal basis for the proposition is not compelling or robust.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This applies if the reason merely restates the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This applies if the proof of reason is assumed as certain because it is universally agreed upon although it's disputed.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** This applies if the proof of reason can be taken in another sense than intended.

**Step 4: Analyze for Defective Argument Type**
- The argument states that eating candy bars and drinking sodas helps in getting better grades based on a single instance (the last test in history).
- There might be many other factors that contributed to getting an A on the test which are not addressed.
- The argument does not conclusively prove the Proposition due to lack of a broader range of data points or supporting evidence.

Given these points, it's evident that the argument exhibits characteristics of a **Generalization (<G>)**:
- The proposition is based on a single instance rather than a broad or universally applicable situation.

**Conclusion:**
Applying <IDAA> to the provided string:
"**Eating five candy bars and drinking two sodas before a test helps me get better grades. I did that and got an A on my last test in history.**"
We classify the argument as a type **Generalization (<G>)**.
