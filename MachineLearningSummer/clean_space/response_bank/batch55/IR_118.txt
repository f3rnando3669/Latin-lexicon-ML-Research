For 
To apply the IDAA (which involves decomposing the task of classifying the given statement into specific steps), we will follow a systematic approach. Here, we'll break down the string "Not able to defend his position that evolution 'isn't true' Bob says that he knows a scientist who also questions evolution (and presumably isn't a primate)" to identify the type of defective argument it represents.

### Decomposition of the Task (D)

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Determine what Bob is trying to prove or assert.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Determine the causal basis Bob uses to support his proposition.

3. **Evaluate the Completeness and Validity:**
   - Check whether the R given is a valid and compelling reason.
   - Verify whether the argument form used matches any of the defective argument types.

4. **Classify According to Defective Argument Types:**
   - Classify the argument as one of the defective argument types such as Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

### Application of the Decomposition (IDAA)

1. **Identification of the Proposition (P):**
   - Bob is asserting that "evolution isn't true."

2. **Identification of the Reason (R):**
   - The reason Bob provides for his assertion is that "he knows a scientist who also questions evolution."

3. **Evaluation of Completeness and Validity:**
   - Is this reason sufficient and compelling as a proof of his proposition?
   - The provided reason is essentially an appeal to authority or an appeal to a specific individual without giving substantial evidence.

4. **Classification of Defective Argument Type:**
   - Analyze how this argument can fit one of the defective argument types:
     - **Generalization (G):** Not applicable, as Bob is not making a broad claim based on a small subset.
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable, no enumeration of possibilities present.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Somewhat applicable, but not the best fit.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Applicable because knowing a scientist who questions evolution is not a sufficiently compelling reason to reject evolution as a whole.
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Not applicable, Bob's reason isnâ€™t repeating the proposition.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Not exactly applicable as there is no claim of universal agreement.
     - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Not applicable here.

Given the reasoning and the steps followed, the most suitable classification for Bob's argument is:

**Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

We classified "Not able to defend his position that evolution 'isn't true' Bob says that he knows a scientist who also questions evolution (and presumably isn't a primate)" as an argument of type **WCB** because the causal basis provided, that knowing a scientist who questions evolution, does not compellingly substantiate the claim that evolution isn't true.
