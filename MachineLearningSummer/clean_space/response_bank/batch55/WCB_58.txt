To apply IDAA to the given string, we need to follow a structured approach to decompose the task of classifying the defective argument into specific steps. Here's how it can be broken down:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
Determine the main assertion or claim made in the argument.
- **Proposition (P):** "If I were a mayor, I’d ban Twinkies so no one would kill me."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
Identify the reason or causal basis presented to support the proposition.
- **Reason (R):** "Dan White ate a lot of Twinkies and then killed the Mayor of San Francisco."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason <PR>
Look for any corroboration or additional arguments presented to support the reason.
- **Proof of Reason (PR):** There is no explicit Proof of Reason provided in the argument.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument
Now that we have identified the components, we need to classify the argument based on the defective argument types provided. Here are the possible classifications and what they entail:
- **Generalization (G):** Does the argument make an assertion about all based on one or a few cases?
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Does the argument miss out on some pertinent possibilities?
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the causal basis for the proposition weak or not compelling?
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Does the reason simply restate the proposition?
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Is something assumed as certain based on a supposed consensus?
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Is there ambiguity in the way the argument is presented?

### Step 5: Determine the Specific Classification
Evaluate the argument based on the identified proposition, reason, and the possible defective argument types.

- The argument in question seems to link the consumption of Twinkies to the act of murder (Dan White's case) and then generalizes this to the idea that banning Twinkies would prevent murders.
- Here are some observations about the argument:
  - The Reason (R) does not conclusively demonstrate that Twinkies cause murder; it only shows a correlation in a single instance.
  - The causal basis (WCB) for banning Twinkies to prevent murders is weak and not compelling since it relies on one specific and perhaps unique case.

Given these observations, the defective argument type most fitting for this case is:

- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The causal basis for banning Twinkies to prevent murder is weak and not compelling based on the provided reason.

### Conclusion
Applying IDAA to the given string "Dan White ate a lot of Twinkies and then killed the Mayor of San Francisco. If I were a mayor, I’d ban Twinkies so no one would kill me." results in classifying the argument as **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
