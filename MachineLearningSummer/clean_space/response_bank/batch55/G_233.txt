For 
To apply the decomposition of the advanced task \( <t> \) into specific steps \( <D> \) to the task of classifying the argument string \( <s> \) as one of the defective argument types (i.e., to perform \( <IDAA> \)), we need to break down the process into clear, systematic steps. Here are the steps to decompose and apply:

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( <P> \))**: Determine what the argument is trying to prove.
2. **Identify the Reason (\( <R> \))**: Determine the causal basis presented to support the proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Reason (\( <R> \))**: Check if the reason given firmly supports the proposition or not.
4. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\( <PR> \))**: Check for additional evidence or arguments provided to support the reason.
5. **Classify the Argument \( <s> \)**: Based on the identified segments (\( <P> \), \( <R> \), and \( <PR> \)), classify the argument \( <s> \) into one of the defective argument types (\( <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP> \)).

Let's apply this decomposition to the given argument string:

**Argument string \( <s> \)**:
"Based on a survey of 1000 American homeowners, 99% of those surveyed have two or more automobiles worth on average $100,000 each. Therefore, Americans are very wealthy."

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( <P> \))**:
   - Proposition \( <P> \): "Americans are very wealthy."

2. **Identify the Reason (\( <R> \))**:
   - Reason \( <R> \): "99% of a surveyed group of 1000 American homeowners have two or more automobiles worth on average $100,000 each."

3. **Evaluate the Reason (\( <R> \))**:
   - The reason states that a specific survey group possesses wealth in terms of automobile ownership value. We need to check if this reason conclusively supports the proposition that Americans (in general) are very wealthy.

4. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\( <PR> \))**:
   - Proof of Reason \( <PR> \): The survey itself, the specific percentage, and the average worth of automobiles.

5. **Classify the Argument (s)**:
   - The argument claims that Americans are very wealthy based on a survey of only 1000 American homeowners. This is a classic case of generalization where the behavior or characteristic of a relatively small sample is extended to the entire population.
   - Therefore, the classification of this argument is \( <G> \) (Generalization).

Final Result:
- The argument string \( s \) "Based on a survey of 1000 American homeowners, 99% of those surveyed have two or more automobiles worth on average $100,000 each. Therefore, Americans are very wealthy." is classified as \( <G> \) (Generalization).
