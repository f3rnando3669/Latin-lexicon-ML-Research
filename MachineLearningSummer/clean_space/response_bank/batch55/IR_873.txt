For 
To apply <IDAA> to "You can't believe Jack when he says there is a God because he doesn't even have a job," we need to follow the steps of decomposition to identify which defective argument type, if any, this string represents. Here are the steps:

### Decompose <IDA> into <D>
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine the propositional statement and the reasoning used to support it.

2. **Analyze the Reason (<R>):**
   - Evaluate whether the reason provided supports the proposition effectively.

3. **Check for Defective Arguments:**
   - Cross-reference the argument with defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>.
   
4. **Categorize the Argument:**
   - Classify the string according to its matching defective argument type.

### Apply the Steps to the Given String

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>)
- **Proposition (<P>):** "You can't believe Jack when he says there is a God."
- **Reason (<R>):** "because he doesn't even have a job."

#### Step 2: Analyze the Reason (<R>)
- The reason given is that Jack's claim about God's existence should not be believed because he is unemployed. 

#### Step 3: Check for Defective Arguments
- **Generalization (<G>):**
  - Not applicable. This argument does not generalize a characteristic of one or some individuals to everyone.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
  - Not applicable. This argument does not enumerate possibilities.
  
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
  - Applicable. The reason provided (Jack's job status) is not logically connected to the veracity of his claim about the existence of God. The truth of the proposition (God's existence) does not logically depend on Jack's employment status. This reason does not conclusively demonstrate that Jack’s statement should not be believed.
  
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
  - Not applicable. The reason is not a mere repetition of the proposition.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
  - Not directly applicable, although it can be argued. There isn’t a weak causal basis; it’s more a non-causal basis.
  
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
  - Not applicable. There is no appeal to universal agreement in this argument.
  
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
  - Not applicable. The argument does not rely on ambiguous language.

#### Step 4: Categorize the Argument
- The most appropriately matching defective argument type is **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
  - The reason ("because he doesn't even have a job") does not directly relate to nor affect the proposition's validity ("You can't believe Jack when he says there is a God").

### Conclusion
The string "You can't believe Jack when he says there is a God because he doesn't even have a job." should be classified as an argument of type **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**.
