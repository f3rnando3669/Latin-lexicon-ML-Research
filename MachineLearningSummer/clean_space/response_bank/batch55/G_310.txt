For 
To apply the advanced task decomposition (IDAA) to the task of classifying the string "In both of the murder mysteries I have read, the District Attorney was the culprit. All mystery writers like to make lawyers out to be villains," we need to break down the task (IDA) into specific steps and then apply each of those steps to the given string. The process is as follows:

**1. Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - A Proposition (P) is a statement set forth to express what we intend to prove.

   In the string: 
   "In both of the murder mysteries I have read, the District Attorney was the culprit. All mystery writers like to make lawyers out to be villains."

   The Proposition (P) is:
   - "All mystery writers like to make lawyers out to be villains."

**2. Identify the Reason (R):**
   - A Reason (R) sets forth the causal basis establishing the truth of the Proposition (P).

   In the string:
   - "In both of the murder mysteries I have read, the District Attorney was the culprit."

**3. Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - Proof of Reason (PR) corroborates the Reason (R) with additional arguments or evidence.

   In the string:
   - There is no additional corroboration presented beyond the initial reason, so PR is absent or implied.

**4. Categorize the defective argument type by comparing the argument to defects:**
   - G: Generalization
   - FE: Incomplete Enumeration
   - IR: Inconclusive Reason
   - WCB: Insufficient Causal Basis
   - RR: Faulty Repetition of Proposition
   - FU: Presumptuous Consensus
   - DEP: Ambiguous Language Use

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

- The proposition (P) "All mystery writers like to make lawyers out to be villains" is being generalized based on the limited evidence provided in the reason (R) "In both of the murder mysteries I have read, the District Attorney was the culprit."

- There is no PR provided; the Reason (R) itself is the only support given for the Proposition (P).

- "In both of the murder mysteries I have read" suggests that the conclusion is based on a very limited sample size.

**Conclusion:**
- The argument falls under the defective argument type <G> (Generalization). The generalization arises because the reason (R) is based on the particular experiences of the author (reading two murder mysteries) being applied broadly to make a claim about all mystery writers.

**Classification:**
- <s> = "In both of the murder mysteries I have read, the District Attorney was the culprit. All mystery writers like to make lawyers out to be villains."
- The type of defective argument is <G> (Generalization).

Therefore:
- <s> is classified as <G>.
