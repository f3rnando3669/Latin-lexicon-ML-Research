Sure, let's apply the process of IDAA to the statement "No one has proven God exists, so He doesn’t."

### Step 1: Identify the Propositions, Reason, and Proof of Reason
- **Proposition (P):** He (God) doesn’t exist.
- **Reason (R):** No one has proven God exists.
- **Proof of Reason (PR):** Presumably, the statement does not include further arguments to support the Reason.

### Step 2: Evaluate Whether the Argument is Defective
We need to classify the argument into one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step 3: Analyze the Type of Defective Argument
1. **Generalization (G):** The argument does not seem to be making a general assertion from some subset to the whole.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument is not dependent on enumerating possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This could be a candidate. "No one has proven God exists" does not necessarily demonstrate that God doesn't exist, as absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Similarly, the reason given does not provide a compelling causal basis to establish the proposition. 
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The Reason is not simply a repetition of the Proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There isn’t an assertion of universal agreement.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language in the argument does not seem ambiguous.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis:
- The argument can be classified as **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The Reason provided ("No one has proven God exists") does not conclusively prove the Proposition ("He doesn’t [exist]").

Thus, applying IDAA to the statement "No one has proven God exists, so He doesn’t" classifies it as an <IR> type defective argument.
