To apply the process of IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as one of the defined defective argument types) to the given string, we will break down the task into specific diagnostic steps. We'll analyze the argument step by step to classify it correctly.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Identify what is being stated or claimed as true in the argument.
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Identify the causal basis provided to establish the truth of the Proposition.
   
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Identify the additional arguments or evidence provided to support the Reason.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:**
   - Analyze the argument to see if it fits any of the defective argument types defined: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

### Application to the Given String

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The Proposition in the argument is implicitly stated: "Such a crime deserves no verdict except guilty, guilty!"

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The Reason provided to support the Proposition is: 
- "Look at the bloody clothes, the murder weapon."
- "Imagine the helpless screams of the victim."

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
There is no explicit additional argument or evidence provided beyond urging the jury to imagine the crime scene and consider the physical evidence. The argument largely leans on the emotional and suggestive appeal rather than on further tangible proof.

#### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type
- **Generalization (<G>):** Not applicable, as the argument does not globally generalize from one instance to all instances.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Not applicable, no enumeration is present in the argument.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
  - The Reason given ("bloody clothes, murder weapon, helpless screams") is emotionally charged but does not conclusively demonstrate that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt based solely on the provided evidence. The connection between the evidence and the conclusion is not thoroughly established.
  - Therefore, the Reason does not conclusively support the Proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Could be considered, but isn't as strong a fit since the causality here is less about insufficient basis and more about inconclusiveness.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Not applicable, the Reason is not a mere repetition of the Proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Not applicable, no universal consensus is appealed to.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Not strongly applicable, as the language used doesn't seem to shift in meaning.

#### Conclusion
The argument primarily exhibits characteristics of an Inconclusive Reason (<IR>). The Reason does not conclusively prove the Proposition that the only verdict should be "guilty." It instead relies on emotional appeal and suggestive language rather than concrete, conclusive evidence.

Thus, the classification of the given argument is <IR>.
