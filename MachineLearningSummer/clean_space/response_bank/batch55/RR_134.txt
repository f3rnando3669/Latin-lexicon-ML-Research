Sure, let's apply the IDAA (decomposition and analysis) method to classify the given string "Plagiarism is deceitful because it is dishonest."

First, let's break down the argument to identify its components:

1. **Identify the Proposition (\<P\>):**
   - In the statement, the proposition (\<P\>) is: "Plagiarism is deceitful."

2. **Identify the Reason (\<R\>):**
   - The reason (\<R\>) is: "because it is dishonest."

3. **Analyze the Causal Basis:**
   - We need to determine whether the causal basis (\<R\>) is weak or compelling with respect to the proposition (\<P\>).

Now we can evaluate whether this argument falls into one of the defective argument categories:

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - Does the argument assert about all based on a part or majority? No, it does not generalize here.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - Does the argument claim a complete list of possibilities while missing relevant ones? No, it's not presenting a list.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - Does the reason (\<R\>) fail to demonstrate conclusively the proposition (\<P\>)? Here, "because it is dishonest" is simply restating the proposition using different wording without adding new information. This suggests the reasoning doesnâ€™t compellingly prove the deceitful nature of plagiarism.

4. **Weak Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - Is the reason (\<R\>) weak? Since "dishonest" and "deceitful" are synonyms, there's no independent causal basis established here.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - Is the reason just a repetition of the proposition in different words? Yes, "dishonest" is essentially synonymous with "deceitful," so this is a restatement of the same idea.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - Does the proof of the reason rely on assumed universal agreement? No, this isn't relevant here.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - Is there ambiguous language that could be interpreted in another way? No, the language used is not ambiguous.

Given these analyses, we can classify the argument:

### Classification:
- This argument is an example of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** because the reason provided ("it is dishonest") does not add new information or independently support the proposition; instead, it only repeats the proposition in different terms.

Therefore, the classification task (IDA) for the given string "Plagiarism is deceitful because it is dishonest" places it as type **RR**.
