Applying the process of IDAA involves following a systematic decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument into specific steps. The advanced task <t> in this case is the classification of the defective argument present in the statement. Here’s the step-by-step decomposition (D) of the task:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition and Reason
- **Proposition (P):** This is the assertion that sets forth what is being argued.
  - Initial proposition by Angus: "Scotsmen do not put sugar on their porridge."
  - Revised proposition by Angus: "No true Scotsman sugars his porridge."
- **Reason (R):** This part sets forth the causal basis for (P).
  - Reason given by Angus to support his revised proposition: Being a true Scotsman means not putting sugar on porridge.

### Step 2: Identify any Proof of Reason (PR)
- **Proof of Reason (PR):** This part offers additional support for the reason.
  - Angus’s appeal to a revised definition of a "true Scotsman" that doesn’t explicitly offer further factual evidence but relies on a redefinition.

### Step 3: Evaluate the Argument for Completeness and Look for Defective Types
- Evaluate whether (P), (R), and (PR) present a complete and logical argument.
- Check for known types of defective arguments: Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Weak Causal Basis, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Presumptuous Consensus, Ambiguous Language Use.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument
- **Identify if G (Generalization):** Is (P) based on a non-exhaustive observation applied universally?
  - No, the statement does not broadly generalize from limited data but redefines terms.
- **Identify if FE (Incomplete Enumeration):** Is (P) claiming completeness but missing parts?
  - No, it’s not about missing potential options.
- **Identify if IR (Inconclusive Reason):** Does (R) fail to conclusively support (P)?
  - No, the issue is not purely about the reason being inconclusive.
- **Identify if WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis):** Is the reason given weak or inadequate?
  - No, the primary issue is not the strength of the causal basis but the redefinition.
- **Identify if RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** Is the reason a mere repetition of the proposition?
  - No, there is a shift from a claim about Scotsmen to a claim about "true Scotsmen."
- **Identify if FU (Presumptuous Consensus):** Is the argument based on an assumed universal agreement?
  - No, it is not based on presumed consensus.
- **Identify if DEP (Ambiguous Language Use):** Is the argument using ambiguous language?
  - No, the language used is not ambiguous; it is a change in definition.

### Step 5: Conclude with the Classification
Based on the steps above, the type of defective argument present is:

**"No true Scotsman" fallacy (implicitly falls under the category of Generalization, but specifically a **Generalization redefinition**): Angus shifts the definition to exclude counterexamples without addressing the argument substantively. This can be identified as a version of a **special pleading** where exceptions are made through changing the criteria (No true Scotsman) rather than addressing the validity of the counterexample (Lachlan’s claim).

### Summary
The argument "Angus declares that Scotsmen do not put sugar on their porridge, to which Lachlan points out that he is a Scotsman and puts sugar on his porridge. Furious, like a true Scot, Angus yells that no true Scotsman sugars his porridge," can be classified as a variant of Generalization specifically known as the "No True Scotsman" fallacy.
