For 
To apply IDAA to the given sentence, we will decompose the advanced task of identifying the defective argument into specific steps, and then apply those steps to classify the argument appropriately.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of the IDA Task:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):** Determine what is being asserted.
2. **Identify the Reason (R):** Determine what reason is given to support the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):** Determine what proof is given to support the reason.
4. **Analyze the Type of Defect in the Argument:** Compare the identified parts of the argument with the defect definitions (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP).

### Application of Decomposition (IDAA) to the Given Sentence:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P):
- *What is being asserted?*
  - The assertion can be summarized as: "All kinds of cars need fuel to start."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R):
- *What reason is given to support the proposition?*
  - The reason provided seems indirect; the assertion stands alone without explicit causal reasoning in the sentence itself. We can infer that the argument relies on commonly accepted knowledge or presumed authority of the speaker.

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):
- *What proof is given to support the reason?*
  - The proof appears to be the reference to "Dra. Vicky Belo said," which acts as an appeal to authority.

#### Step 4: Analyze the Type of Defect in the Argument:
- *Is there a Generalization (G)?*
  - The statement does claim something about all kinds of cars based on a general trait (needing fuel), but without data on an exceptional case like electric cars.

- *Is there an Incomplete Enumeration (FE)?*
  - Yes, the statement misses pertinent possibilities like electric cars, which do not need fuel to start.

- *Is there an Inconclusive Reason (IR)?*
  - The statement does not really provide a causal reason; it rather appeals to authority.

- *Is there Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)?*
  - The provided assertion doesnâ€™t thoroughly explain the different types of fuel for all cars (e.g., electricity as fuel for electric cars).

- *Is there Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)?*
  - There is no repetition; hence, this defect does not apply.

- *Is there Presumptuous Consensus (FU)?*
  - The speaker seems to expect the proposition to be accepted based on her authority.

- *Is there Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)?*
  - The language doesn't seem ambiguous; it is mostly inaccurate in its assertion.

### Conclusion:
The most applicable defective arguments given the analysis are:
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The statement misses pertinent possibilities like electric cars, which do not use fuel in the conventional sense.
- **Generalization (G):** The generalizing claim that all cars need fuel is inaccurate.

Therefore, the fallacies being committed in the sentence are **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** and **Generalization (G)**.
