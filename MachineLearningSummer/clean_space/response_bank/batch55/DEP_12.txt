To apply the process of IDAA (decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument into specific steps) to the given statement, we need to systematically break down the task and classify the argument step by step.

Here is the text we'll analyze:
"I don't understand why you're saying I broke a promise. I said I'd never speak to my ex-girlfriend again. And I didn't. I just sent her some pictures and text messages."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
1. **Proposition (P)**: "I didn't break the promise."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
2. **Reason (R)**: "I said I'd never speak to my ex-girlfriend again, and I didn't."

#### Step 3: Evaluate the Sufficiency and Validity of the Reason
3. **Assessment of Reason**:
   - **Does the Reason establish the truth of the Proposition?** We need to analyze if the action of "not speaking" but "sending pictures and text messages" aligns with keeping the promise.

#### Step 4: Classification of the Reason (R)
4. **Classify Possibly Defective Reason (R)**:
   - **Evaluate if the Reason (R) truly and conclusively supports the Proposition (P)**. In this case, the Reason (R) provided ("I didn't speak, I just sent pictures and text messages") appears problematic because it interprets "speaking" in a narrow sense that excludes other forms of communication. Let's evaluate potential defects:
     - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The Reason (R) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition (P). The promise to "never speak" could reasonably be interpreted to include all forms of communication, not just verbal speech.
     - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The Reason (R) hinges on an ambiguous interpretation of the word "speak," taking it only in the narrow sense of verbal communication, while the promise might have implied a broader sense of communication.

#### Step 5: Determine the Most Suitable Classification
5. **Determine Final Classification**:
   - Given that the Reason does not conclusively establish that the promise was kept and depends on a potentially ambiguous interpretation of "speak," the most applicable classifications seem to be IR (Inconclusive Reason) and DEP (Ambiguous Language Use).

### Conclusion:
The argument "I don't understand why you're saying I broke a promise. I said I'd never speak to my ex-girlfriend again. And I didn't. I just sent her some pictures and text messages." is primarily classified as:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Because the Reason (R) provided does not conclusively support the Proposition (P).
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Because the term "speak" is used in a potentially misleading way, which could be interpreted broadly to cover all forms of communication, not just verbal.

Thus, through the application of IDAA, we identify the argument as involving an Inconclusive Reason (IR) and Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).
