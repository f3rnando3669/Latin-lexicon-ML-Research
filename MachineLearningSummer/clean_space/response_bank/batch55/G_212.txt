For 
To apply <IDAA> to the provided argument:

### Step 1: Identify the Components of the Argument
The argument provided is lengthy and appears to encompass several stages. Let's break it down into its constituent parts to analyze it efficiently.

1. **Proposition (<P>)**: "If you accept that the story of Adam and Eve was figurative, then you will do the same for most of the Old Testament stories of similar literary styles."
2. **Reason (<R>)**: "Once you are there, the New Testament and the story of Jesus does not make sense, which will lead you to believe that the resurrection of Jesus was a 'spiritual' one."
3. **Additional Argument/Steps**:
   - "Once you accept that, you won’t be a Christian anymore; you will be a dirty atheist."
   - "Then you will have no morals and start having sex with animals of a barnyard nature."
4. **Conclusion/Secondary Proposition (<P2>)**: "So you better take the story of Adam and Eve literally."

### Step 2: Analyze Each Part for Potential Defects
#### Analysis:

1. **Proposition (<P>)**:
   - "If you accept that the story of Adam and Eve was figurative, then you will do the same for most of the Old Testament stories of similar literary styles."
   - This part seems to be making a generalization about accepting figurative interpretations.

2. **Reason (<R>)**:
   - "Once you are there, the New Testament and the story of Jesus does not make sense, which will lead you to believe that the resurrection of Jesus was a 'spiritual' one."
   - This is supposed to establish a causal link but needs corroboration.

3. **Additional Arguments (<R2>, <R3>, etc. if we denote them as such)**:
   - These extend the reasoning towards consequences like becoming an atheist and indulging in immoral behavior.
   - Potential defects may include more generalization, improper causal basis, and unfounded assumptions.

4. **Conclusion/Secondary Proposition (<P2>)**:
   - "So you better take the story of Adam and Eve literally."
   - It asserts a direct action based on the previously presented reasons.

### Step 3: Identify the Specific Defective Argument Type(s)

#### <G> Generalization:
- Proposition <P> generalizes that accepting one story as figurative leads to the same treatment of all similar literary styles.
- The conclusion extrapolates that small religious interpretive shifts lead to extreme behavioral changes.

#### <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:
- The reasoning <R> does not provide compelling causation for the end result (immoral behavior).
- Claiming moral decay from religious interpretation changes lacks rigorous causal proof.

#### <IR> Inconclusive Reason & <FU> Presumptuous Consensus:
- The argument that following a figurative interpretation of scriptures leads to atheism and immorality does not conclusively prove the related propositions.

#### <DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:
- Some terms or steps could be ambiguous (e.g., "moral", "spiritual resurrection"); however, specifics need more in-depth context analysis.

### Step 4: Classify <s> as <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>

Based on the above analysis, the given argument mainly falls under:
1. **<G> Generalization**: Several aspects of the argument overgeneralize the implications of accepting scriptural stories as figurative.
2. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: The provided causal links are weak and not convincingly compelling.
3. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The reasons do not conclusively demonstrate the correctness or inevitability of the propositions.

### Conclusion:
The argument "If you accept that the story of Adam and Eve was figurative, then you will do the same for most of the Old Testament stories of similar literary styles. Once you are there, the New Testament and the story of Jesus does not make sense, which will lead you to believe that the resurrection of Jesus was a 'spiritual' one. Once you accept that, you won’t be a Christian anymore; you will be a dirty atheist, then you will have no morals and start having sex with animals of a barnyard nature. So you better take the story of Adam and Eve literally, before the phrase, 'that chicken looks delicious,' takes on a whole new meaning," exhibits Generalization <G>, Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>, and Inconclusive Reason <IR>.
