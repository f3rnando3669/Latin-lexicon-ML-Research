To apply the decomposition of the task of classifying a type-defective argument (IDA) to the given example string, let's proceed step-by-step.

### Steps for Decomposing Task (D)
1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine the assertion or claim that is being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Determine what causal basis is set forth for the claim.
3. **Classify the Argument Type**: Assess whether the Proposition, Reason, or Proof of Reason aligns with any of the defined defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP).

### Application of Decomposition to IDA (IDAA)

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**
- **P**: "I should go to the movies the night before every math test!"

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)**
- **R**: "I passed my math test after going out to the movies the night before."

**Step 3: Classify the Argument Type**

**Analysis of Potential Defective Argument Types:**

1. **Generalization (G)**
   - Description: The Proposition is an assertion based on some one part or a majority of individuals but not necessarily applicable to all.
   - In this case: The claim that going to the movies the night before every math test will always result in passing math tests is based on a single instance. This fits the definition of a Generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
   - Description: The Proposition claims a complete enumeration of possibilities but misses some pertinent ones.
   - In this case: This is not directly applicable since the argument does not lay out or claim all possibilities for success in math tests.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
   - Description: The Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.
   - In this case: Merely passing one test after going to the movies does not conclusively prove that the same will happen every time.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
   - Description: The Reason is weak if the causal basis for the Proposition is not compelling.
   - In this case: The causal link between going to the movies and passing the test is very weak and not compelling.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
   - Description: The Reason is weak when it repeats the Proposition in different words.
   - In this case: The Reason does not just repeat the Proposition but offers a (weak) causal link.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
   - Description: The Proof of Reason is assumed certain because it is "universally agreed upon."
   - In this case: Not applicable as the argument does not rely on presumed universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**
   - Description: The Proof of Reason can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended.
   - In this case: Not applicable as there is no significant ambiguous language in the statement.

**Conclusion: The Classification**
The argument presented in the string "I passed my math test after going out to the movies the night before. I should go to the movies the night before every math test!" is best classified as:

1. **Generalization (G)**: because the conclusion that one should always go to the movies before a math test based on a single instance is an overgeneralization.
   
2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: as the singular reason does not conclusively demonstrate that going to the movies will always lead to passing math tests.

3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: because the causal connection from the Reason to the Proposition is not strong or compelling.

Thus, the argument contains elements of multiple defective argument types, primarily **Generalization (G)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
