For 
To apply the decomposition of the task (D) to the task of classifying a string by identifying the defective argument type (IDA), we will follow a systematic breakdown of the process for the given string:

String (s): "A news story that reported that Captain Shah was under investigation was shared widely on social media. He must have been the individual who caused the crash."

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
   Identify what is being asserted or intended to be proved in the string.
   - **P**: "He (Captain Shah) must have been the individual who caused the crash."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
   Determine the causal basis or reasoning provided for the Proposition (P).
   - **R**: "A news story that reported that Captain Shah was under investigation was shared widely on social media."

### Step 3: Analyze the Reason (R) for Defects
   Examine whether the Reason (R) adequately supports the Proposition (P), and identify the type of defective argument if any.

#### Step 3.1: Check for Generalization (G)
   - Determine if P is an assertion based on a part or majority of individuals, applied to all.
   - **Analysis**: The assertion is about one individual, not a generalization.

#### Step 3.2: Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
   - Evaluate if P claims completeness but misses possibilities.
   - **Analysis**: The assertion does not enumerate possibilities; it makes a direct claim about one individual.

#### Step 3.3: Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR)
   - Assess if R fails to conclusively demonstrate P.
   - **Analysis**: The Reason (being under investigation and shared widely on social media) does not conclusively demonstrate that Captain Shah caused the crash.

#### Step 3.4: Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
   - Check if R presents a weak causal basis for P.
   - **Analysis**: "Being under investigation and shared widely" does not compel a conclusion of guilt; it's a weak causal link.

#### Step 3.5: Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
   - Confirm if R repeats P in different words.
   - **Analysis**: There's no repetition; the Reason is different from the Proposition.

#### Step 3.6: Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
   - See if PR is assumed certain due to universal agreement on a thing still in dispute.
   - **Analysis**: The argument does not mention universal agreement.

#### Step 3.7: Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)
   - Verify if PR can be taken differently than intended.
   - **Analysis**: The phrasing is clear without ambiguity.

### Step 4: Conclude the Defective Argument Type (IDA)
Based on the analysis, the Reason (R) "A news story that reported that Captain Shah was under investigation was shared widely on social media" has a weak causal basis for the Proposition (P) "He must have been the individual who caused the crash."

### Conclusion
The defective argument type (IDA) for the string is:
- **WCB** (Insufficient Causal Basis)

The decomposition of the task (D) led us through identifying and analyzing the parts of the argument to classify the defective argument type.
