For 
To apply **IDAA** to the given string "Invoke shared values and principles. They call upon the audience’s sense of right and wrong.", we must first follow the decomposition process. Here, we will break down this task step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the components of the given string
Examine the string to identify the proposition (\(<P>\)), reason (\(<R>\)), and proof of reason (\(<PR>\)), if any.

- **String**: "Invoke shared values and principles. They call upon the audience’s sense of right and wrong."
- **Proposition (\(<P>\))**: Suggests invoking shared values and principles.
- **Reason (\(<R>\))**: Claims that shared values and principles appeal to the audience's sense of right and wrong.

### Step 2: Determine if the argument presented fits into any of the defective argument types
This step requires examining the argument more critically to see if it fits any of the defective types (\(<G>\), \(<FE>\), \(<IR>\), \(<WCB>\), \(<RR>\), \(<FU>\), or \(<DEP>\)).

1. **Generalization (\(<G>\))**: Is the assertion generalizing a part to the whole?
   - No, the statement is not making a generalization but rather advising action based on shared values.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\(<FE>\))**: Is the assertion defective by missing pertinent possibilities?
   - No possibilities are enumerated; the focus is on an approach (using shared values).

3. **Inconclusive Reason (\(<IR>\))**: Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
   - This is possible. Invoking shared values and principles might not conclusively demonstrate that they always appeal effectively to the audience’s sense of right and wrong.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(<WCB>\))**: Does the reason provide a weak causal basis for the proposition?
   - It might be argued that just stating shared values appeal to the audience’s sense of right and wrong is not entirely compelling. This could fall under \(<WCB>\).

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(<RR>\))**: Does the reason merely repeat what was stated in the proposition?
   - The reason given does not appear to be just a repetition of the proposition; it elaborates on why the proposition is suggested.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\(<FU>\))**: Is the proof based on a presumed consensus?
   - **Yes**. The proof relies on the assumption that appealing to shared values and sense of right and wrong is universally effective, which might not be the case, as it is still in dispute.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\(<DEP>\))**: Does the proof use ambiguous language?
   - The language does not seem ambiguous in this context.

### Step 3: Determine the classification of the given string
After examining each defective type, we need to classify the string based on the observations made.

Given that:
- The assumption that invoking shared values and principles necessarily appeals to the audience’s sense of right and wrong could be seen as relying on a presumed consensus, and
- This presumption takes for granted that everyone agrees on the effectiveness of invoking shared values.

### Conclusion
The defective argument type that fits this string best is **Presumptuous Consensus** (<FU>).

### Final Classification
Therefore, applying **IDAA** to "Invoke shared values and principles. They call upon the audience’s sense of right and wrong." results in the classification: **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**.
