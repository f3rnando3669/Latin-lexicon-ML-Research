To apply the task of decomposing the IDA (Identification of Defective Arguments) into specific steps (D), we'll follow a structured approach to classify the argument given in the string according to the types of defective arguments defined.

Here are the steps for the decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)** - Determine what is being asserted or intended to be proved.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)** - Identify the reason given to support the Proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)** - Look for any additional arguments that might support the Reason.
4. **Evaluate the Reason (R) against the defined defective argument types** - Check if the Reason fits any of the defective argument types.
5. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (PR) against the defined defective argument types (if applicable)** - Check if the Proof of Reason fits any of the defective argument types.
6. **Classify the argument** - Based on steps 4 and 5, identify which defective argument type best classifies the given argument.

Now let's apply these steps to the argument: "Giving 10% of your income to the Church will free a child’s soul from Limbo into Heaven, so give your money!"

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The Proposition (P) is:
"Giving 10% of your income to the Church will free a child’s soul from Limbo into Heaven."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The Reason (R) is:
"If you give your money to the Church, it will free a child’s soul from Limbo into Heaven."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
There is no explicit additional argument or proof presented to support the Reason (R).

### Step 4: Evaluate the Reason (R) against the defined defective argument types
1. **Generalization (G)** - Does not apply as the argument does not generalize from a part to the whole.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** - Does not apply as the argument is not presenting a set of possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** - potentially relevant. The Reason given does not have a clear, conclusive foundation for making the Proposition true.
4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** - Does not apply as the Reason is not merely repeating the Proposition.
5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** - potentially relevant. The Reason does not provide sufficient causal evidence that giving money to the Church will indeed free a child's soul from Limbo into Heaven.

### Step 5: Evaluate the Proof of Reason (PR) against the defined defective argument types (if applicable)
No Proof of Reason (PR) is provided explicitly in this argument.

### Step 6: Classify the argument
Based on the evaluation in Step 4, we find two potential defective argument types:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

Given the context and the nature of the argument, "Inconclusive Reason (IR)" seems more applicable because the Reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition. The causal link implied by the Reason is unproven and thus fails to adequately support the Proposition.

### Conclusion
The argument "Giving 10% of your income to the Church will free a child’s soul from Limbo into Heaven, so give your money!" is classified as an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the Reason provided does not conclusively validate the Proposition.
