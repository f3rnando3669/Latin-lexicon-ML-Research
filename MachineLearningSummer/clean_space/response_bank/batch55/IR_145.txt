For 
To apply the task of identifying defective arguments (IDA) through decomposition (IDAA) to the string "This fallacy distracts from the argument by pointing out hypocrisy in the opponent," we'll follow a systematic approach. I'll break down the process into specific steps to classify the string.

1. **Understanding the String:**
   - First, we need to understand what the string is describing. The string is talking about a type of fallacy that diverts attention from the main argument by highlighting the opponent's hypocrisy.

2. **Identifying the Components:**
   - To classify the string according to the types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>, we need to analyze the nature of the fallacy described in the string.

3. **Matching Against Defective Argument Types:**
   - We need to match the description of the fallacy with the definitions provided for each defective argument type.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate and decide which category the string fits into.

Now, let's go through these steps in detail:

### Step 1: Understanding the String
The string describes a fallacy where the tactic is to distract from the argument by focusing on the opponent's hypocrisy. This description aligns with a specific type of fallacy known as the "tu quoque" fallacy, which is an attempt to discredit the opponent's position by asserting their failure to act consistently in accordance with that position.

### Step 2: Identifying the Components
- Proposition (<P>): The string doesn't provide a direct proposition but implies that the opponent's argument should be ignored due to their hypocrisy.
- Reason (<R>): The reason implied is the opponent's hypocrisy.
- Proof of Reason (<PR>): The string does not explicitly provide a proof but the distraction is implied to be a tactic used to avoid addressing the argument.

### Step 3: Matching Against Defective Argument Types
- <G> Generalization: Does not discuss the generalization of a few instances to all.
- <FE> Incomplete Enumeration: Does not describe a situation where possibilities are missed.
- <IR> Inconclusive Reason: The reason of opponent’s hypocrisy does not directly address the correctness of the opponent's argument.
- <RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition: Does not repeat the proposition.
- <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis: The causal basis (opponent’s hypocrisy) isn’t a compelling reason to reject the argument.
- <FU> Presumptuous Consensus: The string does not reference a presumed consensus.
- <DEP> Ambiguous Language Use: The language is straightforward and not subject to multiple interpretations.

### Step 4: Evaluation
Upon close examination, the string "This fallacy distracts from the argument by pointing out hypocrisy in the opponent" matches most closely with:

- <IR> – Inconclusive Reason: The reason (hypocrisy) provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness or incorrectness of the opponent's argument. Pointing out hypocrisy is an attempt to undermine the opponent without addressing the argument itself.

Therefore, the defective argument type for the string is:
**<IR> – Inconclusive Reason**

This completes the application of IDAA to classify the string.
