To apply the decomposition of the task (D) to the task of classifying (IDA) the given string "an attempt to persuade the reader/audience based on feelings or emotions; emotional response", we will proceed in a structured manner. Here are the steps:

### Step 1: Understanding the Target String
First, we need to fully understand the target string:

- "an attempt to persuade the reader/audience based on feelings or emotions; emotional response"

### Step 2: Identify the Components
Now we will look at the possible components of the target string in terms of Propositions (P), Reasons (R), and Proofs of Reason (PR).

1. **Proposition (P)**: The target string essentially is making an assertion.
2. **Reason (R)**: The rationale provided is "based on feelings or emotions; emotional response".

### Step 3: Recognize Defective Arguments
We need to categorize the given string based on the defined types of defective arguments: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), and Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

Looking at the definitions:
- **Generalization (G)** involves asserting something based on a part or majority but not necessarily applicable to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** involves claiming a complete enumeration but missing some possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** involves the reason not conclusively demonstrating the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** involves a weak causal basis.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** involves the reason saying precisely the same as the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** involves assuming something as certain based on universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)** involves the terms used being ambiguous.

### Step 4: Match the String to Defective Argument Type
Evaluate the target string against each defective argument type:

1. **Generalization (G)**: There is no mention of a majority vs. all, so it's not a G.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: No attempt of enumeration is present, so it's not an FE.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason here is "based on feelings or emotions," which makes the argument rely on subjective emotional responses. Emotions are inherently inconclusive and subjective, thus this can be seen as more susceptible to IR.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: "Feelings or emotions" are generally not strong, objective bases for a proposition. This can indicate WCB as the basis is non-compelling from an evidence-based standpoint.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason offered (feelings or emotions) is not verbatim repeating the proposition, so it is not RR.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There is no reference to universal agreement, so this is not FU.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language used seems clear and not susceptible to different interpretations, thus it is not DEP.

### Step 5: Conclusion
Based on the evaluation:

- The closest defective argument types are **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** due to the reliance on subjective emotional responses, which are neither conclusive nor compelling in establishing a rational argument.

Therefore, the classification of the string "an attempt to persuade the reader/audience based on feelings or emotions; emotional response" is:

**IR** and **WCB** (Inconclusive Reason and Insufficient Causal Basis).
