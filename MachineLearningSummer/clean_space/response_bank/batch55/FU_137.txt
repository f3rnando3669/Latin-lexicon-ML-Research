For 
To apply the IDAA (Decomposition of Identification of Defective Arguments) to the string "Appealing to popularity or the fact that many people do something as an attempted form of validation," we will go through specific steps to classify the string <s> as one of the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of IDA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Analyze the given string to understand what it is attempting to validate or prove. In this case, the proposition seems to be that something is true or validated because many people do it or believe it.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Determine the reason being provided to support the proposition. Here, the reason provided is that many people do or believe in something.

3. **Classify the Defective Argument type:**
   - Match the reasoning type with one of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

### Application of IDAA to the given string:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - The implied proposition in the string is: "X is validated."
   - Where X could be any action or belief.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - The reason being provided is: "Many people do X" or "Many people believe in X."

3. **Classify the Defective Argument type:**
   - **Generalization (G):** This involves making a broad conclusion based on some part or majority without it necessarily being applicable to all. This doesn't apply here.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This involves claiming to have considered all possibilities but missing some. This doesn't apply here.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This involves the reason not conclusively demonstrating the truth of the proposition. While the argument is weak, it's not just about being inconclusive.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This involves the causal basis being weak. Popularity is not a causal relationship.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This involves the reason being a repetition of the proposition. This doesn't apply here.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This involves assuming something as certain because "it is universally agreed upon," while itâ€™s still in dispute. The statement does imply validation based on consensus.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** This involves the proof of reason being ambiguous. This doesn't apply here.

Given the definitions of defective argument types, the most fitting classification for "Appealing to popularity or the fact that many people do something as an attempted form of validation" is:

**Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**

- **Rationale:** The argument assumes validation based on the premise that it is universally accepted or popular, which is a form of presumed consensus.

### Conclusion:
Applying IDAA to the string, we classify it as type **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**.
