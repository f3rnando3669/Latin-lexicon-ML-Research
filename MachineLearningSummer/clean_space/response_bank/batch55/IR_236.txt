To apply the defined process of decomposing the task of classifying a defective argument (<IDAA>) to the given argument exchange between Speaker 1 and Speaker 2, we need to follow the steps of breaking down the advanced task (<t>), which in this case is the task of <IDA>, into specific steps of analysis.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

**Step 1: Identify the propositions and reasons in the argument exchange.**

- **Speaker 1's Proposition (P1):** "I think it’s terrible that a game hunter killed Cecil the lion."
- **Speaker 2's Proposition (P2):** "What about all the babies that are killed every day by abortion?"

**Step 2: Evaluate the type of defective argument each proposition or reason may fall into.**

- **Contextual Analysis:** Assess whether Speaker 2’s response is intended to counter or undermine the original proposition by Speaker 1. This step helps in understanding if the response is relevant to the initial point or a deflection.

**Step 3: Apply the definitions of defective arguments to classify the given exchange.**

- **Determine if <G> (Generalization) applies:** Is Speaker 2 making an assertion that the outrage for one occurrence should apply to all similar occurrences? Not strictly.
  
- **Determine if <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration) applies:** Is Speaker 2 failing to consider all possibilities or relevant aspects of Speaker 1's proposition? Not directly applicable here.
  
- **Determine if <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) applies:** Does Speaker 2 provide a reason that does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of his implied proposition? Partially, but not entirely fitting.
  
- **Determine if <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition) applies:** Is there mere repetition without adding new reasoning? No, Speaker 2 introduces a new topic.
  
- **Determine if <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) applies:** Does Speaker 2 submit a weak causal basis? Possibly, but it’s more a matter of relevance.
  
- **Determine if <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus) applies:** Is Speaker 2 assuming consensus on the issue of abortion to dismiss the concern about the lion? This is not clearly indicated.
  
- **Determine if <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use) applies:** Is there ambiguous language in Speaker 2’s response? No obvious ambiguity exists.

### Step-By-Step Application

**Step 4: Closely examine if any defective argument matches fully.**

- Speaker 2's response does not directly address Speaker 1's concern about Cecil the lion and instead introduces a different, highly charged issue (abortion). This form of argument is often referred to as a "whataboutism" or a red herring, where the responder deflects from the original topic and introduces another issue.

### Classification:

- **<IDAA> results in the classification of <s> ("Speaker 1: I think it’s terrible that a game hunter killed Cecil the lion.
  Speaker 2: What about all the babies that are killed every day by abortion?")** as **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** and **a form of Red Herring/Fallacious Distractor**, which doesn't fit perfectly within the given defective arguments but highlights introducing an unrelated argument without directly addressing the original proposition. 

By applying <IDAA>, we determined that while none of the defective argument definitions perfectly fit, the closest classification is an inconclusive reason and usage of a red herring or fallacious distraction.
