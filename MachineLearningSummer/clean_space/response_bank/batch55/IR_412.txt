To apply IDAA to the string "The is zero doubt that she has the condition. She scored high on two separate diagnostic tests for it and both tests have shown extremely high validity. That proves she has it," we will break down the task of classifying defective argument types into specific steps. Here is the step-by-step decomposition:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDAA:

1. **Identify Proposition (P)**:
   - The proposition is the statement being put forward for proof. In this case, "There is zero doubt that she has the condition."

2. **Identify Reason (R)**:
   - The reason provides the causal basis for the proposition. In this text, it is: "She scored high on two separate diagnostic tests for it and both tests have shown extremely high validity."

3. **Identify Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   - The proof of reason corroborates the reason with additional arguments. Here, it is the claim about the validity of the tests: "Both tests have shown extremely high validity."

4. **Analyze Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: The proposition is not a broad generalization based on a sample. Hence, it doesn't fit this category.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: There is no enumeration of all possibilities; rather, the argument is based on two specific tests. Hence, it doesn't fit this category.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Evaluate if the reason conclusively proves the proposition. Here, the reason includes diagnostic tests' scores and their validity, which might be sufficient in many cases.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Check if the reason submitted is compelling. In this case, high scores on valid diagnostic tests generally provide a strong causal basis.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason provided is not merely a repetition of the proposition. Hence, it doesn't fit this category.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Check if the PR assumes something is universally agreed upon that is in dispute. Here, the validity of the tests is asserted but could be scrutinized. However, it is not asserted solely on being universally agreed upon.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Check if the PR's language could be taken in another sense than intended. No apparent ambiguous language use is evident here.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Upon the analysis, there isn't a clear indication of the argument being defective within the given classes. However, if we consider potential subtlety:
      - There might be room to argue for **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** if one believes the test scores may not be fully comprehensive or encompass all conditions related to the diagnosis, i.e., other factors might need to be considered.
      - Alternatively, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** might be argued if critics consider test scores and validity not conclusively proving the condition's presence without additional evidence.

### Final Classification:
Given the text and the structured step analysis, the string appears most closely scrutinizable under **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** or **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, depending on the robustness of additional supportive evidence perceived essential by critics. Thus, let's classify it as:
- **<s> is of type: WCB or IR**.

Further scrutiny and context about the tests and condition might specify which of the two categories fits better.
