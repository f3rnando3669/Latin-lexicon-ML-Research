For 
To apply <IDAA> to the classification task <IDA> for the given string ("Wilma: You cheated on your income tax. Don't you realize that's wrong? Walter: Hey, wait a minute. You cheated on your income tax last year. Or have you forgotten about that?"), we will decompose the advanced task <t> into specific steps and analyze the argument to determine which defective argument type it falls under.

### Steps for <IDAA> (Applying <D> to <IDA>):

1. **Identify the propositions (<P>) and reasons (<R>) in the dialogue.**
2. **Determine if there are any proofs of reasons (<PR>) presented.**
3. **Analyze the structure and content of the argument for signs of defects according to the defined defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>).**
4. **Classify the defective argument type(s) present in the dialogue.**

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Propositions (<P>) and Reasons (<R>):**
   - **Wilma's Statement:** 
     - Proposition (<P>): "You cheated on your income tax."
     - Reason (<R>): "Don't you realize that's wrong?" (Implying a moral judgment)
     
   - **Walter's Statement:** 
     - Proposition (<P>): "You cheated on your income tax last year."
     - Reason (<R>): "Or have you forgotten about that?" (Pointing out perceived hypocrisy)

2. **Determine if there are any Proofs of Reasons (<PR>) presented:**
   - There are no additional arguments presented that corroborate the reasons. Therefore, no <PR> is explicitly identified in the given dialogue.

3. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** Not applicable, since there's no general claim about a population based on a part.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Not applicable, since there's no claim of complete enumeration of possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Might be applicable. Walter's counter-argument does not address the ethical issue but shifts focus to Wilma's past behavior.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Not applicable, since there's no insufficient causal basis presented.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Not applicable, because Walter's counter is a different claim rather than repeating Wilma's proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Not applicable, since there's no reliance on universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Not applicable here since the meanings of the given statements are clear and unambiguous.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type(s):**
   - Upon analyzing the above steps, Walter's response can be classified as shifting the argument to point out the accuser's hypocrisy without addressing the initial moral claim. This is a form of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, since the reason provided by Walter fails to conclusively demonstrate that Wilma's claim about the wrongdoing is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The defective argument type present in the dialogue is **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**. Walter's response does not address the ethical issue raised by Wilma but instead attempts to undermine her position by pointing out her past behavior, which does not conclusively prove the original proposition (the wrongness of cheating on income tax).
