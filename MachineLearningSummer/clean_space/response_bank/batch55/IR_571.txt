For 
The task at hand involves classifying the given string "Because students do not do homework virtually when quarantined, we should get rid of all computers" as one of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>). This requires the decomposition of <IDA> into specific steps. Let's apply IDAA (Decomposition of <IDA>):

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Determine the main assertion or claim intended to be proven.
   - In the given string: "we should get rid of all computers".

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
    - Identify the causal basis for the Proposition.
    - In the given string: "Because students do not do homework virtually when quarantined".

3. **Evaluate the Reason against the Proposition**:
    - Check if the causality and relevance between <R> and <P> justify the proposed action.

4. **Determine if the Proposition holds up**:
    - Identify if there is any aspect of the argument that falls into the listed defective types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP>).

### Application of Identified Steps

1. **Proposition (<P>)**:
   - "We should get rid of all computers."

2. **Reason (<R>)**:
   - "Because students do not do homework virtually when quarantined."

3. **Evaluation**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument might be a generalization; it takes a specific behavior (students not doing homework when quarantined) and applies it broadly as a justification for getting rid of all computers, implying that this behavior applies universally and sufficiently justifies the action.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This does not explicitly claim a complete enumeration of all reasons to get rid of computers, so <FE> is less likely.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided (students not doing homework) does not conclusively demonstrate why all computers should be eliminated. Thus, it is an inconclusive reason.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument could also fall under <WCB>, as the reason provided ('students not doing homework virtually') is an insufficient basis for the broad action of getting rid of all computers. There is a lack of compelling causal connection.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The reason and proposition are not restatements of each other. So, not <RR>.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: There is no appeal to a universal agreement in this argument. So, not <FU>.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The argument is clear in terms of language; ambiguity does not seem to be the issue.

From the steps and evaluations above, the string 'Because students do not do homework virtually when quarantined, we should get rid of all computers' most closely fits:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: because the reasoning provided does not conclusively prove the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: because the causal link between students not doing homework virtually and the need to remove all computers is weak and not compelling. 

The primary applicable defective argument type is <WCB>.
