Sure, let's apply the process of IDAA to classify the string into one of the defective argument types. The string is:

"You haven't held a steady job since 1992. Worse than that, we couldn't find a single employer who'd provide you with a good reference."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of Task (D):
1. **Identify the Proposition (P):** Look for the main claim or assertion being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (R):** Determine what reason is being given to support the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):** Identify any additional arguments or evidence provided to support the reason.
4. **Classify the Defective Argument (IDA):** Using the identified P, R, and PR, classify the argument as one of the defective types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

### Applying IDAA to the String:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Proposition: "You haven't held a steady job since 1992."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Reason: "We couldn't find a single employer who'd provide you with a good reference."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - The string does not provide additional arguments or evidence beyond the reason, so there is no PR explicitly stated.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument (IDA):**
   - Let's analyze the nature of the identified P and R.
   - The reason given ("We couldn't find a single employer who'd provide you with a good reference") is used to support the proposition ("You haven't held a steady job since 1992"). 
   - However, the reasoning does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition, because not having references does not necessarily mean one hasn't held a steady job.

Therefore, the argument seems to suffer from the defect known as **"Inconclusive Reason (IR)"** since the reason given does not conclusively prove the proposition.
