For 
To apply <IDAA> to "Dicky: So how do you think life began?
Ralphie: Simple.  Aliens from another planet seeded this planet with life billions of years ago.
Dicky: OK, but how did that alien life form begin?
Ralphie: Simple.  Aliens from another planet seeded that planet with life.
," we need to decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps. Below is the step-by-step decomposition:

### Step 1: Identify the Parts of the Argument
Isolate and identify the main proposition (P), the reasons (R), and any potential proof of reasons (PR)

- Proposition (P1): "Aliens from another planet seeded this planet with life billions of years ago."
- Reason (R1): There is no explicit causal basis stated for P1.
- Proposition (P2): "Aliens from another planet seeded that planet with life."
- Reason (R2): There is no explicit causal basis stated for P2.

### Step 2: Determine if the Argument is Defective
Analyze the identified parts against the types of defective arguments defined: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), and Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

### Step 3: Classify the Argument
Focus on each type of defective argument and see which type matches the identified components:

- **Generalization (G)**: 
  - P doesn't seem to be a generalization of a part to the whole.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
  - No claim to enumerate all possibilities.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
  - Both R1 and R2 lack causal bases entirely, so this doesn't apply formally here.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
  - Similar to above, there's no actual causal basis.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
  - Each argument's reason (R) seems to repeat its own proposition: R implies a repeat of P.
  
    Specifically:
    - P1: "Aliens from another planet seeded this planet with life billions of years ago."
    - R1: Implied repetition in the context, if R1 is taken as a justification.
    - P2: "Aliens from another planet seeded that planet with life."
    - R2: Similarly, implied repetition in the subsequent argument.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
  - No consensus appeal.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
  - No ambiguity in the language.

### Step 4: Conclude the Argument Type
Given the steps outlined, the argument provided fits best under the definition of Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR).

### Summary
Applying <IDAA> to the argument reveals it as a defective argument of type <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).

### Final Classification
- The argument is of type <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
