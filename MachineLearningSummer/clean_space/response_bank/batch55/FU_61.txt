For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of IDA into specific steps) to classify the defective argument in the given string "Going to prom (when you don't want to) because 90 percent of your classmates are going," we can break down the process as follows:

1. **Identify the type of argument presented in the string:**
   The string makes an assertion about going to prom based on the behavior of the majority of classmates.

2. **Analyze the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition: You should go to prom.
   
3. **Examine the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason: 90 percent of your classmates are going.

4. **Consider the Potential Defects:**
   - Determine if the argument involves a defect such as:
     - **Generalization (G):** Is the assertion about going to prom based on the actions of the majority?
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Is an incomplete set of options being presented to support the decision of going to prom?
     - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does the reason (that 90 percent are going) fail to conclusively support the conclusion?
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the causal connection between the reason and the proposition weak in compelling someone to go to prom?
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Is the reason simply restating the proposition?
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Is the reason based on an assumed universal agreement that isn't actually established?
     - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Does the proof or reason involve ambiguous language?

5. **Apply the Relevant Criteria:**
   - In this case, the argument "Going to prom (when you don't want to) because 90 percent of your classmates are going" appears to rely on the behavior of the majority (90 percent of classmates) as sufficient grounds for the action (going to prom).

6. **Classify the Defective Argument:**
   - The argument seems to make an assertion based on the actions of the majority, but this does not necessarily apply to the individual since it is not compelling that *you* must go just because *they* are going.
   
7. **Conclusion:**
   - The argument can be classified as **Generalization (<G>)** because it assumes that since the majority are going to prom, the same should apply universally, even though this may not be relevant for every individual.

Therefore, after decomposing the task into specific steps, we classify the defective argument in the string "Going to prom (when you don't want to) because 90 percent of your classmates are going" as Generalization (<G>).
