For 
To apply the framework <IDAA> to the given argument "We haven’t proven aliens didn’t create life on earth, so aliens created life on earth," we need to follow a structured decomposition of the task of identifying the defective argument type (<IDA>). Here are the specific steps involved in this decomposition (<D>):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Determine the main claim that is being asserted.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Determine the causal basis or supporting claim that is provided for the Proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Completeness and Validity of the Reason (<R>) in Supporting the Proposition (<P>):** Check for potential issues with the Reason.
4. **Examine for Specific Defective Argument Types:** Assess whether the argument falls into one or more of the defective argument categories defined (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Application

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
In the statement "We haven’t proven aliens didn’t create life on earth, so aliens created life on earth," the main claim (Proposition) is:
- Proposition (<P>): "Aliens created life on earth."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The supporting claim (Reason) provided for this proposition is:
- Reason (<R>): "We haven’t proven aliens didn’t create life on earth."

#### Step 3: Evaluate the Completeness and Validity of the Reason (<R>) in Supporting the Proposition (<P>)
Here, we need to scrutinize whether the Reason provided is sufficient to establish the truth of the Proposition.

- The Reason: "We haven’t proven aliens didn’t create life on earth," merely states that there is an absence of disproof, but it does not provide any positive evidence or causal basis that aliens did create life on earth.

#### Step 4: Examine for Specific Defective Argument Types
Now, we categorize which specific defective argument type the above reasoning corresponds to.

- The Reason "We haven’t proven aliens didn’t create life on earth" does not provide conclusive evidence to support the Proposition "aliens created life on earth." It's relying on a lack of disproof as if it were proof. This is a logical fallacy known as shifting the burden of proof. Therefore, it’s an instance where the Reason provided doesn’t conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.

Given the definitions, this reasoning failure matches the description of "Inconclusive Reason" (<IR>):

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** <R> does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the <P>.

### Conclusion
Using the <IDAA> methodology, we've determined that the argument "We haven’t proven aliens didn’t create life on earth, so aliens created life on earth" can be classified as an instance of the defective argument type:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>).**
