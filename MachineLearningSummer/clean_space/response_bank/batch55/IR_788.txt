To apply IDAA to the given argument, we need to decompose the task of classifying the argument's defectiveness into specific steps, and then execute those steps. Here's a systematic approach:

### Step 1: Identify the Components of the Argument
First, let's identify the Propositions (\<P\>), Reasons (\<R\>), and Proof of Reason (\<PR\>) in the given statement.

**Statement: "The university committee for student discipline investigated all engineering tests for the past five years, and they found no evidence of cheating. We thus declare that no cheating has taken place during those five years."**

- **\<P\> (Proposition)**: "No cheating has taken place during those five years."
- **\<R\> (Reason)**: "The university committee for student discipline investigated all engineering tests for the past five years and found no evidence of cheating."

### Step 2: Analyze the Reason (\<R\>) and Proof of Reason (\<PR\>)
Determine how \<R\> and \<PR\> (if there is one) support \<P\>:

- **\<R\>**: "The university committee for student discipline investigated all engineering tests for the past five years and found no evidence of cheating."

There is no explicit \<PR\>; the reason seems straightforward without additional arguments. 

### Step 3: Determine the Defective Argument Type
We'll check if the argument fits any of the defective argument types \<G\>, \<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<RR\>, \<WCB\>, \<FU\>, or \<DEP\>:

1. **\<G\> (Generalization)**: Is \<P\> a generalization based on a subset?
   - No, it seems to be based on the entirety of the tests over five years.

2. **\<FE\> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: Does \<P\> claim to be a complete enumeration but miss some possibilities?
   - Investigating all engineering tests implies completeness, but there's a possibility they didn't consider all forms of cheating beyond detectable ones.

3. **\<IR\> (Inconclusive Reason)**: Does \<R\> fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of \<P\>?
   - Yes, the lack of evidence does not logically ensure that no cheating occurred; it only indicates that no cheating was detected.

4. **\<RR\> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: Does \<R\> merely restate \<P\>?
   - No, \<R\> is not a mere repetition of \<P\>.

5. **\<WCB\> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: Is the causal basis submitted weak?
   - Yes, the causal basis (investigations over five years) might be weak as it assumes no evidence equates to no occurrence.

6. **\<FU\> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: Is \<PR\> assumed correct because it's "universally agreed upon"?
   - No, there's no mention of universal agreement.

7. **\<DEP\> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: Could \<PR\> be taken differently than intended?
   - No significant ambiguous language seems present.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
Based on our analysis:

- Primary classification aligns most closely with **\<IR\> (Inconclusive Reason)** because the reasoning given (lack of evidence) does not necessarily prove the assertion (no cheating).

### Conclusion
The argument appears to be of type **\<IR\>**, as the reason provided does not conclusively establish the proposition claimed. Thus, the argument's defectiveness is due to an inconclusive reason.
