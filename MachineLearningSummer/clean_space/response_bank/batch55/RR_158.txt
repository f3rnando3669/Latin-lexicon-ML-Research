For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument into specific steps), we will break down the task of classifying the given argument into a structured analysis. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The proposition is the statement that is being set forth to prove.
   - In this case, the proposition is: "God exists."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason sets forth the causal basis for the proposition.
   - The reason provided here is: "The Bible is God's word, and God never speaks falsely, then everything in the Bible must be true."

3. **Analyze the Reason (<R>):**
   - We need to check whether the reason logically supports the proposition without any fallacies or weaknesses.
   - Examine if it appropriately establishes a causal basis.

4. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - The proof of reason corroborates the reason using additional arguments.
   - Here, extra validation given is: "Since the Bible says that God exists."

5. **Classify Potential Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** Is the reason based on an assertion that applies to some but not necessarily to all?
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Is the argument missing some pertinent possibilities?
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Does the reason conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Is the causal basis not compelling or weak?
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Is the reason repeating the proposition?
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Is the proof based on the assumption that it is universally agreed upon?
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Is the language used in such a way that it could be misunderstood?

6. **Determine the Exact Defective Argument Type:**
   - In this case: 
     - The reason "The Bible is God's word, and God never speaks falsely, then everything in the Bible must be true" does not independently verify the truth of the proposition because it assumes the Bible's statement as already certain without external verification.
     - This matches the criteria of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** where the reason basically states the same as the proposition.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - Classify the argument.

Based on the provided argument: "It says in the Bible that God exists. Since the Bible is God's word, and God never speaks falsely, then everything in the Bible must be true. So, God must exist."

**Classification:**

The argument is defective and fits the type **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** because the reason suggests the proposition without any new or independent validation, effectively stating the same thing in different words.
