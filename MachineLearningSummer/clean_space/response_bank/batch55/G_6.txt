For 
To apply IDAA (Decomposition and Classification) to the string "The spider that bit was poison, therefore all spiders are poison," we need to break down the task of identifying the type of defective argument it represents into specific steps. Here’s a step-by-step approach that we can use:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The proposition (P) in the argument is the assertion or claim that the argument seeks to prove.
- **Proposition (P):** "All spiders are poison."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason (R) is the part of the argument that sets forth the causal basis for the proposition.
- **Reason (R):** "The spider that bit was poison."

### Step 3: Identify the Defective Argument Types
Now, we need to match the given argument against the definitions of defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

Let’s analyze:
1. **Generalization (G):** An assertion based on some one part or on a majority of individuals, but not necessarily applicable to all.
   - The argument makes an assertion about "all spiders" based on the observation of just one spider.
   - This defective argument type appears to fit as a generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Claiming to have made a complete enumeration but actually missing out on possibilities.
   - The argument doesn’t try to enumerate possibilities, so this doesn’t fit.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
   - While the reason is not sufficient, the primary issue is more about generalizing from one instance; so it doesn't directly fit as IR.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis submitted for the proposition is not compelling.
   - The reason is certainly insufficient, but the classification as WCB would target a weak causal relationship more broadly than generalization.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason simply restates the proposition without supporting it.
   - This doesn’t apply as the reason and proposition are distinct.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Assuming a proof of reason based on universal agreement that is, in fact, in dispute.
   - This isn’t about consensus, so FU doesn’t apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The proof of reason can be taken in another sense than intended.
   - There is no ambiguous language provided in the argument.

### Step 4: Conclusion
Based on the steps above and the definitions provided, the primary issue with the argument "The spider that bit was poison, therefore all spiders are poison" is that it generalizes from the experience with one spider to all spiders.

### Result
- The string "The spider that bit was poison, therefore all spiders are poison" is classified as a **Generalization (G)**.

Thus, the specific defective argument type here is <G>.
