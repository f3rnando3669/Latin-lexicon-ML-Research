To apply the decomposition method (D) for the classification task (IDA) on the given string, let's break down the process into specific steps as follows:

### Step 1: Decompose the Argument (D1)
**Step 1.1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**
- <P>: "Don't let your cousin borrow $10.00."

**Step 1.2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**
- <R>: "Next, he's going to be borrowing money from you every day."

### Step 2: Evaluate the Type of Reasoning (D2)
**Step 2.1: Check for Generalization (<G>)**
- A Generalization occurs when an assertion about a part is applied to the whole.
  - In this statement, <R> suggests that allowing the cousin to borrow money once will lead to a repeated daily occurrence. This is a generalization based on one event which may not necessarily lead to an all-encompassing conclusion. 

**Step 2.2: Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
- Incomplete Enumeration involves missing out on some possibilities when claiming to have made a complete list.
  - The argument does not enumerate all the ways lending money might play out; instead, it jumps to a specific, possibly incomplete, conclusion.

**Step 2.3: Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- Inconclusive Reason means the reason provided doesn't conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
  - The reason "he's going to be borrowing money from you every day" does not conclusively prove the initial claim ("Don't let your cousin borrow $10.00"). It is speculative.

**Step 2.4: Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
- Insufficient Causal Basis is where the reason provided is weak in supporting the proposition.
  - The causal basis for the cousin borrowing money every day lacks compelling evidence or logical strength. 

**Step 2.5: Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**
- Faulty Repetition occurs when the reason is merely a repetition of the proposition.
  - The reason is not just repeating the proposition; it adds a new claim.

**Step 2.6: Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
- Presumptuous Consensus assumes an argument is certain because it is universally agreed upon.
  - Thereâ€™s no mention of universal agreement in this reasoning.

**Step 2.7: Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**
- Ambiguous Language Use involves terms or reasons that can be interpreted in multiple ways.
  - The language used is clear and direct without ambiguous terminology.

### Step 3: Classify the Argument (D3)
Based on the decomposition and evaluation:
- The argument is mainly flawed due to its generalization, envisioning a broad outcome from a single event. Hence, it fits best under the defective argument type <G> (Generalization).

### Conclusion
The argument "Don't let your cousin borrow $10.00. Next, he's going to be borrowing money from you every day." is classified as type <G> (Generalization).
