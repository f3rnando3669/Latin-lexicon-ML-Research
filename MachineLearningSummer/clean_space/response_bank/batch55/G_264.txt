To classify the defective argument type of the given string using the process of decomposition, we will break down the task step-by-step.

Given String: "I've never knowingly listened to a Neil Young record all the way through because they all sound like someone strangling a cat (don't they?)."

### Decomposition Steps for Classification (IDAA):

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>).**

- **Proposition (<P>):** "I've never knowingly listened to a Neil Young record all the way through."
- **Reason (<R>):** "because they all sound like someone strangling a cat."

**Step 2: Check for Proof of Reason (<PR>).**

In this case, there is no explicit <PR> provided within the string.

**Step 3: Categorize the proposition and reason to find any defects.**

- **Proposition Analysis:** The proposition states a personal experience.
- **Reason Analysis:** The reason is an assertion that Neil Young's records all sound like someone strangling a cat.

**Step 4: Analyze for Generalization (<G>).**

- **Generalization Analysis:** The reason assumes that "they all sound like someone strangling a cat," generalizing Neil Young's entire body of work based on an unspecified number of experiences or hearsay. This fits the pattern of a generalization, but let's examine other types as well.

**Step 5: Analyze for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>).**

- **Incomplete Enumeration Analysis:** The string does not attempt to enumerate possibilities; it rather makes a sweeping assertion without providing specific cases. This defect does not apply here.

**Step 6: Analyze for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>).**

- **Inconclusive Reason Analysis:** The reason "because they all sound like someone strangling a cat" is a subjective and emotive description. This does not conclusively support the proposition that the speaker never finishes listening to Neil Young records. This fits <IR> as it is a subjective opinion and does not provide conclusive evidence.

**Step 7: Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).**

- **Insufficient Causal Basis Analysis:** The reason given is not compelling; it's based on a subjective impression rather than a concrete causative basis. This fits <WCB> as well.

**Step 8: Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>).**

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition Analysis:** The reason given is not a repetition of the proposition; it introduces a new idea by claiming that Neil Young's music sounds unpleasant. This defect does not apply.

**Step 9: Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>).**

- **Presumptuous Consensus Analysis:** The reason includes the rhetorical question "(don't they?)" suggesting an assumption of general agreement. This fits <FU>.

**Step 10: Analyze for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).**

- **Ambiguous Language Use Analysis:** The phrase "sound like someone strangling a cat" is metaphorical and could be interpreted in different ways, but it seems contextually clear. This defect does not strongly apply here.

### Conclusion:

The string "I've never knowingly listened to a Neil Young record all the way through because they all sound like someone strangling a cat (don't they?)" can be classified as having the following defects:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: The reason generalizes the entire work of Neil Young.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason given is not conclusive.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis is an emotive opinion, not a compelling argument.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The rhetorical question suggests an unfounded assumption of universal agreement.

Since it is identified with multiple defective argument types, it would be best classified primarily under **Generalization (<G>)** as it forms the basis of the other fallacious aspects, with elements of **WCB**, **IR**, and **FU** present.
