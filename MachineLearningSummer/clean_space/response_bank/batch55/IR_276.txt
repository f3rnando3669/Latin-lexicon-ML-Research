To apply IDAA (the application of the decomposition process to the task of classifying a defective argument), we will decompose the argument classification process step by step. Here is the systematic approach:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P), Reason (R), and Proof of Reason (PR)
First, we need to break down the provided dialogue into its essential components to identify any Proposition (P), Reason (R), and Proof of Reason (PR).

**Dialogue:**
- **Child:** "This fish tastes funny. I don’t want to eat this."
- **Parent:** "There are children starving in Africa. Eat your dinner."

**Proposition (P):** The child asserts, "I don’t want to eat this" because "this fish tastes funny."

**Reason (R):** The parent provides the reason: "There are children starving in Africa."

**Conclusion:** The parent’s conclusion is that the child should "eat your dinner."

### Step 2: Analyze the Causal Relationship
Next, we analyze the causal relationship between the Proposition (P) and the Reason (R). Here, we need to see if the parent's reason logically supports the proposition and conclusion.

### Step 3: Check for Defective Argument Types
Using the definitions provided, we will examine if the argument presented by the parent fits into any of the categories of defective arguments.

1. **Generalization (G):** Is the argument based on an assertion that applies to one or a majority but not necessarily to all?
   - No, this doesn't apply here as the parent's argument is not a generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Is the argument defective because it misses out on pertinent possibilities?
   - No, this doesn't apply because the parent's argument is not making an enumerative claim.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
   - Yes, the parent's argument does not provide a reason that directly addresses the child's reason for not wanting to eat. The presence of starving children in Africa does not logically compel the child to eat the fish that tastes funny.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the causal basis presented weak because it is not compelling?
   - Yes, the reason provided by the parent is weak in the context of the child's proposition. The statement about children starving in Africa does not directly address the issue of the taste of the fish.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Does the reason repeat the proposition without adding new information?
   - No, the parent's reason is not a repetition of the child's proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Is the assumption of the proof of reason based on universal agreement?
   - No, this does not apply since the parent's argument does not rely on assumed consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Is there ambiguous use of language in the proof of reason?
   - No, there is no ambiguous language use in the parent's argument.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
After analyzing the argument, we determine the most appropriate classifications for the parent’s argument to be:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

### Conclusion
The parent's argument in response to the child can be classified as both **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The reason provided (children starving in Africa) does not directly address the child's point about the taste of the fish, making it both inconclusive and lacking a compelling causal connection to the proposition.
