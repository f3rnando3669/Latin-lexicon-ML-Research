For 
To apply the task of classifying a defective argument type (IDA) to the given statement, we need to decompose the task (D) into specific steps. Here are these steps followed by the application:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) for IDA

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):** Determine the main assertion or claim being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (R):** Identify the causal basis that aims to establish the truth of the proposition.
3. **Identify Proof of Reason (PR):** Look for additional arguments or evidence provided to support the reason.
4. **Classify Possible Defects:**
   - Check for **Generalization (G)**
   - Check for **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
   - Check for **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
   - Check for **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
   - Check for **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
   - Check for **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
   - Check for **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**
5. **Classify the Argument (Final Step):** Based on the identified defects, classify the argument as one of the defective types if applicable.

### Application of Decomposition to the Given String

Let's apply these steps to the statement provided:

**Statement:**
"In 2011, Christian broadcaster, Harold Camping, (once again) predicted the end of the world via Jesus, and managed to get many Christians to join his alarmist campaign. During this time, and especially after the Armageddon date had passed, many Christian groups publicly declared that Camping is not a 'true Christian.' On a personal note, I think Camping was and is as much of a Christian as any other self-proclaimed Christian and, religious/political/ethical beliefs aside, I give him credit for having the cojones to make a falsifiable claim about his religious beliefs. Example #2:"

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The main assertion here seems to be: "Camping was and is as much of a Christian as any other self-proclaimed Christian."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason presented is: because he had "the cojones to make a falsifiable claim about his religious beliefs."

#### Step 3: Identify Proof of Reason (PR)
The proof given includes the historical reference "predicted the end of the world via Jesus and managed to get many Christians to join his alarmist campaign." Additionally, "many Christian groups publicly declared that Camping is not a 'true Christian.'"

#### Step 4: Classify Possible Defects
1. **Generalization (G):** Does not seem to generalize from one part to all; it speaks about one individual.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Does not claim a complete set of possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason "having the cojones to make a falsifiable claim” does not conclusively demonstrate correctness of the proposition that he is as much a Christian as any other.
4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason presented does not just repeat the proposition.
5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis may be considered weak; having courage to make a claim does not inherently reflect one’s religious identity.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** No claim about universal agreement.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The term "Christian" might be taken in different senses, but it’s more about definition than ambiguity in language.

#### Step 5: Classify the Argument (Final Step)
The statement most closely fits into **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and could also be considered **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

### Final Classification:
The given string presents a defective argument type that primarily suffers from an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and possibly an **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
