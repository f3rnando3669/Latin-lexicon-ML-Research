For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to the task of classifying the string "peer pressure, persuasion based on the foundation that everybody’s doing it," we need to decomposingly analyze the string and identify which defective argument it corresponds to based on the provided definitions. Here are the steps in detail:

1. **Break down the string \( s \)**:
   - The string \( s \) is "peer pressure, persuasion based on the foundation that everybody’s doing it."

2. **Understand the meaning of the string \( s \)**:
   - The string references a situation where persuasion or influence (peer pressure) is being exerted on the premise that "everybody's doing it."

3. **Classify the key elements of the string \( s \)**:
   - The main argument relies on the basis of consensus or common agreement, i.e., "everybody's doing it."

4. **Match the string \( s \) elements with defective argument definitions**:

   - Compare with \( \text{G} \): 
     - Generalization is an assertion based on one part or majority but not necessarily applicable to all. This does not fit here as the focus is not on generalization.
   - Compare with \( \text{FE} \):
     - Incomplete Enumeration claims complete enumeration but misses some possibilities. This also does not fit.
   - Compare with \( \text{IR} \):
     - Inconclusive Reason shows that the Reason does not conclusively demonstrate \( P \). This seems less relevant to a universal consensus claim.
   - Compare with \( \text{RR} \):
     - Faulty Repetition of Proposition means the Reason repeats the Proposition. This is not the focus here.
   - Compare with \( \text{WCB} \):
     - Insufficient Causal Basis regards weak reasons. While persuasion based on consensus could be weak, this definition is more specific to causality rather than consensus.
   - Compare with \( \text{FU} \):
     - Presumptuous Consensus claims something is certain based on universal agreement which is still in dispute. This fits well because persuading based on "everybody's doing it" assumes universal agreement as a basis for persuasion.
   - Compare with \( \text{DEP} \):
     - Ambiguous Language Use uses language that can be taken in another sense than intended. This does not apply here as the string is straightforward.

5. **Select and classify based on the closest match**:
   - The string “peer pressure, persuasion based on the foundation that everybody’s doing it” aligns with \( \text{FU} \) because it suggests that the action or behavior should be adopted based on the claim that it is universally accepted or agreed upon, presuming consensus.

Therefore, by applying \( \text{IDAA} \) on the string:

**Conclusion:** The string "peer pressure, persuasion based on the foundation that everybody’s doing it" is classified under the defective argument type \( \text{FU} \) (Presumptuous Consensus).
