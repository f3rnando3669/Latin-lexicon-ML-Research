To apply the process of decomposing the task of classifying a defective argument (IDA) step by step (IDAA) to the statement "Mayor Jones’ anti-DUI campaign should not be taken seriously. After all, the mayor himself was cited for driving under the influence in college," we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition is the statement summarizing what is intended to be proven.

**<P>**: "Mayor Jones’ anti-DUI campaign should not be taken seriously."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason is the causal basis establishing the truth of the proposition.

**<R>**: "The mayor himself was cited for driving under the influence in college."

### Step 3: Determine if there is a Proof of Reason (<PR>)
The proof of reason is additional arguments corroborating the briefly presented reason.

In this argument, there is no additional argument provided that corroborates the reason.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument as Defective
Using the definitions of defective arguments:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This does not seem to be a generalization as it's not based on a majority or minority of cases applied to the whole.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This does not enumerate possibilities to claim completeness.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This reason may not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition as one's past behavior does not necessarily invalidate their current stance.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reason might be seen as insufficient since the past DUI incident may not be a compelling basis to completely disregard the anti-DUI campaign.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The reason does not repeat the proposition; it provides new information.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This reason does not rely on presumed universal agreement.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: There is no use of ambiguous language in the reason provided.

### Step 5: Match the Argument to the Defective Type
Comparing the defective types’ definitions and the given argument, the argument most closely matches:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason given (Mayor Jones' past DUI) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (that his anti-DUI campaign should not be taken seriously). Past personal history does not necessarily discredit one’s current or future initiatives.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reason (the mayor's past DUI) is weak and is not a compelling argument to disregard the campaign. The past behavior of an individual does not serve as a strong causal basis to undermine their current campaign efforts.

Given that both definitions of <IR> and <WCB> seem applicable, we should decide which is more appropriate:

**Final Classification**: **WCB** as the reason provided does not form a compelling basis to discredit the campaign and is more a matter of the causal basis being insufficient rather than strictly inconclusive reasoning.
