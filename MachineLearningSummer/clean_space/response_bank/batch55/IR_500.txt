Applying IDAA (the decomposition of the classification task IDA into specific steps) to the string provided, "Look at that face! Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that as the face of our next president?", involves breaking down the classification process into well-defined steps. Let's proceed step-by-step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition \<P\>
First, we identify the Proposition within the string. A Proposition is a statement setting forth what is intended to be proved.

In this case, the intent seems to be to question the suitability of an individual based on their appearance. 

### Step 2: Identify Other Elements (\<R\> and \<PR\>)
Next, look for any other parts of a complete argument, such as Reason (\<R\>) or Proof of Reason (\<PR\>), although the string primarily appears to contain a Proposition.

- There is no clear Reason (\<R\>) provided.
- There is no Proof of Reason (\<PR\>) provided.

### Step 3: Determine if the Argument is Defective
Now analyze if the argument is defective by classifying it into one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

Let's examine the components:

#### Generalization (\<G\>)
- The statement appears to generalize an individual's capability to be president based on their appearance.
- This is a faulty assertion applying a singular characteristic (appearance) to generalize overall suitability.

#### Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)
- This does not apply here as the argument is not about enumerating possibilities.

#### Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)
- There’s no conclusive reasoning presented.

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)
- The statement doesn't seem to repeat any previously mentioned proposition in this context.

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)
- The causal basis (assuming “face” as a basis for presidential competency) is weak and not compelling.

#### Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)
- There is no mention of universal agreement or consensus.

#### Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)
- The language doesn't appear ambiguous in how it's intended to be understood.

### Conclusion

Given these observations, the best fit for the string is Generalization (\<G\>) and Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>).

- It's Generalization because it uses an individual’s appearance to generalize their overall suitability.
- It’s also Insufficient Causal Basis because using "face" as a justification for voting is not compelling.

Thus, the string "Look at that face! Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that as the face of our next president?" can be classified as <G> (Generalization) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
