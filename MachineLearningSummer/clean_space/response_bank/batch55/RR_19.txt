For 
To apply the task of IDAA (decomposing the task of classifying the given string into specific steps), we will dissect the string "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there" step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition

Identify the proposition \( \mathbf{P} \) in the argument. 

**Proposition (P)**:
- "That restaurant is popular."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason

Identify the reason \( \mathbf{R} \) in the argument supporting the proposition.

**Reason (R)**:
- "Everyone in town goes there."

### Step 3: Examine the Type of Argument

Analyze the proposition (\( \mathbf{P} \)) and reason (\( \mathbf{R} \)) to classify the argument using the defined defective argument types:

- \( \mathbf{G} \): Generalization
- \( \mathbf{FE} \): Incomplete Enumeration
- \( \mathbf{IR} \): Inconclusive Reason
- \( \mathbf{RR} \): Faulty Repetition of Proposition
- \( \mathbf{WCB} \): Insufficient Causal Basis
- \( \mathbf{FU} \): Presumptuous Consensus
- \( \mathbf{DEP} \): Ambiguous Language Use

### Step 4: Assign Classification

Evaluate the reason \( \mathbf{R} \) for potential defects:

1. **Generalization (\( \mathbf{G} \))**:
   - The statement does not fall into this category as it does not generalize based on parts or majority to all.
  
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\( \mathbf{FE} \))**:
   - The statement does not claim to enumerate possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (\( \mathbf{IR} \))**:
   - Consider if everyone in town going to the restaurant is a conclusive reason for it being "popular."
   - However, it seems more aligned with the notion of popularity due to the implied consensus.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( \mathbf{RR} \))**:
   - The reason is not merely the proposition repeated.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( \mathbf{WCB} \))**:
   - Examine if the reason provided is weak.
   - The reason that "everyone in town goes there" might seem like an expression of popularity, but if the reason is based mostly on an assertion rather than factual information, it can be critiqued.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\( \mathbf{FU} \))**:
   - The statement considers that everyone agreeing that the restaurant is popular is a proof.
   - This matches our case because it relies on an assumed universal truth that everyone in town going there makes it popular.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\( \DEP \))**:
   - The terms are not particularly ambiguous in the context given.

### Step 5: Final Classification

Considering the evaluation criteria, the classification that best fits the given argument is Presumptuous Consensus (\( \mathbf{FU} \)).

### Conclusion

Applying IDAA to "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there" results in classifying it as:

**Defective Argument Type: Presumptuous Consensus (\( \mathbf{FU} \))**

The argument assumes the restaurant is popular based on the notion that "everyone in town goes there," without addressing if this is an established and undisputed fact or merely an assumption.
