For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the classification task IDA into specific steps) to the given string "The best minds in physics have studied physics most of their lives, as it’s necessary to study physics extensively to become a top physicist.", we will break down the task into a structured approach. Here's the step-by-step procedure:

### Step 1: Identify the proposition (\<P\>)
- **Proposition (\<P\>):** The assertion that is intended to be proven.
- **Examination:** The given string sets forth two related propositions:
  - "The best minds in physics have studied physics most of their lives."
  - "It’s necessary to study physics extensively to become a top physicist."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\<R\>)
- **Reason (\<R\>):** The causal basis submitted for \<P\>.
- **Examination:** The reason provided for the second proposition (that extensive study is necessary to become a top physicist) is the observation that the best minds in physics have studied it most of their lives.

### Step 3: Analyze the Proof of Reason (\<PR\>)
- **Proof of Reason (\<PR\>):** Additional arguments that corroborate the reason (\<R\>).
- **Examination:** There is an implicit assumption that the extensive study is what caused these individuals to become top physicists, but no additional arguments are provided to substantiate this claim.

### Step 4: Classify \(\<s\> as a defective argument type

We need to evaluate the argument against each type of defective argument to determine which one(s) apply.

1. **Generalization (\<G\>):**
   - **Evaluation:** This string does not directly generalize a specific instance to all instances.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>):**
   - **Evaluation:** The string does not pretend to enumerate all possibilities; it states a necessity.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>):**
   - **Evaluation:** The reason that studying extensively is necessary to become a top physicist is not conclusively demonstrated. Many factors can contribute to someone becoming a top physicist that are not mentioned or considered.
   
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>):**
   - **Evaluation:** The reason ("studied physics most of their lives") may not be a compelling one because it does not eliminate other contributing factors that could lead to becoming a top physicist.
   
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>):**
   - **Evaluation:** The reason does add information rather than simply reiterating the proposition.
   
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>):**
   - **Evaluation:** There is an assumption that the extensive study is universally accepted as necessary, which may still be in dispute.
   
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>):**
   - **Evaluation:** The language is not ambiguous in such a way that the proof can be taken in a different sense.

### Step 5: Confirm classification based on defective argument type
Based on the evaluations, the argument can be classified as:

- **Primary Classification:** \( \IR \) (Inconclusive Reason)
- **Secondary Classification:** \( \WCB \) (Insufficient Causal Basis) and potentially \( \FU \) (Presumptuous Consensus), depending on interpretation.

### Conclusion:
After decomposing the task and analyzing the string, the primary classification for the given argument according to the defined types is:

\[ IR: Inconclusive Reason \]

The argument does not conclusively demonstrate that extensive study is necessary to become a top physicist. Additionally, we noted insufficient causal basis (\<WCB\>) and the potential for presumptuous consensus (\<FU\>).
