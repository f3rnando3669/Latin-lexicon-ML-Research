For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the string "All my friends are doing a low carb diet. That must be the only way to lose weight." mentioned by Murtaza, we will decompose the advanced task into specific steps and come up with a determination. Let's break down the process:

1. **Identify the Proposition \(P\):**
   - The proposition here is: "That must be the only way to lose weight."

2. **Identify the Reason \(R\):**
   - The reason provided is: "All my friends are doing a low carb diet."

3. **Determine the type of defective argument being made:**
   - Next, we need to examine if the reason \(R\) supports the proposition \(P\) in such a way that it avoids any of the defective argument types \(G\), \(FE\), \(IR\), \(WCB\), \(RR\), \(FU\), or \(DEP\).

4. **Compare the given argument against each defective argument type:**
   - **Generalization (\(G\))**: This applies to an argument assuming that what is true for some or most is true for all.
     - In this case, the argument makes a generalization from "all my friends" to "the only way" for everyone.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (\(FE\))**: This applies when the argument claims a complete list of possibilities but misses out on pertinent ones.
     - The argument does not enumerate all possible ways to lose weight.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (\(IR\))**: This applies when the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
     - "All my friends are doing a low carb diet" does not conclusively show that it is the only way to lose weight.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(WCB\))**: This applies if the reason provided is weak or not compelling.
     - The reason provided is not compelling enough to support the idea that it is the only way to lose weight.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(RR\))**: This applies when the reason repeats the proposition.
     - The reason does not merely repeat the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (\(FU\))**: This applies when the argument assumes something is universally agreed upon.
     - There is no reference to universal agreement or consensus here.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (\(DEP\))**: This applies when the proof can be taken in another sense than intended.
     - The language used does not appear ambiguous in this manner.

5. **Conclude the classification:**
   - Assessing the argument, the most fitting classification appears to be **Generalization (\(G\))**. 
   - The individual is generalizing from the specific case of "all my friends" to everyone in general without sufficient basis, thus assuming what is true for their friends is true for all.

Therefore, applying \(IDAA\) to the string "All my friends are doing a low carb diet. That must be the only way to lose weight." indicates that the argument is classified as **\(G\) (Generalization)**.
