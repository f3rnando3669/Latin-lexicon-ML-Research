For 
To apply the IDAA to the given string "I met a rude person from France yesterday. I guess all French people are rude.", we need to decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps. Let's go through it step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
Examine the string to identify the main proposition, the assertion that is being made. In this case, the proposition (P) is:
- "I guess all French people are rude."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
Determine what reason (R) is given to support the proposition (P). Here, the reason (R) seems to be based on a personal experience:
- "I met a rude person from France yesterday."

### Step 3: Analyze the Argument Structure
Now, diagnose the argument to see if the Reason (R) adequately supports the Proposition (P). In other words, analyze whether the truth of (R) conclusively demonstrates the truth of (P).

### Step 4: Check for Defective Argument Types
Review the identified Proposition (P) and Reason (R) against the defined defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - Check if the Proposition (P) is an assertion based on partial evidence but generalized to all.
   - Here, the argument is based on the experience with one individual and generalizes it to all French people.
   - This fits the definition of a Generalization because it asserts that all French people are rude based on the rudeness of one person.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Check if the Proposition (P) makes a claim about having considered all possibilities when it might have missed some.
   - This does not apply in our case as the argument does not list multiple possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Check if the Reason (R) fails to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition (P).
   - The Reason here does not conclusively demonstrate that all French people are rude; it only gives one instance.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Check if the presented Reason (R) lacks a compelling causal basis for Proposition (P).
   - This can be argued in conjunction with other defects, but as a primary category, Generalization fits better here.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - Check if the Reason (R) simply repeats the Proposition (P).
   - This is not the case here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - Check if the Proof of Reason (PR) claims universal agreement without basis.
   - This does not apply in our context as there is no mention of universal consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - Check if the Proof of Reason (PR) can be interpreted in multiple ways.
   - The language here is clear and unambiguous.

### Conclusion
Since the argument:
- Bases its conclusion about all French people being rude on the experience with just one person,
- Uses partial evidence and extends it to a broader population.

The most fitting classification for this defective argument is:
- **Generalization (<G>)**

So, the application of IDAA to the string "I met a rude person from France yesterday. I guess all French people are rude." results in identifying it as a type <G> defective argument.
