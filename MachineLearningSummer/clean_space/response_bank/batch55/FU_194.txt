For 
To apply IDAA (the application of the decomposition of the advanced task IDA) to classify the given string, "This happens when you assume that something is acceptable just because it is very common," let's perform the decomposition step by step.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The proposition here is the assumption that something is acceptable because it is very common.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason provided is the fact that the thing is very common.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - In this case, no explicit proof of reason is presented within the string. It's a general statement about the nature of the assumption.

4. **Evaluate the Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** This does not appear to be a generalization since it's about an assumption rather than drawing a broad conclusion from a few cases.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This is not about an enumeration of possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason given here (“because it is very common”) does not conclusively prove the proposition that it is acceptable. However, this does not seem to be a perfect fit since it focuses on an assumption framework.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal basis (commonality) for deeming something acceptable seems insufficient. This suggests a weak reason but does not align perfectly with the string provided.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason does not repeat the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This fits well. The string assumes something is acceptable based on the idea that it is universally agreed upon because it is common.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** There is no ambiguity in the language; the meaning is clear.

### Final Classification

The most fitting defective argument type for the string is **<FU> – Presumptuous Consensus**. The string illustrates a situation where an assumption is made that something is acceptable solely because it is very common, which implies a belief in universal agreement that may not actually exist or be validated.
