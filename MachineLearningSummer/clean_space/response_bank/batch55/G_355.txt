To apply the process of decomposing the advanced task of classifying the given string as a defective argument type, let's walk through each specific step in detail.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - Determine what statement or assertion is being made that we intend to prove.
   
2. **Evaluate the Reason (R)**:
   - Analyze the causal basis that is given to support the Proposition.

3. **Inspect for Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   - Look for additional arguments or evidence meant to support the Reason.

4. **Match with Defective Argument Types**:
   - Compare each part (P, R, PR) with the definitions of defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP) to identify if any defective argument type fits.

5. **Make a Conclusion**:
   - Based on the analysis, conclude which defective argument type, if any, the given statement falls under.

Now, let's apply this process to the string: "People who learn from their mistakes don't repeat them."

### 1. Identify the Proposition (P)
- **Proposition (P)**: "People who learn from their mistakes don't repeat them."

### 2. Evaluate the Reason (R)
- The statement itself implies a causal relationship: learning from mistakes causes people not to repeat them. However, it doesn't explicitly state an additional reason beyond the assertion.

### 3. Inspect for Proof of Reason (PR)
- No additional arguments or evidence are provided within the statement to support the reasoning.

### 4. Match with Defective Argument Types
- **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement could be an overgeneralization because it assumes all people who learn from their mistakes will never repeat them, which may not hold true universally.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: It does not apply here as it doesnâ€™t list possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The Reason implied doesn't conclusively prove the Proposition. Simply stating that learning from mistakes leads to not repeating them doesn't account for all variables.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reason provided, "learning from mistakes," might not be compelling enough as numerous factors could influence behavior.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The Reason repeats the essence of the Proposition without adding new information.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: It does not assume consensus as evidence.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Ambiguity is not a clear issue here.

### 5. Make a Conclusion
- The string "People who learn from their mistakes don't repeat them" fits best with the defective argument type of **Generalization (<G>)** because it overgeneralizes the behavior of people based on an unproven assumption applicable to all.

Therefore, applying <IDAA> to the statement "People who learn from their mistakes don't repeat them" yields the classification: **Generalization (<G>)**.
