### Applying IDAA to "Filthy and polluting coal should be banned."

To classify the argument "Filthy and polluting coal should be banned" as one of the defective categories, let's decompose it step by step according to the definition of IDA:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The proposition (P) in this argument is "Coal should be banned."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason (R) provided for this proposition is "Filthy and polluting."

### Step 3: Check for Defectiveness
Review the argument to see if it fits any of the defective argument categories:
1. **Generalization (G)**: This would apply if the proposition is based on one part or a majority but not necessarily applicable to all.
   - Not quite applicable here since it does not generalize based on a single instance or a majority; it categorically states all coal should be banned.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This would apply if the argument claims completeness while missing out on possibilities.
   - Not applicable here; the statement doesn't enumerate possibilities.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This would apply if the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
   - "Filthy and polluting" as reasons are intuitive but may be seen as subjective without quantitative backing. However, they do provide direct qualities that might justify banning coal.
   
4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This would apply if the reason repeats the proposition.
   - Not applicable; the reason "filthy and polluting" is not a direct repetition of "should be banned."
   
5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This would apply if the reason is weak and does not compellingly justify the proposition.
   - Potentially applicable. "Filthy and polluting" are characteristics, but without further context or evidence, they may not be seen as compelling enough on their own.
   
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This would apply if consensus is presumed for a proof that is still disputed.
   - Not applicable here; no consensus is presumed or mentioned.
   
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: This would apply if the reason could be taken in another sense than intended.
   - Potentially applicable as terms like "filthy" and "polluting" could be subjective and open to interpretation.

### Step 4: Classification
Based on the steps and the analysis of the argument "Filthy and polluting coal should be banned," the most fitting classifications are:

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The reason "filthy and polluting" may be seen as not fully compelling without additional context or evidence showing why and how it necessitates a ban.
   
2. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The terms "filthy" and "polluting" can be interpreted differently by different people, leading to ambiguous understanding of the argument's force.

### Conclusion
The argument "Filthy and polluting coal should be banned" exhibits characteristics of:

- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**
- **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use)**
