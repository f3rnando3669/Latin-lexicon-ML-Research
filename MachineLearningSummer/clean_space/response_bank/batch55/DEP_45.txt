For 
To apply the task of decomposing the classification of the given string into specific steps (IDAA), let us follow the structured approach:

1. **Identify the Components of the Argument (<P>, <R>, <PR>)**:
   - Proposition (<P>): The primary assertion or claim being made.
   - Reason (<R>): The causal basis offered to support the proposition.
   - Proof of Reason (<PR>): Additional arguments that corroborate the reason.

2. **Basic Analysis of the Argument**:
   - Parse the string to identify the key components of the argument.
   - Annotate each part based on the definitions of <P>, <R>, and <PR>.

3. **Evaluate for Defective Argument Types**:
   - Assess whether <P>, <R>, or <PR> fits any of the specified defective argument types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

4. **Classification of the Argument**:
   - Based on the evaluation, classify the argument as one or more defective types.

Let's apply these steps to the given argument "I don't see how you can say you're an ethical person. It's so hard to get you to do anything; your work ethic is so bad".

### Step-by-Step Application of IDAA

#### 1. Identify the Components of the Argument

- **Proposition (<P>)**:
  - "I don't see how you can say you're an ethical person."
- **Reason (<R>)**:
  - "It's so hard to get you to do anything; your work ethic is so bad."
- **Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
  - The argument doesn't explicitly include additional supporting arguments beyond the reason already given.

#### 2. Basic Analysis of the Argument

- **<P>**: The speaker doubts the ethical nature of the person.
- **<R>**: Justification given is the person's poor work ethic and difficulty in getting them to do anything.

#### 3. Evaluate for Defective Argument Types

- **Generalization (<G>)**:
  - The argument may be generalizing the concept of ethical behavior based on the individual's work ethic.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
  - The argument doesn't consider other possible aspects of ethical behavior beyond work ethic.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
  - Poor work ethic does not conclusively prove a lack of ethics; ethical behavior encompasses more than just work ethic.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
  - The causal link between being ethical and having a strong work ethic is debatable; the basis feels weak.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
  - The argument does not repeat the proposition; it provides a reason related to work ethic.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
  - The argument does not claim universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
  - "Work ethic" is a fairly clear term, though it encompasses broad behaviors.

#### 4. Classification of the Argument

Based on the analysis:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided (poor work ethic) is not conclusive in proving the proposition (lack of ethical behavior). Saying someone's work ethic is bad does not definitively mean they are not ethical.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument relies on the assumed link between work ethic and ethical behavior, which is not a compelling or universally agreed connection.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not consider other aspects of ethical behavior such as honesty, integrity, etc., and solely focuses on work ethic, which is only one aspect.

Thus, the argument "I don't see how you can say you're an ethical person. It's so hard to get you to do anything; your work ethic is so bad" can be classified as having defective argument types <IR>, <WCB>, and <FE>.
