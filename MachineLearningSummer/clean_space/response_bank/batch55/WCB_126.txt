Certainly! Let's apply the process of Decomposition (<D>) to the task of Identifying Defective Arguments (<IDA>), which creates an process called IDAA:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition is the main claim being made in the argument. 

In this case:
- Proposition (<P>): "That new family must have been involved in the burglary."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason is the causal basis for the proposition. It explains why the proposition is believed to be true.

In this case:
- Reason (<R>): "Our house was burglarized right after that new family moved in next door."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
Proof of Reason provides further substantiation for the reason. This may not be explicitly stated in simpler arguments, but we should determine if there’s an implicit proof or if this step is not applicable.

In this case:
- Proof of Reason (<PR>): There isn't an explicit corroboration provided; the argument simply juxtaposes the timing.

### Step 4: Identify Defective Argument Type
We now need to classify whether the argument suffers from any of the defined defects:

#### Type <G> Generalization:
Is the assertion based on a part or majority and applied to all?
- In this argument, no generalization is applied to a larger group; it's specific to the new family.

#### Type <FE> Incomplete Enumeration:
Does it claim to cover all possibilities but miss pertinent ones?
- The proposition does not claim to identify all suspects exclusively.

#### Type <IR> Inconclusive Reason:
Does the reason inconclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
- Yes, the Reason <R> (timing of the burglary right after the new family moved) does not conclusively demonstrate that the new family was involved because temporal proximity does not necessarily mean causation.

#### Type <RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:
Is the reason merely a repetition of the proposition?
- No, the reason is different from the proposition.

#### Type <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:
Is the causal basis weak and not compelling?
- Yes, the reason provided (just the timing) is weak to establish any strong causal link implicating the new family.

#### Type <FU> Presumptuous Consensus:
Is the proposition assumed certain on a disputed fact’s universal agreement?
- No, there is no mention of universal consensus.

#### Type <DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:
Can the Proof of Reason be taken differently than intended?
- No ambiguous language is used in this argument.

### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues:
- The argument fits primarily under <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) because the temporal proximity alone does not conclusively establish the involvement.
- It also fits under <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) as the causal link drawn is weak.

The argument "Our house was burglarized right after that new family moved in next door. Therefore, that new family must have been involved." is of types <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
