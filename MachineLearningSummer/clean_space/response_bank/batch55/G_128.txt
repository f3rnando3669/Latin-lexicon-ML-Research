To apply the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument (IDA) to the provided string, we need to break it down into specific steps and analyze each step carefully as per the definitions provided. Let's go through the process step by step:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: The statement or assertion that is being proposed.
   - In this case, the proposition is: "We can't allow students to be paid for their grade."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: The causal basis given for the Proposition.
   - The reason provided is: "because next thing you know they'll expect to be paid just for waking up in the morning."

3. **Evaluate the Reason against the Proposition**: Determine if the reason sets forth a compelling, conclusive basis for the proposition.
   - Here, the reason does not provide any causal link or compelling evidence to support the proposition that paying students for their grades would lead to an expectation of payment for merely waking up. The leap from one scenario to the other lacks a logical progression.

4. **Categorize the Defective Argument Type**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: Not applicable, as it is not based on insufficient representation of students.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not applicable, since there's no enumeration of possibilities here.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Applicable, because the reason given does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition ("We can't allow students to be paid for their grade").
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The given reason is weak and not compelling, but this might be considered under IR, where the reason fails to support the proposition conclusively.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Not applicable, since the reason does not simply repeat the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Not applicable, as there is no assumption based on universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Not applicable, as the language used is not ambiguous but rather provides an exaggerated consequence.

To summarize: The process identifies "Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)" as the type of defect in this argument since the reason provided does not conclusively support the proposition.

Hence, applying IDAA to the string: "We can't allow students to be paid for their grade because next thing you know they'll expect to be paid just for waking up in the morning." classifies it as <IR>.
