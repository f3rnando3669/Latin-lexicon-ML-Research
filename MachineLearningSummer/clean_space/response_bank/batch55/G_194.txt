For 
To apply the procedure of IDAA (the decomposition of the task IDA into specific steps) to the string "I saw two women get in a car accident. Therefore, all women are bad drivers", we will break it down into methodical steps to classify the defective argument:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The Proposition (P) is the statement that we intend to prove. In this case, it is:

**P:** "All women are bad drivers."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The Reason (R) is the causal basis for P which establishes the truth of what we are urging. Here, the reason given is:

**R:** "I saw two women get in a car accident."

### Step 3: Classify the Defective Argument Type
We now need to determine which category of defective argument the string falls into. 

#### Generalization (G)
A Proposition (P) is an assertion based on some one part or a majority of individuals, but not necessarily applicable to all, which is then applied to all.

#### Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
A Proposition (P) is defective if it claims a complete enumeration of possibilities but misses pertinent ones.

#### Inconclusive Reason (IR)
The Reason (R) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition (P).

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
A Reason (R) is weak if the causal basis which it submits for the Proposition (P) is not compelling.

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
The Reason (R) is weak when it essentially repeats the Proposition (P) without adding new grounds for it.

#### Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
Proposing a Proof of Reason (PR) based on an assumed, universally agreed-upon idea still in dispute.

#### Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)
The language used in the Proof of Reason (PR) can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended.

By analyzing the structure and content:
1. The Proposition (P) "All women are bad drivers" is based on an observation involving just two individuals.
2. The Reason (R) provided is "I saw two women get in a car accident."

Since the Proposition (P) makes a sweeping generalization about all women based on a very limited observation (just two women), it fits the pattern of an **Over-generalization**.

### Conclusion
The string "I saw two women get in a car accident. Therefore, all women are bad drivers." falls into the defective argument category of **Generalization (G)**. 

The final output of applying IDAA is that the string is classified as **G**.
