For 
To apply IDAA to "P1. Lead poisoning can contribute to violent behavior. P2. Many inner city children have dangerous levels of lead in their blood. C. Therefore, violent crime in the inner city can be solved by curing the lead problem," we need to decompose the advanced task of classifying the statement as one of the defective argument types into specific steps.

Here is the decomposition of the task into specific steps (D):
1. Identify each component (P, R, PR) of the argument.
2. Analyze whether the argument contains any defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP).
3. Classify the argument according to the identified defective argument types.

Let's apply these steps to our example.

### Step 1: Identify each component (P, R, PR) of the argument.
- **P (Proposition)**: C. "Violent crime in the inner city can be solved by curing the lead problem."
- **R (Reason)**: P1. "Lead poisoning can contribute to violent behavior."
- **PR (Proof of Reason)**: P2. "Many inner city children have dangerous levels of lead in their blood."

### Step 2: Analyze whether the argument contains any defective argument types.
1. **Generalization (G)**: The proposition does not generalize based on insufficient evidence of individuals. It seems based on identified trends, not the overall population.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument might lack consideration of other factors contributing to violent behavior beyond lead poisoning.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided (lead poisoning leading to violent behavior) may not conclusively establish that solving lead poisoning will solve violent crime. There might be other causes of violent crime not addressed.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal link suggested between curing lead poisoning and solving violent crime appears not compelling enough to fully substantiate the proposition.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason does not simply restate the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The statement does not rely on an assumed consensus.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: There is no ambiguity in the language used in the proof of reason.

### Step 3: Classify the argument according to the identified defective argument types.
Based on analysis, we identify:
- **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**: The reason does not conclusively demonstrate that solving lead poisoning will solve violent crime; it only suggests a possible partial solution, ignoring other factors in play.
- **FE (Incomplete Enumeration)**: The argument fails to consider all possibilities that may contribute to violent crime, not just lead poisoning.
- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The reason provided does not offer a compelling enough causal basis for the proposition.

Thus, the argument has elements of the following defective argument types:
- **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**
- **FE (Incomplete Enumeration)**
- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**

By decomposing the task and analyzing each step, we classify the argument accurately and highlight its deficiencies.
