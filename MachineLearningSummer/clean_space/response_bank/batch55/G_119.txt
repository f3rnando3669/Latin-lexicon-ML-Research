For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying the statement as one of the defective argument types), the steps can be broken down as follows:

1. **Identification of Parts**: Identify the Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), and Proof of Reason (<PR>) within the statement.
2. **Classification of Argument Parts**: Determine if each part of the argument fits any of the defined defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

Let's decompose and analyze the given statement:
**Statement**: "The government should not prohibit drugs. Otherwise the government should also ban alcohol or cigarettes. And then fatty food and junk food would have to be regulated too. The next thing you know, the government would force us to brush our teeth and do exercises everyday."

### Step 1: Identification of Parts
- **Proposition (<P>)**: "The government should not prohibit drugs."
- **Reason (<R>)**: "Otherwise the government should also ban alcohol or cigarettes. And then fatty food and junk food would have to be regulated too."
- **Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: "The next thing you know, the government would force us to brush our teeth and do exercises everyday."

### Step 2: Classification of Argument Parts
- **Examine the Reason (<R>)**: 
  - This part suggests a slippery slope: if the government prohibits drugs, it would need to prohibit alcohol, cigarettes, fatty food, junk food, and enforce personal habits like brushing teeth and exercising.
  - This appears to be an assumption-based argument without solid evidence for each progressive step.

#### Classify <R>:
  - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The causality between prohibiting drugs and the subsequent prohibitions on other substances and behaviors is not definitively established. This reason doesn't conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition that the government should not prohibit drugs.
  - **Generalization (<G>)**: There's a degree of overgeneralizing the effects (from drugs to the hypotheticals involving alcohol, cigarettes, food, and personal habits).
  - **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The causal link between not prohibiting drugs and these drastic measures is weak and not compelling enough.

- **Examine the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
  - The "The next thing you know..." statement presumes a consensus of impending, undesirable government interventions without concrete proof.
  
#### Classify <PR>:
  - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument is extending into an assumption that universally these further steps would be seen, stepping into fear-mongering territory without solid proof that banning drugs logically leads directly to these extreme regulation scenarios.

### Conclusion
The argument contains elements of:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Because the reason given does not conclusively demonstrate why prohibiting drugs would necessarily lead to the prohibition of alcohol, cigarettes, etc.
- **Generalization (<G>)**: It generalizes from prohibiting drugs to assuming a cascading effect on a wide range of personal freedoms.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causality asserted here is not backed by compelling evidence.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The proof relies on a speculative slippery slope without verified consensus.

Thus, the statement mainly exemplifies **<IR>**, **<G>**, **<WCB>**, and **<FU>** defective argument types.
