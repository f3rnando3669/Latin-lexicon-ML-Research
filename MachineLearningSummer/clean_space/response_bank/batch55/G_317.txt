For 
To apply the IDAA (application of decomposition to the task of classifying defective arguments) to the string "If we let your brother stay, we’ll have to let your whole family stay," we need to systematically decompose this process into specific steps.

### Decomposition of the Task (D)

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine what is being asserted or intended to be proven.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Establish the causal basis for the Proposition.
3. **Analyze the Reason (IR, WCB, RR)**: Check if the Reason is valid and contributes conclusively and sufficiently to the Proposition.
4. **Check for Generalization (G)**: Determine if there is a generalization, and if so, whether it is justified.
5. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Determine if all relevant possibilities have been enumerated.
6. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Determine if there is an assumption of universal agreement.
7. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Determine if ambiguous language is used in the argument.
8. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**: Based on the analysis, classify the argument as one of the given defective types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

### Applying the Decomposition

Let's apply each step to the string "If we let your brother stay, we’ll have to let your whole family stay."

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**
   - **Proposition (P)**: "We’ll have to let your whole family stay."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**
   - **Reason (R)**: "If we let your brother stay."

3. **Analyze the Reason (IR, WCB, RR)**
   - The reason "If we let your brother stay" implies a conditional but does not provide a sufficient causal basis or specific reasoning as to why this would necessitate letting the whole family stay.
   - This appears to be an example of a **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)** because the causal link between letting the brother stay and having to let the whole family stay is weak and not compelling.

4. **Check for Generalization (G)**
   - The statement implies a generalization that if one family member is allowed, all must be allowed. As it doesn’t specify “all families” but rather just from one instance to one family, it is not a classical generalization. So, it is not of type G.

5. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
   - The argument does not list or consider other possibilities or conditions under which one family member might be allowed to stay without necessitating the same for the entire family. However, the primary concern remains the weak causal basis, making this check less relevant.

6. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
   - There is no claim that it is universally agreed upon or consensus-based, so this is not of type FU.

7. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**
   - The language in the argument is straightforward and there does not seem to be any significant ambiguity in the terms, hence not of type DEP.

### Classify the Defective Argument Type

Given this analysis, the primary issue with the argument "If we let your brother stay, we’ll have to let your whole family stay" is the weak causal basis. Specifically, the Reason (R) fails to compellingly establish why the Proposition (P) is necessary.

Thus, we classify the defective argument as **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
