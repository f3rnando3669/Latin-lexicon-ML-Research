For 
To apply the process of decomposing the task \( t \) (in this case, classifying a defective argument) into specific steps and then applying it to classify the argument as one of \( <G> \), \( <FE> \), \( <IR> \), \( <WCB> \), \( <RR> \), \( <FU> \), or \( <DEP> \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Step 1**: Identify the components of the argument:
   - **Proposition (\( P \))**: The conclusion that the argument is drawing.
   - **Reason (\( R \))**: The causal basis which is supporting the proposition.
   - **Proof of Reason (\( PR \))**: Corroboration of the reason, if any.

   Given argument (string \( s \)): "He has smoked cigarettes his entire life and he doesn't have lung cancer. Therefore smoking doesn't cause lung cancer."

   - **Proposition (\( P \))**: "Smoking doesn't cause lung cancer."
   - **Reason (\( R \))**: "He has smoked cigarettes his entire life and he doesn't have lung cancer."

2. **Step 2**: Analyze the logical structure of the argument:
   - Determine if there are any assumptions, generalizations, or inferences that could introduce defects.

3. **Step 3**: Compare the components against definitions of defective argument types:

   - **Generalization (\( G \))**: Does the proposition generalize from specific cases to all cases?
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (\( FE \))**: Does the argument claim all possibilities are covered but miss out on some?
   - **Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \))**: Does the reason not conclusively support the proposition?
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \))**: Is the causal basis presented weak or not compelling?
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( RR \))**: Does the reason merely repeat the proposition in different words?
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (\( FU \))**: Does the argument assume consensus where there is still dispute?
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (\( DEP \))**: Is there any ambiguous language involved in the proof of reason?

4. **Step 4**: Classify the argument based on inspection against definitions:

   Let's evaluate the given argument:

   - **Generalization (\( G \))**: Yes, it takes a specific instance (one person's experience) and draws a general conclusion about smoking and lung cancer. This matches the definition of Generalization.

5. **Conclusion**:

The argument "He has smoked cigarettes his entire life and he doesn't have lung cancer. Therefore smoking doesn't cause lung cancer." is an instance of a **Generalization (\( G \))**, because it draws a general conclusion about smoking not causing lung cancer based on the specific case of one individual.

Thus, the classification of the defective argument is \( <G> \).
