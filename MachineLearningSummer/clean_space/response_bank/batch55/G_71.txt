To determine the logical fallacy used by John F. Kennedy in his statement, we will decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
**Proposition**: "The United States had last year the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
In the statement provided by John F. Kennedy, there does not appear to be an explicit causal basis or reason, rather a direct claim.

### Step 3: Identify the nature of the defective argument, considering the definitions provided for Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), and Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

### Step 4: Examine the Context and Content of the Argument
- Kennedy's assertion focuses on economic growth data from the previous year (1958).
- Nixon refutes by providing additional context indicating 1958 was a recession year and highlights improved economic growth in the following year (1959).

### Step 5: Check for Specific Defects:
- **Generalization (G)**: Not applicable unless broader, unfounded generalizations are made.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not directly applicable without specific enumeration claims.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: No explicit reason provided by Kennedy to analyze.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Not applicable; no repetition observed.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: No causal basis to analyze.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Not applicable; no consensus claim made.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Not obviously ambiguous.

### Step 6: Specific Analysis Point
The main issue appears to be the **context**: Kennedy's statement looks at a single recent year (1958) without acknowledging the broader economic context or trends of economic behavior across multiple years, especially admitting it was during a recession. This omission suggests a more misleading presentation than outright fallacy definitions provided.

### Final Classification
Given the statement's exclusion of critical context (the recession), it could be best categorized under **Generalization (G)** due to Kennedyâ€™s reliance on limited data from one year to make a broader claim about economic growth compared to other industrial countries.

### Conclusion
**Kennedy uses the defective argument type: Generalization (G)**.
