For 
To apply **IDAA** to the string "I guess I should buy my 14 year old a new iPhone since everyone at her school has one," we need to follow the steps of **D**, the decomposition process, to classify this string under the appropriate defective argument type. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\<P\>)
- The proposition (\<P\>) here is the main assertion or claim being made.
- **\<P>**: "I should buy my 14 year old a new iPhone."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\<R\>)
- The reason (\<R\>) is the causal basis for the proposition (\<P\>), explaining why the proposition is purportedly true.
- **\<R>**: "since everyone at her school has one."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (\<PR\>)
- A proof of reason (\<PR\>) might be provided to further support the reason (\<R\>), but in this case, there isn't an explicit additional argument or evidence given besides the reason.

### Step 4: Check for Defective Argument Types
- Now, we analyze whether this argument fits any of the defective argument types: \<G\>, \<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<WCB\>, \<RR\>, \<FU\>, or \<DEP\>.

#### Analysis:

1. **Generalization (\<G\>)**:
   - This argument does not seem to generalize from a sample to a whole population.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)**:
   - The argument does not claim a complete enumeration of possibilities, so \<FE\> does not apply.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**:
   - The reason given ("since everyone at her school has one") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition that the speaker should buy their child a new iPhone. It lacks a concrete connection between other students having iPhones and the necessity for their own child to have one. More justification or causal connections are needed.
   - This fits well, indicating an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**:
   - The reason mentioned ("everyone at her school has one") might be considered as weak in providing a compelling causal connection to the proposition ("I should buy my 14 year old a new iPhone"). The reason alone might not be strong enough to justify the proposition conclusively.
   - This fits well, indicating an **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)**:
   - The reason given is not simply a repetition of the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)**:
   - The argument does appeal to a sort of consensus ("since everyone at her school has one"), but it is not necessarily indicated as universally agreed upon point but more as an observational point from the speaker's perspective.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)**:
   - The language does not seem ambiguous in this context.

### Conclusion:
The argument string "I guess I should buy my 14 year old a new iPhone since everyone at her school has one" can be classified under:
1. **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**: because the reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>): because the reason might be considered insufficiently compelling to establish the necessity of the action proposed.

Therefore, we classify this under both **IR** and **WCB**.
