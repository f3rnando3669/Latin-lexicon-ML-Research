For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task <IDA> of classifying the string "Shortly after MySpace became popular, U.S. soldiers found Saddam Hussein," we will decompose this task into specific steps and follow them systematically:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>) within the string.**
- The proposition is the main assertion or claim made in the argument. 

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>) provided to support the Proposition.**
- The reason is the causal basis that attempts to establish the truth of the proposition.

**Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>) if any exists.**
- The proof of reason corroborates the reason by using additional arguments.

**Step 4: Classify the string according to the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).**

Now, let's apply these steps to the given string:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>).**
- The string "Shortly after MySpace became popular, U.S. soldiers found Saddam Hussein." implies a correlation between the popularity of MySpace and the capture of Saddam Hussein.

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>).**
- The reason appears to be the timing mentioned in the string: "Shortly after MySpace became popular."

**Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>).**
- The string does not offer additional arguments or evidence to prove the reason; it relies solely on the correlation in timing.

**Step 4: Classify the string according to the defective argument types.**

Let's evaluate it against the defective argument types:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: Not applicable. The string does not generalize from one part to a whole.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not applicable. The string does not claim to have enumerated all possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Applicable. The reason provided ("Shortly after MySpace became popular") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition that there is a meaningful connection between MySpace's popularity and the capture of Saddam Hussein.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Applicable. The causal basis here is weak because just mentioning the timing does not compel a causal link.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Not applicable. The reason is not a repetition of the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Not applicable. There is no appeal to a universal agreement in the given string.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Not applicable. There is no evident ambiguity in language.

The most fitting classification for the string "Shortly after MySpace became popular, U.S. soldiers found Saddam Hussein." would be **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** and **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**. The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition, and the causal basis is weak.

Therefore, the defective argument type for this string is both **<IR>** and **<WCB>**.
