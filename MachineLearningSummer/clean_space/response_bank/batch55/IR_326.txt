For 
To apply **IDAA** to the task of classifying the statement "Which case is not a False Dichotomy?" into the given types of defective arguments, we will follow the method of decomposing the advanced task into specific steps. Here's how we can break it down:

**Step 1: Understand the Advanced Task <t>:**
The advanced task <t> here is to classify the given statement "Which case is not a False Dichotomy?" into one of the types of defective arguments provided: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

**Step 2: Break Down the Task <t> into Specific Steps <D>:**
To classify the statement, we'll need to understand and identify which characteristics of defective arguments it exhibits.

**Specific Steps <D>:**
1. Identify the proposition (P) in the statement, if present.
2. Identify the reason (R) given for the proposition, if present.
3. Evaluate the reason (R) to see if it conclusively supports the proposition (P).
4. Check if the argument fits any of the defined defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP>.
5. Classify the statement based on the identified defect.

**Step 3: Apply the Steps to the Statement:**

**Step 3.1: Identify the Proposition (P):**
In the statement "Which case is not a False Dichotomy?", there is no explicit proposition as it is framed as a question. However, the underlying assumption is that there are cases that are not false dichotomies.

**Step 3.2: Identify the Reason (R):**
Since the statement is a question, it does not provide an explicit reason (R). It is asking for an evaluation.

**Step 3.3: Check for Completeness and Specific Type of Defect:**
Due to the nature of the statement being a question, we need to consider if the question itself assumes a form of defective argument:

- **Generalization (<G>):** There is no generalization since the statement does not make a sweeping claim.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The statement could be assuming a complete set of dichotomies but asking to find one that isn’t, rather than listing possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** There is no reason given, so we cannot evaluate it.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** No causality is mentioned.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** There’s no reason, so repetition doesn’t apply.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Implies a common understanding of what a false dichotomy is, but not specifically.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The term "False Dichotomy" itself could be interpreted in multiple ways, depending on context.

**Step 3.4: Classify the Statement:**
Given that the statement is framed as a question and does not provide a specific reason or proposition, it most closely aligns with **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)** as the term "False Dichotomy" can be interpreted differently depending on the context in which it is used.

**Conclusion:**
The statement “Which case is not a False Dichotomy?” is most likely an example of **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)** due to the potential variability in interpreting the term "False Dichotomy."
