For 
To classify the argument within the statement "everybody's doing it, so it must be a good thing to do," using the <IDA> task through a step-by-step decomposition (<D>), we will follow this structure:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>) in the argument:**
   - <P>: "It must be a good thing to do."
   - <R>: "Everybody's doing it."

2. **Analyze the validity of the Reason (<R>) provided in relation to the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The Reason given is based on the behavior of the majority or everyone participating in an action.
   
3. **Match the argument structure and reasoning defects (<IDA>):**
   - Generalization (<G>): It isn't exactly based on an assertion applied universally on a limited observation.
   - Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>): There's no enumeration of possibilities provided.
   - Inconclusive Reason (<IR>): <R> (everybody's doing it) is not conclusive evidence for <P> (it must be a good thing).
   - Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>): The causal basis is weak because popularity doesn't equate to correctness.
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>): <R> does not just repeat <P>.
   - Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>): The argument is relying on the assumed agreement (everybody) to validate <P>.
   - Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>): The language is not ambiguous in this context.

4. **Classify the argument considering the above analysis:**
   - The argument's main defect seems to fall into:
       - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The proof of reasoning used here assumes that the behavior of "everybody" (a presumed universal agreement) validates the claim made by the proposition.

Thus, **applying the IDAA** task to the given statement "everybody's doing it, so it must be a good thing to do," leads us to classify it under the defect type **<FU>**.
