For 
To apply the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, or DEP) to the string "blame opponent's policy for the country's problems," we need to follow a structured decomposition of the task (D). Here's how we can break it down step-by-step:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) for Advanced Task Application (IDAA)
1. **Understand the given string**: Identify the core statement and intentions within the string.
2. **Extract the Proposition (P) and Reason (R)**: Determine if there are identifiable elements of a complete argument (proposition and reason).
3. **Evaluate for Defective Argument Types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP)**: Compare the identified elements against the definitions of defective argument types to classify the string accordingly.

### Step 1: Understand the Given String
**String provided:** "blame opponent's policy for the country's problems"
- This statement implies that the responsibility for the country's problems is attributed to the opponent's policy.
- The primary intention is to assert that there is a direct causal relationship between the opponent's policy and the country's problems.

### Step 2: Extract the Proposition (P) and Reason (R)
- **Proposition (P)**: The country's problems are caused by the opponent's policy.
- **Reason (R)**: The assertion of causality that the opponent's policy is responsible for the problems.

### Step 3: Evaluate for Defective Argument Types
We now need to determine if the string fits any of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP):

1. **Generalization (G)**: 
   - Is the string asserting something based on limited evidence but applying it universally?
   - **Analysis**: The string does not provide any evidence or premise; it makes a blanket assertion. This could be seen as a form of generalization if no specific policies or evidence are mentioned.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: 
   - Does the string claim to cover all possibilities but miss some pertinently?
   - **Analysis**: The string does not enumerate any specific policies or situations, but it does imply a complete causal relation without addressing other possible causes.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: 
   - Does the reason fail to conclusively prove the proposition?
   - **Analysis**: Here, the reason (blaming the policy) does not provide detailed proof or support; it is merely an assertion.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: 
   - Is the causal basis weak or not compelling?
   - **Analysis**: Simply blaming the policy without presenting strong causal connections represents an insufficient causal basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: 
   - Does the reason repeat the proposition without adding new information?
   - **Analysis**: The string does not exhibit a faulty repetition as it is only a single statement.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: 
   - Does the proof of reason rely on assumed universal agreement?
   - **Analysis**: There is no mention of universal agreement or consensus in the string.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: 
   - Is ambiguous language used in the proof?
   - **Analysis**: The language is quite specific in attributing blame and does not appear ambiguous.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis of the string, it is most closely associated with:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because it makes a causal claim without substantiating it with compelling evidence or detailed reasoning.

Thus, the string "blame opponent's policy for the country's problems" is classified as **WCB**, an argument type where the reason provided is weak and the causal basis is not compelling.
