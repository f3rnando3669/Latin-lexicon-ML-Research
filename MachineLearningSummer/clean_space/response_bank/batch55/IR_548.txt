For 
To apply IDAA to classify the string "Are you still a heavy drinker?" as a defective argument type, we will break down the process step by step. Here's how we can proceed:

**Step 1: Parse the String for Argument Parts**
- **Identify Proposition (P)**: This step typically involves recognizing the statement or assertion that is made, though in this case, due to the form of the string (a question), we need to infer the underlying proposition.
- **Identify Reason (R)**: Examine if the string presents any causal basis for the proposition.
- **Identify Proof of Reason (PR)**: Determine if there are additional arguments supporting the reason.

**Step 2: Identify Defective Argument Types**
- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**

**Step 3: Apply Definitions to the String**

Analyzing the string "Are you still a heavy drinker?":

1. **Understand the underlying proposition (P):**
   - Implicit proposition: "You are a heavy drinker."
   - The question presupposes that the person being asked has previously been a heavy drinker and implies that this status might still be true.

2. **Identify Reason (R):**
   - The causal basis or reasoning is not explicitly provided in the string itself. The string assumes without evidence that the person has been a heavy drinker.

3. **Identify Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - There is no proof or additional argument supporting the reason. The question assumes prior behavior without justification.

**Identify Defective Argument Types:**

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - This does not fit since the string does not make a broad assertion based on limited evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - This does not fit since the string is not attempting to enumerate possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - This does not fit since there is no reason provided to evaluate its conclusiveness.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - This also does not directly fit since there is no explicit reason (causal basis) provided in the string.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - This does not fit since the string does not repeat a proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - The string does not rely on universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - This does fit. The string "Are you still a heavy drinker?" can be ambiguous as it presupposes a fact (being a heavy drinker) without clarity or evidence. It can be taken in a way that presumes something that may not be true (the person may have never been a heavy drinker, or may have stopped).

**Conclusion:**
After decomposing the task (IDAA) into steps, we classify the defective argument contained in "Are you still a heavy drinker?" as **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**. This is due to its presumptive nature that introduces ambiguity about the supposed past behavior without evidence.
