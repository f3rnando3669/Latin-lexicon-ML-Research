For 
To classify the string "One pill is good, two will be better" using the process defined as IDAA (the application of decomposing the task of classifying arguments into specific steps), we will follow a structured approach:

1. **Understand the Proposition \(P\)**:
   - Identify the key proposition.
   - In this case, the proposition \(P\) is "Two pills will be better."

2. **Identify the Reason \(R\)**:
   - Identify the reasoning presented in the argument that supports the proposition.
   - Here, the reasoning is implied by comparing the effect of taking one pill: "One pill is good."

3. **Check for Proof of Reason \(PR\)**:
   - Look for any additional arguments or evidence that support the reason.
   - This argument does not provide any further evidence or arguments to support the reason. It relies on the assertion that what applies to one pill should apply more to two pills.

4. **Determine if the Argument is Defective**:
   - Check if the argument falls into any of the defective argument types:
     - **\(G\) Generalization**: Refers to applying an attribute of some or most individuals to all. 
     - **\(FE\) Incomplete Enumeration**: Refers to claiming complete enumeration of possibilities but missing out on some.
     - **\(IR\) Inconclusive Reason**: Where the reasoning does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
     - **\(WCB\) Insufficient Causal Basis**: Where the causal basis is weak or not compelling.
     - **\(RR\) Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: Where the reason is basically a repetition of the proposition.
     - **\(FU\) Presumptuous Consensus**: Assuming something is certain just because it is universally agreed upon.
     - **\(DEP\) Ambiguous Language Use**: Where the proof can be interpreted differently than intended.
   
5. **Evaluate the Argument**:
   - "One pill is good, two will be better" appears to assume that taking more will enhance the positive effect of the first. This assumption does not necessarily apply without additional causal basis (evidence).

Based on these steps, it seems the argument is:
- \(G\): The argument could be considered a Generalization because it infers that the positive effect of one pill will proportionately increase with the ingestion of two pills, without providing sufficient evidence that this pattern holds true in every case.

However, upon closer inspection, **\(WCB\) Insufficient Causal Basis** might be more accurate because the argument assumes that increasing the dose will inherently lead to a better outcome without providing a compelling reason why this is the case. 

So based on the structured process:

- **Step 1**: Proposition \(P\): "Two pills will be better."
- **Step 2**: Reason \(R\): "One pill is good."
- **Step 3**: No Proof of Reason \(PR\) provided.
- **Step 4**: Evaluate against defective argument types.

Final classification: The argument type is **\(WCB\) - Insufficient Causal Basis**. The reasoning that one pill being good automatically makes two pills better is not compelling without further evidence.
