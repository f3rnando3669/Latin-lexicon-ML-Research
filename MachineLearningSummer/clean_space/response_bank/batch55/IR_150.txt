To apply IDAA to the statement "You should always eat everything on your plate, think of all the children in Africa who doesn't always have enough food," we need to decompose the task <IDA> of classifying the string into specific steps and then perform those steps. Here’s a step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Identify and Extract Key Components of the Argument
We need to break down the statement into its component parts according to our definitions for a complete argument and defective arguments:
- **Proposition (<P>)**: "You should always eat everything on your plate."
- **Reason (<R>)**: "think of all the children in Africa who don't always have enough food."

### Step 2: Analyze the Reason (<R>) for Defectiveness
Let's examine if the reason provided falls into any of the defective argument types:
- **Generalization (<G>)**: The reason is a broad, general statement about children in Africa. However, it is not necessarily asserting something about a part that applies to the whole, so it does not strictly fit the definition of <G>.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This doesn’t fit since the statement isn't enumerating possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: We need to check if the reason provided conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the proposition. In this case, the reason "children in Africa don't always have enough food" does not logically prove that one should always eat everything on their plate.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reason provided is emotionally compelling but does not offer a direct causal link between not wasting food on your plate and solving the food scarcity in Africa. Thus, it offers an insufficient causal basis for the proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The reason is not a repetition of the proposition; it introduces a different concept.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The reason does not claim universal agreement on the point being argued.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: There isn’t ambiguous language in the sense that terms are being misused or taken in another sense.

### Step 3: Classify the Argument
Based on the analysis:
- The reason given is emotionally compelling but fails to provide a direct, logical connection between always eating everything on one's plate and the food scarcity in Africa.

The most appropriate classification given the nature of the defect would be:
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**

### Step 4: Conclusion
Thus, applying IDAA to the statement "You should always eat everything on your plate, think of all the children in Africa who don't always have enough food," we classify the argument as:
- **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**
