To apply IDAA to the sentence "You are either with God or against him," let's break down and decompose the task step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Argument
First, we need to deconstruct the proposition to identify its components:
- **Proposition (P)**: What is the assertion being made?
- **Reason (R)**: What is the reason provided for the proposition?
- **Proof of Reason (PR)**: Is there proof or additional arguments that corroborate the reason?

In this case, we have:
- **Proposition (P)**: "You are either with God or against him."
- **Reason (R)**: Implied, but not explicitly stated.
- **Proof of Reason (PR)**: Not provided.

### Step 2: Detect Defective Arguments
Next, we need to classify the argument into one of the defective types defined:
- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**

### Step 3: Decomposition of IDA
We need to examine the argument against the definitions of defective arguments:
1. **Generalization (G)**: Is the proposition a broad assertion based on limited evidence?
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Is the proposition missing out on any pertinent possibilities?
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the proposition?
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Is the causal basis (reason) weak?
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Is the reason just a repetition of the proposition?
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Is the proof assumed as certain due to "universal agreement"?
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Could the proof be interpreted in another sense than intended?

### Step 4: Application to the Argument
Let's classify "You are either with God or against him." against these types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This does not particularly apply as it is not based on limited evidence.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This matches well because it presents only two possibilities ("with God" or "against him") and excludes other potential stances (e.g., neutral, undecided, unaware).
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Since no reason is expressed.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: No causal basis is given.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: No reason is presented.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Not relevant here.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The argument is not ambiguous but binary.

### Step 5: Determine the Defective Type
Given the analysis, the defective argument type that fits the string "You are either with God or against him." is:

**Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**

### Conclusion
By applying IDAA to the given argument, we classify "You are either with God or against him." as an instance of **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** due to its exclusion of other possible positions.
