For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types) to the string "We can have Sally as our soldier or we can have Brittany be the queen of the kingdom.", we need to follow these specific steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of IDA

1. **Identify the components of the argument (Proposition, Reason, and Proof of Reason).**
2. **Determine if the Proposition (P) is clear and specific.**
3. **Determine if the Reason (R) provided is valid and causally connected to the Proposition (P).**
4. **Verify if the Proof of Reason (PR) supports the Reason (R) adequately.**
5. **Check if the argument commits any established types of defective arguments: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).**

### Application to the given string

**Step 1: Identify the components of the argument.**

- **Proposition (P):** "We can have Sally as our soldier or we can have Brittany be the queen of the kingdom."

**Step 2: Determine if the Proposition (P) is clear and specific.**

- **Proposition (P):** The proposition is clear - it presents two options, Sally as a soldier or Brittany as the queen.

**Step 3: Determine if the Reason (R) provided is valid and causally connected to the Proposition (P).**

- **Reason (R):** There is no explicit Reason (R) given that explains why these are the only two options or the rationale behind either choice.

**Step 4: Verify if the Proof of Reason (PR) supports the Reason (R) adequately.**

- **Proof of Reason (PR):** No Proof of Reason is provided since we don't have an explicit Reason to corroborate.

**Step 5: Check for defective arguments.**

- **Checking for Generalization (G):** The argument does not appear to generalize from some to all.
- **Checking for Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument posits a forced dichotomy (either Sally as soldier or Brittany as queen), potentially overlooking other possibilities.
- **Checking for Inconclusive Reason (IR):** There is no Reason given, so this does not apply.
- **Checking for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** There is no Reason attempting to provide a causal basis.
- **Checking for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** No Reason is repeated here; there’s simply the Proposition.
- **Checking for Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There’s no appeal to universal agreement.
- **Checking for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language is clear in what it proposes without ambiguity.

Given the analysis, the argument specifically falls under **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, as it creates a forced choice (dichotomy) without considering other alternatives. 

### Conclusion

The classification of the string based on the defective arguments identified is: **<FE>** (Incomplete Enumeration).
