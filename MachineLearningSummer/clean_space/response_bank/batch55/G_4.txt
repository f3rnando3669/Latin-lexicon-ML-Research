Sure, let's apply the advanced task of decomposing <IDA> into specific steps for classifying the string. We'll break down the argument using the definitions provided.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

**1. Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The statement setting forth what is intended to be proved.
   - **Proposition (<P>):** "We've got to stop them from banning poetry."

**2. Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The causal basis for the proposition.
   - **Reason (<R>):** "Once they start banning one form of literature, they will never stop."

**3. Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Corroborative arguments supporting the Reason.
   - **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** "Next thing you know, they will be burning all the books!"

### Analyzing for Defective Argument Types

**4. Classify for Generalization (<G>):**
   - Determining if the proposition is based on a partial or majority view but applied universally.
   - **Analysis:** The argument doesn't explicitly present an assertion based on a partial or majority view but applied universally. This doesn't seem to fall under <G>.

**5. Classify for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Checking if the proposition claims to consider all possibilities but omits some pertinent ones.
   - **Analysis:** The argument does not claim to consider all possibilities regarding banning poetry. It seems to focus on one scenario escalating uncontrollably. It does not fall under <FE>.

**6. Classify for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Determine if the Reason (<R>) conclusively supports the Proposition (<P>).
   - **Analysis:** The argument suggests a slippery slope (if they ban one, they will ban all). This is not necessarily conclusive because it assumes without sufficient evidence that one action will lead to an extreme outcome. **Classification: <IR>**.

**7. Classify for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Determine if the Reason (<R>) provides a weak causal basis for the Proposition (<P>).
   - **Analysis:** The causal basis presented is speculative; it asserts without strong evidence that banning one form will lead to banning all. This might overlap with <IR>. However, it is also a weak causal justification. **Classification: <WCB>**.

**8. Classify for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - Check if the Reason (<R>) is the same assertion as the Proposition (<P>).
   - **Analysis:** The Reason presented is that banning one form will lead to more bans, which is a different assertion from "We've got to stop them from banning poetry." This is not <RR>.

**9. Classify for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - Determine if the Proof of Reason (<PR>) is based on assumed universal agreement.
   - **Analysis:** The Proof of Reason does not rely on presumed consensus but on a slippery slope argument. This is not <FU>.

**10. Classify for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
    - Check if the Proof of Reason (<PR>) can be taken in another sense than intended.
    - **Analysis:** The language used ("Next thing you know, they will be burning all the books!") isn't ambiguous; it's hyperbolic but clear in its intent. This is not <DEP>.

### Final Classification
Based on the analyzed argument and the definitions provided, the argument can be classified primarily as:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition and relies on a slippery slope fallacy.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The Reason provides a weak causal basis for the Proposition because it assumes without strong evidence that banning one form of literature will inevitably lead to banning all forms.

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the given string, we classify it as a combination of:

**<IR> and <WCB>**
