For 
To apply IDAA (the application of the decomposition of a task into specific steps to the task of classifying a string as a defective argument type) to the provided string, "I broke my mirror this morning, AND I failed my History test. I must've failed because the mirror gave me bad luck," we need to follow a structured approach.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Application

1. **Identify the Proposition (P) within the Argument:**
   - "I must've failed because the mirror gave me bad luck."
   - This is the main assertion the speaker intends to prove.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - The Reason given is "I broke my mirror this morning, AND I failed my History test."
   - This is used as the causal basis for the Proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - There isn't a formal PR provided, but the implication is that the breaking of the mirror symbolizes bad luck, which is culturally assumed as "proof" for bad events that follow.

4. **Analyze and Classify the Defective Argument Type:**

   - **Generalization (G):** The argument does not overgeneralize from a sample to a population.
   
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument does not list possibilities and miss out on some.
   
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This could apply here. The Reason provided (broken mirror leading to failing a test) is not sufficiently conclusive. There are many potential reasons for failing a test besides breaking a mirror.
   
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Yes, the causal link between breaking a mirror and failing a test is not strong or compelling. This is more of a superstitious belief rather than a logical or empirically supported reason.
   
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This is not applicable since the Reason given does not simply repeat the Proposition.
   
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This might be slightly suggested as it relies on culturally assumed superstition, but largely, it does not appear strongly as this type.
   
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** This argument does not hinge on ambiguous terms or phrases.

5. **Classify the Argument:**
   - Given the analysis, the argument primarily exhibits characteristics of both an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. Of these:
     - **WCB** fits most precisely because the Reason provided (mirror breaking) does not provide a compelling causal basis for the Proposition (failing the test).

### Conclusion:
The argument "I broke my mirror this morning, AND I failed my History test. I must've failed because the mirror gave me bad luck," should be classified as an **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** defective argument type.
