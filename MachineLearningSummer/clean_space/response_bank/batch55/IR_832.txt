For 
Certainly! Let's apply <IDAA> to classify the given argument string step by step. 

### Step 1: Identify Parts of the Argument
First, we need to identify the Proposition (\<P\>), Reason (\<R\>), and Proof of Reason (\<PR\>) if they exist in the given string.

Given the sentence:
"Luke didn't want to eat his sheep's brains with chopped liver and brussel sprouts, but his father told him to think about the poor, starving children in a third world country who weren't fortunate enough to have any food at all."

We can break it down as follows:
- \<P\>: "Luke didn't want to eat his sheep's brains with chopped liver and brussels sprouts."
- \<R\>: "His father told him to think about the poor, starving children in a third world country who weren't fortunate enough to have any food at all."

### Step 2: Match the Reason to a Defective Argument Type
Now we need to classify the Reason (\<R\>) to see if it falls under any defective argument type (\<G\>, \<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<RR\>, \<WCB\>, \<FU\>, or \<DEP\>).

The Reason (\<R\>) provided is: "His father told him to think about the poor, starving children in a third world country who weren't fortunate enough to have any food at all."

### Step 3: Analyze the Reason
We will go through each defective argument type to see which one matches the given string.

- **Generalization (\<G\>):** This is not a generalization from a single instance to all instances.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>):** This does not appear to miss out on other pertinent causes but focuses on a moral appeal.
- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>):** The reason does not logically demonstrate why Luke should eat his food; it's using an emotional appeal rather than a logical connection between the two.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>):** This could be seen here, as there is no direct causal basis stating why thinking about starving children should compel Luke to eat his food.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>):** The reason doesn't just restate the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>):** There is no claim about universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>):** The statement is clear and not ambiguous.

Based on the above analysis:

### Step 4: Conclude with the Classified Defective Argument Type
The reason (\<R\>) "His father told him to think about the poor, starving children in a third world country who weren't fortunate enough to have any food at all," does not conclusively connect to the proposition (\<P\>) about eating his meal. This makes the argument fall under the defective type:

**Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**

### Conclusion
The defective argument type for the given string is **\<IR\>**.

So the final output after applying <IDAA> to the string is:
> **\<IR\>**
