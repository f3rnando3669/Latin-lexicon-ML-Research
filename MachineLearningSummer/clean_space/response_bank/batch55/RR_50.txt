For 
To apply the decomposition of the advanced task \( \text{IDAA} \) to the task of classifying the given argument \( s \), "Standardized dress should be used in schools because kids should wear standardized dress," we will follow a structured approach to classify the argument type. This involves breaking down the task into specific steps as follows:

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( P \))**:
   - Proposition (\( P \)): "Standardized dress should be used in schools."

2. **Identify the Reason (\( R \))**:
   - Reason (\( R \)): "Kids should wear standardized dress."

3. **Determine if the Reason supports the Proposition**:
   - The Reason (\( R \)) should provide a causal basis for the Proposition (\( P \)), meaning it should establish the truth of what the Proposition is urging.

4. **Check for defective argument types**:
    - Examine the given argument for characteristics that match any of the defective argument types: Generalization (\( G \)), Incomplete Enumeration (\( FE \)), Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \)), Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \)), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( RR \)), Presumptuous Consensus (\( FU \)), or Ambiguous Language Use (\( DEP \)).

Let's go through the specific logic of \( s \) step by step:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\( P \))
- The given argument starts with the Proposition:
  - "Standardized dress should be used in schools."
  
#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\( R \))
- The Reason provided in the argument is:
  - "Kids should wear standardized dress."

#### Step 3: Determine if the Reason supports the Proposition
- We need to check whether "Kids should wear standardized dress" provides a causal basis to support "Standardized dress should be used in schools." 

Here, the Reason (\( R \)) simply restates the Proposition (\( P \)) in a slightly different form without giving a causal basis or further explanation for why standardized dress should be used. The Reason does not offer new information or independent evidence to support the Proposition.

#### Step 4: Check for defective argument types
- We now classify this argument based on the types of defective arguments defined:

  - **Generalization (\( G \))**: Not applicable here.
  - **Incomplete Enumeration (\( FE \))**: Not applicable here.
  - **Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \))**: Not directly applicable.
  - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \))**: While the Reason might be weak, this category is not the most directly fitting description.
  - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( RR \))**: Fits precisely, as the Reason merely restates the Proposition in different words. There is no new information that supports \( P \) distinctively from \( R \).
  - **Presumptuous Consensus (\( FU \))**: Not applicable here.
  - **Ambiguous Language Use (\( DEP \))**: Not applicable here.

Given the conclusion of our structured analysis, we determine that the argument type most accurately described by the task \( IDA \) is:

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( RR \))**

### Conclusion
The argument "Standardized dress should be used in schools because kids should wear standardized dress" is classified as type \( RR \), meaning it contains a **Faulty Repetition of Proposition**.
