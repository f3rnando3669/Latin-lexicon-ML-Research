For 
Certainly! To apply <IDAA> (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a string as one of the defective arguments), we'll need to break down the steps needed to classify the provided string: "I broke my mirror this morning, AND I failed my Civics test. I must've failed because the mirror gave me bad luck." 

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Find the statement that is intended to be proven.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine the causal basis being used to establish the truth of <P>.

3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Check if there are any additional arguments corroborating the reason.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:**
   - Compare the identified <P>, <R>, and <PR> against the definitions of defective arguments: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

### Applying the Decomposition to the Example

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - "I must've failed because the mirror gave me bad luck."
     This is the main assertion being put forth for proof.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - "I broke my mirror this morning, AND I failed my Civics test."
     This provides the causal basis for <P>.

3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - In this case, there is no additional argument provided to corroborate <R>.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** The argument does not involve applying an observation about some to all.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This argument does not claim to have considered all possibilities and missed some.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason provided (breaking the mirror) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition that the bad luck caused the test failure. It's a coincidence without a necessary causative link.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The reason provided is weak, as there is no compelling causal basis to link a broken mirror to failing a test.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason isn't merely a repetition of the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The reason isn't assumed to be true based on supposed universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** There isn't ambiguity in language employed.

After carefully considering the definitions, the argument can be classified as an **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** and potentially also **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** due to the lack of a compelling causal link between breaking the mirror and failing the test.

Thus, the defective argument type here is primarily:
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**
