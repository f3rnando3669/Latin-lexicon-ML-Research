For 
Certainly! Let's apply <IDAA> to classify the given statement "My first time walking the dog went terribly, so my dog is a terrible one."

### Step 1: Break Down the Statement Using <P>, <R>, and <PR>

1. **Proposition (P):**
   - What is the main assertion being made?
   - \<P\>: "My dog is a terrible one."

2. **Reason (R):**
   - What causal basis is given for the assertion?
   - \<R\>: "My first time walking the dog went terribly."

3. **Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - Is there additional argument or evidence presented to corroborate the reason?
   - In this statement, there's no additional argument or evidence beyond the reason provided.

### Step 2: Identify the Defective Argument Type

Now let's classify if the argument is of type <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

#### Generalization (G):
- The assertion that "My dog is a terrible one" is based on just one instance ("My first time walking the dog went terribly"). This is a classic case of generalization because a single event is used to make a broader conclusion about the dog’s overall nature.
- So, the argument seems to fit the definition of <G>.

### Step 3: Verify Classification

Let's verify our classification by confirming if it's indeed a generalization:

- **Generalization (G):** The argument is taking one instance (first time walking went terribly) and generalizing it to the dog’s overall nature (the dog is terrible).

Since all conditions match the definition of a Generalization, we can conclude:

### Conclusion:
The statement "My first time walking the dog went terribly, so my dog is a terrible one." is of type <G> (Generalization).

Thus, the classified defective argument type for the given string is <G>.
