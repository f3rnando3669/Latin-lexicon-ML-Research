For 
Let's apply the decomposition of the advanced task of classifying the argument into specific steps to determine which type of defective argument it represents.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition <P>**: Determine what we are intending to prove or assert.
2. **Identify the Reason <R>**: Identify the causal basis given for the proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Reason <R> relative to the Proposition <P>**: Assess if the Reason conclusively supports the Proposition.
4. **Classify the Category of Defect**: Based on the evaluation, classify the identified defect according to the predefined types of defective arguments (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Application to "Americans should give money to charity because it is the right thing to do."

1. **Identify the Proposition <P>**: 
   - Proposition: "Americans should give money to charity."

2. **Identify the Reason <R>**:
   - Reason: "Because it is the right thing to do."

3. **Evaluate the Reason <R> relative to the Proposition <P>**:
   - In this case, the reason "because it is the right thing to do" is a moral assertion and does not provide a concrete causal basis. It is essentially a restatement of a moral proposition without additional evidence or logical underpinning that demonstrates why it is the right thing to do or proves the necessity of the action.

4. **Classify the Category of Defect**:
   - The given Reason almost repeats the Proposition with no additional substantive causal basis provided; it merely states a moral opinion without further proof or evidence. This aligns closely with the definition of **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**, where the Reason appears to be merely a repetition of the Proposition.

Thus, the classification of the argument "Americans should give money to charity because it is the right thing to do" is <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
