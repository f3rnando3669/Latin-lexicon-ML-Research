For 
To perform IDAA, which is the decomposition of the advanced task (in this case, IDA - classifying the argument), we need to break down the process into manageable steps. The goal is to classify the given string "Believing that 'runs' occur to statistically independent phenomena such as roulette wheel spins." into one of the specified defective argument types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

Let's break this down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
First, we need to identify the proposition (P) which is the part of the argument that sets forth what is intended to be proved.

- **Proposition (P):** "Runs occur to statistically independent phenomena such as roulette wheel spins."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
Next, we determine if there is a reason given for the proposition. This step requires us to see if there is a causal basis for the proposition.

- **Reason (R):** The statement does not explicitly present a reason. It seems to assume that "runs" naturally apply to statistically independent phenomena without providing a basis.

### Step 3: Analyze the structure of the argument
Given the proposition and the lack of an explicit reason, we need to check for any proofs or support provided for the reason (if any).

- There are no additional arguments supporting the proposition or the reason.

### Step 4: Evaluate for Defective Argument Types
Now, check the characteristics of the argument against the various defective argument types.

1. **Generalization (G):** This applies when an assertion based on some individuals is incorrectly applied to all. The proposition discusses statistically independent phenomena, which form a broad group, suggesting it might erroneously generalize.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This would involve a complete enumeration of possibilities, which does not seem relevant here.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Here the reason does not conclusively establish the proposition. The argument does lack a reason, making it potentially fit IR, as the proposition is not conclusively demonstrated.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This applies if the causal basis submitted for the proposition is weak. There isn't a causal basis given, so it might also fit WCB due to the absence of compelling reason.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This is where the reason repeats the proposition. Not applicable as there isn't a clear reason.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This involves assuming a proof of reason as certain because it is "universally agreed upon". The argument does not reference universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Ambiguous language that can be interpreted differently. The argument seems clear in its language.

### Final Classification
Given the steps and analysis, the argument lacks a clear reason and appears to rely on an implicit generalization that "runs" apply to all statistically independent phenomena, leading to the following classification:
    
- **Generalization (G)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

### Conclusion
"Believing that 'runs' occur in statistically independent phenomena such as roulette wheel spins" fits primarily as Generalization (G), due to the broad application of 'runs' without specifying a concrete basis. It also reflects qualities of Inconclusive Reason (IR) and Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), as it lacks a solid reason and basis for the claim. If forced to choose the most applicable single type, it would be **Generalization (G)** due to implying a broad generalization without specific support.
