For 
To apply \(IDAA\) to the string "No one has ever been able to prove that extraterrestrials do not exist, so they must be real," we'll first decompose the task of classifying this string (\(IDA\)) into specific steps (\(D\)). Here are the steps for \(D\):

1. **Identify the Proposition (\(P\)):** Determine the main statement or claim that is being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (\(R\)):** Determine the justification or rationale that is provided to support the \(P\).
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\(PR\)), if any:** Determine any additional arguments or evidence that corroborate the \(R\).
4. **Classify the string according to defective argument types:** Based on the definitions of \(G\), \(FE\), \(IR\), \(RR\), \(WCB\), \(FU\), and \(DEP\), identify which type of defective argument the string falls into.

Now, we apply these steps to the given string:

1. **Identify the Proposition (\(P\)):**
   - The claim being made in the string is: "Extraterrestrials must be real."

2. **Identify the Reason (\(R\)):**
   - The justification given for the \(P\) is: "No one has ever been able to prove that extraterrestrials do not exist."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\(PR\)), if any:**
   - There is no additional argument or evidence provided to corroborate the \(R\) in the given string.

4. **Classify the string according to defective argument types:**
   - Let's analyze the reason (\(R\)) in relation to the proposition (\(P\)):
     - The argument relies on the idea that since there is no disproof of extraterrestrials, they must exist. This is a logical fallacy known as an argument from ignorance.

   Given the definitions provided:

   - **Generalization (\(G\)):** This doesn't apply because the assertion is not based on an incomplete survey of a group.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (\(FE\)):** This also doesn't seem relevant as there is no enumeration of possibilities provided.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (\(IR\)):** This could be relevant because the reason "No one has ever been able to prove that extraterrestrials do not exist" does not conclusively establish the truth of "they must be real."
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(WCB\)):** The causal basis provided here is not compelling; it does not actually prove the existence of extraterrestrials.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(RR\)):** The reason does not simply repeat the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (\(FU\)):** There is no presumption of universal agreement in the argument.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (\(DEP\)):** The language used does not appear to be ambiguous.

Given the analysis, the argument falls primarily under two defective argument types:
- **Inconclusive Reason (\(IR\))**: The reason given ("No one has ever been able to prove that extraterrestrials do not exist") does not conclusively support the proposition ("Extraterrestrials must be real").
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(WCB\))**: The reason is not a compelling causal basis for concluding that extraterrestrials must be real.

Therefore, the string "No one has ever been able to prove that extraterrestrials do not exist, so they must be real" can be classified as both \(<IR>\) and \(<WCB>\).
