To apply the decomposition of the task (IDAA) to the given string and classify it as one of the defective argument types, we will break down the classification process into specific steps.

Step 1: Identify the Propositions (P) and Reasons (R)
Let's discern any propositions and reasons within the given string.

1. Proposition (P1): "All of my friends are coming to my birthday party."
2. Proposition (P2): "If Micah doesn't, she might as well tell me that she doesn't like me."

Step 2: Evaluate the Propositions (P)
Determine if each proposition falls into any of the defective types.

Proposition (P1):
- Evaluate if this is a Generalization (G), claiming something based on a subset of the whole population but asserting it as if it applies to the entire population.
- "All of my friends" could be considered an overgeneralization if it's based on assumptions or incomplete information.

Proposition (P2):
- Evaluate if this is an Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

Step 3: Determine if Reason (R) supports Proposition (P)
Check if there's a causal connection or logical reasoning that supports P2, and whether any part of the argument is faulty.

Reason (R) implied in Proposition (P2) is:
- "If Micah doesn't come, then she doesn't like me."
- Evaluate if this reason is conclusive or if it contains defects such as Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).

Step 4: Identify Defective Argument Type
After evaluating the propositions and reasons, classify each based on the defective argument types.

Proposition (P1): "All of my friends are coming to my birthday party."
- This could be classified as a Generalization (G) because it is asserting something about all friends based on some assumption or incomplete data.

Proposition (P2) linked to Reason (R): "If Micah doesn't, she might as well tell me that she doesn't like me."
- This assertion can be seen as having an Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB). The reason provided ("Micah not coming" equals "Micah doesn't like me") is not necessarily a compelling or sufficient cause to deduce the proposition stated.

Step 5: Combine Analysis for Final Classification
Combine the classifications of the propositions to form an overall assessment of the argument.

Given that Proposition (P1) is a Generalization (G) and Proposition (P2) has Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):

The overall argument can be classified in terms of the defective argument types as:
- Generalization (G) due to "All of my friends are coming to my birthday party."
- Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB) due to "If Micah doesn't [come], she might as well tell me that she doesn't like me."

Therefore, if we were to classify the argument using the IDAA framework, we identify it as a combination of <G> and <WCB>. This indicates multiple defects within the given argument string.
