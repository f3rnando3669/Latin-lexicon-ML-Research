For 
To apply IDAA (the task of decomposing the classification task IDA into specific steps) to the given statement "Now that the Chiefs are going to the Super Bowl, everybody is suddenly a fan," we need to methodically analyze the statement and determine which type of defective argument it represents. Here are the steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - The proposition in the statement is: "Everybody is suddenly a fan."

2. **Analyze the Argument for Defects**:
   - We need to determine if the proposition (P) and the underlying reasoning have any of the specified defects.

3. **Classify the Defects (if any)**:
   - Here, we check for the types of defective arguments: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

By following these steps, let's evaluate the statement:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - "Everybody is suddenly a fan."

2. **Analyze the Argument for Defects**:
   - This proposition suggests that every single person has become a fan of the Chiefs now that they are going to the Super Bowl.
   - The reasoning (R) implied here is that the Chiefs going to the Super Bowl has caused everyone to become a fan. 
   - This is implicitly claiming a complete enumeration of all people ("everybody").

3. **Classify the Defects (if any)**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: This could be a case of generalization because it takes the excitement or increased fan base due to the Chiefs' success and extends it to "everybody," which is likely not true for all individuals.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This argument assumes that the only possible state is that of being a fan now that they're successful, completely ignoring anyone who might remain indifferent or who was already a fan before.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The given reasoning doesn't conclusively demonstrate that "everybody" has become a fan; it's an overstatement.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis (that the Chiefs going to the Super Bowl will make everybody a fan) isn't a compelling one as there can be multiple reasons why someone might not become a fan despite the success.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Not applicable here. The reasoning isn't just a repetition of the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Depending on interpretation, one might argue this lightly presumes a universal agreement, but it's more about exaggeration than citing a consensus.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language here is less about ambiguity and more about overgeneralization.

Given the analysis, **Generalization (G)** and **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** seem to be the most fitting classifications.

### Conclusion:
The statement "Now that the Chiefs are going to the Super Bowl, everybody is suddenly a fan." can primarily be classified under **Generalization (G)** since it extends the excitement of some fans to everybody. It can also be considered as having **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** because it inaccurately claims to describe the enthusiasm of all people without considering those who might not fit the description.
