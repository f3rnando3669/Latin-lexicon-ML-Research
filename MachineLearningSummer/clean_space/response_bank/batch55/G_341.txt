To apply IDAA to classify the given string "If you allow the students to redo this one test, they will always want to redo all future tests" as one of the defective argument types, we need to decompose the task into specific steps. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - In the given statement, the proposition (<P>) can be summarized as: "If you allow the students to redo this one test, they will always want to redo all future tests."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason (<R>) presented is: Allowing the redo of one test will lead to students always wanting to redo all future tests.

3. **Identify which defective argument type (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) best fits:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** This is where the proposition is an assertion based on some part or a majority and not necessarily applicable to all, but referred to all.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This occurs when the proposition claims to make a complete enumeration of possibilities but misses some.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This happens when the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This is when the causal basis for the proposition is not compelling.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This means the reason repeats the proposition without adding new information.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This happens when a proof is assumed certain on the ground of universal agreement, despite being disputed.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** This is when a proof can be taken in another sense than intended by the speaker.

4. **Analyze the statement in the context of these definitions:**

   - **Generalization (<G>):** The statement makes a broad claim based on the situation of redoing one test and extends it to all future tests. This appears to be an unwarranted generalization since it draws a broad conclusion from a specific instance without enough evidence. This fits the definition of Generalization, as it implies that allowing one redo will mean students will always want redos in the future, without sufficient evidence to suggest this will always be the case.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This argument does not claim to enumerate all possibilities, so it doesn't fit this type.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason assumes a slippery slope but does not conclusively prove that redoing one test will always lead to wanting to redo all tests.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal connection between allowing one redo and students always wanting redos is weak and not compelling.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason provided does not just repeat the proposition; it builds on it.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** There is no claim of universal agreement.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The language used does not appear to be ambiguous.

5. **Determine the appropriate classification:**
   - The most fitting classification here is **Generalization (<G>)**, because the statement extends a conclusion from a single instance to all future instances without sufficient evidence to support this broad application.

6. **Document the classification:**
   - The given string "If you allow the students to redo this one test, they will always want to redo all future tests" is best classified as a defective argument type: **Generalization (<G>)**.

By following these steps, we have applied IDAA to systematically decompose and analyze the given statement, leading to its classification as a Generalization.
