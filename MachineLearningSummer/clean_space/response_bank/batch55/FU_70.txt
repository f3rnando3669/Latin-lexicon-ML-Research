For 
To apply `<IDAA>` to the argument "Justin Bieber wears Ray Bans, so you should buy a pair to wear in the sun," we first need to decompose the task of classifying the defective argument into specific steps (`<D>`). Here is the step-by-step process:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (`<D>`):

1. **Identify the Proposition (`<P>`) and Reason (`<R>`):**
   - Determine what the statement is intending to prove (`<P>`).
   - Identify the causal basis or reasoning provided to support that proposition (`<R>`).

2. **Analyze for Specific Defective Argument Types (`IDA`):**
   - Check if the assertion is a Generalization (`<G>`).
   - Check if there is an Incomplete Enumeration (`<FE>`).
   - Evaluate if the Reason is Inconclusive (`<IR>`).
   - Determine if there is a Faulty Repetition of Proposition (`<RR>`).
   - Determine if the causal basis is weak or insufficient (`<WCB>`).
   - See if there is a Presumptuous Consensus (`<FU>`).
   - Assess if the language used is ambiguous (`<DEP>`).

### Applying the Steps to the Argument:

1. **Identify the Proposition (`<P>`) and Reason (`<R>`):**
   - **Proposition (`<P>`):** "You should buy a pair of Ray Bans to wear in the sun."
   - **Reason (`<R>`):** "Justin Bieber wears Ray Bans."

2. **Analyze for Specific Defective Argument Types (`IDA`):**

   - **Generalization (`<G>`):**
     - Is the argument based on a single individual's behavior and applied to all? Yes.
   
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (`<FE>`):**
     - Is the argument missing other possibilities? This doesn't apply here.
   
   - **Inconclusive Reason (`<IR>`):**
     - Does the reason provided conclusively demonstrate the proposition? No, simply stating that Justin Bieber wears Ray Bans does not conclusively prove that you should.
     
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (`<WCB>`):**
     - Is the causal basis weak? Yes, there's no compelling reason why Justin Bieber wearing Ray Bans means you should too.
   
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (`<RR>`):**
     - Is the reason just a repetition of the proposition? No, the reason is not just repeating the proposition.
   
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (`<FU>`):**
     - Is the proof assumed as certain due to a supposed universal agreement? This doesn't apply here.
   
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (`<DEP>`):**
     - Can the statement be taken another way? No, the language is clear in this context.

### Conclusion:
The defect in the argument "Justin Bieber wears Ray Bans, so you should buy a pair to wear in the sun" is primarily of type `<G>` (Generalization) and `<IR>` (Inconclusive Reason), with a significant element of `<WCB>` (Insufficient Causal Basis).

## Final Classification:
- **Primary Defective Argument Type:** `<G>` (Generalization)
- **Secondary Defective Argument Types:**
  - `<IR>` (Inconclusive Reason)
  - `<WCB>` (Insufficient Causal Basis)
