To apply the advanced task IDAA, which involves decomposing the task IDA into specific steps to classify the string provided, let's proceed step-by-step.

### Step 1: Break Down the Given Argument
Let's break the argument into its propositions and reasons.

1. **Proposition (P1)**: "Everyone who gets a college degree is better off."
2. **Proposition (P2)**: "All people who are better off as a result of getting a degree are good to have conversations with."
3. **Conclusion (C)**: "Therefore, everyone who gets a college degree is a good person to have a conversation with."

### Step 2: Identify the Type of Potential Defective Arguments
There are various types of defective arguments we must consider: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), and Ambiguous Language Use (DEP). 

### Step 3: Evaluate Each Proposition and Reason
- **Evaluating P1**: "Everyone who gets a college degree is better off."
  - This seems to be making a sweeping generalization about all college graduates without acknowledging the possibility that some graduates might not be better off. Hence, this could be a case of **Generalization (G)**.

- **Evaluating P2**: "All people who are better off as a result of getting a degree are good to have conversations with."
  - This is another sweeping statement. Not all people who are better off due to a degree are necessarily good to have conversations with; it overgeneralizes the connection between being better off and the ability to have good conversations. This also appears to be a **Generalization (G)**.

- **Evaluating the Reasoning Chain leading to the Conclusion C**:
  - Combining P1 and P2 to make the conclusion C depends on the generalizations made in P1 and P2. The conclusion itself may inherit these generalizations.
  - More critically, this looks like a classic case of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**, where the reason is really just a repeat of what the proposition is implying.

### Step 4: Determine the Specific Defective Classification
From the evaluation, the two most dominant defective types are Generalization (G) and Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR).

### Conclusion
The argument "Everyone who gets a college degree is better off. All people who are better off as a result of getting a degree are good to have conversations with. Therefore, everyone who gets a college degree is a good person to have a conversation with." exhibits characteristics of:
- **Generalization (G):** The propositions make sweeping statements that apply to all individuals without qualifying the statement or considering exceptions.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The conclusion essentially repeats the earlier propositions with slight rephrasing, implying the same point rather than adding new reasoning.

Thus, when applying IDAA to the given argument, we classify it primarily as a combination of **Generalization (G)** and **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**.
