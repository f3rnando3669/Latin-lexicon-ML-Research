To apply the method of decomposing the task of identifying the defective argument type, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Determine the central claim or proposition being argued in the string.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Identify the reason(s) given to support the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - Check if there's any corroboration or proof provided for the reason(s).
4. **Evaluate the Argument**:
   - Determine if the argument falls into one of the defective argument types defined: **Generalization (G)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**, **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**, **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**.

Let's apply these steps to the provided string.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)

The main proposition is:
- "You should never gamble!"

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)

The reasons given are:
1. "Once you start gambling you find it hard to stop."
2. "Soon you will spend all your money on gambling."
3. "Eventually you will turn to crime just to support your gambling addiction."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)

There is no explicit proof or evidence provided for the reasons in the argument. The reasons themselves are mentioned but not backed up by further arguments or evidence.

### Step 4: Evaluate the Argument

Now, we'll determine if the argument type is one of the defective types defined.

1. **Generalization (G)**: The claim "Once you start gambling you find it hard to stop" and subsequent points assume the worst-case scenario for all individuals. This is making a generalized statement without considering individuals who might gamble responsibly.
  
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: It does not appear that this string is trying to enumerate possibilities; it is projecting a single path or outcome from gambling.
  
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Each reason does not necessarily prove the central proposition definitively. Not everyone who starts gambling finds it hard to stop, spends all their money on gambling, or turns to crime.
  
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The reasons provided ("You find it hard to stop", "You will spend all your money", "You will turn to crime") are not necessarily causally linked compellingly to the proposition (i.e., gambling leads exactly to these outcomes always).
  
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reasons are not merely restating the proposition; they are supposed to build a case for why gambling should be avoided.
  
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This argument does not appeal to a universal agreement.
  
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language used is fairly straightforward and not ambiguous.

### Conclusion

The argument primarily fits under two defective argument types:

- **Generalization (G)**: Because it generalizes that everyone who starts gambling will have the same severe outcomes.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Because the reasons given do not conclusively prove that "you should never gamble."

### Final Classification

The string "You should never gamble! Once you start gambling you find it hard to stop. Soon you will spend all your money on gambling, and eventually you will turn to crime just to support your gambling addiction." is primarily identified as having the defective argument types:

- Generalization (G)
- Inconclusive Reason (IR)
