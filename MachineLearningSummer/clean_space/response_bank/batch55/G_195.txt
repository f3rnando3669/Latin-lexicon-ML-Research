To apply the decomposition of the advanced task (IDAA) to the task of classifying the given string (IDA), we need to follow systematic steps. Let's break down the task (D) into specific steps and apply it to the string "The child did not do his chores so therefore all children are lazy."

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
Determine what the statement is intending to prove or assert.
- "The child did not do his chores" is a specific instance.
- "All children are lazy" is the general proposition <P>.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
Determine the reason given to support the proposition.
- The reason given is "The child did not do his chores."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason <PR>
Determine any additional arguments that corroborate the reason <R>. In this case, there is no additional proof provided, only the initial reason.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type
Compare the given statement with the definitions of defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

Now, step by step:

#### Step 1: Identify <P>
- **Proposition <P>:** "All children are lazy."

#### Step 2: Identify <R>
- **Reason <R>:** "The child did not do his chores."

#### Step 3: Identify <PR>
- **Proof of Reason <PR>:** None provided in this case.

#### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type
- **Generalization <G>:** This argument type involves asserting something about all based on some or the majority. The statement "The child did not do his chores so therefore all children are lazy" seems to be an assertion about all children based on the behavior of one child.
- **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>:** Does not apply here as the argument does not claim to have enumerated all possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason <IR>:** This might be relevant as the reason given does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition, but this case fits better under generalization.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>:** Could be a consideration, but "The child did not do his chores" isnâ€™t a causal basis for "all children are lazy."
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>:** Not applicable here because the reason and proposition are distinct.
- **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>:** Not relevant as the argument does not appeal to a universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>:** Not relevant as the language used is not ambiguous.

Given the above analysis, the most fitting classification is:

- **Defective Argument Type:** <G> (Generalization)

By breaking the analysis into specific steps and examining the argument against each defective type, we determine that the statement "The child did not do his chores so therefore all children are lazy." is an example of Generalization (<G>).
