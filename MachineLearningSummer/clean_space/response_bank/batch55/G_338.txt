For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "The last Democrat winner of the New Hampshire primary won the general election. This year, the winner of the New Hampshire primary will win the general election," we will decompose the task of classifying defective arguments into specific steps and then apply these steps to the given string. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
Determine the main assertion or statement proposed in the argument.

In this case: 
**<P>:** "This year, the winner of the New Hampshire primary will win the general election."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Determine the causal basis provided to support the proposition.

In this case:
**<R>:** "The last Democrat winner of the New Hampshire primary won the general election."

### Step 3: Analyze the Argument for Defective Types
Examine whether the argument fits into any of the defective argument types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), and Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

**Analysis of defective types:**

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The argument asserts that because one Democrat winner in the past won the general election, the current year’s winner will also win. This is a generalization problem because it takes a specific instance and applies it universally.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The argument does not claim a complete enumeration of possibilities directly, so <FE> may not be applicable.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The reason does not undeniably establish the proposition. The fact that the last Democrat winner won does not guarantee the same outcome this year.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The causal basis ("last time’s winner won") is not compelling enough as it depends on numerous variables that might differ this year.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - The reason given is not exactly repeating the proposition; it provides a historical instance as justification.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - The argument does not rest on a presumed consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - There is no ambiguous language that shifts the meaning of the proposition.

### Step 4: Determine Primary Defective Type
Based on the analysis, decide which defective argument type(s) is/are most applicable.

**Conclusion:** The primary defective types identified here are **Generalization (<G>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**, with **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** also being relevant.

**Classification of s:** **<G>, <WCB>, <IR>**
