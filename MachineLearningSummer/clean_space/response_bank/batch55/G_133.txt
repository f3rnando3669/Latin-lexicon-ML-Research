For 
To apply \(IDAA\) to the statement "Four out of five dentists recommend Happy Glossy Smiley toothpaste brand. Therefore, it must be great," we follow the process step-by-step:

### Step 1: Understand the Argument Structure
Identify the parts of the statement:

1. **Proposition (<P>)** - The main claim: "Happy Glossy Smiley toothpaste brand must be great."
2. **Reason (<R>)** - The supporting reason: "Four out of five dentists recommend Happy Glossy Smiley toothpaste brand."

### Step 2: Analyze the Reason (<R>)
Examine the provided reason to determine if it conclusively supports the proposition:

- The reason relies on the testimony of a majority of dentists (4 out of 5).

### Step 3: Identify Defective Argument Type
Evaluate if the argument displays traits of defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)** - Making a broad assertion from a limited sample.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** - Claiming complete possibilities but missing some.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** - Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** - Weak causal basis.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** - Reason repeats the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** - Assuming universal agreement.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)** - Language interpreted differently than intended.

### Step 4: Match Argument to Defective Type

- **Generalization (G)** - The statement "Four out of five dentists recommend Happy Glossy Smiley toothpaste brand" suggests generalizing from the sample (dentists) to the entirety (the quality of the toothpaste). It implies that because a majority of dentists recommend it, the toothpaste is inherently great.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** - The recommendation by dentists alone does not necessarily substantiate the quality of the product. More concrete evidence about the toothpaste's efficacy would be needed to support the proposition conclusively.

### Step 5: Classify the Argument
After analysis, the primary defective argument type here is:

- **Generalization (G)** - This is the most fitting category since the argument generalizes the quality of the toothpaste based on the recommendation from a limited sample of dentists.

### Conclusion
By decomposing and analyzing the statement as per \(IDAA\), we classify "Four out of five dentists recommend Happy Glossy Smiley toothpaste brand. Therefore, it must be great." as a type **Generalization (G)**.
