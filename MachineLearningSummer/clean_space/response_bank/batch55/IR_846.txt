For 
To apply IDAA to the given string "Nicholas - 'An apple is a vegetable.' Alexis - 'Don't listen to Nicholas; he is failing AP Language'," we will decompose the task IDA (classifying the string as one of the defective argument types G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP) into specific steps and then perform those steps.

**Steps for IDAA:**
1. **Identify the Propositions and Reasons:** Extract the propositions (P) and reasons (R) from the string.
2. **Classify the Propositions and Reasons:** Classify each element as one of the defective argument types.
3. **Determine Overall Classification:** Determine the overall defective argument type for the string.

Let's proceed step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Propositions and Reasons
- **Nicholas:** "An apple is a vegetable."
  - This is a proposition (P) asserting a claim.
- **Alexis:** "Don't listen to Nicholas; he is failing AP Language."
  - This is a reason (R) given by Alexis to discredit Nicholas’s proposition.

### Step 2: Classify the Propositions and Reasons
- **Nicholas' Proposition (P):** "An apple is a vegetable."
  - This is a clear assertion, though factually incorrect, but it doesn't contain any of the defective argument types by itself as per definitions given for G, FE, IR, etc.
- **Alexis' Reason (R):** "Don't listen to Nicholas; he is failing AP Language."
  - To classify this:
    - **G (Generalization):** Not applicable here since it doesn’t generalize from a part to a whole.
    - **FE (Incomplete Enumeration):** Not applicable since it’s not trying to enumerate possibilities.
    - **IR (Inconclusive Reason):** Not applicable since it doesn’t try to show P is correct.
    - **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** No repetition in R of P.
    - **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis):** Not directly giving any causal basis.
    - **FU (Presumptuous Consensus):** Not appealing to universal agreement.
    - **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use):** Language is clear in terms but not ambiguous.

### Step 3: Determine Overall Classification
- The flaw in Alexis' reason "Don't listen to Nicholas; he is failing AP Language," is an attempt to discredit Nicholas based on his academic performance rather than addressing the content of Nicholas's proposition. This is a classic **ad hominem** fallacy where Alexis attacks Nicholas' character instead of the argument itself.

Given the types provided, the most analogous can be identified as **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**:
- **Inconclusive Reason:** Although it is specifically defined more about reasonability, in this context, Alexis' argument does not conclusively refute Nicholas' proposition about apples and vegetables. Instead, it attempts to sidestep the actual argument by attacking Nicholas' credibility, which is an inconclusive way to address the argument.

Therefore, the classification of the string "Nicholas - 'An apple is a vegetable.' Alexis - 'Don't listen to Nicholas; he is failing AP Language'" is **IR (Inconclusive Reason)** under the provided flaws.
