For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of decomposition into specific steps to the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types) to the string "But, Dad, I know you smoked when you were my age, so how can you tell me not to do it?", we will follow a structured approach to break down and analyze the argumentation flaws.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The proposition in this string is: "Dad cannot tell me not to smoke."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The provided reason is: "Dad smoked when he was my age."

3. **Determine if the Reason (<R>) directly supports the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Evaluate whether the given reason logically supports the proposition. Here, the reason suggests hypocrisy rather than a logical refutation of the father's advice.

4. **Classify with respect to Defective Argument Types:**
   - We need to check whether this argument falls into one of the predefined defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>.

### Detailed Classification Analysis

- **Generalization (<G>):** The argument does not generalize a characteristic or a property to an entire group.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument does not attempt to list all possibilities and miss out on some.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The Reason provided here does not logically support the Proposition. Instead, it points out a perceived hypocrisy:
  - **Proposition (<P>):** "Dad cannot tell me not to smoke."
  - **Reason (<R>):** "Dad smoked when he was my age."
  - The father’s past behavior does not logically inhibit his ability to advise against smoking; hence the reason is inconclusive or irrelevant to the proposition.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The Reason does not simply restate the Proposition.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal basis here is not necessarily insufficient but irrelevant. However, this fits better into <IR>.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The argument does not assume consensus to be true.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** There is no ambiguous use of language.

### Conclusion and Classification
The string "But, Dad, I know you smoked when you were my age, so how can you tell me not to do it?" is best classified as <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) because the Reason provided (Dad’s past smoking) does not logically support the Proposition (Dad cannot advise against smoking). This forms the basis of our final classification using <IDAA> methodology.

**Classification: <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**
