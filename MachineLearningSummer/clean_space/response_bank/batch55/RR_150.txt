Sure, let's apply IDAA (Decomposition of IDA) step by step to classify the argument "We know he’s not lying since he says he’s telling the truth."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (IDAA to the given argument):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Proposition (P) is what is intended to be proved.
   - In this case, the proposition is: "He’s not lying."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Reason (R) is the causal basis for P, establishing its truth.
   - Here, the reason given is: "He says he’s telling the truth."

3. **Compare and Analyze Potential Defective Argument Types:**
   - Now we need to check for defective argument types based on our classifications:
     - **Generalization (G):** Not applicable as there's no generalization.
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable as enumeration is not involved.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason given does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. However, we'll need to check other types before concluding.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reason given is weak because "saying he's telling the truth" is not a compelling causal basis for "he’s not lying."
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason (R) is essentially the same as the proposition (P), just rephrased. Here, (R) "He says he's telling the truth" is repeating (P) "He’s not lying" without adding any new supporting information.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Not applicable as there's no mention of universal agreement.
     - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Not applicable as there's no ambiguous language use.

4. **Conclude the Defective Argument Type:**
   - Based on the above analysis, the most fitting type of defective argument is **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**, as the reason provided simply repeats the proposition without adding any substantive support.

### Conclusion:
The argument "We know he’s not lying since he says he’s telling the truth." can be classified as a defective argument of type <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
