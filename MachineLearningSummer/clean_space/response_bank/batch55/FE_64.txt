For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument into specific steps) to classify the string "Purchase our product or no one is going to think you’re attractive," we'll go through a structured approach to identify which type of defective argument it might be. Here are the steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
A <P> sets forth summarily what we intend to prove. In this case, the proposition is:
- "No one is going to think you’re attractive."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
An <R> sets forth the causal basis for <P>. Here, the reason might be implicitly:
- "Because you did not purchase our product."

### Step 3: Identify if There is a Proof of Reason (<PR>)
A <PR> supports the <R> by means of additional arguments. In this case, there isn’t any additional argument presented to support the reason.

### Step 4: Determine the Defective Argument Type
Now examine the defective argument types one by one to see which one fits.

#### Type <G>: Generalization
- Generalization involves an assertion based on one part or a majority but not necessarily applicable to all. This does not match our case as the proposition and reason do not refer to a majority or sample of individuals.

#### Type <FE>: Incomplete Enumeration
- Incomplete Enumeration occurs when claiming to have made a complete enumeration of possibilities but missing out some. This does not apply as the string does not enumerate possibilities.

#### Type <IR>: Inconclusive Reason
- Inconclusive Reason is when the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. There's a somewhat relevant match here: purchasing a product does not conclusively demonstrate how it will affect perceived attractiveness.

#### Type <RR>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition
- Faulty Repetition is where the reason is merely a restatement of the proposition. This is not applicable here, as the reason is different from the proposition.

#### Type <WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis
- Insufficient Causal Basis is where the causal basis for the proposition is not compelling. This fits well: claiming that attractiveness depends solely on purchasing the product is weak and unconvincing causal reasoning.

#### Type <FU>: Presumptuous Consensus
- Presumptuous Consensus assumes a proof as certain because it is "universally agreed upon." This does not apply to the given string as it doesn't make such an assumption.

#### Type <DEP>: Ambiguous Language Use
- Ambiguous Language Use means the proof could be taken in another sense than intended. The language in the given string is quite clear and does not suffer from ambiguity.

### Step 5: Conclusion
After evaluating the string against the defective argument types, we conclude that the primary defective argument type is:

- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**

The reasoning provided ("Purchase our product") does not provide a compelling basis for the proposition ("No one is going to think you’re attractive").

Therefore, the result of applying IDAA to the string "Purchase our product or no one is going to think you’re attractive" is:

- **<WCB>**
