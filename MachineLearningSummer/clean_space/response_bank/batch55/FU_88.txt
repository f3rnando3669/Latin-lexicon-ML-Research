For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of IDA) to the statement "Slavery is accepted by just about everyone in our society, so it’s ethical to keep slaves," we'll need to break down the advanced task of classifying this string into specific steps.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of Task (IDA)

1. **Identify the components of the argument:**
   - Find the Proposition (<P>).
   - Identify the Reason (<R>).
   - Check if there is any Proof of Reason (<PR>).

2. **Classify the argument as one of the defective types:**
   - Check if the argument commits a Generalization (G).
   - Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE).
   - Check for an Inconclusive Reason (IR).
   - Examine for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).
   - Look for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR).
   - Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU).
   - Look for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

### Step-by-Step Classification (IDAA)

1. **Identify the components of the argument:**
   - Proposition (<P>): "It’s ethical to keep slaves."
   - Reason (<R>): "Slavery is accepted by just about everyone in our society."

2. **Classify the defective argument type:**
   - **Generalization (G):** 
     - Does the argument make an assertion applicable to all based on some or a majority of individuals? 
     - No, the argument does not generalize a specific case to all.
   
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
     - Does the argument claim a complete enumeration of possibilities but omit some?
     - No, it does not enumerate possibilities.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
     - Does the reason not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
     - This may not necessarily be conclusively demonstrated by the reason alone but needs further examination under the next types.
   
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
     - Is the reason for the proposition provided not compelling enough?
     - This could be argued as an instance of Insufficient Causal Basis since societal acceptance does not inherently provide a moral justification.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
     - Is the reason the same as the proposition just restated?
     - No, the reason is different from the proposition.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
     - Is the proof of reason assumed certain due to a supposed universal agreement?
     - Yes, this statement assumes the correctness of an ethical stance based on a claimed universal acceptance, disregarding diversity in ethical views.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
     - Could the argument be taken in another sense than intended?
     - No, the language seems straightforward and unambiguous in its intention.

### Conclusion
After decomposing the task and examining the defective argument types, the argument "Slavery is accepted by just about everyone in our society, so it’s ethical to keep slaves" falls under the defective argument type of **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**. The argument erroneously assumes that societal acceptance equates to ethical correctness, which is a presumptuous consensus fallacy.
