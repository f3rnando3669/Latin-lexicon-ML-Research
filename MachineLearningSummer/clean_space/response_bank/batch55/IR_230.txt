For 
To apply IDAA to classify the argument "A teacher tells Billy to stop talking, and he yells back: 'Sarah was talking too!'", we first need to decompose the task (IDA) and then apply this structured approach to identify which type of defective argument it is.

### Decomposition (D) of IDA:
1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - What is being stated or claimed by Billy?
   
2. **Determine if there is a Reason (R)**:
   - What causal basis or reasoning does Billy provide?

3. **Check for Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   - Is there any further argumentation or proof provided to support the Reason?

4. **Assess the defect type categorization (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP)**:
   - Based on the elements identified (P, R, PR), classify the argument according to the defective argument types outlined.

### Application (IDAA):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
    - Billy's implied proposition (P) is that it is unfair for him to be singled out for talking because Sarah was talking too.

2. **Determine if there is a Reason (R)**:
    - The Reason (R) Billy provides is essentially the fact that Sarah was also talking. His reasoning seems to be that because Sarah is talking, his talking should be considered acceptable or at least not singularly reprimandable.

3. **Check for Proof of Reason (PR)**:
    - Billy does not provide additional arguments or proof beyond his initial claim that Sarah was also talking. There is no further substantiation given.

4. **Assess the defect type categorization**:
    - **Generalization (G)**: This is not a generalization; Billy isn't making a claim about a majority based on one instance.
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This doesn't apply; Billy is not making a claim about enumerating possibilities.
    - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason (R) provided by Billy doesn't directly demonstrate the correctness of his proposition (P). Just because Sarah was also talking does not logically make Billy’s talking acceptable.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis ("Sarah was talking too") isn't directly related to the fairness of reprimanding Billy for his talking. However, it is not introducing a new causal link; it is just a weak defense.
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Billy’s response does not just repeat the proposition; it introduces new information.
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This does not apply; Billy isn’t appealing to universally agreed norms.
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: This does not seem to apply here; Billy's statement is clear in its intention.

Based on the assessment, the most fitting defective argument type in this scenario is **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, as the reasoning provided by Billy (that Sarah was also talking) does not conclusively demonstrate or justify his proposition (that it is unfair for him to be singled out for talking).

Thus, applying IDAA, the argument "A teacher tells Billy to stop talking, and he yells back: 'Sarah was talking too!'" is classified as an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
