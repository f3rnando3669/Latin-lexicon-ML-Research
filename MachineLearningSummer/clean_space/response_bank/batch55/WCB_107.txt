For 
Certainly! Let's apply IDAA (the decomposition of IDA into specific steps) to classify the given string "When the new administration came on campus, test scores increased and attendance improved." Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
A proposition is an assertion or claim that the argument is attempting to establish. In the given string, the proposition seems to be implied, but can be formulated as:
- \( P \): "The new administration coming on campus caused test scores to increase and attendance to improve."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
The reason provides the causal basis for the proposition. It asserts why the proposition should be true. In the given string, the reason appears to be:
- \( R \): Timing of events: The increase in test scores and attendance improvement happened after the new administration came on campus.

### Step 3: Check the Proof of Reason <PR>
Proof of reason corroborates the reason through additional arguments or evidence. The given string does not explicitly provide a proof of reason, making it difficult to identify directly. We may assume it to be:
- \( PR \): Observational evidence of improved metrics following the administrative change.

### Step 4: Analyze for Defective Argument Types
Now, let's scrutinize the string for any of the identified defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**
   - The argument does not generalize a part to the whole; it discusses specific outcomes (test scores and attendance).

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
   - The argument does not claim a complete enumeration of possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
   - The reason (<R>) given does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. The correlation does not imply causation, which is a critical flaw. The improvement in scores and attendance might have other causes.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
   - The reason is weak if it does not compellingly link the new administration to the observed outcomes. No substantial causal mechanism or direct evidence has been provided.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**
   - The reason is not a mere repetition of the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
   - The argument does not appeal to universal agreement for proof.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**
   - There is no evident ambiguous language in the given string.

### Step 5: Classification
Based on the analysis, the string "When the new administration came on campus, test scores increased and attendance improved" can best be classified as:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided (timing of events) does not conclusively establish that the new administration caused the improvements.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis is weak, as no compelling evidence or mechanism is provided for the claim.

### Conclusion
The defective argument type(s) most applicable to the given string are:

- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**

These classifications indicate that the argument lacks sufficient proof and compelling reasoning to firmly establish the proposition.
