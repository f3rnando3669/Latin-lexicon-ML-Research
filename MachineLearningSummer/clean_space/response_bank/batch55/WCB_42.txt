For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given statement "Every time I wear this necklace, I pass my exams. Therefore, wearing this necklace causes me to pass my exams," we need to decompose the advanced task of classifying the argument type (i.e., <IDA>) into specific steps (i.e., <D>). Here's how we can proceed step-by-step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>) and its Reason (<R>)
1. **Proposition (<P>):** The conclusion or statement that is being asserted.
   - In this case: "Wearing this necklace causes me to pass my exams."
2. **Reason (<R>):** The causal basis or premised reason given to support the proposition.
   - In this case: "Every time I wear this necklace, I pass my exams."

### Step 2: Determine the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
3. **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Any additional argument or evidence meant to support the reason.
   - This argument does not provide additional evidence beyond the initial observation.

### Step 3: Evaluate the Argument for Defective Types
4. **Check for Generalization (<G>):**
   - **<G>:** Proposition based on one part or a majority, but not necessarily applicable to all.
   - This is not immediately applicable as the assertion is about a specific individual's experience rather than a generalization about a group.

5. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - **<FE>:** Proposition claims a complete enumeration of possibilities but misses some pertinent ones.
   - This is not the issue here, as the statement does not enumerate possibilities.

6. **Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - **<IR>:** The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the propositionâ€™s correctness.
   - Here, the causal link is weak because there is no conclusive demonstration that wearing the necklace actually causes the exam success. 

7. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - **<WCB>:** The causal basis for the reason is not compelling.
   - There is indeed an insufficient causal basis since correlation (wearing the necklace and passing exams) does not imply causation.

8. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - **<RR>:** The reason repeats the proposition without adding new information.
   - This argument does not simply repeat the proposition; it does try to provide a reason.

9. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - **<FU>:** Assumes something is universally agreed upon which is still in dispute.
   - This is not the issue here because there is no claim about universal consensus.

10. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - **<DEP>:** The argument can be taken in another sense than intended.
   - There is no notable ambiguous language in the statement.

### Step 4: Conclude the Appropriate Defective Argument Type
Based on the evaluation, the most fitting defective argument types for the given statement are:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason given (correlation) is not sufficient to conclusively demonstrate the proposition (causation).
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis (wearing the necklace) is not compelling enough to establish the cause (passing exams).

Thus, the string "Every time I wear this necklace, I pass my exams. Therefore, wearing this necklace causes me to pass my exams." demonstrates defects of the types <IR> and <WCB>.
