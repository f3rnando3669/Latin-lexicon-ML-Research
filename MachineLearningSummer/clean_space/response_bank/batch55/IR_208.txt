To apply the process of IDAA to the string "John agrees with me that drinking energy drinks are bad for you," we need to break down the task of identifying defective arguments (IDA) into specific steps (D). Here’s the step-by-step decomposition and classification:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) for IDA:
1. **Identify the Proposition (P):** Determine what is being set forth as the main claim or assertion.
2. **Identify the Reason (R):** Identify the causal basis that is meant to establish the truth of the Proposition.
3. **Identify Proof of Reason (PR):** Determine if there’s additional evidence or argument used to corroborate the Reason.
4. **Classify Potential Defective Argument (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP):** Evaluate if there is a defect in the argument based on the types defined.

### Application of IDAA to the String:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Proposition: "Drinking energy drinks are bad for you."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Reason: "John agrees with me."

3. **Identify Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - Proof of Reason: Implicitly, the proof of reason here is the consensus, i.e., John's agreement is presented as supporting evidence.

4. **Classify Potential Defective Argument:**
   - Analyzing the components:
     - The Proposition (P) is a health claim about energy drinks.
     - The Reason (R) presented is the agreement of John, which leverages consensus.

   - Evaluate for Defects:
     - **Generalization (G):** Not applicable here, as no generalization is made from a sample to a whole population.
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable here, as no enumeration of possibilities is presented.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This doesn’t conclusively demonstrate the proposition as true since John's opinion isn't evidence of the health claim itself.
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Not applicable, as the Reason (R) isn’t merely restating the Proposition (P).
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The Reason (R) does have a weak causal basis because an opinion doesn’t compellingly establish the truth of the Proposition (P).
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Applicable here because the support for the Proposition (P) relies on the assumption of consensus (John’s agreement), which is presented as if it's universally agreed upon while the actual claim about the health effects remains in dispute.
     - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Not applicable, the language does not appear ambiguous or open to different interpretations.

Given the analysis, the defective argument type that best fits the string is:

### Identified Defective Argument: Presumptuous Consensus (FU)

By applying the decomposition of IDAA step-by-step, we identify that the reasoning based on someone's agreement (John’s in this case) falls into the category of Presumptuous Consensus (FU).
