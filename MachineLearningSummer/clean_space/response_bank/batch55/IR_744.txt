To apply the process of IDAA to the given dialogue between John and Marvin, we need to first decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps. Here’s a step-by-step plan to carry out IDAA for the provided argument:

### Step 1: Identify Propositions and Reasons
We need to identify each proposition (P) and associated reason (R) that appear in the conversation.

- **John's Proposition (P1)**: "Members of the UbaTuba White Men's Club are upstanding citizens of the community."
- **Marvin's Counter (P2)**: "Then why are there so many of these members in jail?"
- **John's Response (R1)**: "They were never true UbaTuba White Men's Club members."
- **Marvin's Inquiry for Clarification (P3)**: "What’s a true UbaTuba White Men's Club member?"
- **John's Definition (P4)**: "Those who don't go to jail."

### Step 2: Identify Potential Defective Arguments
Now, we classify any part of this conversation as fitting into one of the defective argument types.

- **P1**: "Members of the UbaTuba White Men's Club are upstanding citizens of the community."
- **P2**: "Then why are there so many of these members in jail?" (not necessarily a defective argument but a counter)
- **R1**: "They were never true UbaTuba White Men's Club members."
- **P3**: "What’s a true UbaTuba White Men's Club member?" (Question, not a defective argument)
- **P4**: "Those who don't go to jail."

### Step 3: Check the Types of Defective Arguments

**Analyze P1 and R1:**
- The argument that members of the UbaTuba White Men's Club are upstanding citizens presumes all members fit this characterization, which could be a **Generalization (G)** defect.
- John's response (R1) "They were never true UbaTuba White Men's Club members" seems to avoid addressing the generalization by redefining the membership post-factum. This implies **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: it doesn't conclusively demonstrate that all members are upstanding but redefines members to those who fit the initial claim.
  
**Analyze P4:**
- The definition "Those who don't go to jail" as a true member could be seen as **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** because it essentially repeats the proposition in a different form without providing additional proof.

### Step 4: Conclude the Classification
Based on the analysis:

- **P1** might suffer from a **Generalization (G)** defect.
- **R1**, reclassifying members post-criticism, shows characteristics of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
- **P4** is essentially repeating the definition and could be classified as **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**.

### Full IDAA Application:

1. **Classify each string**:
   - John's Argument: "Members of the UbaTuba White Men's Club are upstanding citizens of the community." → **Generalization (G)**
   - Marvin's Counter: "Then why are there so many of these members in jail?" → Not defective, valid counter
   - John's Response: "They were never true UbaTuba White Men's Club members." → **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
   - Marvin's Clarification: "What’s a true UbaTuba White Men's Club member?" → Not defective, clarification request
   - John's Definition: "Those who don't go to jail." → **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**

2. **Put together the classifications**:
   - **John's Proposition (P1)**: Generalization (G)
   - **John's Reason (R1)**: Inconclusive Reason (IR)
   - **John's Definition (P4)**: Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)

This reflects the decomposition of the argument and its evaluation based on the identified defective argument types.
