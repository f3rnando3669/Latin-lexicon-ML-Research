To apply the task of classification of the argument as one of the defective argument types (<IDA>) step by step through the decomposition of the task (<D>), let's break down the process. Here's the step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)

The Proposition (<P>) is the statement or claim that the argument is trying to prove. In the given argument:
> "Tommy went to go swimming for the afternoon and later bought a lottery ticket. He won the lottery which must mean that swimming makes you win the lottery."

The Proposition is:
> "Swimming makes you win the lottery."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)

The Reason (<R>) is the causal basis that is offered to support the Proposition. In this argument, the implied reason is:
> "Tommy went swimming and later won the lottery."

### Step 3: Identify Defective Argument Types

Now, we need to classify the given argument based on the defective argument types. We will check it against each defined defective argument type:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:  
   - This would occur if the Proposition is based on observing one or a few instances and generalizing those observations to all instances. Here, the Proposition is based on a single instance (Tommy's case), implying a general rule without sufficient evidence.
  
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:  
   - This applies if all potential scenarios are not considered in the enumeration. The argument does not enumerate different conditions under which someone wins the lottery.
  
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:  
   - This happens when the Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the Proposition. The Reason provided ("Tommy swam, then won the lottery") does not necessarily demonstrate the causality implied in the Proposition. This fits the argument.
  
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:  
   - Arises when the causal basis is not compelling enough. The claim that swimming causes lottery wins is not sufficiently justified by the sequence of events.
  
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:  
   - This type of defect occurs when the Reason is just a restatement of the Proposition. This is not the case here.
  
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:  
   - This occurs when something is claimed to be true simply because it is universally agreed upon. This is not evident in the given argument.
  
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:  
   - This applies when the Proof of Reason can be interpreted in another way than intended. There is no ambiguity in the statement provided.

### Step 4: Assign the Appropriate Defective Argument Type

Based on the analysis:
- The most fitting defective argument type here is **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** because the Reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.
- Additionally, **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** can also be applied because the causal basis (swimming leading to winning a lottery) is not compelling.

### Conclusion

Based on the above steps, the classification of the argument "Tommy went to go swimming for the afternoon and later bought a lottery ticket. He won the lottery which must mean that swimming makes you win the lottery." identifies two defective argument types:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**

Thus, we have applied <IDAA> to classify the defective argument types appropriately.
