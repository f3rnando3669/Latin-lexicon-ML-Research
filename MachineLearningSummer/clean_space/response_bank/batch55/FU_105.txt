For 
To apply the <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument into specific steps) to the provided string, "Matthew: Everyone believes that teachers get paid enough for the job they do. Therefore, it must be true," we need to follow the decomposed steps to determine which type of defective argument it is. 

Here is the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - The proposition is the main assertion intended to be proven.
   - In this case: "Teachers get paid enough for the job they do."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - The reason is the causal basis for asserting the proposition.
   - In this case: "Everyone believes that teachers get paid enough for the job they do."

3. **Examine the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - The proof of reason corroborates the reason through additional arguments.
   - In this statement, there isn't a detailed proof presented, just a consensus claim.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument (IDA):**
   - Determine if the argument fits any defective types:

   - **Generalization (G):** Not applicable here as the argument doesnâ€™t generalize from a part to a whole.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable here as the argument is not enumerating possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason (that "everyone believes it") does not necessarily demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis (that "'everyone' believes it") is weak and non-compelling to establish the truth.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason is not a mere repetition of the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This is the most fitting type. The argument claims "everyone believes" something to assume it as certainly true, which is still in dispute and does not necessarily confirm its truth.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language in the statement is not particularly ambiguous.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - After evaluating the defective types, we classify the argument as <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).
   
Therefore, the argument "Matthew: Everyone believes that teachers get paid enough for the job they do. Therefore, it must be true," is of type <FU>, Presumptuous Consensus.
