For 
To apply **IDAA** (application of the decomposition of a task into specific steps) to the task of classifying the string "All writing teachers must be awesome because Ms. Lopez is.", we will decompose the classification task **IDA** into specific steps.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>

First, we need to identify the proposition, <P>, which is the statement we intend to prove.

In this case, the proposition is:
**P:** "All writing teachers must be awesome."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>

Next, we identify the reason, <R>, which is the causal basis provided for the proposition.

In this case, the reason is:
**R:** "because Ms. Lopez is (awesome)."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Argument for Defects

We now evaluate the argument to check if it falls under one of the defective argument types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

Analyzing the argument:
- **Generalization (<G>):** Is the assertion based on one or a majority and incorrectly applied to all? 
  - Yes, the proposition "All writing teachers must be awesome" is based solely on the example of Ms. Lopez, which is then generalized to all writing teachers.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument

Based on the above analysis, the argument "All writing teachers must be awesome because Ms. Lopez is." falls under the defective argument type:

**<G>: Generalization**

### Conclusion

By applying **IDAA**, we have decomposed the task of classifying the given string into specific steps and determined that the argument is a type of defective argument known as Generalization (<G>).
