For 
To apply \( <IDAA> \) to the given string "With 80% of consumers choosing our product, isn't it obvious that you should, too?", we need to decompose the task of classifying the argument (as defective) into specific steps. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step decomposition:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition \( <P> \)
Determine what the argument is trying to assert or prove. In this case:
- **Proposition \( <P> \)**: You should choose our product.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason \( <R> \)
Determine the reason provided to support the Proposition.
- **Reason \( <R> \)**: 80% of consumers choose our product.

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason \( <PR> \)
Determine if there is any additional argument or proof supporting the Reason given.
- **Proof of Reason \( <PR> \)**: None explicitly stated, the argument presumes that the large percentage itself is proof.

### Step 4: Check for Defective Argument Type
Analyze if the given argument matches any of the defective argument types defined.

- **Generalization \( <G> \)**: Not applicable here, as the argument does not generalize based on a small or non-representative sample.
- **Incomplete Enumeration \( <FE> \)**: Not applicable here, as the argument does not rely on enumeration.
- **Inconclusive Reason \( <IR> \)**: While related, the Reason itself is concrete (80%).
- **Insufficient Causal Basis \( <WCB> \)**: Possibly applicable since the Reason doesn't inherently justify the Proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition \( <RR> \)**: Not applicable here, as the Reason does provide new information.
- **Presumptuous Consensus \( <FU> \)**: Potentially applicable since the argument implies consensus (80% of consumers) as sufficient grounds to accept the Proposition.
- **Ambiguous Language Use \( <DEP> \)**: Not applicable as the language here is not ambiguous.

### Step 5: Conclusion and Classification
Based on the analysis, choose the most fitting defective argument type.

The argument appears to hinge on the assumption that because a large majority (80%) choose the product, it is inherently the right choice for everyone else. This suggests the logical fallacy of assuming consensus where it might not validly apply to the specific decision context. Thus, the argument most closely fits:

- **Presumptuous Consensus \( <FU> \)**

### Final Classification:
The argument "With 80% of consumers choosing our product, isn't it obvious that you should, too?" falls under the defective argument type **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.
