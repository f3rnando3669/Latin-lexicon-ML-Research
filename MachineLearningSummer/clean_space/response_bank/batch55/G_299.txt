For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the advanced task IDA—classifying defective arguments—into specific steps) to a given statement, we need to follow a systematic process. Here's how we can break it down:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>)
- **Proposition (<P>)**: "If America doesn’t send weapons to the Syrian rebels, they won’t be able to defend themselves against their warring dictator."
- **Reason (<R>)**: "They’ll lose their civil war, and that dictator will oppress them, and the Soviets will consequently carve out a sphere of influence that spreads across the entire Middle East."

### Step 2: Analyze the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
Since <PR> is supposed to corroborate the Reason with additional arguments, we need to see if the Reason is supported appropriately.

### Step 3: Check for Defective Argument Types
1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - Is the assertion based on a subset but claimed to be universally applicable?
   - No clear evidence of a generalization fallacy as the argument is relatively specific.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - Does it claim a complete enumeration of possibilities but miss out on some?
   - This doesn’t apply here since the argument is not necessarily presenting an exhaustive list.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - Does the Reason conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition?
   - The Reason provided includes a series of events that might happen, but it does not conclusively link the sending of arms to preventing Soviet influence—it includes assumptions and possible events.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - Is the causal basis for the proposition weak or non-compelling?
   - Yes, the causal chain suggested ("they’ll lose the civil war" leading to "Soviets will carve out a sphere of influence that spreads across the entire Middle East") is potentially weak and speculative.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - Is the Reason merely a restatement of the Proposition without additional support?
   - The Reason given is a bit more elaborate and not a mere restatement.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - Is something assumed to be true because of a supposed universal agreement?
   - This fallacy does not seem relevant to the given statement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
   - Is the Proof of Reason ambiguous or could it be taken in a different sense than intended?
   - The statement is relatively clear in its language but speculative in its causal prediction.

### Step 4: Concluding the Classification
Based on the analysis:
- The proposition and reasoning provided do not conclusively demonstrate the truth of the proposition due to speculative connections.
- The causal basis submitted for the proposition is not compelling.

Given this, the argument best fits:
1. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The Reason provided as a causal basis is speculative and weak.

### Final Classification
The argument "If America doesn’t send weapons to the Syrian rebels, they won’t be able to defend themselves against their warring dictator. They’ll lose their civil war, and that dictator will oppress them, and the Soviets will consequently carve out a sphere of influence that spreads across the entire Middle East." mainly falls under **<IR> Inconclusive Reason** and **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**.
