To apply the decomposition of the advanced task (IDAA) to the identification of the defective argument type (IDA) for the given string, we need to break down the task <IDA> into its constitutive steps. Let's go step-by-step through the process:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Determine the primary assertion or claim being made in the argument.
   - In this case, Lola makes the assertion that "John would not be a good fit to manage this project."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Find the causal basis or reason offered to support the proposition.
   - Lola supports her assertion with the reason: "because he doesn't have a lot of experience with project management."

3. **Examine the Exchange:**
   - Look at the response by John and analyze if it directly addresses or refutes Lola's reason.
   - John responds: "But you don't have a lot of experience in project management either!"

4. **Compare Reason and Response:**
   - Check if the response provides evidence against the original reason (Lola’s reason) or merely sidesteps it.
   - John’s response does not directly address Lola’s reason. Instead, it points out a similar lack of experience in Lola.

5. **Determine the Type of Defective Argument:**
   - Using the classifications of defective arguments, identify which category fits the observed flaw in reasoning.
   - Here, John’s response is diverting attention and does not address the core reason provided by Lola. This is an example of a faulty argument because it tries to undermine Lola’s claim by attacking her instead of focusing on the argument itself.

Let's correlate this with our defective argument types:
   - **Generalization (G)**: Not applicable here as this argument is not about applying a general rule from specific instances.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable here as Lola is not claiming to have covered all possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Might be considered if John had provided a weak reason; however, John doesn't challenge the reason directly.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: If John had argued that Lola's causal basis for her proposition was not compelling, this would apply.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: John’s response is not simply a repetition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Not applicable as there is no claim of universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Not applicable here as the language is clear, though irrelevant to the original reason.

Upon further consideration, the most appropriate classification is likely that John’s response is a **deflection rather than a direct argument**, and while it doesn't fit precisely into **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, the thrust of John's response is shifting the focus.

Thus, more specifically, this could be a type of **ad hominem (personal attack)** fallacy — an argument strategy that attacks the person rather than addressing the point they made, which wasn't directly defined but is a recognized type of argumentative flaw.

Hence, under the definitions provided, this could be closest to **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** but more accurately, it's a case of **ad hominem**.
