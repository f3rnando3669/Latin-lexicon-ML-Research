For 
To apply the process of IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string into specific steps) to the given string "When the arguer is attacked vs. the argument that is attacked, this is an example of:", let us proceed step-by-step:

### Step 1: Understanding the Task
- **Task IDA:** Classify a given string as one of the defective argument types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

### Step 2: Analyze the String
- The given string is: "When the arguer is attacked vs. the argument that is attacked, this is an example of:"
- The string appears to make a comparison between attacking the person (arguer) versus attacking the argument.

### Step 3: Identifying Key Components
- **Main Clause:** "When the arguer is attacked vs. the argument that is attacked,"
  - This indicates a distinction between two types of attacks: one on the person and one on the argument.
- **Concluding Phrase:** "this is an example of:"
  - This seeks to classify the preceding information into a category.

### Step 4: Match with Known Defective Argument Types
1. **Generalization (<G>):** This involves making a broad claim based on limited examples.
   - The given string does not involve generalizing based on examples.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This involves missing out on pertinent possibilities in an enumeration.
   - The given string does not enumerate possibilities, so <FE> is not applicable.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This means the provided reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
   - The string is not presenting a reason for a proposition, but simply describing a scenario.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This implies a weak causal basis for a reason.
   - The string does not provide a causal basis to evaluate.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This involves repeating the proposition instead of providing a distinct reason.
   - The string does not repeat any proposition or argument.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Assuming universal agreement on something still in dispute.
   - No claim of universal agreement is made in the string.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** This involves a proposition that can be taken in another sense than intended.
   - The string does not use ambiguous language in the context given; it clearly differentiates two types of attacks.

### Step 5: Consider Other Logical Fallacies
- The string seems to describe a specific type of logical fallacy known as "ad hominem," where the arguer is attacked instead of the argument. However, "ad hominem" is not strictly one of the defined defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Step 6: Conclusion
- Since the given string does not directly fall into one of the specified defective argument types but rather describes an "ad hominem" fallacy (a different categorical logical fallacy), it seems not applicable under the specified defective arguments.

Thus, the provided string "When the arguer is attacked vs. the argument that is attacked, this is an example of:" does not directly map to one of the specified defective argument types within the scope of IDA as it pertains more accurately to an "ad hominem" fallacy.

### Result:
The string does not classify under <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>. It describes an "ad hominem" logical fallacy, which is outside the given classifications.
