For 
Sure, let's decompose the task of classifying the given statement according to <IDAA>. The steps of decomposition are as follows:

1. Identify the Proposition (<P>).
2. Identify the Reason (<R>).
3. Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>), if present.
4. Determine if the argument fits any of the defective argument types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).
5. Classify the string according to the identified defective argument type.

Let's apply these steps to the given statement:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
**Proposition (<P>): "In its origins [AIDS] was entirely a disease of sodomites."**

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
**Reason (<R>): "That the first case was diagnosed a little over a decade after the so-called "Gay Rights" and "Gay Pride" movement gained momentum and force can hardly be coincidental."**

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
There's no explicit proof of reason in the statement. The statement implies a causal relationship without providing additional proof.

### Step 4: Determine if the argument fits any of the defective argument types

- **Generalization (G):** The claim that AIDS was originally "entirely" a disease of sodomites is a broad generalization, implying it does not occur in anyone else, which is not correct.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** There's no enumeration provided.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason provided (the timing of diagnosis post-Gay Rights/Gay Pride) does not conclusively demonstrate that AIDS was "entirely a disease of sodomites."

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal link between the timing of the first AIDS case diagnosis and the momentum of the Gay Rights movement is weak and unsubstantiated. 

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason does not merely reiterate the proposition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There’s no claim of universal agreement.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language isn’t particularly ambiguous in another intended sense but does carry connotations.

### Step 5: Classify the string according to the identified defective argument type

The statement fits multiple defective argument types, but the most evident fit is:
- **Generalization (<G>):** The statement makes an assertion based on a subset of individuals, implying falsely that it applies to all (i.e., all AIDS cases were among sodomites).

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The timing correlation presented as a reason does not provide a compelling causal basis for the proposition.

### Classification:
The provided statement "In its origins [AIDS] was entirely a disease of sodomites... That the first case was diagnosed a little over a decade after the so-called "Gay Rights" and "Gay Pride" movement gained momentum and force can hardly be coincidental." is primarily classified as **Generalization (G)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
