To apply **<IDAA>** to the statement "I don’t care what scientists say, my mother always told me that the world is flat, and she would never lie to me!" involves decomposing the task of classifying the argument into specific steps. Here's the step-by-step breakdown of this process:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
First, we need to identify the main proposition or assertion being made in the statement.

- **Proposition (<P>)**: "the world is flat"

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Next, look for the causal basis or reason given to support the proposition.

- **Reason (<R>)**: "my mother always told me that the world is flat, and she would never lie to me"

### Step 3: Analyze the Reason for Potential Defects
Evaluate the reason for any defective argument characteristics.

- **Generalization (G)**: This does not seem to be an instance of generalizing from a part to a whole group.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not claim to have enumerated all possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason given ("my mother would never lie to me") does not scientifically or logically demonstrate the correctness of the proposition ("the world is flat"). It instead appeals to personal belief.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis (trust in the mother's word) is not compelling enough to establish the scientific truth of the earth's shape.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason is not a repetition of the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument does not mention universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: There is no indication that the proof is taken in a different sense than intended by the speaker.

### Step 4: Classification of the Argument
Based on the analysis, choose the best classification for the defective argument type:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason given ("my mother would never lie to me") is inconclusive in proving the proposition ("the world is flat") as it relies on personal trust rather than scientific evidence.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The reason's causal basis (the mother's honesty) is insufficient to compellingly support the proposition about the world's shape.

### Step 5: Conclusion
The statement "I don’t care what scientists say, my mother always told me that the world is flat, and she would never lie to me!" can be classified under **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** and **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.

The primary defective argument type is <IR> as the reason provided does not conclusively establish the proposition. Additionally, <WCB> also applies as the causal basis is insufficiently compelling.
