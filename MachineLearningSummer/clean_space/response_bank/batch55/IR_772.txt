For 
Certainly! Let's apply the decomposition of the task (D) to identify and classify the given string according to the provided defective argument types (IDAA):

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of IDA:

1. **Understand the proposition (P)**: Identify what is being asserted or the statement that is intended to be proven.
2. **Identify the reason (R)**: Determine the causal basis or the reason given for the assertion.
3. **Assess the proof of reason (PR)**: Evaluate any further arguments or evidence provided to support the reason.
4. **Classify the defective argument type (IDA)**: Based on the identified elements (P, R, PR), classify the argument into one of the defective argument types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

### Application to the Given String

#### String to be Classified:
"You ask your mother if you can go to the mall with your friends. She says 'no'. You ask why? She says, 'because I'm the mom and I say so'."

1. **Understand the proposition (P)**:
   - **P**: You are not allowed to go to the mall with your friends.

2. **Identify the reason (R)**:
   - **R**: "Because I'm the mom and I say so."

   Here, the reason given is based solely on the authority of being a mom, without providing any further justification or causal basis.

3. **Assess the proof of reason (PR)**:
   - **PR**: No additional proof or argument is provided beyond the initial reason.

4. **Classify the defective argument type (IDA)**:
   - The reasoning provided ("because I'm the mom and I say so") does not offer a compelling or causal basis for the decision. It merely reiterates the authority and provides no substantial reasoning.
   - This fits the form of a **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**, as the reason appears to restate the authority (the mom's authority) without providing a separate, causal justification.

### Conclusion:
The string is an example of the defective argument type **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**. The reason given merely reiterates the authority without offering a proper causal basis or justification for the proposition (the refusal to go to the mall).
