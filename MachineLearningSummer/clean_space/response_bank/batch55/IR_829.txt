For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string about Jojo and Charli's conversation, we first need to decompose the task of identifying the defective argument into specific steps. 

### Decomposition of <IDA> (D):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>) in the argument.**
2. **Analyze the Proof of Reason (<PR>) if present.**
3. **Determine if the <P>, <R>, or <PR> fit into any of the defective argument types:**
    - Generalization (<G>)
    - Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
    - Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
    - Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
    - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
    - Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
    - Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)

### Applying <D> to <IDA>:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>).

- **Jojo's Proposition (<P>):** "All New Yorkers are tough."
- **Charli's Counterpoint:** "I get shoved in a locker every day and cry when I see bunnies."
- **Jojo's Rebuttal (<R>):** "Well, REAL New Yorkers are tough."

#### Step 2: Analyze the Proof of Reason (<PR>), if present.
There is no formal proof given. Jojo's Rebuttal seems to be offered as an explanation or clarification rather than a formal proof.

#### Step 3: Determine the Defective Argument Type.

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - Jojo's Proposition "All New Yorkers are tough" is a sweeping generalization, which assumes that a characteristic (toughness) applies universally to all individuals of a group.
   
   Charli provides a counter-example of herself, a New Yorker who doesn't fit this characteristic, dismantling the generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - This doesn't seem to apply here as the argument is not about listing possibilities or missing out on pertinent ones.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Jojo's Reason "Well, REAL New Yorkers are tough" reasserts the initial claim without providing new evidence, making it inconclusive in demonstrating the Proposition's correctness.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The causal basis here (that toughness is inherent to all New Yorkers) is weak as Jojo hasn't established a compelling link between geography and personal toughness.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - This might apply since Jojo's rebuttal is essentially a restatement of the original Proposition without adding new information or reasoning.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - This doesn’t apply here as Jojo is not claiming universal agreement on the toughness of New Yorkers.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - This doesn’t seem applicable as the language is clear though the term "REAL New Yorkers" might introduce some ambiguity about what criteria separate real New Yorkers from others.

### Conclusion:
After careful deconstruction, Jojo's initial argument and rebuttals seem to fit primarily into two defective argument types: **Generalization (<G>)** and **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**. 

- **Generalization (<G>):** "All New Yorkers are tough" is an overgeneralization not true for all members of the group.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** "Well, REAL New Yorkers are tough" essentially repeats the original proposition without providing additional supporting reasoning.

Therefore, the string "Jojo: All New Yorkers are tough\nCharli: I get shoved in a locker every day and cry when I see bunnies\nJojo: Well, REAL New Yorkers are tough\nCharli: What does toughness have to do with Geography?\nJojo: Todos los neoyorquinos son duros\nCharli: Me empujan en un casillero todos los días y lloro cuando veo conejitos.\nJojo: Bueno, los verdaderos neoyorquinos son duros.\nCharli: ¿Qué tiene que ver la dureza con la geografía?" can be classified as containing the defective argument types **<G>** and **<RR>**.
