For 
To apply the process of IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying an argument into specific steps and applying those steps to classify a defective argument), we need to break down the process of classifying the string "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick." Let's start:

**Step 1: Identify the Parts of the Argument**
- **Proposition (<P>):** "the water must have made me sick"
- **Reason (<R>):** "I drank bottled water and now I am sick"

**Step 2: Examine the Potential Defect Types**
- **Generalization (G):** Does the proposition assert something based on one part or on a majority of individuals?
  - No, this argument does not make a generalization about bottled water or sickness overall; it focuses on the individual experience.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Does the proposition claim a complete enumeration of possibilities but miss some pertinent ones?
  - While it doesn't explicitly enumerate possibilities, it does implicitly assume that the only cause of the sickness is the bottled water, ignoring other potential causes (e.g., other food or external factors).
  
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does the Reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition?
  - Yes, the Reason "I drank bottled water and now I am sick" doesn't conclusively demonstrate that the bottled water caused the sickness. Other factors could be at play, making the reasoning inconclusive.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the causal basis weak or not compelling?
  - Yes, there is not enough evidence to prove that drinking the bottled water is the compelling cause of the sickness.
  
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Does the Reason say precisely what was said in the Proposition?
  - No, the Reason provides an experience rather than repeating the proposition verbatim.
  
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Is the Proof of Reason assumed certain based on universal agreement, which is still in dispute?
  - No, there is no mention of universal agreement or a disputed consensus in this argument.
  
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Can the Proof of Reason be taken in another sense than intended?
  - The language seems clear and not ambiguous. The phrase is straightforward and likely to be taken as intended.

**Step 3: Classify the Argument**
Based on an examination of the defective argument types:
- The primary defect lies in two areas:
  - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument ignores other potential causes for the sickness, assuming the bottled water is the only cause.
  - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reasoning is inconclusive; it does not definitively prove that the bottled water was the cause.

**Final Classification:**
The argument "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick" is an example of both **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** and **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.

By decomposing the task (D) into steps and applying this to the IDA task, we have successfully classified the argument as having defects that specifically fall under the categories of **Incomplete Enumeration and Inconclusive Reason**.
