For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposition of a task into specific steps) to IDA (the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types), we'll proceed step by step.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>)**:
   - Proposition (<P>): The string in question claims that the defendant killed her husband.
   - Reason (<R>): The reason provided is that many people already believe it.

2. **Evaluate the Reason (<R>) and Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - The Reason is based on the belief of many people, suggesting a sort of consensus.
   - There's no additional Proof of Reason offered beyond this consensus; it's presumed to be self-evident.

3. **Classify the Argument**:
   - We need to determine which defective argument type this falls into based on the definitions provided.

### Analysis of Defective Argument Types:

- **<G> - Generalization**:
  This argument does not generalize from a part to a whole; it states a belief held by many.

- **<FE> - Incomplete Enumeration**:
  There is no enumeration of possibilities here that could be deemed incomplete.

- **<IR> - Inconclusive Reason**:
  The reason (many people believe it) could be seen as inconclusive for a factual claim, but this isn't a perfect fit.

- **<WCB> - Insufficient Causal Basis**:
  It does provide a form of causal basis (many people believe this), but it's not addressing causality in a compelling manner directly related to the proof of the murder.

- **<RR> - Faulty Repetition of Proposition**:
  The statement doesn't simply repeat the proposition; it provides an alleged basis for belief (consensus).

- **<FU> - Presumptuous Consensus**:
  This argument indeed presumes its reason to be valid because it is "universally agreed upon," despite the fact that the actual truth of the matter is still in dispute.

- **<DEP> - Ambiguous Language Use**:
  The language used does not seem particularly ambiguous in this context.

Based on the above analysis, the argument that "Everyone already believes that the defendant killed her husband, and that many people can't be wrong" best fits the defective argument type:

### Conclusion:
The string is classified as type **<FU> - Presumptuous Consensus**.
