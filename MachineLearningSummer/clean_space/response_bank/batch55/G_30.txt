Certainly! To apply the task of classifying the given argument as one of the defective argument types step by step, we will decompose <IDA> into specific steps as follows:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA> (Task <D>):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine the main assertion that is being put forward to prove.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Find the causal basis provided for the <P>.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Check for any additional arguments or evidence provided to support the <R>.
4. **Classify the Argument Based on Defective Types**: Compare the identified <P>, <R>, and <PR> with the definitions of defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>.

### Applying <IDAA> to the Given Argument:

#### Argument: 
"Once you leave the house, you cannot go back. You will not receive any financial support so you need to stop going to school. Your credit card will be cut so you need to work. You will live on your own."

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - **<P>**: "You will live on your own."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - **<R>**: 
     - "You will not receive any financial support so you need to stop going to school."
     - "Your credit card will be cut so you need to work."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - No explicit additional arguments or evidence are provided to support the <R>. The argument is presented mostly as a series of causal statements without further proof.

4. **Classify the Argument Based on Defective Types**:
   - Examine if the given argument matches any defective argument type (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>):
     - **<G> (Generalization)**: No, this argument does not make a broad generalization.
     - **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: No, it does not claim to enumerate all possibilities.
     - **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: This could fit because the reasons given are assumed to conclusively lead to "You will live on your own," but they donâ€™t comprehensively justify this claim. For instance, stopping school or cutting a credit card doesn't necessarily mean one would have to live on their own.
     - **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: This also fits. The reasons given (stopping school, cutting a credit card) are not compelling enough to conclusively establish that the person will end up living on their own.
     - **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: No, the reasons provided are different from the proposition itself.
     - **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: No, there are no claims of universal agreement or consensus.
     - **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: No, the language use is relatively clear and unambiguous.

Based on the analysis, the argument fits both **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** and **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.

### Conclusion:
The given argument "Once you leave the house, you cannot go back. You will not receive any financial support so you need to stop going to school. Your credit card will be cut so you need to work. You will live on your own." can be classified as having defective argument types **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** and **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
