For 
To apply <IDAA>, the process involves decomposing the task of classifying the defective argument within the string into specific steps. We'll analyze the given statement step by step to classify it according to the predefined defective argument types.

### Step 1: Understand the Components of the Given Statement
Let's first break down the given string to better understand its structure and content:
```
"I hope I presented my argument clearly. Now, my opponent will attempt to refute my argument by his own fallacious, incoherent, illogical version of history."
```
This consists of two main parts:
1. The speaker expresses hope that their own argument was presented clearly.
2. The speaker preemptively criticizes their opponent's counter-argument by labeling it as fallacious, incoherent, and illogical.

### Step 2: Identify the Type of Defective Argument
We need to match the components of the statement with the definitions provided for Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), and Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

### Step 3: Analyze Each Component for Relevant Defective Argument Types

- **Component 1**: "I hope I presented my argument clearly."
  - This part is an expression of the speaker's hope and doesn't contain a proposition or reason that falls within the defective argument types directly. 

- **Component 2**: "Now, my opponent will attempt to refute my argument by his own fallacious, incoherent, illogical version of history."
  - This part makes an assertion about the nature of the opponent's counter-argument. Let's classify it according to the defective arguments listed.

### Step 4: Match the Defining Features of Defective Arguments

- **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement criticizes the opponent's counter-argument broadly without specific evidence.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This is not applicable as the statement does not enumerate possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided (fallacious, incoherent, illogical) is conclusory without supporting evidence for this assertion.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis (fallacious, incoherent, illogical) to dismiss the opponent's argument is asserted without compelling evidence.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This is not a mere repetition of an earlier proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This does not assume universal agreement but rather makes an assertion about the opponent.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The terms "fallacious," "incoherent," and "illogical" could be subject to different interpretations, but the intent seems clear.

Given this analysis, the most fitting classifications based on the definitions provided are:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasons given for dismissing the opponent's counter-argument are conclusory and lack specific supporting evidence.
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The assertion that the opponent's counter-argument is "fallacious, incoherent, illogical" is not backed by a compelling causal basis.

### Step 5: Conclusion and Classification
After systematically analyzing the statement and matching it to the provided defective argument types, we can conclude that the given string:
```
"I hope I presented my argument clearly. Now, my opponent will attempt to refute my argument by his own fallacious, incoherent, illogical version of history."
```
is best classified as involving both **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
