Sure, let's apply the steps of <IDAA> to the string in question: "FlatSam: Common sense tells us that if the earth were a sphere, people on the bottom would fall off. ReasonEric: I don’t think you get to reference something you clearly don’t have."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>) of <IDA> Process:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Determine what claim or assertion is being made.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Identify any causal basis or reasons provided to support the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - Look for any additional arguments or evidence that substantiate the reason.

4. **Classify the Argument**:
   - Determine whether the argument falls into one of the defined defective argument types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

5. **Justify the Classification**:
   - Explain why the argument has been classified as a certain type.

### Applying <IDAA> to the Given String:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- **FlatSam's Proposition (<P>)**: "If the earth were a sphere, people on the bottom would fall off."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- **FlatSam's Reason (<R>)**: "Common sense tells us."

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- There is no additional argument or evidence provided by FlatSam to substantiate the reason.

#### Step 4: Classify the Argument
- Evaluate if the proposition, reason, or purported proof of reason falls into one of the defective argument types.

  - **Generalization (<G>)**: This doesn't apply here.
  - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This doesn't apply here.
  - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided ("common sense tells us") is not a conclusive demonstration of the correctness of the proposition that people would fall off a spherical earth.
  - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Similar to <IR>, the causal basis "common sense" is not compelling for the claim being made.
  - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This doesn't apply here.
  - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This doesn't apply here.
  - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: This doesn't apply here.

The argument by FlatSam is best classified as **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**.

#### Step 5: Justify the Classification
- The reason "common sense tells us" does not provide a conclusive or scientifically valid basis to support the proposition that "if the earth were a sphere, people on the bottom would fall off." Therefore, it is not a compelling reason that can establish the truth of the proposition.

### Complete Solution
- The given string contains an argument by FlatSam that can be classified as **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** because the reason provided ("common sense tells us") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
