For 
Applying <IDAA> to the task of classifying the string "Evolution is the idea that humans come from pond scum":

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Recognize the main assertion or statement being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine if any reasoning is given to support the proposition. If not, identify the implicit reason or the lack thereof.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Determine if any additional corroborating arguments are provided.
4. **Classify Argument Type**:
   - Determine if the argument is defective based on the types provided (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>).
5. **Analyze for Ambiguity or Presumptions**: Check for ambiguous language use or presumptive consensus.
6. **Final Classification**: Assign the defective argument type based on the analysis.

### Application of Decomposition to the Given String:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: 
   - Proposition: "Evolution is the idea that humans come from pond scum."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: 
   - Reason: Implicit claim in the statement implies that the notion of evolution equates to humans coming from pond scum, suggesting a simplistic and possibly misleading representation of evolutionary theory.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: 
   - Proof of Reason: No additional arguments or corroborating facts are provided.

4. **Classify Argument Type**: 
   - **Generalization (G)**: This is not about making a broad claim from limited instances.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This does not involve listing possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This involves checking if the reason does not conclusively prove the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This involves assessing if the reason given is a weak causal basis.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This involves repeating the proposition as the reason.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This involves assuming something is universally agreed upon without support.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: This involves checking for ambiguous terms or meanings.

5. **Analyze for Ambiguity or Presumptions**:
   - The statement "humans come from pond scum" oversimplifies and misrepresents evolutionary theory, potentially creating ambiguity.

6. **Final Classification**:
   - The most fitting defective argument type appears to be **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)** because it uses terms ("pond scum") in a misleading and overly simplistic way that can be taken to mean something other than the scientific concept of evolution, which involves complex processes and evidence.

### Conclusion:
The string "Evolution is the idea that humans come from pond scum" is an example of **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**.
