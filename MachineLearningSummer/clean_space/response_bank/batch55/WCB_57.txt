To apply IDAA (the application of the decomposition of a task into specific steps for identifying the type of defective argument) to the given string, let's break down the steps necessary to classify the fallacy. We'll follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine the primary assertion being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the causal basis provided for the Proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Check for corroboration through additional arguments.
4. **Classify the Argument Type**: Determine which type of defective argument the string fits into by comparing it to the definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
"You got a cold two nights ago but last night you stayed up really late and now you are no longer sick, so it must be because you stayed up really late last night."

**Proposition (<P>):** "You are no longer sick because you stayed up really late last night."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
The provided reason appears to be that staying up really late last night is causally linked to no longer being sick.

**Reason (<R>):** "You stayed up really late last night."

**Step 3: Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
There doesn't appear to be an additional argument provided to further corroborate the reason. The statement directly links staying up late as the cause without further validation.

**Step 4: Classify the Argument Type**:
To classify the argument type, we compare it to the definitions provided:

- **<G> (Generalization)**: The argument does not generalize from a specific instance to a broader population.
- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: The argument does not purport to list all possibilities and miss some.
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The causal basis submitted for the proposition is not compelling.
- **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: The reason is not a mere repetition of the proposition.
- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: There is no claim of universal agreement on the matter.
- **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: There seems to be no language ambiguity.

After examining the definitions, the most fitting defective argument type is <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis). The reason provided for the proposition does not compellingly establish the causation. Just because two events (staying up late and not being sick) occur sequentially, it does not necessarily mean that one caused the other.

**Conclusion**: The fallacy being committed is <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
