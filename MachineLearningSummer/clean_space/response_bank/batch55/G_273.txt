For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "If you give a mouse a cookie, he'll want a glass of milk to go with it" is a book built around THIS fallacy, we need to decompose the task of classifying this statement into the specific steps of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Step 1: Understand the String and Context
First, we must understand what the string is saying:
- The statement refers to a popular children’s book, "If You Give a Mouse a Cookie."
- It suggests that the book is built around a specific fallacy.

### Step 2: Identify Potential Propositions and Reasons
- In the string, <P> could be "The book is built around a fallacy."
- <R> might not be explicitly stated but implied as the scenario of giving a mouse a cookie leading to escalating demands.

### Step 3: Categorize the Defective Argument Type
Let's evaluate which defective argument type (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) the statement could fall under:

**Generalization (<G>):** 
- The statement might be making a broad assumption based on a single instance or a few instances.

**Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** 
- This might not apply as there’s no enumeration of possibilities in the given string.

**Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** 
- The reasoning provided (if implied reason is the causal chain of events starting from giving a mouse a cookie) does not conclusively demonstrate why the book is built around a fallacy.

**Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** 
- The Reasoning (if implied) is the chain of events, and the causal basis is weak, suggesting an insufficient cause.

**Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** 
- The Reason does not exactly repeat the Proposition.

**Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** 
- The statement does not claim that it is universally agreed upon that it’s a fallacy.

**Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** 
- The statement does not use ambiguous language directly related to the Reason validation.

### Step 4: Conclusion
Based on the above analysis, the most fitting defective argument type for the given string is **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because the chain of events described in the book does not provide a compelling causal basis to conclude that the entire book is built around a fallacy.

### Final Classification
- The statement "If you give a mouse a cookie, he'll want a glass of milk to go with it" is a book built around THIS fallacy, demonstrates the defective argument type **<WCB>**.
