For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task IDA) to the string "Snarl Words are an example of...," let's break this down into specific steps and analyze it step by step according to the definitions provided.

### Step 1: Understand the Statement
First, we need to understand the statement "Snarl Words are an example of...". The statement is incomplete, but it suggests that "Snarl Words" are being categorized or exemplified within a certain context.

### Step 2: Identify the Proposition <P>
The proposition here seems to be:
- **P**: "Snarl Words are an example of X" (where X is not explicitly stated).

### Step 3: Check for Causal Basis <R>
The statement does not provide any reasoning or causal basis for why "Snarl Words" are an example of whatever X is. Thus, there is no immediate **R** (Reason) provided.

### Step 4: Check for Additional Arguments <PR>
There are no additional arguments or proofs given in this statement. Thus, there is no **PR** (Proof of Reason).

### Step 5: Categorize the Defective Argument Type
Given the lack of complete information and context, we need to evaluate the defective argument types to see which one fits best.

#### <G>: Generalization
- A generalization would typically assert something based on insufficient evidence. The statement "Snarl Words are an example of..." does not provide sufficient context, so it might lead to a generalized assumption without adequate proof.

#### <FE>: Incomplete Enumeration
- The statement is incomplete and presumes an example without enumerating possible options. However, it does not list possibilities explicitly, so it doesnâ€™t fit <FE> perfectly.

#### <IR>: Inconclusive Reason
- Since there is no **R** (Reason) provided at all, the statement lacks reasoning, which might lead to inconclusive reasoning if an **R** was later added.

#### <RR>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition
- The provided proposition is not a repetition of any reason, as there's no reason stated.

#### <WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis
- There is no causal basis provided, so this might apply if any reasoning given later is weak.

#### <FU>: Presumptuous Consensus
- The statement does not appeal to a universal agreement or consensus.

#### <DEP>: Ambiguous Language Use
- The statement leaves the categorization ambiguous ("..."), which fits the loosely defined condition of ambiguous interpretation.

### Conclusion
Given the incomplete state and the lack of elaboration in the statement, "Snarl Words are an example of..." is most likely a case of <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use), since the listener could interpret it in multiple ways without further context or information.

So, our final classification of the string "Snarl Words are an example of..." is:

**<DEP>: Ambiguous Language Use**
