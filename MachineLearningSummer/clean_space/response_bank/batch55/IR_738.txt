Sure, let's apply IDAA to classify the argument type of the company's slogan "Expect More. Pay Less."

1. **Task Decomposition (<D>) for <IDA>:**
   - **Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine what the slogan is asserting or setting forth.
   - **Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Extract any causal basis or reasoning within the slogan.
   - **Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Look for any corroboration provided within the slogan to support the reason.
   - **Step 4: Compare with Defective Argument Types**: Compare the identified <P>, <R>, and <PR> with definitions of defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>) to classify the argument.

2. **Step-by-Step Classification (<IDAA> applies)**:

   - **Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
     - **Inspection of the slogan**: "Expect More. Pay Less."
     - **Proposition (<P>)**: The slogan suggests that customers can expect more (better quality, greater quantity, or enhanced service) while paying less money.

   - **Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
     - **Inspection of the slogan**: The slogan contains two phrases but does not explicitly provide a reason.
     - **Reason (<R>)**: Not explicitly stated. The slogan implies a causal relationship but does not explain how expecting more and paying less can be achieved.

   - **Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
     - **Inspection of the slogan**: There is no specific proof or corroborative argument presented within the slogan.
     - **Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Not provided in the slogan.

   - **Step 4: Compare with Defective Argument Types**:
     - **Generalization (<G>)**: The slogan does not generalize from a sample set but makes a broad assertion about the company's offerings.
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The slogan does not enumerate possibilities but makes a straightforward assertion.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The slogan implies a causal relationship without providing conclusive evidence or reasoning.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The relationship implied by the slogan lacks an explicit causal basis, making it weak if evaluated formally.
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This does not seem to repeat the proposition as reason.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The slogan does not rely on an assumed consensus.
     - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The terms “more” and “less” could be seen as somewhat ambiguous without context.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The slogan "Expect More. Pay Less." most closely matches the definition of **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**. The slogan asserts a potential benefit without providing a compelling causal reason as to how "expecting more" is realistically achievable while "paying less."

By breaking down the task into specific steps, we've determined that the company's slogan "Expect More. Pay Less." primarily suffers from an insufficient causal basis.
