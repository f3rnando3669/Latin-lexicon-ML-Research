To apply the process of <IDAA> to the task of classifying the argument presented in the dialogue between Billy and Bobby, we first need to break down the advanced task (IDA) into specific steps. Here’s how we would approach it:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>) of the Task (IDA):

1. **Identification of Proposition (<P>):**
   - Isolate what the speaker intends to prove.
   
2. **Identification of Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine the causal basis the speaker provides to support the proposition.
   
3. **Identification of Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Look for any additional arguments used to corroborate the Reason.
   
4. **Classification of Defective Argument:**
   - Determine which type of defective argument (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP) is present based on the definitions provided.

### Application of Decomposition to Argument ("s"):

Now let's apply these steps to the given dialogue:

#### Step 1: Identification of Proposition (<P>)
   - **Billy's Proposition (<P>)**: "An apple is a vegetable."

#### Step 2: Identification of Reason (<R>)
   - There is no explicit Reason provided by Billy to support his proposition. We just have the proposition.

#### Step 3: Identification of Proof of Reason (<PR>)
   - Not present in Billy’s part of the argument.

Next, we move to Bobby’s response to examine for any defective argument:

#### Step 1: Identification of Proposition (<P>)
   - **Bobby's Proposition (<P>)**: "Don't listen to Billy."

#### Step 2: Identification of Reason (<R>)
   - **Bobby's Reason (<R>)**: "He failed Spanish class last year."

#### Step 3: Identification of Proof of Reason (<PR>)
   - Not explicitly present in Bobby’s argument either.

#### Step 4: Classification of Defective Argument
   - In Bobby’s case, his Reason (that Billy failed Spanish class) does not address the correctness of Billy’s proposition (whether an apple is a vegetable). Instead, Bobby is attacking Billy's credibility in an unrelated domain.

Therefore, Bobby is employing a type of defective argument known as an **Ad Hominem attack**, which is a fallacy where an argument is rebutted by attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, rather than addressing the substance of the argument itself.

However, considering the definitions provided:

- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: Given that Bobby's argument does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness (or incorrectness) of Billy's proposition about apples and vegetables based on Billy's failure in a Spanish class, it fits the definition of <IR>.

Thus, the classification of the argument is:
- **Type <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**

In conclusion, the application of <IDAA> to the given string leads us to classify Bobby's response as an argument of type <IR>.
