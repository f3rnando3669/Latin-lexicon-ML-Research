For 
To apply the IDAA (decomposition of the task IDA) to the given string "Everybody knows that staying out in the rain can make you sick. Which logical fallacy is represented here?", we need to break down and sequentially analyze the string according to the predefined steps for detecting logical fallacies. Here is the structured approach:

### Decomposition of the Task (D)
1. **Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**
   - Determine the main assertion or claim in the given string.

2. **Step 2: Examine the Reason (R)**
   - Identify what causal basis, if any, is provided to support the Proposition (P).

3. **Step 3: Evaluate the Proof of Reason (PR)**
   - Assess any additional arguments or evidence that corroborate the Reason (R).

4. **Step 4: Classify the Type of Defective Argument (IDA)**
   - Analyze the identified components (P, R, PR) to classify the type of logical fallacy according to the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Application of IDAA to the Given String
Let's apply the decomposition steps to the given string: "Everybody knows that staying out in the rain can make you sick. Which logical fallacy is represented here?"

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
- The Proposition (P) is: "Staying out in the rain can make you sick."

#### Step 2: Examine the Reason (R)
- The string does not explicitly provide a causal basis. Instead, it implies a reason through a commonly held belief: "Everybody knows."

#### Step 3: Evaluate the Proof of Reason (PR)
- The Proof of Reason (PR) is assumed through the phrase "Everybody knows." This implicitly suggests that the widespread acceptance of the idea is taken as proof.

#### Step 4: Classify the Type of Defective Argument (IDA)
Analyzing the components identified:

- Proposition (P): "Staying out in the rain can make you sick."
- Implicit Reason (R) / Proof (PR): "Everybody knows," which appeals to common belief as supporting evidence.

**Classification:**

The fallacy represented here is based on the presumed consensus that "everybody knows" this to be true without providing solid evidence or reasoning. This fits the definition for:

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The logical fallacy here relies on assuming a fact is true because it is supposedly universally agreed upon, which is still in dispute.

### Conclusion:
The given string "Everybody knows that staying out in the rain can make you sick. Which logical fallacy is represented here?" exemplifies the logical fallacy of **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.
