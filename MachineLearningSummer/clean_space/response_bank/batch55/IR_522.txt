Certainly! Let's break down the task of classifying the statement "I don’t see what’s wrong with engaging the services of a professional escort" as either <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP> using the process of decomposition (D).

### Step-by-Step Application of IDAA to IDA:

**Step 1: Understand the Statement (s)**
- The statement in question is: "I don’t see what’s wrong with engaging the services of a professional escort."

**Step 2: Identify the Core Elements of the Argument**
- **Proposition (<P>):** The person is asserting that there is nothing wrong with engaging the services of a professional escort.
- **Reason (<R>):** Implied; might be personal opinion or lack of visible harm but is not specifically stated.

**Step 3: Evaluate the Statement Against Each Defective Argument Type**
1. **Generalization (G)**
   - Does the statement make a broad claim based on limited evidence?
   - **Assessment:** No. The statement is personal and does not generalize based on partial evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
   - Does the statement claim to have considered all possibilities but overlooks some?
   - **Assessment:** No. Does not enumerate possibilities or claim completeness.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
   - Does the Reason (R) fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition (P)?
   - **Assessment:** There is no explicit Reason (R) stated that can be evaluated for conclusiveness.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
   - Is the Reason (R) weak because the causal basis for the Proposition (P) is not compelling?
   - **Assessment:** No explicit causal Reason (R) provided to evaluate for sufficiency.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
   - Is the Reason (R) merely a restatement of the Proposition (P) in different words?
   - **Assessment:** No explicit Reason (R) is stated.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
   - Does the Proof of Reason (PR) assume universal agreement on a disputed point?
   - **Assessment:** There is no Proof of Reason (PR) involving universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**
   - Can the Proposition (P) be taken in a different sense than intended by the speaker?
   - **Assessment:** Potentially, "nothing wrong" is a subjective phrase that may be interpreted differently by different audiences, but it does not fit the precise definition of DEP.

**Step 4: Determine the Most Applicable Defective Argument Type**
- Since no explicit Reason (R) or Proof of Reason (PR) is provided, many of the defective argument types cannot be applied.
- The key flaw here is the lack of an explicit Reason (R) to support the Proposition (P). This directly fits the type:

   **<IR> - Inconclusive Reason**

### Conclusion:
The statement "I don’t see what’s wrong with engaging the services of a professional escort" is best classified under **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, as it lacks a conclusive Reason (R) to support its Proposition (P).
