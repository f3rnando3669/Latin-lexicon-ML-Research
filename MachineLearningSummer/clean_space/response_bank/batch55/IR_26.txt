For 
To apply the task <IDAA> (decomposition of the classification task <IDA>), we need to break down the advanced task of classifying the argument into specific steps. We'll execute each step methodically to determine the type of defective argument.

Here are the steps for decomposing the classification task <IDA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine what is being asserted or intended to be proven.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Identify the causal basis or reason presented to support the proposition.
3. **Identify whether a Proof of Reason (<PR>) is present**: Determine whether there is additional argument or corroboration provided.
4. **Analyze the Proposition (<P>) for defects**: Determine if <P> fits the definition of Generalization (<G>) or Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>).
5. **Analyze the Reason (<R>) for defects**: Determine if <R> fits the definition of Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), or Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>).
6. **Analyze the Proof of Reason (<PR>) for defects**: Determine if <PR> fits the definition of Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>) or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).
7. **Classify the argument**: Based on the analysis, classify the defective argument type.

Letâ€™s apply these steps to "You should certainly be the one who washes the dishes -- you are just so good at it!".

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - **Proposition (<P>)**: "You should certainly be the one who washes the dishes."
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - **Reason (<R>)**: "You are just so good at it!"

3. **Identify whether a Proof of Reason (<PR>) is present**:
   - There is no additional argument or corroboration provided beyond the given reason.

4. **Analyze the Proposition (<P>) for defects**:
   - The proposition "You should certainly be the one who washes the dishes" does not seem to be a Generalization (<G>) or Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>). It is a specific assertion about who should wash the dishes.

5. **Analyze the Reason (<R>) for defects**:
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: We will see if the reason "You are just so good at it!" conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the proposition that "You should be the one to wash the dishes".
     - The reason is subjective and does not provide a compelling basis for the proposition. While it praises the person's skill, it does not necessarily justify why that person should always wash the dishes.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reason might not be compelling enough.
     - The causality implied (being good at washing dishes means one should be the one to always do it) is weak and not fully justifiable.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Whether <R> repeats <P>.
     - The reason provided is not an exact repetition of the proposition.

6. **Analyze the Proof of Reason (<PR>) for defects**:
   - No Proof of Reason (<PR>) is present in this argument.

7. **Classify the argument**:
   - The argument appears mainly to suffer from **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The Reason provided, "You are just so good at it!" is a subjective praise and does not necessarily compel the conclusion that "You should be the one who washes the dishes." 

Therefore, the classification of the defective argument type for "You should certainly be the one who washes the dishes -- you are just so good at it!" is **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
