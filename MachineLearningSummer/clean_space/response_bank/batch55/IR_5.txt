### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The first step in classifying a defective argument is to identify the proposition within the provided string. 

For the string "Why did you steal my keys?", the implicit proposition (<P>) can be extracted as:
  - <P>: "You stole my keys."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The second step is to identify if there is a reason presented that sets forth the causal basis for the proposition.

In the string "Why did you steal my keys?", there is no explicit reason provided. The question is accusatory and assumes the proposition without providing a causal basis.

Since there is no explicit reason (<R>), it is necessary to determine if the argument is defective due to this lack.

### Step 3: Identify Defective Arguments
Next, we need to determine if the identified proposition and the context match one of the known defective arguments.

#### Generalization (<G>):
  - **Test for Generalization**: Does the argument assert something based on a subset of possibilities applied to all?
    - No, the argument does not seem to generalize across a group.

#### Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):
  - **Test for Incomplete Enumeration**: Does the argument miss important possibilities in making a complete enumeration?
    - No, the argument does not rely on an enumeration of possibilities.

#### Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):
  - **Test for Inconclusive Reason**: Does the reason provided not conclusively demonstrate the proposition?
    - Since no reason (<R>) is given, this is not applicable.

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):
  - **Test for Insufficient Causal Basis**: Is the causal basis weak?
    - Since no reason (<R>) is provided, this does not apply.

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):
  - **Test for Faulty Repetition**: Does the reason repeat what was said in the proposition?
    - Since no reason (<R>) is provided, this does not apply.

#### Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):
  - **Test for Presumptuous Consensus**: Is the proof assumed as certain on the basis of presumed universal agreement?
    - This does not apply to the given string.

#### Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):
  - **Test for Ambiguous Language Use**: Can the proof be taken in another sense than intended?
    - The string does not appear to have ambiguous language that can be interpreted differently in the context of presumption of guilt.

### Conclusion: Defective Argument Type
Given the steps above, it appears that the string "Why did you steal my keys?" implicitly posits a proposition without providing any explicit reasoning, thus the argument seems to be incomplete. However, the primary issue is that it assumes the correctness of the proposition without offering a valid reason, making it a defective argument.

Therefore, the best matching defective argument type is:

**<IR> - Inconclusive Reason**

Because there is no reasoning provided to demonstrate the proposition "You stole my keys," the string represents an inconclusive reason scenario.
