Sure, to apply <IDAA> to the given string, we'll decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps and work through them one by one.

### Steps for <IDAA>

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Find the main statement that is intended to be proven.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Find the causal basis for the proposition.

3. **Determine if there is a Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Check if there are additional arguments corroborating the Reason.

4. **Check for defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>):**
   - Compare components with definitions of defective argument types to classify the argument.

### Step-by-Step Application

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - The proposition here is "We need to put together a 24-hour schedule as soon as possible."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - The reason provided is "We surveyed all the customers in the store and they all agreed that staying open 24 hours would be a great idea."

3. **Determine if there is a Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - There isn't an explicit additional argument corroborating the reason. The survey itself is used as the main Reason.
 
4. **Check for defective argument types**:

    1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
        - The Reason is based on a survey of the customers in the store. This suggests a generalization from a specific group (customers in the store) to a broader implementation (24-hour schedule). This can be a generalization if it's assumed that the surveyed customers represent the opinion of all potential customers.

    2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
        - The argument does not claim to have considered all possibilities, so this does not seem to be applicable.

    3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
        - The Reason is not inherently inconclusive if we assume the customer survey is valid. However, questioning whether the survey's sample is representative might lead to questions about conclusiveness.

    4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
        - The Reason is not merely a repetition of the Proposition.

    5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
        - The surveyâ€™s validity can be questioned, but it's not inherently a weak causal basis. This depends on the perspective about the comprehensiveness and representativeness of the survey.

    6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
        - The Reason doesn't state that "it is universally agreed upon," only that surveyed customers agreed. Hence, this does not apply.

    7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
        - The language used in the Reason and Proposition does not seem ambiguous.

### Classification

The most fitting classification for the argument is **Generalization (<G>)** because it assumes the surveyed customers inside the store represent the views of a larger, potentially more varied, customer base who would be influenced by the 24-hour schedule.

---

**Result:** The argument is of type **<G> (Generalization)**.
