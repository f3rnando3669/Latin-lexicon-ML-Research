For 
To apply \( IDAA \) to the argument "Every time I go to sleep the sun goes down. Therefore, my sleeping causes the sun to set," we will decompose the task of classifying the defective argument (\( IDA \)) into specific steps (\( D \)). Here are the steps for \( D \):

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( P \))**: Determine what is intended to be proved.
2. **Identify the Reason (\( R \))**: Determine the causal basis provided for \( P \).
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\( PR \))**: Check for any corroborating evidence or additional arguments supporting \( R \).
4. **Classify the Defective Argument**: Based on the identified parts, classify the argument as one of the types (\( G \), \( FE \), \( IR \), \( RR \), \( WCB \), \( FU \), or \( DEP \)).

Let's systematically apply these steps to the argument in the provided sentence.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\( P \))
The proposition \( P \) is: "My sleeping causes the sun to set."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\( R \))
The reason \( R \) is: "Every time I go to sleep the sun goes down."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (\( PR \))
There does not appear to be an explicit \( PR \) provided in the argument. No additional arguments or corroborating evidence are provided to establish the causal relationship claimed in \( R \).

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument
Now we must classify the defective argument based on the identified parts:

- \( G \) (Generalization): Not applicable. The argument is not generalizing from a part to a whole.
- \( FE \) (Incomplete Enumeration): Not applicable. The argument does not involve an incomplete enumeration of possibilities.
- \( IR \) (Inconclusive Reason): The reason \( R \) is indeed inadequate to conclusively demonstrate \( P \). \( R \) simply shows correlation (my sleeping and the sun setting happening together) rather than causation.
- \( WCB \) (Insufficient Causal Basis): \( R \) very likely fits here because the causal basis provided is weak. Just because two events happen at the same time does not mean one causes the other.
- \( RR \) (Faulty Repetition of Proposition): Not applicable. This argument does not merely restate the proposition in the reason.
- \( FU \) (Presumptuous Consensus): Not applicable. The argument does not rely on a presumed universal agreement.
- \( DEP \) (Ambiguous Language Use): Not applicable. The argument is not ambiguous in the sense of words meaning different things.

### Conclusion
The defective argument classification for the given statement is both \( IR \) (Inconclusive Reason) and \( WCB \) (Insufficient Causal Basis), but the primary issue is that \( R \) does not conclusively demonstrate \( P \) and provides an insufficient causal basis.

Therefore, the argument "Every time I go to sleep the sun goes down. Therefore, my sleeping causes the sun to set." can be categorized as \( IR \) and \( WCB \).
