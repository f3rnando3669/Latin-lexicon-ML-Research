For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task IDA into specific steps) to the classification of the string "All people who live in England have bad teeth," we will systematically identify and apply each specific step necessary to classify the type of defective argument.

Step 1: Identify and clearly state the proposition (P).
- Proposition (P): "All people who live in England have bad teeth."

Step 2: Examine the nature of the proposition to identify any potential generalization or enumeration used.
- The proposition asserts a universal quality ("All people") based on an attribute ("have bad teeth").
- This suggests a generalization.

Step 3: Determine whether the proposition is making claims about an entire group based on insufficient evidence, such as limited observations or stereotypes.
- The statement makes a broad claim about everyone in England based on the stereotype that people in England have bad teeth.

Step 4: Evaluate if the claim can be supported or if it inherently suffers from logical flaws.
- It is unreasonable to conclude that all individuals in a diverse population share the same characteristic based on a stereotype or limited evidence.

Step 5: Classify the defective argument type considering the identified flaws and steps.
- Given that the proposition (P) asserts a quality about an entire group based on a general assumption or stereotype, it fits the definition of:
  - Generalization (G): where the <P> is an assertion based on some one part or on a majority of individuals, but not necessarily applicable to all, is referred to all.

Therefore, after decomposing the task and analyzing the string step by step, we classify the string "All people who live in England have bad teeth." as a defective argument of type <G> (Generalization).
