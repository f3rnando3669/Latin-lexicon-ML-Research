For 
To apply the IDAA (application of decomposition to the task of classifying a defective argument) to the given argument "Being overweight leads to a shortened lifespan because it's unhealthy," we'll break down the task step by step and analyze each component to identify the type of defective argument (if any).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The Proposition (<P>) is what we intend to prove. In this case, "<P>": "Being overweight leads to a shortened lifespan."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The Reason (<R>) sets forth the causal basis for <P>. In this argument, "<R>": "because it's unhealthy."

3. **Evaluate the Argument against Defective Types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** 
     - Does <P> make an assertion based on partial evidence or a non-representative sample?
     - "Being overweight leads to a shortened lifespan" is a generalization that may not hold for every individual instance, as it depends on various factors, but it's not directly stated in the argument as being based on a specific sample or partial evidence. Hence, it doesn't directly apply as <G>.
   
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
     - Does <P> claim to enumerate all possibilities but miss some pertinent ones?
     - This argument does not list possibilities but makes a causal claim.
   
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
     - Does <R> fail to conclusively demonstrate <P>?
     - The reason "because it's unhealthy" is not detailed enough to conclusively demonstrate shortened lifespan. There are many factors that contribute to lifespan, and merely stating "unhealthy" is vague and not specific enough.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
     - Is the causal basis provided for <P> weak or uncompelling?
     - The causal basis provided is weak. Simply stating that "it's unhealthy" without specifying what aspects of being overweight contribute to a shortened lifespan is insufficient.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
     - Does <R> simply restate <P> without adding new meaningful information?
     - The Reason doesn't simply restate the Proposition; it provides a basis albeit weak, so <RR> does not apply here.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
     - Is <PR> assumed on the ground that it is universally agreed upon but still in dispute?
     - There's no indication that the argument relies on universal agreement, so <FU> doesn't apply here.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
     - Could <PR> be taken in another sense than the speaker intended?
     - The phrase "it's unhealthy" could be seen as ambiguous, but there's no proof of reason presented in the first place for potential misinterpretation, so <DEP> doesn't directly apply.
   
4. **Conclusion:**
   - The argument "Being overweight leads to a shortened lifespan because it's unhealthy" can be classified under <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis). The Reason provided is weak and not compelling enough to conclusively establish the Proposition. The claim that being overweight leads to a shortened lifespan needs a more detailed and robust causal explanation to be compelling.

By following these steps, we decompose the task and determine that the argument provided is defective due to an insufficient causal basis, classifying it as <WCB>.
