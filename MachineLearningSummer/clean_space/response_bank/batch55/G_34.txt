For 
First, let's apply the definition of the IDAA to classify the string ""Yesterday, you were late for ten minutes. Today you were late for an hour. You know someday, you will simply cease to show up." as one of the defective argument types. To do this, we'll decompose the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine what the main assertion or proposition is in the statement.
   - Proposition (P): "You know someday, you will simply cease to show up."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Look for the causal basis or reasons given for the proposition.
   - Reason (R): "Yesterday, you were late for ten minutes. Today you were late for an hour."

3. **Examine For Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: Check if the proposition is based on a broad assertion that may not necessarily apply to all instances.
     - Analysis: The statement seems to be generalizing future behavior based on past incidents.
   
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Determine if there are possibilities missing from the reasoning.
     - Analysis: The statement does not explicitly enumerate all possible reasons why someone might be late or view different future outcomes besides ceasing to show up.
   
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Analyze if the reason fails to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
     - Analysis: The fact that someone was late twice doesn't necessarily mean they will eventually stop showing up.
   
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Evaluate if the reason provided is compelling enough to support the proposition.
     - Analysis: The two instances of being late do not provide a sufficient causal basis to conclude that they will eventually stop showing up.

   - **Faulty Repetition (RR)**: Check if the reason is just a repetition of the proposition without adding new information.
     - Analysis: The reason is not just a repetition of the proposition but is attempting to provide evidence/forms of lateness.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: See if the proof of reason is based on assumption that everyone agrees without question.
     - Analysis: The statement does not use "universally agreed upon" as its basis.
   
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Assess if the proof can be interpreted differently than intended.
     - Analysis: The language used in the statement does not seem ambiguous or open to different interpretations.

Given the decomposition of the task IDAA, the most fitting defective argument type for the statement "Yesterday, you were late for ten minutes. Today you were late for an hour. You know someday, you will simply cease to show up." is:

- **Generalization (G)**: The statement is generalizing that because someone has been late twice, they will eventually stop showing up altogether. This is based on a couple of instances and wrongly implies that this pattern will necessarily continue to the extreme case of them not showing up at all. Additionally, it also fits the type of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, as the two instances of lateness do not provide compelling evidence to predict future complete absence.

Conclusively, the logical fallacy used in the statement is primarily **Generalization (G)**.
