For 
To apply IDAA to the string "A real video game would include set goals!", we need to first decompose the task of classifying the string as one of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, or DEP) into specific steps. Here is the decomposition (D):

### Decomposition (D) of Task (IDA):

1. **Understand the Proposition**:
   - Identify the main assertion or proposition (<P>) in the string.

2. **Evaluate the Reason**:
   - Determine if there is an implied or explicit reason (<R>) supporting the proposition.

3. **Check for Proof of Reason**:
   - Look for any corroborative evidence or proof (<PR>) provided for the reason.

4. **Identify Defective Argument Type**:
   - Compare the proposition, reason, and any proof against the definitions of defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Application of Decomposition (D) to the String "A real video game would include set goals!":

1. **Identify the Main Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Proposition (<P>): "A real video game would include set goals!"

2. **Determine if there is an Implied or Explicit Reason (<R>)**:
   - The statement does not directly provide a reason. However, it implies that having set goals is what defines a "real" video game.

3. **Look for Any Corroborative Evidence or Proof (<PR>)**:
   - There is no additional proof or evidence provided to support the proposition.

4. **Compare Against Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: The statement makes a broad assertion about what constitutes a "real" video game. It generalizes based on an assumed characteristic (having set goals).
     - Does this generalization apply to all video games or just some? This could indicate that the argument might be a type of Generalization.
   
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not attempt to enumerate possibilities explicitly.
     - This defective type does not seem applicable as there's no enumeration mentioned.
   
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The statement does not provide a reason conclusively demonstrating the correctness of the proposition.
     - While the reason is implied, it’s not clear if it’s truly inconclusive because no explicit reasoning is presented.
   
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis for saying a game needs set goals to be a "real" video game is implied but not provided.
     - The lack of a compelling reason might make this argument weak, but it’s not explicit enough to clearly classify as WCB.
   
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason repeats the proposition exactly.
     - Since no explicit reason is given, this type does not apply here.
   
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The statement does not claim a consensus.
     - This defective type does not seem applicable.
   
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: There doesn’t seem to be ambiguity in the language used regarding set goals.
     - This defective type does not seem applicable.

Based on the above analysis, the most fitting defective argument type for the statement "A real video game would include set goals!" is **Generalization (G)**. This is because the statement makes a sweeping generalization that "real" video games must include set goals without providing adequate support for this claim.
