For 
To apply the decomposition task (IDAA) to the given string "We cannot listen to John’s opinion on global warming because he is a tree hugger," we need to break down the classification task (IDA) into specific steps (D).

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of IDA:

1. **Identify Proposition (P):**
   Determine the main assertion or proposition that the argument is making.

2. **Identify Reason (R):**
   Determine the causal basis or the reason provided to support the proposition.

3. **Check for Defective Argument Type:**
   Evaluate the argument against the definitions of defective argument types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), and Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

### Application of IDAA to the Given String:

#### Step 1: Identify Proposition (P)
The proposition being made is:
- "We cannot listen to John’s opinion on global warming."

#### Step 2: Identify Reason (R)
The reason provided for this proposition is:
- "because he is a tree hugger."

#### Step 3: Check for Defective Argument Type
Evaluate the reason against the defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G):** This does not appear to be a case of generalization as it does not generalize a proposition based on some part or majority to all.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** It does not attempt to enumerate possibilities and thus does not have missing pertinent points.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason "because he is a tree hugger" does not logically and conclusively demonstrate why John's opinion on global warming should not be listened to. This falls short of demonstrating a direct, logical contradiction or invalidation of his opinion.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reason provided seems to fall short of logically compelling basis. Being labeled a "tree hugger" does not undermine the validity of John's opinion on global warming per se.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason does not merely repeat the proposition in different words.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** It does not appeal to a disputed matter assuming it as universally accepted.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The argument does not hinge on an ambiguous term meant to be taken in another sense than intended by the speaker.

#### Conclusion:
The argument fits multiple defective types but most accurately falls under **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The reason that John is a "tree hugger" does not conclusively or compellingly support the proposition that his opinion on global warming is invalid or should be dismissed.

**Classification (IDA):** **<IR> and <WCB>**

Thus, the individual steps have led us to classifying the argument appropriately.
