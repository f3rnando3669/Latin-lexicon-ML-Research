For 
To apply \( <IDAA> \) and classify the given string using specific steps, we need to first decompose the task \( <IDA> \) into its component steps. Here is how it can be done:

## Decomposition \( <D> \):
1. **Identify the Proposition \( <P> \)**: Determine the main claim or assertion being made.
2. **Identify the Reason \( <R> \)**: Determine the causal basis that supports the Proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason \( <PR> \)**: Determine if there is any additional corroborative argument or data provided to support the Reason.
4. **Check for Generalization \( <G> \)**: Check if the Proposition asserts something about all members based on some or most members.
5. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration \( <FE> \)**: Check if the Proposition claims a complete list of possibilities but misses some pertinent ones.
6. **Check for Inconclusive Reason \( <IR> \)**: Check if the Reason does not conclusively support the Proposition.
7. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis \( <WCB> \)**: Verify if the Reason has a compelling causal basis.
8. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition \( <RR> \)**: Check if the Reason merely repeats the Proposition without adding new support.
9. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus \( <FU> \)**: See if the Proof of Reason assumes something to be true based on general agreement.
10. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use \( <DEP> \)**: Check if any part of the argument can be misunderstood or taken in another unintended sense.

## Application \( <IDAA> \):
Let's apply these steps to the string: "Everybody understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal and pro-abortion and pro-gay marriage,' he said. 'And focus on money and the media."

### 1. Identify the Proposition \( <P> \)
The Proposition \( <P> \) in the string is: "the values in New York City are socially liberal and pro-abortion and pro-gay marriage" and "focus on money and the media."

### 2. Identify the Reason \( <R> \)
The Reason \( <R> \) is somewhat implicit but seems to be framed as a general consensus or public understanding: "Everybody understands that..."

### 3. Identify the Proof of Reason \( <PR> \)
There isn't a specific Proof of Reason provided beyond the claim of general understanding.

### 4. Check for Generalization \( <G> \)
The phrase "Everybody understands that..." generalizes the values based on the speaker's assertion. Therefore, we can suspect this might be a case of Generalization \( <G> \).

### 5. Check for Incomplete Enumeration \( <FE> \)
There is no explicit enumeration of possibilities here. This step does not immediately apply.

### 6. Check for Inconclusive Reason \( <IR> \)
Since the Reason "Everybody understands that..." does not conclusively prove the Proposition without further evidence, this could also be seen as Inconclusive Reason \( <IR> \).

### 7. Check for Insufficient Causal Basis \( <WCB> \)
The causal basis is weak as the statement does not provide a compelling reason aside from the claim of a general understanding. This fits Insufficient Causal Basis \( <WCB> \).

### 8. Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition \( <RR> \)
The Reason does not simply repeat the Proposition, so this step doesn't apply.

### 9. Check for Presumptuous Consensus \( <FU> \)
The claim "Everybody understands that..." presumes a consensus that may not actually exist. This fits Presumptuous Consensus \( <FU> \).

### 10. Check for Ambiguous Language Use \( <DEP> \)
The term "focus on money and the media" could be ambiguous as it could be interpreted in multiple ways, although not overtly so.

### Conclusion:
The string "Everybody understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal and pro-abortion and pro-gay marriage,' he said. 'And focus on money and the media" can best be classified as \( <G> \) (Generalization) and \( <FU> \) (Presumptuous Consensus), with potential elements of \( <IR> \) (Inconclusive Reason) and \( <WCB> \) (Insufficient Causal Basis).

This completes the application of \( <IDAA> \) to the given string.
