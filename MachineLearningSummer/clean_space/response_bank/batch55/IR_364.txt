For 
To apply **IDAA** (the decomposition of the task IDA into specific steps) to the given string \( s \) ("I know in my heart of hearts that our home team will win the World Series."), let's execute the necessary steps meticulously.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition \( <P> \)**

- **Proposition (P):** This is the statement or assertion that is being put forward for proof.
- In this case, the proposition being asserted is: "Our home team will win the World Series."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason \( <R> \)**

- **Reason (R):** This is the causal basis provided to establish the truth of \( <P> \).
- In this string, "I know in my heart of hearts" is being presented as the reason.

**Step 3: Apply Classification \( <IDA> \)**

We now need to classify the given argument into one of the defective argument types: \( <G> \), \( <FE> \), \( <IR> \), \( <RR> \), \( <WCB> \), \( <FU> \), or \( <DEP> \).

**Step 4: Determine the Nature of the Reason and Proposition**

- Let's examine "I know in my heart of hearts." This phrase suggests a subjective feeling or intuition, not an empirical or logical basis for the proposition.
- Since "I know in my heart of hearts" does not provide a compelling, logical, or empirical reason for \( <P> \), it falls under the category of \( <WCB> \) (Insufficient Causal Basis).

**Step 5: Verify the Inapplicability of Other Defective Argument Types**

- **Generalization (G):** The statement does not make a generalization about all instances based on some instances.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The statement does not claim completeness in considering all possible scenarios.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Although the reason given is not conclusive, it is more specifically insufficient than inconclusive.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason given is not simply a repetition of the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The reason given is not based on a presumed universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language used here is not ambiguous but rather subjective.

**Step 6: Conclude the Classification**

Given the above analysis, the string "I know in my heart of hearts that our home team will win the World Series" represents a defective argument of type:

- **\( <WCB> \) (Insufficient Causal Basis)**

The reason provided for the proposition about the home team winning the World Series is not compelling because it is based on personal belief or intuition rather than tangible evidence or logical reasoning.

### Conclusion

The application of **IDAA** to the string results in the classification of the argument as **\( <WCB> \) - Insufficient Causal Basis**.
