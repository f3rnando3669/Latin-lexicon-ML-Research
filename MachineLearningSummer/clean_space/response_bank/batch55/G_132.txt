For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "10 of the last 14 National Spelling Bee Champions have been Indian American. Indian Americans must all be great spellers!", we will decompose the task of classifying the string as a defective argument into specific steps and then execute each step.

### Step-by-Step Execution of IDAA

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
Examine the given string to identify the main assertion or proposition.

- **Proposition (P)**: "Indian Americans must all be great spellers!"

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Determine the causal basis that supports the proposition stated in Step 1.

- **Reason (R)**: "10 of the last 14 National Spelling Bee Champions have been Indian American."

#### Step 3: Evaluate the Validity of the Reason (<R>)
Assess if the reason provided conclusively supports the proposition.

- The reason presents statistical evidence about 10 of the last 14 champions.
- However, the reason does not necessarily support the proposition that "all" Indian Americans are great spellers.

#### Step 4: Check for Specific Defective Argument Types
Evaluate the argument using the definitions provided for each defective argument type.

1. **Generalization (G)**: The proposition is based on a statement about a specific number (10 out of 14) of individuals and extends it to all Indian Americans.
    - Relevant Definitions:
        - **Proposition (P)**: "Indian Americans must all be great spellers!"
        - **Reason (R)**: "10 of the last 14 National Spelling Bee Champions have been Indian American."
    - The argument assumes that because some Indian Americans have been successful in spelling bees, all Indian Americans are great spellers, which generalizes the trait of the champions to the entire population.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable here since there are no claims of completely enumerating all possibilities; just referencing a specific group.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: While the reason is true, it does not conclusively demonstrate that all Indian Americans are great spellers.
    - However, the argument seems to primarily be a case of overgeneralization rather than an inconclusive reason.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis is not compelling enough to support the proposition that "all" Indian Americans are great spellers. However, the error here seems to be more of generalization than a weak causal basis since the reason does present verifiable data.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Not applicable since the reason is not merely a repetition of the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Not applicable as there is no mention of consensus or universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Not applicable as there is no use of ambiguous language in the given argument.

#### Step 5: Classify the Argument Based on Identified Defects
Based on the analysis in Step 4, classify the defective argument.

- The primary classification for this argument is **Generalization (G)**.

### Conclusion
Applying <IDAA> to the string "10 of the last 14 National Spelling Bee Champions have been Indian American. Indian Americans must all be great spellers!" leads us to classify it as a defective argument type **Generalization (G)**. The reason presented does not justify the sweeping assertion made in the proposition.
