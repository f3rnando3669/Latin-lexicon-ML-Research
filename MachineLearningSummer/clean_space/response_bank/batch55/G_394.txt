For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument into specific steps) to the given statement "While jogging around the neighborhood, you are more likely to get bitten by someone’s pet dog, than by any member of the canine species," we'll follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
First, we need to identify the main proposition in the statement. This is the assertion that the argument aims to prove.

- **Proposition**: "You are more likely to get bitten by someone’s pet dog while jogging around the neighborhood, than by any member of the canine species."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Next, we locate the reason provided in the argument to support the proposition. This is the causal basis for the proposition.

- **Reason**: The argument suggests it's simply a comparison in likelihood without explicitly providing a clear causal basis involving why pet dogs specifically would bite more often in this scenario.

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
Then, we look for any proof or additional arguments that corroborate the reason.

- **Proof of Reason**: In this statement, there is no explicit proof or further argument provided to corroborate the reason.

### Step 4: Identify any Defective Argument Types
Finally, we examine if there are any defects in the argument based on the defined defective argument types.

1. **Generalization (G)**: If the proposition is making a broad assertion based on a sample that is not representative.
   - Potential Issue: The proposition could be seen as overly generalizing that pet dogs in neighborhoods are more likely to bite than other canines without sufficient data.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: If the argument claims a complete list of factors but misses pertinent ones.
   - Potential Issue: There's no claim of complete enumeration, so this does not quite fit.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: If the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
   - Potential Issue: The reason does not clearly establish why pet dogs are more likely to bite compared to wild canines; it's more of an assumption.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: If the reason provided is not compelling enough.
   - Potential Issue: The argument lacks a compelling causal basis, as there’s no explanation provided for why pet dogs would bite more frequently in this context.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: If the reason is effectively a repeat of the proposition.
   - Does not fit in this case.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: If we assume something is universally agreed upon without it being conclusively proven.
   - Doesn't quite fit here.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: If language is used ambiguously.
   - Potential Issue: The term "any member of the canine species" may cause ambiguity as it includes all canines, both domestic and wild, and the comparison might be unclear.

### Conclusion
The argument most closely fits with the defective types **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition, and the causal basis for the proposition is not compellingly substantiated.

Thus, the classification of the string would be <IR> and <WCB>.
