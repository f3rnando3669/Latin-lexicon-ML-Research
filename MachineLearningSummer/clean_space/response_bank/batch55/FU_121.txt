For 
To apply the IDAA (decomposition of the task of classifying the argument as a type of defective argument), we need to break down the task step by step to accurately identify the type of defective argument in the given string:

Given string: **"Everyone is doing it, you should be too!"**

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify and Extract Key Components:**
   - Extract the <P>, <R>, and <PR> if they are present.
   - In the given string, the proposition (<P>) seems to be: "You should be doing it."
   - The reason (<R>) is: "Everyone is doing it."

2. **Analyze the Reasoning:**
   - Determine if <R> (the reason) provides a causal basis for <P> and if it is compelling or logically sound.
   - In this case, the reason appears to be a general statement of what others are doing, not necessarily a logical or causal basis.

3. **Classify the Argument:**
   - Compare the elements with definitions of defective argument types:
     - **Generalization (<G>):** Not relevant here, as it's not based on some parts or majority.
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Not relevant as it doesn't claim a complete enumeration.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Not relevant as it doesn't necessarily demonstrate inconclusiveness.
     - **Faulty Repetition (<RR>):** Not relevant as R is not repeating P.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Could be, if the reason is weak because "Everyone is doing it" isn’t compelling.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Relevant, since it assumes that because something is universally agreed upon (everyone is doing it), it is correct, even though this is in dispute.
     - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Not relevant, as it doesn’t involve ambiguous language.

### Conclusion:
Based on the IDs provided, we classify the string "Everyone is doing it, you should be too!" as a **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** because it assumes that the proposition is correct based on the ground that it is universally agreed upon, without resolving the matter in dispute.

Thus, the fallacy in the given string is **FU**, Presumptuous Consensus.
