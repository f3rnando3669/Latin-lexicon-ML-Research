For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of a task into specific steps) to IDA (the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types), we need to break down the steps for identifying the defective argument within the given string. Here's the step-by-step application:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   * The proposition (P) in the given string is: "The logic teacher was hired to fill the new computer animation class."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   * The reason (R) provided is: "He is a great admirer of Pixar's work."

3. **Evaluate the Reason for Corroboration (Proof of Reason, PR)**:
   * In some arguments, there might be additional supporting details (proof of reason, PR). However, in this case, the string does not provide any further corroborative arguments beyond the initial reason.

4. **Classify the Argument**:
   Based on the definitions provided for defective argument types, we need to determine which one fits the string best:

   - **Generalization (G)**: Not applicable here, as the argument does not impose a generalization based on a sample.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable, as there's no claim of a complete enumeration of possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This could be applicable if the reason does not conclusively establish the correctness of the proposition. The admiration of Pixar's work does not necessarily provide a strong enough causal basis for the teacher's capability to teach a computer animation class.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This is also applicable here. The reason (great admirer of Pixar's work) provided does not present a compelling causal basis for concluding that the teacher will do a great job.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Not applicable, as the reason is not simply a repetition of the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Not applicable, as there's no claim that "it is universally agreed upon."
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Not applicable, as thereâ€™s no ambiguity in the language used.

5. **Determine the Most Appropriate Classification**:
   - Upon evaluating the steps, it appears the reason (R) provided, "He is a great admirer of Pixar's work," does not present a compelling causation for concluding the proposition (P), "He will do a great job." Hence, this defective argument aligns with **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.

Thus, the classification of the given string is:

**<WCB>**
