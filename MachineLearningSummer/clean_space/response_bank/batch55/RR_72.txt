For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "Bill: I think capital punishment is wrong. Adam: No it isn't. If it was wrong, it wouldn't be legal.", we need to decompose the task of classifying the argument into defective argument types into specific steps. Let's proceed step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition and Reason in the Argument

- **Proposition (P):** "Capital punishment is wrong." 
- **Reason (R):** "If it was wrong, it wouldn't be legal."

### Step 2: Compare the Reason Against the Proposition

We now need to evaluate if the reason provided by Adam truly supports or establishes the proposition by Bill.

### Step 3: Check for Defective Argument Types

Let's test each defective argument type against the identified proposition and reason:

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - This type is about making an assertion based on insufficient or biased sample size.
   - Not applicable here as Adam is not generalizing.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - This type is about claiming to cover all possibilities but missing some pertinent ones.
   - This doesn't seem to be the case here. Adam is not listing possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - This type is when the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition's correctness.
   - Adam’s reasoning (if it wasn't wrong, it wouldn't be legal) seems logically weak because legality does not necessarily imply moral correctness.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - This type is when the reason is weak and the causal basis is not compelling.
   - This could be applicable since legality is a poor basis to judge morality.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - This type is when the reason is simply a restatement of the proposition.
   - Adam’s reason is not a repetition. It introduces a new idea—that legality implies correctness.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - This type is when a proof of reason is assumed to be certain because it is "universally agreed upon."
   - Not applicable—there is no appeal to consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - This type is when a proof of reason can be taken in another sense than intended.
   - Not applicable here.

### Step 4: Conclude the Classification

Based on the above evaluation, the types that might match the form of Adam's argument are:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

Both "Inconclusive Reason" and "Insufficient Causal Basis" seem to capture the essence of the flaw in Adam’s argument. However, the closer fit here is **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** since Adam’s reasoning rests on the weak assumption that legality equates to morality without providing a compelling causal basis for why legality would prove moral correctness.

### Conclusion

The argument provided by Adam, "If it was wrong, it wouldn't be legal.", against Bill's proposition "Capital punishment is wrong.", is best classified under the defective argument type **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

**Final Answer:** Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
