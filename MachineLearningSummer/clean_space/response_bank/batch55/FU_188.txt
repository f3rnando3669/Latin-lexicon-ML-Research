For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a defective argument), we should first decompose the task into specific steps for classifying the argument provided.

### Decomposition Steps for <IDA> (Classifying Defective Arguments):
1. **Extract the Proposition (<P>):** Identify the main statement or claim.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Understand the causal basis provided to support the proposition.
3. **Assess the Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Determine if additional arguments support the reason, and check their validity.
4. **Identify the Argument Type:** Compare the identified elements with definitions of defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).
5. **Classify the Argument:** Based on the comparison, classify the argument as one of the defective types.

### Applying <IDAA> to the Given Argument:

#### Step 1: Extract the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition here is: "It must be a good thing to do."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason provided is: "Everybody's doing it."

#### Step 3: Assess the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
There is an implied proof through social consensus: "Everybody's doing it, so it must be right or good."

#### Step 4: Identify the Argument Type
Compare the identified elements with the definitions of defective arguments:
- **Generalization (<G>):** Not applicable as no all-encompassing generalization of a subset to the whole population is being made.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Not applicable as there is no mention of a limited set of possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Not directly applicable as the reason is not scrutinized based on other logical grounds.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This could be part of it, but the reason itself isn't based on a proper investigation but on an assumption.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Not applicable because the reason (social behavior) isn't repeating the proposition (rightness).
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This matches well since the argument assumes that because everyone agrees or follows, it is thereby correct without actually proving the correctness.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Not applicable as there's no ambiguity in the argument's language.

#### Step 5: Classify the Argument
Given that the argument relies heavily on the assumption of universal agreement (a thing which is still in dispute regarding its correctness), it best aligns with the defective argument type of **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**.

### Conclusion
The given argument "when evidence boils down to 'everybody's doing it, so it must be a good thing to do' / 'cuando la evidencia se reduce a "todo el mundo lo est√° haciendo, por lo que debe ser algo bueno'" can be classified as a defective argument type <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).
