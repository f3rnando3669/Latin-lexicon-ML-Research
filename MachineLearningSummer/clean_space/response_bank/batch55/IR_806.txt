For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string provided by decomposing the task of classifying said string as a type of defective argument, we need to follow a step-by-step approach. This involves breaking down the task of classifying the string into specific steps to systematically arrive at a conclusion. Here are the steps:

### Step 1: Identify and Understand the Propositions and Reasons
First, we need to identify and isolate the propositions (P) and reasons (R), if any, from the provided dialogue.

#### String Analysis
"How am I to get in?" asked Alice again, in a louder tone.
"Are you to get in at all?" said the Footman, "That's the first question, you know."

- **Proposition by Alice (P):** Alice intends to know how she is supposed to get in.
- **Footman's Counter-Proposition (P2):** The Footman raises a preliminary question on whether Alice is supposed to get in at all.

### Step 2: Evaluate Based on Defective Argument Types
Now, let's evaluate the identified propositions to classify any potential defective arguments. 

#### Evaluation
- **Generalization (G):** Is there an over-generalization based on a particular or incomplete scenario presenting it as universally applicable?
  - No, there is no indication of an over-generalization.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Is there a claim of complete enumeration that misses out on pertinent possibilities?
  - No, there is no claimed enumeration in the propositions.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does the Reason (R) fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition (P)?
  - No explicit reason is given that would fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of Alice's question.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the Reason (R) weak due to a non-compelling causal basis for the Proposition (P)?
  - No causal basis is provided that is weak.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Is there a repetition where the Reason (R) merely repeats the Proposition (P) without adding substantive content?
  - No, the Footman actually provides a different angle by questioning the premise itself rather than repeating.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Is there an assumption of certainty based on a presumed universal agreement which is still in dispute?
  - No, there is no cited consensus used as proof.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Can the Proof of Reason (PR) be taken in another sense than intended due to ambiguous language?
  - Potentially, the Footman's question "Are you to get in at all?" can be taken as having different implications (whether Alice deserves or needs to get in, or if it should be assumed she should get in).

### Step 3: Draw Conclusion
After thorough evaluation, we determine if the string fits one of the defective argument types.

#### Conclusion
The best fitting defective argument type for the provided string appears to be:

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The Footman's answer using ambiguous language, "Are you to get in at all?" does leave open multiple interpretations and questions rather than directly addressing Alice's original proposition.

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the provided string concludes that it is classified as <DEP> due to the ambiguous nature of the Footman's response.
