To apply the **IDAA** framework to the task of classifying the given string "Order is necessary to justice because justice can only be achieved by a program of social and legal order," we need to decompose the classification process into specific steps. Let's proceed step by step to determine the type of defective argument it falls under:

### Step 1: Identification of Components
Identify the Proposition (P), Reason (R), and any Proof of Reason (PR) in the argument.

- **Proposition (P):** "Order is necessary to justice"
- **Reason (R):** "because justice can only be achieved by a program of social and legal order"

### Step 2: Analysis of the Argument Structure
Analyze whether the Reason adequately supports the Proposition.

1. **Proposition (P):** "Order is necessary to justice"
2. **Reason (R):** "because justice can only be achieved by a program of social and legal order"

### Step 3: Match the Argument to Defective Types
Evaluate the relationship between P and R under the lens of possible defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

1. **Generalization (G):** Check if the argument makes a general assertion based on insufficient evidence. (Not applicable here)
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Check if the argument claims to consider all possibilities but overlooks some. (Not applicable here)
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Consider if the Reason does not conclusively prove the Proposition. 
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Consider if the Reason provided is weak or not compelling. 
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Determine if the Reason merely restates the Proposition without adding new information.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Consider if the argument assumes a disputed point is universally accepted. (Not applicable here)
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Consider if the language in the Reason might be taken in another sense. (Not applicable here)

### Step 4: Classification
Based on the analysis, we determine that:
- The Reason (R) "justice can only be achieved by a program of social and legal order" essentially restates the Proposition (P) "Order is necessary to justice" without providing new information or compelling causal basis.
- Thus, the argument falls under **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**.

### Conclusion
The string "Order is necessary to justice because justice can only be achieved by a program of social and legal order" is classified as a **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**.

This step-by-step approach applied the principles of **IDAA** to classify the argument as defective, specifically identifying it as a case of faulty repetition.
