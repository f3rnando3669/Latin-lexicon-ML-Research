For 
To apply \( IDAA \) (the application of \( D \) to \( IDA \)), we first need to decompose \( IDA \) (the task of classifying a given string \( s \) into one of the defective argument types) into specific steps. Let's begin by defining these steps for decomposition (\( D \)):

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( P \))**: Determine the main assertion or claim made in the argument.
2. **Identify the Reason (\( R \))**: Determine the causal basis or reason supporting the \( P \).
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\( PR \))**: Determine if there are any additional arguments provided to corroborate the \( R \).
4. **Analyze the argument against the definitions of defective argument types** (\( G \), \( FE \), \( IR \), \( RR \), \( WCB \), \( FU \), \( DEP \)):
   - **Generalization ( \( G \) )**: Does the \( P \) make an unwarranted generalization?
   - **Incomplete Enumeration ( \( FE \) )**: Does the \( P \) claim a complete enumeration but miss out on possibilities?
   - **Inconclusive Reason ( \( IR \) )**: Does the \( R \) fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of \( P \)?
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis ( \( WCB \) )**: Is the causal basis presented in \( R \) weak or not compelling?
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition ( \( RR \) )**: Does the \( R \) merely repeat the \( P \) without adding anything new?
   - **Presumptuous Consensus ( \( FU \) )**: Does the \( PR \) assume certainty based on a dubious claim of universal agreement?
   - **Ambiguous Language Use ( \( DEP \) )**: Is there ambiguity in how the \( PR \) can be understood?
   
5. **Classify the argument**: Based on the analysis in step 4, classify the argument as one of the defective types.

Let's apply \( IDAA \) to the given string: "If you miss practice, it means you were probably goofing off. People who goof off drop out of school and end up penniless."

### Step-by-Step Application:

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( P \))**:
   - \( P \): "If you miss practice, it means you were probably goofing off."

2. **Identify the Reason (\( R \))**:
   - \( R \): "People who goof off drop out of school and end up penniless."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\( PR \))**:
   - There does not seem to be an explicit \( PR \); the argument transitions directly from the \( R \) to the conclusion without further verification.

4. **Analyze the argument against defective argument types**:

   - **Generalization ( \( G \) )**: The proposition does seem to make a generalization about missing practice equating to goofing off without consideration of other reasons (e.g., illness, emergencies). This could indicate a Generalization.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration ( \( FE \) )**: The argument does not provide a complete enumeration of all reasons why someone might miss practice. It claims missing practice equals goofing off without acknowledging other factors.
   - **Inconclusive Reason ( \( IR \) )**: The \( R \) does not logically follow from the \( P \). Just because people who goof off drop out of school and end up penniless doesn't conclusively demonstrate that missing practice is due to goofing off.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis ( \( WCB \) )**: The causal link between missing practice and goofing off, as well as goofing off leading directly to dropping out and ending up penniless, is weak and not substantiated.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition ( \( RR \) )**: This does not appear to be the case here.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus ( \( FU \) )**: This is not relevant here since there's no explicit appeal to universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use ( \( DEP \) )**: There does not appear to be significant ambiguity.

5. **Classify the argument**:

The string predominantly displays attributes of both **Generalization ( \( G \) )** and **Insufficient Causal Basis ( \( WCB \) )**:

- **Generalization ( \( G \) )**: The argument generalizes that missing practice equals goofing off without considering other possible reasons.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis ( \( WCB \) )**: The causal links between missing practice and goofing off, and then from goofing off to dropping out and ending up penniless, are weak and not compelling.

In conclusion, the classification of the argument "If you miss practice, it means you were probably goofing off. People who goof off drop out of school and end up penniless." can be identified as both **Generalization ( \( G \) )** and **Insufficient Causal Basis ( \( WCB \) )**.

Summary: The argument is predominantly a \( G \) (Generalization) with elements of \( WCB \) (Insufficient Causal Basis).
