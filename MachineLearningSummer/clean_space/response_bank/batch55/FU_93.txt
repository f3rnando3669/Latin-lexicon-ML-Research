For 
To apply IDAA to the string "A persuasive technique used in media messages that appeals to the 'everyone is doing it' mentality," we need to break down the advanced task of classifying this string as one of the defective argument types into specific steps. Here's the step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Understand the Task
Define the goal: We need to classify the given string as one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step 2: Analyze the String
Examine the string "A persuasive technique used in media messages that appeals to the 'everyone is doing it' mentality":
- This string describes a technique in media messages that relies on the idea that something is widely accepted or practiced.
- It suggests that the argument's strength comes from the appeal to widespread belief or behavior.

### Step 3: Match String to Defective Argument Types
Compare the identified nature of the string with each of the defective argument types:

- **<G> (Generalization)**: This involves an assertion based on some part or majority of individuals but assumes it applies universally. The string doesn't directly assert universality from a sample, so this might not be the best match.
  
- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: This involves missing possibilities while claiming a complete listing. The string doesn't suggest an enumeration of possibilities, so this is likely not relevant.
  
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: This would involve a reason that doesn't conclusively support the proposition. The string is about a persuasive technique rather than the conclusiveness of a reason.
  
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: This involves a reason that is not compelling. The string does not discuss the strength of a causal basis directly.
  
- **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: This involves restating the proposition as the reason. The string does not display a circular reasoning pattern.
  
- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: This describes a Proof of Reason assumed certain due to universal agreement, which aligns well with "everyone is doing it." This indicates that the persuasiveness comes from perceived universal consensus, a thing still in dispute.
  
- **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: This involves the proof of reason being taken in a different sense than intended. The string does not suggest ambiguous language use.

### Step 4: Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the string "A persuasive technique used in media messages that appeals to the 'everyone is doing it' mentality" best matches the defective argument type **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**, since it relies on the persuasive power of presumed universal agreement.

Thus, the classification <IDA> for the given string, following the steps of <IDAA>, is:

**Classify the string as type <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).**
