For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying an argument into specific defective argument types) to the given dialogue, we need to follow these specific steps:

1. **Identify and Extract Claims and Arguments**: Identify the propositions and reasons given by the speakers (Bill and Dave).
2. **Classify Each Statement**: Evaluate and classify each identified proposition and reason based on the defined defective argument types.
3. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types**: Determine if the identified arguments fit into any of the defective argument types.

Here is the step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Identify and Extract Claims and Arguments

1. **Bill's Proposition (\<P\>)**: "I believe that abortion is morally wrong."
2. **Dave's Counter-Argument (\<R\>)**:
   - "Of course, you would say that, you’re a priest."
   - "Those don’t count. Like I said, you’re a priest, so you have to say that abortion is wrong."
   - "Further, you are just a lackey to the Pope, so I can’t believe what you say."

### Step 2: Classify Each Statement

1. **Bill's Proposition (\<P\>)**: "I believe that abortion is morally wrong."
   - This is a straightforward proposition stating his belief.
2. **Dave's Counter-Arguments**:
   - "Of course, you would say that, you’re a priest.": This suggests that Bill's argument is influenced by his position as a priest.
   - "Those don’t count. Like I said, you’re a priest, so you have to say that abortion is wrong.": This dismisses Bill's arguments based on his identity as a priest.
   - "Further, you are just a lackey to the Pope, so I can’t believe what you say.": This ties Bill's belief to being a mere follower of the Pope, not his independent reasoning.

### Step 3: Analyze for Defective Argument Types

1. **Ad Hominem (not listed in provided defective types, but a common logical fallacy)**: 
   - Dave attacks Bill's personal characteristics (his identity as a priest) rather than addressing the arguments Bill presents.
   
2. **Generalization (\<G\>)**:
   - Assertion that all priests would say abortion is wrong might fit, but this is more about attacking the person, i.e., an Ad Hominem.

3. **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)**:
   - No evidence Dave claims to have enumerated possibilities.

4. **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**:
   - Dave's reasoning does not address the correctness of Bill's proposition about abortion but rather dismisses Bill's position based on his identity.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**:
   - Dave's reasoning lacks substantial evidence connecting the cause (Bill being a priest) to the effect (Bill's moral stance).

6. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)**:
   - Dave repeats his proposition that Bill's arguments don't count because he is a priest.

7. **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)**:
   - Dave does not appeal to universal agreement about a disputed matter.

8. **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)**:
   - The language used by Dave is clear in its dismissal of Bill based on identity.

### Conclusion

The argument type that best categorizes Dave's argument falls primarily under "Generalization (\<G\>)" (assuming that because Bill is a priest, he must necessarily believe abortion is wrong in all cases) and "Ad Hominem," a type of argument where the individual's characteristics are attacked instead of their actual argument, although "Ad Hominem" was not mentioned in our predefined defective arguments list.

Thus, applying **<IDAA> to the given dialogue**, Dave's arguments can be primarily classified as:

- **Ad Hominem**: attacks the person rather than the argument.
- **Generalization (\<G\>)**: asserting that Bill's belief is solely based on his identity as a priest.

Note: The classification "Ad Hominem" is used here given its relevance, even though it's not defined in the original defective argument types.
