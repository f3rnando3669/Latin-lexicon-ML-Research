For 
To classify the given argument type "If we don't control Covid-19, it could lead to millions of deaths. Wouldn't it make you sad to live in a country where that had happened?" using the steps of <IDAA>, we need to decompose the task (<IDA>) into specific steps (<D>). Here’s how to approach it:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>) of <IDA>:
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Determine the main assertion or claim being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Determine the causal basis or reasoning provided to support the proposition.
3. **Evaluate the defective argument types:** Consider each defective argument type (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) and see if the identified <P> and <R> are defective according to these definitions.

### Applying <IDAA> to the argument:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition (<P>): "If we don't control Covid-19, it could lead to millions of deaths."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason (<R>): While there is no explicit causal reasoning presented for the proposition, the second part of the statement implicitly suggests an affective emotional appeal: "Wouldn't it make you sad to live in a country where that had happened?"

3. **Evaluate the defective argument types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** The proposition does make a general claim about the outcome of not controlling Covid-19, but it doesn't appear to be a generalization of a smaller sample to a larger group.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument does not appear to enumerate possibilities but directly states a consequence.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition. The emotional appeal ("Wouldn't it make you sad") doesn't provide a concrete causal basis for the assertion that millions of deaths would result.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** There is an insufficient causal basis provided. The argument jumps to an emotional appeal without giving detailed reasoning regarding the link between the lack of control and millions of deaths.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The Reason doesn't restate the Proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The Reason doesn’t rely on presumed universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** There isn't ambiguous language in the Proposition or Reason that could be misinterpreted.

### Conclusion:
- The defective argument type that applies most closely to the given argument is **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, because the emotional appeal ("Wouldn't it make you sad") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition that not controlling Covid-19 would lead to millions of deaths.

Therefore, applying <IDAA> to the given argument, we classify it as of type **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason).
