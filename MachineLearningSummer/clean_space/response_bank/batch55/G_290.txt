For 
To apply IDAA to the given statement "Besides charities, comfort, community cohesion, rehabilitation, and helping children learn values, religion poisons everything," we need to decompose the task of classifying the type of defective argument into specific steps (D) and apply those steps methodologically to identify the type (IDA).

### Step 1: Identify Proposition (P)
First, identify the Proposition (P) which is the main statement or claim in the argument.

**P**: "Religion poisons everything."

### Step 2: Identify Reason (R) Supporting Proposition
Next, identify the Reason (R) that supports the Proposition (P). It is the causal basis for establishing the truth of the Proposition.

**R**: "Besides charities, comfort, community cohesion, rehabilitation, and helping children learn values."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Nature of the Proposition and Reason
Evaluate the nature of the Proposition and the Reason supporting it. This involves checking if there are any issues such as over-generalization, incomplete enumeration, weak causal basis, or ambiguous language.

Here are the issues identified:
- The Proposition (P) "Religion poisons everything" is a sweeping generalization.
- The Reason (R) lists a set of positive aspects (charities, comfort, etc.) and contrasts them with the generic negative impact of religion.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument
Check the identified defects against predefined types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP).

**Analysis:**
1. **Generalization (G)**: The Proposition (P) "Religion poisons everything" makes a broad claim applicable to all instances of religion, based on contrasting with some specific positive aspects. This indicates a sweeping generalization without addressing the various dimensions or positive impacts of religion beyond those listed.

Thus, the classification based on analysis is that the argument primarily represents a **Generalization (G)**.

### Conclusion
By following these steps, we classify the statement as a defective argument of type **Generalization (G)**. The Proposition "Religion poisons everything" is based on a generalization that contrasts it with a few specific positive attributes, without demonstrating why those positive attributes are insufficient or considering potential other positive impacts of religion.
