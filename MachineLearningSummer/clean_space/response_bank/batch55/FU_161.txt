For 
To apply <IDAA>, which is the application of the decomposition of the task into specific steps to the task of classifying an argument as of a defective argument type, we first need to decompose the advanced task of argument classification into actionable steps. Here, we want to identify the defective argument type in the given string "What persuasive technique is being used in this photo?". 

Let's break this down:

1. **Identify the Components**: Recognize the parts of the task and the possible components involved in the string.

2. **Match Definitions**: Compare the components identified to the definitions of defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

3. **Analyze Context and Language**: Understand the context and specific language used to see if it matches any specific defective argument type.

4. **Classify**: Assign the string to the corresponding defective argument type based on the analysis. 

Now let's apply these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Components

The string in question is: "What persuasive technique is being used in this photo?"

- The string is a question asking about the technique used in a photo.
- There is an implicit assumption that a persuasive technique is being used.

### Step 2: Match Definitions

- **Generalization (G)**: The string doesn't seem to be making a broad assertion based on limited cases.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The string does not list possibilities, so it does not fit this category.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The string does not offer a reason to justify a proposition; it is simply a question.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The string does not repeat any proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The string does not provide a reason for a proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The string does assume something; it assumes there is a persuasive technique in the photo.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The string does not use language that can be taken in another sense. 

### Step 3: Analyze Context and Language

- The question assumes that a persuasive technique exists in the photo without presenting any proof of reason. 
- It suggests that by merely asking, it is agreed upon that the photo employs a persuasive technique, which could be presumptuous.

### Step 4: Classify

Based on the analysis, the string "What persuasive technique is being used in this photo?" fits best with the defective argument type **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** because it assumes universality, presuming that the existence of a persuasive technique in the photo is agreed upon, something that is still in dispute.

Thus, applying <IDAA> results in classifying the string as of type <FU>.
