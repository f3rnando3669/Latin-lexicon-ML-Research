For 
To apply the advanced task decomposition (\<IDAA\>) of classifying the argument type (\<IDA\>) in the given string, we need to follow specific steps to analyze and determine the defective argument type. Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Extract the Proposition (\<P\>) and Reason (\<R\>) from the string.**
2. **Identify any Proof of Reason (\<PR\>) that's being referenced.**
3. **Analyze the argument structure to determine if it fits any of the defective argument types defined.**

### Step-by-Step Application (\<IDAA\>):

1. **Extract the Proposition (\<P\>) and Reason (\<R\>):**

   Given string: "Television Advertisement: Rush to shop at Super-Mart this weekend, everyone is doing it!"

   - **Proposition (\<P\>):**
     "Rush to shop at Super-Mart this weekend."

   - **Reason (\<R\>):**
     "\Everyone is doing it!\""

2. **Identify any Proof of Reason (\<PR\>):**

   - In this string, no explicit additional arguments or proof (\<PR\>) are provided besides the Reason (\<R\>).

3. **Analyze the argument structure:**

   - The argument suggests that one should shop at Super-Mart this weekend because "everyone is doing it."

4. **Determine the defective argument type:**

   - First, consider if the Reason (\<R\>) provided conclusively supports the Proposition (\<P\>).
     - The Reason "\Everyone is doing it!\"" does not conclusively demonstrate that one should rush to shop at Super-Mart.

   - Next, check if the provided Reason invokes a presumed consensus or universally agreed fact without evidence.
     - The statement "\Everyone is doing it!\"" appears to assume a universal agreement without providing evidence for its truth.

   - This fits the pattern of Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>):
     - Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>): A Proof of Reason (\<PR\>) is assumed as certain, on the ground that "it is universally agreed upon," a thing which is still in dispute.

### Conclusion:

The given string "Television Advertisement: Rush to shop at Super-Mart this weekend, everyone is doing it!" exhibits the defective argument type Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>).

Therefore, the classification of the string under \<IDA\> is:

**Defective Argument Type: \<FU\> (Presumptuous Consensus)**
