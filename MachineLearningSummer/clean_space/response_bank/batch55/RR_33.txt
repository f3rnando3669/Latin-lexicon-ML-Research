For 
To apply **<IDAA>** to the sentence **"I must be telling the truth, since I’m not lying."**, we'll break down the advanced task of **classifying the defective argument** into specific steps. Here's the step-by-step decomposition of the task **<IDA>**:

### Decomposition (<D>):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine the main assertion being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the basis or reason given to support the proposition.
3. **Analyze the Structure**: Evaluate if the reason provided logically supports the proposition according to the defined valid argument structure.
4. **Classify Defective Argument Types**: Compare the argument’s structure and content against the definitions of defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Application of Decomposition (<IDAA>):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The proposition in the sentence is: **"I must be telling the truth."**

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason being given is: **"since I’m not lying."**

3. **Analyze the Structure:**
   - The argument states that the proposition **"I must be telling the truth"** is supported by the reason **"since I’m not lying."**
   - The reason essentially repeats the proposition but in a different wording. The reason does not introduce any new information or rationale for why the proposition should be accepted. Instead, it relies on a tautological statement (a statement that is true by necessity or by virtue of its logical form).

4. **Classify Defective Argument Types:**
   - In this step, we need to match the structure and content of the argument to one of the known defective argument types:
     - **<G> Generalization**: Not applicable here as there is no assertion based on a part or majority being referred to all.
     - **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: Not applicable as no enumeration of possibilities is being claimed.
     - **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: While the reason is strong in structure, it is not exactly the issue here.
     - **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: Not applicable since no causal basis is weakly presented.
     - **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: This seems to be our match as the reason **"I’m not lying"** repeats the core idea of the proposition **"I must be telling the truth"** without adding to the causal basis but presenting the same idea in a different form.
     - **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: Not applicable as there is no assumed consensus stated.
     - **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: Not applicable as there is no ambiguous language present.

Thus, after applying the steps of **<IDAA>** to "I must be telling the truth, since I’m not lying," we classify the argument as **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**.
