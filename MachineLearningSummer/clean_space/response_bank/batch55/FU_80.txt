For 
To apply IDAA (the application of D to IDA) to the statement "This technique uses the logic: Everyone else is doing it, you should too!", we need to decompose the task of classifying the statement into specific steps and then methodically perform each step. 

**Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of IDA:**
1. **Identify and Understand the Proposition (P):**
   - Extract the main assertion or claim being made.
2. **Identify and Understand the Reason (R):**
   - Determine the causal basis or justification presented.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR), if Any:**
   - Look for any additional arguments that support the reason.
4. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types:**
   - Compare the identified proposition, reason, and proof of reason against the definitions of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP).

**Application to the Given Statement:**

1. **Identify and Understand the Proposition (P):**
   - The main assertion is implicit but can be formulated as: "You should do it (whatever 'it' is)."

2. **Identify and Understand the Reason (R):**
   - The justification provided is: "Everyone else is doing it."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR), if Any:**
   - In this statement, there doesn't appear to be an additional argument that supports the reason beyond "everyone else is doing it," so we can assume there is no explicit PR.

4. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (G)**: The statement might be trying to apply a behavior of a group to all individuals, but it's not an assertion based on a single part or majority and then applied to all. So, this is not a case of G.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement is not claiming a complete list of possibilities, so this is not a case of FE.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason given ("everyone else is doing it") does not logically or conclusively demonstrate why the proposition ("you should do it") is correct. It lacks a conclusive basis. This aligns closely with IR.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The reason provided is not a compelling cause to establish the truth of the proposition. This also aligns with WCB.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason ("everyone else is doing it") is not simply a repetition of the proposition ("you should do it"), so this is not a case of RR.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The statement does not assume the reason is universally agreed upon; rather, it is leveraging a perceived social norm. FU is not applicable here.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: There is no ambiguous language that could lead to multiple interpretations in the statement. So, DEP is not applicable.

**Conclusion:**
The statement "This technique uses the logic: Everyone else is doing it, you should too!" primarily exhibits the characteristics of an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** since the reasoning provided does not logically establish the truth of the proposition. It also aligns with **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** as the causal basis (everyone else doing it) is not a compelling reason to justify the claim (you should do it).
