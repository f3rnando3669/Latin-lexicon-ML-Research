For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types) to the given string "Whatever is less dense than water will float, because such objects won't sink in water," we need to decompose the task systematically:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition (<P>): "Whatever is less dense than water will float."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason (<R>): "Such objects won't sink in water."

3. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:**
   - We need to compare the given argument structure to each defective argument type to see which one it fits. We analyze whether any of the defective argument types mentioned earlier applies.

#### Analysis of Potential Defective Argument Types:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - Generalization involves extending an assertion from a part or majority to all cases.
   - This doesn't strictly apply here since the statement doesn't generalize from a part or majority to all.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Incomplete Enumeration involves missing out on possibilities.
   - This defective type doesn't seem relevant here because no enumeration of possibilities is presented or suggested.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Inconclusive Reason means the reason provided does not conclusively support the proposition.
   - To verify the truth of <P>: Objects less dense than water float. This aligns with <R>: Such objects won't sink in water. The reason provided reiterates the criterion for floating but doesn't conclusively support the proposition in a rigorous way. We’ll revisit this if others don’t apply more straightforwardly.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Insufficient Causal Basis means the causal basis provided for the proposition is weak.
   - The reason "<objects less dense than water won't sink>" restates the notion of floating rather than providing an additional causal basis, potentially making <R> a weak causal basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - Faulty repetition means the reason essentially repeats the proposition.
   - Here, the reason "such objects won't sink in water" is indeed a restatement of the proposition "whatever is less dense than water will float." This fits the definition well, as both say essentially the same thing.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - Presumptuous Consensus means a proof of reason is assumed based on universal agreement.
   - This argument doesn't appeal to universal agreement to establish the proposition.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - Ambiguous Language Use involves language that can be taken in another sense than intended.
   - There's no ambiguous language in the proposition or reason here.

### Conclusion:
The argument "Whatever is less dense than water will float, because such objects won't sink in water" most closely aligns with the defective argument type **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)** because the reason provided is merely a restatement of the proposition itself.

Thus, the classification of the string is <RR>.
