To apply the process of IDAA (decomposition of IDA), we'll break down IDA into specific steps and then apply those steps to classify the given string "We either ban hairspray or the world will end."

Step 1: Understand the Proposition (\<P\>) in the Argument
- Identify the main point or assertion that is being made.
- In the given string: "We either ban hairspray or the world will end."
- Proposition (\<P\>): The world will end if we do not ban hairspray.

Step 2: Analyze the Reason (\<R\>) for the Proposition
- Identify the causal basis provided for the proposition.
- In the given string: The reason implied is that hairspray is causing a threat that could lead to the end of the world.
- Reason (\<R\>): Hairspray usage will cause the world to end.

Step 3: Examine if There is a Proof of Reason (\<PR\>)
- Check for additional arguments or evidence that support the reason.
- In the given string: There is no additional evidence provided, just a stark choice presented.

Step 4: Classify the Argument Type
- Analyze the types of defective arguments defined (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP) and see which one matches the given string.

Let's apply each defective argument type in turn:

1. **Generalization (G):** 
   - This type of defective argument asserts that what applies to some or a majority is applicable to all. 
   - The given string does not fit this description as it does not generalize from a part to the whole.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** 
   - This occurs when a complete enumeration of possibilities is claimed but is incomplete.
   - The given string presents a dichotomy (either/or) without considering other possibilities, hence it fits the definition of Incomplete Enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - This is where the reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
   - The reasoning that banning hairspray will prevent the end of the world is not conclusively demonstrated.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - This is when the causal basis for the proposition is weak.
   - The reason given (hairspray leading to the end of the world) is weak without further evidence or explanation. 

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - This is when the reason repeats the proposition without adding new information.
   - The given string does not involve repetition of the same statement in both P and R.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - This happens when a proof of reason is assumed true based on a supposed universal agreement.
   - The given string does not assume universal agreement, so it does not match FU.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - This involves language that can be interpreted in different ways.
   - The given string is not ambiguous but rather unequivocal in its proposition.

**Conclusion:**
Evaluating the steps, the given string fits best under both **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. However, since the stark dichotomy presented ("ban hairspray or the world will end") is a clearer fit for missing out on other plausible possibilities and courses of action, the most fitting classification for the argument type in the given string is **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**. 

### Final Classification:
The argument "We either ban hairspray or the world will end." is classified as **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**.
