For 
To apply IDAA, which involves decomposing the task of classifying a defective argument, we'll follow these steps systematically:

1. Identify the proposition (P).
2. Identify the reason (R).
3. Identify the proof of reason (PR) if available.
4. Compare identified components against definitions of defective argument types.
5. Determine classification as per defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

Let's apply these steps to the given argument: "I met a tall man who loved to eat cheese. Now I believe that all tall people like cheese."

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- **Proposition (P):** "Now I believe that all tall people like cheese."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- **Reason (R):** "I met a tall man who loved to eat cheese."

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- **Proof of Reason (PR):** None provided explicitly beyond the initial reason.

#### Step 4: Compare Identified Components Against Definitions of Defective Argument Types
- **Generalization (G):** Is the proposition (<P>) an assertion based on one part or a majority, but not necessarily applicable to all? Look at the provided reason.
  - **Assessment:** The reason cites meeting just one tall man who loved cheese and extends this attribute to all tall people.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Does the proposition claim to have made a complete enumeration of possibilities but actually misses out?
  - **Assessment:** This does not appear to be the case here.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does the reason conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
  - **Assessment:** The reason does not provide conclusive evidence that all tall people like cheese.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the causal basis for the reason compelling?
  - **Assessment:** The causal basis (one instance) is weak for supporting the proposition about all tall people.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Does the reason say the same thing as the proposition?
  - **Assessment:** This does not apply as the reason and proposition are distinct.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Is the proof of reason assumed certain on the ground of universal agreement?
  - **Assessment:** No claim of universal agreement is made here.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Can the proof of reason be taken in another sense than intended?
  - **Assessment:** No ambiguous language causing misinterpretation in different senses is present.

#### Step 5: Determine Classification
Given the comparisons, the primary issue with this argument is that it draws a broad conclusion from a single instance:

- **Classification:** <G> (Generalization)

### Conclusion:
The argument "I met a tall man who loved to eat cheese. Now I believe that all tall people like cheese." is classified as type <G> (Generalization).
