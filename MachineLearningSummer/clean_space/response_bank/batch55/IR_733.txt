To apply the process of IDAA to classify the argument "My uncle is a mechanic and he says you shouldn't spank children. He says it's ineffective," we need to first decompose the task (IDA) into specific steps (D). Here is the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
A proposition (P) is a summary statement of what we intend to prove.
- Proposition: "You shouldn't spank children."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
A reason (R) provides the causal basis for the proposition.
- Reason: "It’s ineffective."

### Step 3: Determine the Proof of Reason (PR)
A proof of reason (PR) corroborates the reason with additional arguments or evidence.
- Proof of Reason: "My uncle is a mechanic and he says you shouldn't spank children."

### Step 4: Examine the Argument for Defect Types
Now, we need to classify the given argument by examining it for any defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP).

Let’s analyze each defect type with respect to the given argument:

1. **Generalization (G)**
   - This occurs when an assertion about a part or majority is wrongly applied to all.
   - No evidence of generalization in this specific context.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
   - This occurs when not all possibilities are considered.
   - Not applicable here as enumeration of possibilities is not attempted.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
   - This occurs when the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
   - "It’s ineffective" is a reason but not necessarily conclusive without empirical evidence.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
   - This occurs when the causal basis is weak or not compelling.
   - "My uncle is a mechanic" provides no expertise relevant to child discipline.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
   - This occurs when the reason simply restates the proposition.
   - The reason seems to be different from the proposition, hence not RR.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
   - This happens when proof is assumed based on a supposed universal agreement.
   - No consensus is claimed here.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**
   - This happens when terms can be interpreted in multiple ways.
   - There's no significant ambiguity—"ineffective" is clearly related to spanking.

### Step 5: Classify the Defect
From the analysis above, the most fitting classification is:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reason provided ("My uncle is a mechanic") does not serve as a compelling or relevant causal basis for the argument about child discipline.

Thus, the argument "My uncle is a mechanic and he says you shouldn't spank children. He says it's ineffective." falls under the classification of **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**.
