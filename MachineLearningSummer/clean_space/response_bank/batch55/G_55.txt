For 
Let's apply the process of IDAA to the statement "No one in your family surfs? But I thought you said you lived in California before this."

1. **Step 1: Understand the task <IDA>.**
   - Task <IDA> involves classifying a given string as one of the defective argument types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

2. **Step 2: Breakdown the string into its elements.**
   - The string consists of two parts:
     - Part 1: "No one in your family surfs?"
     - Part 2: "But I thought you said you lived in California before this."

3. **Step 3: Identify the Proposition <P>.**
   - The implied Proposition \( <P> \) here is: "People who live in California surf."

4. **Step 4: Identify the Reason <R>.**
   - The Reason \( <R> \) could be: "Because you (or your family) lived in California, you should surf."

5. **Step 5: Evaluate the argument components.**
   - The statement assumes a causal relationship between living in California and surfing.

6. **Step 6: Identify the defective argument type according to the definitions provided.**
   - To classify based on defects:
     - **Generalization \( <G> \)**: The argument makes an assertion that because the speaker believes most people in California surf, it applies to everyone who lives (or lived) in California. 

     - **Incomplete Enumeration \( <FE> \)**: This defect does not apply because the argument does not claim a complete enumeration of all possibilities.

     - **Inconclusive Reason \( <IR> \)**: This does not specify if the reason is conclusively demonstrating the proposition.

     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition \( <RR> \)**: The statement does not simply repeat the proposition.

     - **Insufficient Causal Basis \( <WCB> \)**: The causal basis (living in California implies surfing) might be weak or not compelling.

     - **Presumptuous Consensus \( <FU> \)**: The argument does not rely on an assumed universal agreement.

     - **Ambiguous Language Use \( <DEP> \)**: The language in the argument is clear and unambiguous.

7. **Step 7: Refine classification.**
   - Given the options, the argument seems to fit **Generalization** \( <G> \) most closely because it takes a stereotype (people in California surf) and applies it universally to everyone who lives there.

**Conclusion: The statement "No one in your family surfs? But I thought you said you lived in California before this." is best classified as a Generalization \( <G> \).**
