For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "Grading this exam on a curve would be the most fair thing to do. After all, classes go more smoothly when the students and the professor are getting along well.", we need to decompose the task of classifying this string as one of the defective argument types into specific steps.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Locate the main assertion that is being put forward.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Locate the causal basis for the proposition.
3. **Analyze the Reason**: Determine if the reason provided adequately supports the proposition.
4. **Determine the type of Defective Argument**: Based on the analysis, classify the argument as one of the defective types.

Let's apply these steps to the given string.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
**Proposition (<P>)**: "Grading this exam on a curve would be the most fair thing to do."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
**Reason (<R>)**: "After all, classes go more smoothly when the students and the professor are getting along well."

### Step 3: Analyze the Reason
Here, the Reason provided is that classes go more smoothly when there is good rapport between students and the professor. The implied causal connection is that grading on a curve would enhance student-professor relations, thereby making the class go more smoothly.

### Step 4: Determine the Type of Defective Argument
Now, let's evaluate if and how the reason adequately supports the proposition:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: It's not based on an assertion about a majority and does not generalize a part to the whole.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: It doesn't claim a complete enumeration of all possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This seems plausible. The reason "classes go more smoothly when the students and the professor are getting along well" does not conclusively prove that "grading this exam on a curve would be the most fair thing to do." The connection between grading on a curve and fairness is not conclusively established.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reason provided might be weak as the causal link between grading on a curve and fairness is not compelling in this case.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The reason is not a repetition of the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument does not appeal to universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The terms are not ambiguous; they do not appear to have an alternative interpretation different from what the speaker intended.

Given this analysis, the argument can be classified primarily as **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and possibly **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**, but more strongly leaning towards **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** because the reason does not conclusively establish the fairness of grading on a curve.

### Conclusion
The given string “Grading this exam on a curve would be the most fair thing to do. After all, classes go more smoothly when the students and the professor are getting along well.” is best classified under **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**.
