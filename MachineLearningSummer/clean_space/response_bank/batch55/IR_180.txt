For 
To apply **<IDAA>** to the statement "Who are you to ask fast food restaurants to give us nutritional facts? I saw you eat Taco Bell last night!", we first need to **define**, **decompose**, and **classify** the statement based on the given defective argument types.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Classification:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - The statement questions the authority or appropriateness of someone asking fast food restaurants for nutritional facts.
   - Proposition (P): "You lack the standing to request nutritional facts from fast food restaurants."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - The reason given for the proposition is that the person making the request was seen eating at Taco Bell.
   - Reason (R): "I saw you eat Taco Bell last night."

3. **Analyze the Reason (R) in relation to the Proposition (P):**
   - Check if the reason provided is relevant and compelling enough to support the proposition.
   - Here, the reason tries to discredit the person's authority to ask for nutritional facts based on their eating behavior.

4. **Determine the possible defective argument type:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** Not applicable since the argument is not making a broad assertion about a majority or all individuals based on a single instance.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Not applicable since there’s no claim of complete enumeration here.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This could be applicable as the reason provided ("I saw you eat Taco Bell last night") does not conclusively undermine the request for nutritional facts. It’s irrelevant to the authority of the person making the request.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Not applicable as it is not about the sufficiency of a causal basis but rather the relevance of the observation.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Not applicable since the reason given is different from the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Not applicable as there is no reference to a universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Not applicable as the language used doesn’t appear ambiguous or open to multiple interpretations.

### Classification:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason given ("I saw you eat Taco Bell last night") does not logically support the proposition ("You lack the standing to request nutritional facts from fast food restaurants").

So, the defective argument type for the given statement is **<IR>**.
