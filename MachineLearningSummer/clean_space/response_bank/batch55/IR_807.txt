For 
To apply the concept of IDAA (which involves decomposing the task of identifying the type of defective argument present in a given string) to the provided statement, "Aren't you tired of the political divisiveness in this country? Republicans know what they are talking about when it comes to immigration. Don't you agree?," let's break down the process step by step:

### Decomposition (D) into Specific Steps:
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine what is being set forth as the claim or assertion.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine the causal basis being set forth to support the Proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Determine any additional arguments provided to corroborate the Reason.

4. **Analyze for Defective Arguments:**
   - Compare the identified Proposition, Reason, and Proof of Reason against the definitions of defective arguments (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

5. **Classify the Defective Argument (<IDA>):**
   - Based on the analysis, classify the argument as one of the defective types.

### Step-by-Step Application of <IDAA>:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The Proposition in this statement can be interpreted as:
   - "Republicans know what they are talking about when it comes to immigration."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The Reason supporting the Proposition seems to be implied and not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred from the context:
   - "Political divisiveness in the country is a problem, suggesting Republicans have a coherent solution."

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
The Proof of Reason, evidence or additional argument to support the Reason, appears to be built on the rhetorical question inviting agreement:
   - "Don't you agree?" (This is encouraging the listener to accept the assertion based on presumed social consensus)

#### Step 4: Analyze for Defective Arguments:
We'll compare the identified Proposition, Reason, and Proof of Reason against the definitions of defective arguments.

- **Generalization (<G>):**
  The statement does not seem to generalize an unfounded majority or all individuals to a whole implicitly.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
  The Proposition does not rely on an enumeration of possibilities, so this type isn't applicable.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
  The Reason presented is more of a rhetorical gesture and doesn't conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition. There is no logical connection between political divisiveness and Republicans knowing what they are talking about on immigration specifically.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
  There's a weak causal connection made because the Reason does not compellingly justify the Proposition.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
  It doesn’t repeat the proposition in the form of the Reason.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
  The part “Don’t you agree?” suggests that the Proposition might be true because of assumed agreement or social consensus, which has not been proven.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
  There isn’t ambiguity in language that could lead to misinterpretation here.

#### Step 5: Classify the Defective Argument (<IDA>):
Given the above analysis, the argument mainly suffers from:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason provided doesn't conclusively justify the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** It assumes universal agreement as a proof which is still in dispute.

Thus, the provided string can be classified primarily under **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and secondarily as **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**.
