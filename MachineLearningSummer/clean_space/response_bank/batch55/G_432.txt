For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "If we ban Hummers because they are bad for the environment, eventually the government will ban all cars, so we should not ban Hummers," we will decompose the task of classifying the defective argument into specific steps. We'll break down the string, examine each part in the context of the defective argument types, and identify the most applicable classification.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Classification:

1. **Identify the Proposition <P>:**
   - The proposition in the string is: "We should not ban Hummers."

2. **Identify the Reason <R>:**
   - The reason provided is: "If we ban Hummers because they are bad for the environment, eventually the government will ban all cars."

3. **Examine the Reason <R> and check for defects:**
   - **Generalization (G):** Does the reason take a specific case (Hummers) and make an unwarranted generalization about all cars?
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Does the reason rely on an enumeration that is not complete or fully explored?
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the causal basis submitted for the proposition not compelling enough?
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Does the reason merely repeat the proposition in different words?
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Is there an assumption that the reason is universally agreed upon without substantiation?
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Does the reason suffer from ambiguous language that can be interpreted in multiple ways?

4. **Identify the most applicable defective argument type:**
   - The reason provided claims a slippery slope: banning Hummers will lead to banning all cars. This is a form of **Generalization (G)**.
   - Specifically, it takes a small, specific action (banning Hummers) and generalizes its consequences to a broad and extreme outcome (banning all cars).

### Classification:

Given the examination, the string "If we ban Hummers because they are bad for the environment, eventually the government will ban all cars, so we should not ban Hummers." falls under the defective argument type **Generalization (G)**.

### Result:

Applying <IDAA> to the string results in the classification: **G**.
