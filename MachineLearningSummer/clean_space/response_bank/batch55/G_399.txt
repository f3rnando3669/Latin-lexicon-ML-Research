For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument) to the given statement "You can never give anyone a break. If you do, they'll walk all over you.", we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   The statement to be proven or the main claim. 
   - <P>: "You can never give anyone a break."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   The causal basis for <P>.
   - <R>: "If you do, they'll walk all over you."

3. **Identify the type of defective argument**:
   - Examine if <P> is a Generalization.
   - Examine if <P> is an Incomplete Enumeration.
   - Examine if <R> is an Inconclusive Reason.
   - Examine if <R> provides an Insufficient Causal Basis.
   - Examine if <R> is a Faulty Repetition of Proposition.
   - Examine if a Pres presumptuous Consensus is assumed in <PR>.
   - Examine if there is Ambiguous Language Use.

Here is the step-by-step analysis:

### Step 1: Examine for Generalization (<G>)
A Generalization would mean <P> is applicable to all based on a small sample.

- **Analysis**: The statement "You can never give anyone a break" suggests a universal rule based on what seems to be a limited or unspecified number of experiences or examples.
- **Conclusion**: <P> fits the characteristic of <G> as it asserts a universal rule from potentially selected or limited examples.

### Step 2: Examine for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
Claims to make a complete list but misses some possibilities.

- **Analysis**: The statement does not claim to enumerate possibilities but rather asserts a universal rule.
- **Conclusion**: Not <FE>.

### Step 3: Examine for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
<R> must conclusively prove <P>.

- **Analysis**: <R> ("If you do, they'll walk all over you") does not conclusively demonstrate that giving a break always results in being walked over.
- **Conclusion**: <R> fits the characteristic of <IR> as it does not definitively prove <P> ("You can never give anyone a break").

### Step 4: Examine for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
<R> must provide compelling causal basis for <P>.

- **Analysis**: The reason offered does not seem sufficiently compelling to provide a strong causal basis.
- **Conclusion**: <R> could also potentially fit <WCB>, but this is secondary to <IR> and <G>.

### Step 5: Examine for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
<R> should not be a mere restatement of <P>.

- **Analysis**: <R> is not a restatement of <P>, instead it tries to provide a reason.
- **Conclusion**: Not <RR>.

### Step 6: Examine for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
<PR> should not assume universal agreement which is in dispute.

- **Analysis**: The argument does not base its proof on universal agreement.
- **Conclusion**: Not <FU>.

### Step 7: Examine for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)
<PR> should not have ambiguous language.

- **Analysis**: The language is clear, when "walk all over you" is kept in colloquial context.
- **Conclusion**: Not <DEP>.

### Summary
The defective argument can be principally classified as:

- **<G>**: Generalization - Proposition asserts a universal rule based on limited examples.
- **<IR>**: Inconclusive Reason - Reason does not conclusively prove the Proposition. 

Therefore, the statement "You can never give anyone a break. If you do, they'll walk all over you." is primarily an example of <G> (Generalization) and also suffers from <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
