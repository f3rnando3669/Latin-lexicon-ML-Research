For 
To apply **IDAA** (the application of task decomposition to the classification of a defective argument) to the given string:

"Historically, up until the late 16th century, most people believed that the Earth was the center of the universe. Today we understand this is not true," is an example of what fallacy?

we need to break down the task of identifying the fallacy step by step. 

### Step-by-step Decomposition

1. **Identify and summarize the proposition (<P>):**
    - **Proposition (P)**: Historically, most people believed that the Earth was the center of the universe.
  
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
    - **Reason (R)**: Today, we understand that this belief is not true.
  
3. **Analyze the Reason (<R>) for any of the following defects:**

   - **Generalization (G)**
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**
  
#### Decomposition Analysis:

4. **Check for Generalization (G)**:
   - The proposition is about a historical belief ("most people believed that the Earth was the center of the universe").
   - This is not a generalization about a part being applied to the whole.
  
5. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - The string does not enumerate possibilities; it states one historical fact and its contradiction by modern understanding.
  
6. **Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - "Today we understand this is not true" establishes the contrary evidence but does this reason alone disprove the initial proposition conclusively in the context it is mentioned?
     - Since it is accepted science today, this is not inconclusive reasoning.

7. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - The reason given is not a restatement of the proposition.

8. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - The reason provided is accepted scientific evidence and is compelling. Thus, it is not an insufficient causal basis.

9. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - The string does not imply consensus as the basis for establishing the truth.

10. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
    - There is no term in the statement that could be taken in another sense than intended. The terms are clear and the context is straightforward.

### Conclusion

Given the steps above, the defective arguments have been evaluated, and none of the specific defects listed seems to apply directly to "Historically..., most people believed..." proposition when analyzed in this context. Therefore, the given string does not fall into any of the defined defective argument categories.

Upon careful consideration, another fallacy category outside of those defined might be suitable. The statement could be seen as a **Bandwagon Fallacy** due to the implication of shifting beliefs over time. However, within the confines of the provided categories, it does not strictly match any of the given defective argument types.
