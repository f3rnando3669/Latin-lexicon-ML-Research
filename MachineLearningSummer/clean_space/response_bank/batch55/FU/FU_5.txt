For 
To apply the IDAA to the string "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding," we will decompose the task of classifying the argument (IDA) into specific steps (D). Here is a step-by-step approach to determine the defective argument type:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P) in the statement:**
   - The speaker is trying to prove: "I wasn't speeding."

2. **Identify the Reason (R) given for the Proposition (P):**
   - The reason provided by the speaker is: "I was only driving as fast as everyone around me."

3. **Assess the Reason (R) using different classifications of defective arguments:**

   - **Generalization (G):** Is the proposition based on an assertion applied universally from a sample that might not represent the whole?
     - Not applicable here.
   
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Does the argument miss out on some pertinent possibilities?
     - Not applicable here.
   
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does the reason not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
     - This could be considered, as driving at the same speed as others does not conclusively prove whether the person was speeding or not.
   
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the causal basis for the proposition weak or not compelling?
     - This could also be considered. The fact that others are driving at a certain speed doesn't necessarily justify that the speaker wasn't speeding.
   
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Does the reason repeat the proposition without adding substantial information?
     - Not applicable here.
   
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Is the reason based on an assumption that it is universally agreed upon?
     - This fits well. The speakerâ€™s reason is based on the presumption that if everyone else is driving at that speed, it must be acceptable, which is not necessarily the case.
   
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Could the proof be taken in another sense than the speaker intended?
     - Not applicable here.

4. **Based on the classification, determine the defective argument type:**

Given that the Reason (R) primarily relies on the assumption that driving as fast as everyone else justifies the claim of not speeding, the defective argument can be classified as **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.

**Conclusion:**
The defective argument type for the provided string "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding." is **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.
