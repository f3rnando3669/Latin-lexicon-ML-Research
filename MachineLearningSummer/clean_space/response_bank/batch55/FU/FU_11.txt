For 
To apply IDAA (Decomposition of the task of classifying "SM 7: No global warming happening" as one of the defective argument types), we must follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P> in the string "SM 7: No global warming happening"
- The proposition <P> is "No global warming happening".

### Step 2: Attempt to identify a Reason <R> that would support the Proposition <P>
- Since the statement is brief and only contains the proposition, there's no explicit reason <R> provided within the string itself.

### Step 3: Determine if there is a Proof of Reason <PR> within the string
- The string doesn't provide any proof of reason. It's simply asserting the proposition without any proof or reason attached.

### Step 4: Evaluate if the Proposition <P> appears to fit any known defective argument types
Without an explicit reason or proof, we can still analyze the defective nature of the assertion itself:

#### 4.1 Check for Generalization <G>
- The proposition "No global warming happening" might be a **generalization** if it is based on limited observations that do not represent the overall trend.

#### 4.2 Check for Incomplete Enumeration <FE>
- There is no enumeration of possibilities given in the string, so this defective type does not apply in this particular instance.

#### 4.3 Check for Inconclusive Reason <IR>
- Since no reason <R> is provided within the given string, it would be speculative to deem the reason conclusive or inconclusive. However, by its format alone, it lacks evidence or reasoning to substantiate the claim made.

#### 4.4 Check for Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>
- Again, due to the absence of any reason <R>, we cannot judge its causal basis as insufficient. The statement lacks a causal basis altogether.

#### 4.5 Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>
- There isn't a redundancy of the proposition stated as the reason, as no reason is provided. Thus, this type does not apply.

#### 4.6 Check for Presumptuous Consensus <FU>
- The statement does not explicitly claim a universal consensus or agreement of the assertion "No global warming happening." Therefore, this doesn't apply either.

#### 4.7 Check for Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>
- The statement is clear in asserting "No global warming happening." There's no ambiguous language that could be taken in another sense than intended.

### Step 5: Summarize and Classify <s>
Based on our analysis, the most fitting classification for the string "SM 7: No global warming happening" is:

- **Generalization <G>**: The statement "No global warming happening" is a strong assertion likely based on limited or selective observations rather than a comprehensive evaluation of global climate trends.

### Final Classification:
- The defective argument type of the statement "SM 7: No global warming happening" is **Generalization (<G>)**.
