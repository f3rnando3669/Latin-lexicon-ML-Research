For 
To apply IDAA (the application of the decomposition of a task into specific steps) to IDA (the task of classifying the string as one of the defective argument types) for the string "Everyone else believes it, so it must be true," we need to break down the process into specific steps and then execute those steps.

### Decomposition of the Task (D):
1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine what is being asserted or intended to be proved in the string.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Determine the causal basis or reason given in the string to support the proposition.
3. **Assess the Reason (R)**: Evaluate the nature and strength of the reason to see if it falls into any defective argument categories.
4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**: Based on the analysis, classify the string as one of the identified defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Application of Decomposition to the Task (IDAA):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - **String:** "Everyone else believes it, so it must be true."
   - **Proposition (P):** "It must be true."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - **Reason (R):** "Everyone else believes it."

3. **Assess the Reason (R)**:
   - The reason given is that the proposition is true based on the belief of everyone else. 

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**:
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This can be ruled out because the reason does not directly fail to demonstrate correctness but instead appeals to consensus.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This is weak since the basis given (everyone else's belief) does not sufficiently establish truth and may not be compelling.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This appears to be the appropriate classification. The argument assumes that because there is a universal or majority belief, the proposition must be true, which is an appeal to mass belief or consensus.

Based on the analysis, the string "Everyone else believes it, so it must be true" is classified as a defective argument type <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).
