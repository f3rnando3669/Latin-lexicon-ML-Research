For 
**Step-by-Step Decomposition of the Task <IDA> (Classifying the Defective Arguments) for the Given Statement:**

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - In the given statement, Alex asserts, "More than 80% of university professors are voting against the Republicans. Clearly, it's the only intelligent vote to make."
   - Here, the <P> could be interpreted as: "The only intelligent vote to make is against the Republicans."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The Reason provided by Alex is: "More than 80% of university professors are voting against the Republicans."
   - This <R> is intended to establish the truth of the <P>.

3. **Identify if there is a Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - In the given statement, there doesn't appear to be an additional corroborating argument (<PR>) beyond Alex's initial statement.
   
4. **Classify the Argument Type:**

   **Analyze the Reason (<R>):**
   - The Reason given is based on the voting habits of "more than 80% of university professors." 
   - We need to determine if this Reason conclusively supports the Proposition (<P>).

**Determine Defective Argument Type:**

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The <R> involves a statement about 80% of university professors.
   - If Alex is asserting that because most university professors are voting against Republicans, everyone should, this reasoning is a generalization.
   - Generalization would imply assuming what applies to university professors should apply universally to all voters. This fits the structure of <G>.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - There's no indication that Alex is making a complete enumeration of possibilities. This doesn't seem to fit <FE>.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The <R> does not conclusively demonstrate that voting against Republicans is the “only intelligent vote.”
   - It only provides evidence from a specific group (university professors), but this does not conclusively prove the Proposition.
   - This fits the criteria for <IR>.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The causal basis given is that professors are voting in a certain way. This doesn't necessarily mean it's the "only intelligent" choice, but rather suggests a correlation.
   - The causal basis isn't strong enough for the universal claim of "the only intelligent vote."
   - This fits <WCB>.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - The Reason given is not a repetition of the Proposition, so <RR> does not fit in this case.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - There isn't an explicit statement that it's universally agreed upon, rather it's suggesting that the majority view of professors should be followed.
   - This does not perfectly fit <FU>, though it hints at consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - There is no ambiguous language that would change the intended meaning in Alex's statement so <DEP> does not apply.

**Final Classification:**

The argument can be classified as a combination of the following defective argument types:

- **<G>** (Generalization): As it implies that because most professors are voting against Republicans, it's a universally intelligent choice.
- **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason): The Reason given that professors are voting a certain way doesn’t conclusively establish that it's the only intelligent choice.
- **<WCB>** (Insufficient Causal Basis): The causal link between professors' votes and the "intelligent" nature of the vote is weak.

Thus, applying <IDAA> to Alex’s statement, we identify the defective argument as a mix of <G>, <IR>, and <WCB>.
