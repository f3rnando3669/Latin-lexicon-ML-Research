For 
To apply IDAA (decomposition of an advanced task into specific steps) to IDA (the classification of a string as a specific type of defective argument) for the string "Lots of people bought this album, so it must be good.", we need to break down the task and analyze each step carefully:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>) in the Argument
- **Proposition (<P>):** "it must be good"
- **Reason (<R>):** "Lots of people bought this album"

### Step 2: Analyze the Structure of the Argument
We need to determine if there is a Proof of Reason (<PR>), although it may not always be explicitly present in simpler arguments. In this case, there isn't an explicit additional argument provided to support the reason, so we proceed without a <PR>.

### Step 3: Evaluate the Types of Defective Arguments
We will compare the argument against the types of defective arguments defined:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** This argument does involve taking the behavior of a group of people and making a claim based on that. It may suggest a form of generalization, but let's check other definitions to be thorough.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This defect involves claiming a complete set of possibilities but missing some. The argument doesn't enumerate possibilities, so this doesn't apply.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This defect involves a reason that doesn't conclusively support the proposition. The argument claims that because many people bought the album, the album must be good. This is not necessarily conclusive; popularity does not equate to quality directly.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The reasoning here relies on a causal link between the number of purchases and the album’s quality. This causal basis (popularity equals quality) can be considered weak and not compelling since there could be other reasons for the album's popularity not related to its quality.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This involves the reason repeating the proposition in different words. In this argument, the reason and the proposition are not the same, so this defect doesn't apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This assumes something is universally agreed upon. The argument doesn’t claim universal agreement about the album’s quality; it infers quality from buying behavior, so it doesn’t apply here.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** This involves a proof that can be interpreted differently than intended. This argument is straightforward without significant ambiguity, so this defect doesn't apply.

### Step 4: Assess the Best Fit Defective Argument Types
Based on the analysis above, two types seem relevant:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason "Lots of people bought this album" does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition "it must be good".
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The reasoning here involves a weak causal basis: popularity does not necessarily ensure quality.

### Conclusion
While both <IR> and <WCB> could apply, <IR> seems to best capture the essence of the deficiency because it directly addresses the inconclusiveness of the reason provided.

So, the string "Lots of people bought this album, so it must be good." can best be classified as having the defect type:

**<IR> (Inconclusive Reason).**
