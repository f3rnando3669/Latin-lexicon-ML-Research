Sure, let's decompose the task of classifying the given string using argument defect types step by step. Here, our goal is to apply the decomposition of the classification task into specific steps (<IDAA>) to the argument in the string provided. 

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Analyze the string to find the main claim or assertion that is being made.
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Look for the causal basis or supporting reason provided for the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Look for any additional arguments or evidence that supports the reason.

4. **Evaluate against defect types:**
   - Compare the identified parts of the argument with the definitions of the various defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Applying the Steps to the Provided String:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition in the string: "*Our team needs to purchase Apple watches for everyone.*"

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason in the string: "*All professional athletes use Apple watches to track their training.*"
   
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - In this string, there is no additional argument or evidence provided to support the reason, so we can consider <PR> as missing or implicit.

4. **Evaluate against defect types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>):**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** 
     - The argument makes a sweeping statement (*All professional athletes use Apple watches to track their training*), which could be a generalization without sufficient evidence to support that it applies to all professional athletes.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** 
     - The argument does not enumerate all possibilities. For example, it doesn't consider other types of watches or training methods that professional athletes might use.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** 
     - The reason does not necessarily demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. Even if many professional athletes use Apple watches, it doesn't imply that *our team absolutely needs Apple watches*.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
     - The reason here is not a repetition of the proposition; hence this type does not apply.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
     - The causal basis might be considered weak as it doesn't show a compelling link between what other athletes use and the necessity for our team to follow suit.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
     - The argument assumes a consensus (all professional athletes use Apple watches) which may not be universally agreed upon or true.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
     - The argument does not present ambiguity in the language used.

### Conclusion:
After evaluating the argument against the defect types, the string "All professional athletes use Apple watches to track their training, so our team needs to purchase Apple watches for everyone," primarily falls under the type:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: Because it asserts that all professional athletes use Apple watches, leading to a conclusion that may not be warranted.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Because the reason linking Apple watch usage by other athletes to necessity for our team isn't compelling.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Because it fails to consider other possible scenarios or alternatives.

Thus, the argument can be classified under these defective argument types.
