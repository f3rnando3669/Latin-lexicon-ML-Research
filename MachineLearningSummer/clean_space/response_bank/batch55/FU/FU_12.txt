For 
To apply the task IDAA to the given argument ("An opinion article in a campus newspaper states that in an all-campus survey 95% of students think that tuition should be lowered and therefore tuition should be lowered immediately"), we will decompose IDA into specific steps, applying each step to classify the defect type of the argument.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) and Application to the Argument

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**
   - **Proposition:** Tuition should be lowered immediately.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**
   - **Reason:** 95% of the students surveyed think that tuition should be lowered.

3. **Determine if the <R> is a valid causal basis for <P> (Check for WCB)**
   - Analysis: The reason given (students' opinion) is not a strong causal basis for the actual decision to lower tuition. Factors such as financial implications, institutional budgeting, and educational quality need to be considered, which are not addressed by merely presenting student opinion.
   - Conclusion: This indicates a potential <WCB> — Insufficient Causal Basis.

4. **Check if <R> is just a repetition of <P> (Check for RR)**
   - Analysis: The reason is not just a repetition of the proposition; it does provide new information (student opinions).
   - Conclusion: No evidence of <RR> — Faulty Repetition of Proposition.

5. **Check if the argument involves a generalization from an incomplete set or sample (Check for G)**
   - Analysis: The survey might represent a substantial majority, but it uses the students' opinions to make a definitive decision about tuition without considering the input from other stakeholders (faculty, administration, financial experts).
   - Conclusion: This suggests a <G> — Generalization.

6. **Determine if the argument claims to have covered all possibilities but misses some (Check for FE)**
   - Analysis: The argument does not discuss all relevant factors and stakeholders involved in tuition decisions.
   - Conclusion: This may also be indicative of <FE> — Incomplete Enumeration.

7. **Assess if the reason does not conclusively prove the proposition (Check for IR)**
   - Analysis: The opinion of students alone doesn't conclusively prove that tuition should be lowered immediately.
   - Conclusion: This suggests <IR> — Inconclusive Reason.

8. **Check if the argument presumes a consensus without evidence (Check for FU)**
   - Analysis: The argument does not claim universal agreement; it specifies a survey result.
   - Conclusion: There is no evidence of <FU> — Presumptuous Consensus.

9. **Determine if ambiguous language might lead to misunderstandings (Check for DEP)**
   - Analysis: The language used ("should be lowered immediately") is straightforward without apparent ambiguity.
   - Conclusion: There is no evidence of <DEP> — Ambiguous Language Use.

### Classification

Based on the applied steps:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reason (student opinion) is not a compelling enough basis for the proposition (lowering tuition).
- **Generalization (G):** The argument generalizes student opinion to apply to the entire decision-making process.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument misses out on pertinent factors and stakeholder considerations necessary for making tuition decisions.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason provided does not conclusively lead to the proposition.

Thus, the argument can be classified as exhibiting defects of type <WCB>, <G>, <FE>, and <IR>.
