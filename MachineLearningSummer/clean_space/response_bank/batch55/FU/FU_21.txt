For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task IDA into specific steps) to classify the argument "The new iPhone comes out this weekend! If you don't get it, you're not cool!", we need to follow these systematic steps:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**
Identify what is summarily being set forth to be proven in the argument.
- Proposition (<P>): "If you don't get the new iPhone, you're not cool."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**
Determine the causal basis offered for the Proposition.
- Reason (<R>): Implicitly, the reason is "not having the new iPhone means you are not cool."

**Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**
Check any supporting evidence or arguments provided to corroborate the Reason.
- Proof of Reason (<PR>): This argument does not explicitly provide a Proof of Reason; it largely rests on an implied social consensus.

**Step 4: Determine if the Argument is Defective (Identify Defective Argument Types)**
Compare the identified <P>, <R>, and <PR> against the definitions of defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

Let's evaluate each type:

1. **<G> Generalization:** The argument does not generalize based on an unrepresentative sample; it asserts a specific condition (not having the iPhone) leads to an outcome (not cool).
   
2. **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:** The argument does not enumerate possibilities; it directly connects owning an iPhone to being cool.
   
3. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** The reason provided ("not having the new iPhone means you are not cool") does not conclusively prove the proposition. The link between owning an iPhone and being "cool" is speculative without further evidence.
   
4. **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** The reason provided appears to be a repetition of the proposition itself in different words, indicating an overlap between <P> and <R> without substantial reasoning. This could fit.
   
5. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** The causal basis for associating an iPhone with being cool is weak; it relies on societal assumptions which are not examined or proven.
   
6. **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** The argument assumes that everyone universally agrees that having the new iPhone is necessary to be coolâ€”a thing still in dispute.
   
7. **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:** There is no significant ambiguity in terms of language use in this particular argument.

**Step 5: Conclude the Classification**
Pick the most fitting defect type based on the evaluation.

Based on our analysis:
- **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason) applies because the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the <P>.
- **<RR>** (Faulty Repetition of Proposition) applies because the <R> echoes the <P> without substantial added reasoning.
- **<WCB>** (Insufficient Causal Basis) applies due to the weak and speculative causal link.
- **<FU>** (Presumptuous Consensus) applies because the argument assumes a universal agreement that is still debatable.

**Final Classification:**
The argument "The new iPhone comes out this weekend! If you don't get it, you're not cool!" exhibits elements of **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason), <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis), and <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**.
