For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a defective argument) to the string "assumes that if many people act or believe a certain way, it must be the right way," we need to decompose the task of identifying the defect in the argument step by step. 

Step 1: Understand the components of the argument in the string.
- Identify the implied Proposition <P>, Reason <R>, and Proof of Reason <PR> within the string.
- Proposition <P>: "It must be the right way."
- Reason <R>: "If many people act or believe a certain way."

Step 2: Compare the identified components with the definitions of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).
- Generalization (<G>): Not applicable here as the argument is not generalizing from a part to the whole.
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>): Not applicable as the argument doesn't involve an enumeration of possibilities.
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>): Not directly applicable as we need to check if the reason is inherently weak.
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>): Not applicable as the Reason is different from the Proposition.
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>): Could be considered but not strongly tied to the form of "many people act or believe".
- Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>): Applicable here since the argument relies on the assumption that the belief or action of the majority necessarily makes it right, without further proof.
- Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>): Not applicable since the argument doesn't hinge on language ambiguity.

Step 3: Determine the most suitable defective argument type.
- The most suitable type of argument defect based on our analysis is Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>).

Step 4: Final verification to ensure correctness.
- Check the definition of <FU> again: "a <PR> is assumed as certain, on the ground that 'it is universally agreed upon,' a thing which is still in dispute."
- The argument string fits this definition as it assumes correctness based on the majority's belief or action.

Conclusion: Based on the decomposed steps and analysis, the string "assumes that if many people act or believe a certain way, it must be the right way" is classified as a defective argument of type <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).
