For 
To apply the process <IDAA> to the string "use of people's desire to be part of the group to convince them", we will decompose the advanced task <IDA> (the task of classifying the string as one of the defective argument types) into specific steps. Here is the step-by-step decomposition and application:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
The first step is to discern what is being proposed or intended to be proven in the argument. In this case, the proposition seems to be the idea that "using people's desire to be part of the group can convince them."

### Step 2: Determine the Reason <R>
Next, we identify the reason that is presented to support the proposition. Here, the causal basis for the proposition appears to be "people's desire to be part of the group."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason <PR>
We need to identify any additional arguments or corroborations that support the reason. In this case, the string doesn't provide additional arguments or corroborations; it simply states the proposition and the reason.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type
We then compare the argument against the various types of defective arguments defined. Let’s analyze the possible classifications:

- **<G> Generalization:** This argument doesn't seem to be making a broad assertion based on limited data, so it may not fit this type directly.
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:** There isn't an enumeration of possibilities in the argument, so this type doesn't seem to apply.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** To determine this, we need to ask if the reason "people's desire to be part of the group" conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the proposition "using this desire can convince them." The reason doesn't necessarily conclusively prove the proposition, so this might fit.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** This defective argument occurs when the reason isn't compelling. The reason here could be considered weak because just because people have a desire to be part of a group doesn’t necessarily imply it will be a strong basis for convincing them in every context. This is a possible fit.
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** The reason given does not simply repeat the proposition, so this does not apply.
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** There is not an assumed universal agreement in this string, so this doesn’t apply.
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:** While the term "desire to be part of the group" could have different interpretations, it does not appear strongly ambiguous, making this classification less likely.

### Step 5: Conclude the Classification
Based on the analysis, the defective argument type that best fits the string "use of people's desire to be part of the group to convince them" appears to be either <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) or <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis). 

- <IR> indicates that the reason provided does not conclusively establish the correctness of the proposition.
- <WCB> suggests that the reason or causal basis offered is insufficient or not compelling.

Given the context, <WCB> may be the more precise classification since it directly challenges the strength and compelability of the causal basis.

**Final Classification: <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**

Thus, the argument "use of people's desire to be part of the group to convince them" is classified as an <WCB> type defective argument within the defined framework.
