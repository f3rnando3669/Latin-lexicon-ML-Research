For 
To apply IDAA to the given exchange between the parent and child concerning smoking pot, we need to decompose the task of identifying the defective argument into specific steps. We will analyze the argument and identify any potential defects using the defined categories.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition <D> of <IDA>:

1. **Identify Propositions (<P>):** Determine the statements being put forth as truth-claims.
2. **Identify Reasons (<R>):** Determine the causal basis or reasons provided to support each proposition.
3. **Check Proof of Reasons (<PR>):** Examine any additional arguments provided to corroborate the reasons.
4. **Identify Defective Arguments:** Check for potential defects in the arguments using the given types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), and Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

### Application of <IDAA> to the Given Exchange

#### Step 1: Identify Propositions (<P>)

- **Parent's Proposition (<P1>):** "I really don’t want you to smoke pot."
- **Child's Proposition (<P2>):** "You must not think it’s a big deal."

#### Step 2: Identify Reasons (<R>)

- **Parent's Reason (<R1>):** "It’s still illegal, and could get you into trouble."

  Here, the parent provides two reasons to support not smoking pot:
  - It is illegal.
  - It could lead to trouble.

- **Child's Reason (<R2>):** "Didn’t you smoke pot when you were my age?"

  The child implies that the parent's past actions negate the seriousness of the issue.

#### Step 3: Examine Proofs of Reasons (<PR>)

- For the parent's argument, there are no additional arguments (or proofs) provided for the reasons.
- For the child's argument, the reason (<R2>) is itself a challenge to the parent's authority based on their past actions, not additional proof.

#### Step 4: Identify Defective Arguments

**Parent’s Argument:**
- *Proposition (<P1>):* "I really don’t want you to smoke pot."
- *Reason (<R1>):* "It’s still illegal, and could get you into trouble."

This part of the argument appears logically sound and does not exhibit any of the defined defects.

**Child’s Argument:**
- *Proposition (<P2>):* "You must not think it’s a big deal."
- *Reason (<R2>):* "Didn’t you smoke pot when you were my age?"

The defect here is **Generalization (<G>)** combined with elements of **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**. The child implies that because the parent smoked pot as a teenager, the parent must think it’s not serious. This is a generalization from a single individual instance (the parent’s past behavior) and does not provide a strong causal relationship to the current advice being given. This argument is also defective because the child's reasoning is not a compelling causal basis to infer the proposition.

### Conclusion

By applying the decomposition task (D) to the identification task (IDA), the child's argument is classified as defective, specifically falling under:
- **Generalization (<G>):** Assuming that the parent's past action when they were younger represents their current opinion on the seriousness of smoking pot.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The child's reason does not provide a strong causal basis for the proposition that the parent does not consider smoking pot a big deal.
