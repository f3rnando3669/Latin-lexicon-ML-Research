For 
Applying IDAA to classify the given string as one of the defective argument types:

**Step 1: Decompose the Task <t> into Specific Steps <D>**

The task here is to identify the defective argument type <IDA> of the given string. The decomposition steps involve:
1. Analyze the provided string and identify the Proposition <P>.
2. Identify the Reason <R> provided to support <P>.
3. Ascertain if there is a Proof of Reason <PR>, and analyze it.
4. Evaluate the argument based on the definitions provided:
   - Generalization (<G>)
   - Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
   - Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
   - Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
   - Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
   - Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)

**Step 2: Apply the Decomposition to the Specific Task <IDA>**

Let's analyze the provided string in detail:

1. **Identify Proposition <P>**: 
   - "the moon’s core is filled with spare ribs."
2. **Identify Reason <R>**:
   - "we have proven that the moon is not made of spare ribs, we have not proven that its core cannot be filled with them."
3. **Ascertain Proof of Reason <PR>**:
   - There isn’t an explicit <PR> provided in the string.

**Step 3: Evaluate the Argument:**

Given the analysis above, let’s identify which defective argument type the provided string falls under:

1. **Generalization (G)**: It does not seem to assert something about a part or majority and then generalize to all, so it’s unlikely a Generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: It doesn’t seem to claim a complete list of possibilities while missing out on some, so it doesn’t seem to be Incomplete Enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The Reason provided does not conclusively support the Proposition. The assertion that we have not disproven something does not logically lead to it being true. This sounds like an Inconclusive Reason.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There’s also a weak causal connection since the lack of disproof doesn’t imply truth. This might also suggest Insufficient Causal Basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The Reason given doesn’t simply repeat the Proposition, so this doesn’t fit.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There’s no claim about universal agreement, so it’s not a Presumptuous Consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: There doesn’t seem to be any ambiguity in the intended meaning, so Ambiguous Language Use doesn’t apply.

**Conclusion**: The string fits most strongly under **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, because it assumes that what has not been disproven is therefore true, which doesn’t conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.

Moreover, elements of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** are present due to the weak causal logic, but the primary issue seems to be the inconclusiveness of the reason.

**Step 4: Reporting the Result**

The given string "Although we have proven that the moon is not made of spare ribs, we have not proven that its core cannot be filled with them; therefore, the moon’s core is filled with spare ribs.
X is true because you cannot prove that X is false. X is false because you cannot prove that X is true." is primarily an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** argument.
