For 
To apply the task of decomposing the classification of a possibly defective argument, or IDAA, to the provided conversation, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Identify the parts of argument**: Determine if the conversation contains elements of a Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), or Proof of Reason (<PR>).

2. **Analyze the defective arguments**: Review each statement to classify potential defects such as Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

3. **Classify the string**: Based on the analysis, classify the overall argument as one or more of the defect types.

Letâ€™s break it down using these steps:

**Step 1: Identify parts of the argument in the conversation**
   
- **Person 1**: "We should argue with logic facts"
  - This is an assertion, possibly a Proposition (<P>). It suggests what should be done in an argument.
  
- **Person 2**: "You should grow a brain before you open your mouth"
  - This is more of an ad hominem attack and does not present a real Reason (<R>), Proof of Reason (<PR>), or address the initial Proposition (<P>).

**Step 2: Analyze the defective arguments**
   
- **Person 1**'s statement does not specify any particular defect but implies the need for rational discussion.
- **Person 2**'s response seems to dismiss the original proposition without providing any logical counter-argument or reason. It doesn't fit well into the formal categories of defective arguments listed but instead may demonstrate a form of defective reasoning not specifically outlined: an ad hominem fallacy. Since our predefined defective argument types do not account for ad hominem, we might classify this:
  - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: as Person 2 doesn't provide a valid reason that relates to the Proposition.
  - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: since Person 2 shifts the discussion to a personal attack rather than addressing the initial claim about arguing with logic and facts.

**Step 3: Classify the string**
   
Based on the analysis, the string could be classified as:
- **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason)
- **<RR>** (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)

### Conclusion:
The conversation can be classified under <IR> because Person 2's response does not address or refute Person 1's Proposition with a related logical reason. Additionally, we may also consider it <RR> since the response deviates from addressing the Proposition and instead targets the individual, although this point may be less clear-cut in this context. 

Thus, the string "person 1: 'We should argue with logic facts' person 2: 'You should grow a brain before you open your mouth'" is classified as having <IR> or possibly <RR>, but more definitively <IR>.
