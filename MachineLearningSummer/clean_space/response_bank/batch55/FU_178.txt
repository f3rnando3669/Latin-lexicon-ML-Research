To apply IDAA to the given string, we will follow the steps involved in decomposing the task of <IDA>, which is the classification of defective arguments. The string to be analyzed is:

"Mormonism is one of the fastest growing sects of Christianity today so that whole story about Joseph Smith getting the golden plates that, unfortunately, disappeared back into heaven, must be true!"

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** 
   The assertion or statement being put forth for proof.
   - In this case, <P> is: "the whole story about Joseph Smith getting the golden plates that, unfortunately, disappeared back into heaven, must be true."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   The causal basis for the Proposition, setting forth the reason why the Proposition is established as true.
   - Here, <R> is: "Mormonism is one of the fastest growing sects of Christianity today."

3. **Examine the structure and content to detect defective argument types:**
   - Check if the Reason (<R>) provides a valid causal basis for the Proposition (<P>).
   - Check if there are any obvious logical fallacies or weaknesses in the argument.

4. **Classify the defective argument type:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** Is <P> a broad assertion based on a part or majority but not all? 
     - No, <P> is a specific claim rather than a broad generalization.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Does <P> claim a complete set but miss out on some?
     - No, <P> does not involve enumeration of possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Does <R> fail to conclusively demonstrate <P>?
     - Yes, the fact that Mormonism is growing quickly does not necessarily prove the historical claim about Joseph Smith and the golden plates.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Is the causal basis for <P> weak?
     - Yes, the growth of a religious sect does not serve as strong evidence for the truth of its foundational stories.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Does <R> simply repeat <P>?
     - No, <R> introduces new information unrelated to <P>.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Does <PR> assume a consensus that is in dispute?
     - No, there is no claim of universal agreement in the argument provided.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Can <PR> be taken in another sense unintended by the speaker?
     - No, <PR> does not seem to involve ambiguous language in a way that changes the intended sense.

After careful analysis, the defective argument types identified in the string are:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**

Thus, the string "Mormonism is one of the fastest growing sects of Christianity today so that whole story about Joseph Smith getting the golden plates that, unfortunately, disappeared back into heaven, must be true!" can be classified as containing <IR> and <WCB>.
