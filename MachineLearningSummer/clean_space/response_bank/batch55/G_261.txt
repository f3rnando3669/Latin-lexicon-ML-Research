For 
To apply **IDAA** to the task of classifying the argument "When someone says that what is true of something as a whole must also be true of each of its parts" as one of the defective argument types, we will follow these decomposed steps:

1. **Understand the Argument (Identify <s>)**:
   - `<s>`: "When someone says that what is true of something as a whole must also be true of each of its parts."

2. **Break Down the Argument (Analyze <s>)**:
   - Proposition (P): "What is true of something as a whole must also be true of each of its parts."
   - This is a general assertion about the relationship between the whole and its parts. 

3. **Identify the Nature of the Defect in the Argument**:
   - Determine whether the argument is a defective form based on the types provided: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

4. **Classify the Argument (Identify the Defect Type)**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: This does not seem to fit as it doesn’t generalize from a subset to a whole set.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not fail to list possibilities but rather assumes a property transfer from whole to parts.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument seems more specific than a generic inconclusive reason.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument does not provide a weak causal basis; rather, it asserts a type of relation between parts and whole.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: It does not just repeat the proposition; it asserts a property about parts based on the whole.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument does not rely on a consensus or a widely agreed notion.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: There does not appear to be ambiguous language in the assertion.

Given the above analysis, this argument fits best with the defective argument type of:

**Have a Defect related to the logical fallacy of Division**.

This is because the reasoning assumes that what is true for the whole must also be true for its parts, which is an incorrect assumption and thus a particular form of <IR>—Inconclusive Reason.

**Conclusion**:
   - The argument type "<s>" should be categorized as <IR> due to an inherent logical fallacy in assuming that properties of a whole must apply to its parts.

Revisiting the steps:
1. Identify <s>.
2. Analyze the components of <s> (P and its reasoning).
3. Evaluate against each defective type: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>.
4. Conclude and classify accurately based on the identified defect.

Applying <IDAA>: 
The string <s> "When someone says that what is true of something as a whole must also be true of each of its parts" is classified as <IR> due to an inconclusive reason assumption in the argument.
