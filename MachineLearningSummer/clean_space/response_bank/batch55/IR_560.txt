For 
To apply the IDAA (the decomposition of the IDA task into specific steps) to the given string, "In order to really look at the problem of global warming, we must first consider how the homeless suffer when it is cold," we will break down the IDAA into its specific steps and systematically classify the string into one of the defective argument types. Here is the step-by-step decomposition:

### Step 1: Identify and Understand the Proposition ( <P> ) and the Reason ( <R> )
1. **Proposition ( <P> ):**
   - The statement we intend to prove or assert. In this case, <P> is "In order to really look at the problem of global warming."
   
2. **Reason ( <R> ):**
   - The causal basis or supporting statement for the proposition. In this case, <R> is "we must first consider how the homeless suffer when it is cold."

### Step 2: Evaluate the Relationship Between <P> and <R>
3. **Establish if <R> Supports <P>:**
   - Assess if the reason given logically and causally supports the proposition. 
   - Question: Does considering how the homeless suffer when it is cold logically help in understanding the problem of global warming?

### Step 3: Classify the Argument Based on Recognized Defective Types
4. **Generalization ( <G> ):**
   - Check if the proposition is based on some part or majority but is applied to all.
   - Not applicable here, as the proposition does not generalize.

5. **Incomplete Enumeration ( <FE> ):**
   - Check if the proposition claims complete enumeration but omits possibilities.
   - Not applicable here, as the argument does not claim to enumerate possibilities.

6. **Inconclusive Reason ( <IR> ):**
   - Check if the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
   - This seems potentially applicable; evaluating if <R> conclusively establishes <P> is crucial.

7. **Insufficient Causal Basis ( <WCB> ):**
   - Check if the reason is submitted without a compelling causal basis.
   - This also seems relevant. Is considering the suffering of the homeless when cold a compelling basis to address global warming?

8. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition ( <RR> ):**
   - Check if the reason is essentially a repetition of the proposition.
   - Not applicable here, as <R> is not a repetition of <P>.

9. **Presumptuous Consensus ( <FU> ):**
   - Check if the reason assumes a universally agreed claim that is still in dispute.
   - Not applicable; there is no consensus assumption.

10. **Ambiguous Language Use ( <DEP> ):**
    - Check if the language used in the proof or reason is ambiguous.
    - Ambiguity does not seem the primary issue here.

### Step 4: Selection of the Most Suitable Classification
11. **Decision:**
    - The statement "we must first consider how the homeless suffer when it is cold" does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of "In order to really look at the problem of global warming."
    - Additionally, there is clearly an insufficiency in the causal basis, as the suffering of the homeless due to cold weather does not directly relate to global warming's broader systemic issues.

### Conclusion:
The most fitting classification for the given argument string "In order to really look at the problem of global warming, we must first consider how the homeless suffer when it is cold." from the defective argument types is:
- **Inconclusive Reason ( <IR> )** because the reason provided does not conclusively support the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis ( <WCB> )** because the causal link between the suffering of the homeless in cold weather and understanding global warming is weak and not compelling.

Thus, this string can be classified under <IR> and <WCB>.
