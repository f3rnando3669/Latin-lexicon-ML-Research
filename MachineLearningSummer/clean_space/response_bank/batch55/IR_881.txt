For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of <D> to the task of <IDA>), we'll break down the task of classifying the given string into specific steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine the main assertion that is being set forth to be proved.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the causal basis or reasoning presented to support the Proposition.
3. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types**: Evaluate the relationship between the Proposition and the Reason for the known defective argument types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), and Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

Now, let's apply these steps to the string: "I cannot get a job because the public education system failed me; I have to steal to survive. It is society's fault, not mine."

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The main assertion set forth in the string.
- Proposition (P): "I cannot get a job... It is society's fault, not mine."
  - The individual claims they cannot get a job and blames society for their situation.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The causal basis provided to support the Proposition.
- Reason (R): "The public education system failed me; I have to steal to survive."
  - The individual claims that the failure of the public education system has led them to steal to survive.

### Step 3: Analyze for Defective Argument Types
Now, evaluate if the argument contains any of the defective types.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Is the Proposition based on an assertion about a part or majority applied to all?
   - Not applicable. The Proposition singles out the individual's situation, not a generalization about all people.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Does the argument miss out on other possible reasons or factors?
   - Applicable. The Proposition and Reason suggest that the only cause of the inability to get a job and need to steal is the failure of the public education system, without considering other factors (e.g., personal effort, job market conditions, etc.).

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Does the Reason fail to conclusively prove the Proposition?
   - Applicable. The Reason (the failure of the public education system) does not conclusively prove why the individual cannot get a job or why they must resort to stealingâ€”there could be many other factors involved.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Is the causal basis weak or not compelling?
   - Applicable. The assertion that the failure of the public education system is a weak causal basis for the inability to get a job; it is not a compelling or exhaustive explanation.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Does the Reason repeat the Proposition?
   - Not applicable. The Reason does provide additional information rather than repeating the Proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Is there an assumption that something is universally agreed upon without evidence?
   - Not applicable. No claim is made about universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Is there ambiguity in the language that may lead to misinterpretation?
   - Potentially applicable. The terms "failed me" and "society's fault" could be interpreted in various ways, requiring further clarification.

### Conclusion
The string can be classified under the following defective argument types:
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not consider other possible causes.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The Reason provided does not conclusively prove the Proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis is weak and not compelling.
- **Potentially Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Some terms can be interpreted ambiguously.

Thus, the given string most fittingly exemplifies a combination of <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, and possibly <DEP> types of defective arguments.
