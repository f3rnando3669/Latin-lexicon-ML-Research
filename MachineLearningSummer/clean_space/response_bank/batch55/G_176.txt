Sure! Let's apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the given string as one of the defective argument types. We'll decompose the task of classifying defective arguments into specific steps.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of the Classification Task (<IDA>) for the Given String

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - **String**: "This crash will likely damage the reputation of Malaysia Airlines, which will hurt the tourism industry of Malaysia and ruin their economy."
   - **Proposition (<P>)**: The primary claim is that "This crash will likely damage the reputation of Malaysia Airlines, which will hurt the tourism industry of Malaysia and ruin their economy."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>) supporting the Proposition:**
   - **Reason (<R>)**: The reason given is that the crash will damage the reputation of Malaysia Airlines. This damage to the airline's reputation is proposed to lead to negative consequences for the tourism industry and the economy as a whole.

3. **Evaluate the Reason (<R>) for the following possible defects:**
   - **Generalization (G):** Check if the assertion is based on a single or majority instance but is generalized to all cases.
     - **Analysis**: The string doesn’t explicitly generalize from a single instance; it predicts a chain of events based on the crash.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Check if there are any missing possibilities in the claim.
     - **Analysis**: The argument doesn't rely on enumerating all possibilities; it suggests a specific sequence of consequences.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Check if the Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.
     - **Analysis**: The reason that the crash will damage the airline's reputation and, in turn, hurt tourism and the economy, seems speculative and lacks conclusive evidence.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Check if the causal link proposed is weak.
     - **Analysis**: The link between the crash and the final outcome on the economy seems weak without further evidence that a crash would have such far-reaching effects.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Check if the Reason merely repeats the Proposition in different words.
     - **Analysis**: The Reason does not merely repeat the Proposition; it provides a supposed causal sequence.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Check if the argument presumes consensus without evidence.
     - **Analysis**: The argument doesn’t rely on a presumed consensus; it makes a predictive claim.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Check if ambiguous language could lead to multiple interpretations.
     - **Analysis**: The language is fairly clear, though speculative.

4. **Determine the most applicable defect type:**
   - Based on the above analysis, the two most relevant defect types are:
     - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal link proposed is weak and not compelling.

### Final Classification

The string "This crash will likely damage the reputation of Malaysia Airlines, which will hurt the tourism industry of Malaysia and ruin their economy." can be classified as:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The Reason given does not conclusively demonstrate that the crash will cause all the predicted outcomes.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal chain from the crash to the ruin of the economy is weak without additional evidence.

Thus, the string exhibits both **<IR> and <WCB>** characteristics.
