To apply the task of IDAA (decomposition of the task of classifying a string as a defective argument) to the statement "It was observed that persons who went out at night often developed the malady. So night air was assumed to be the cause of malaria, and elaborate precautions were taken to shut it out of sleeping quarters," we need to break this down into specific steps and then classify the string.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDA into IDAA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P) and Reason (R):**
   - **Proposition (P):** Night air was assumed to be the cause of malaria.
   - **Reason (R):** It was observed that persons who went out at night often developed the malady.

2. **Analyze Potential Defective Argument Types:**

   - **Generalization (G):** Is P based on an assertion from some individuals or a majority, not necessarily all?
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Does P claim a complete enumeration of possibilities, but actually miss some pertinent ones?
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does R fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of P?
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is R weak because the causal basis it submits for P is not compelling?
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Does R merely repeat P in a different form?
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Is PR assumed as certain based on an alleged universal agreement that is actually in dispute?
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Can PR be taken in another sense than intended?

3. **Evaluate the Nature of the Reason (R) – "It was observed that persons who went out at night often developed the malady":**

   - This is an observation but doesn't conclusively demonstrate that night air is the cause of malaria. Other factors could be at play, such as mosquitoes which are active at night.

4. **Assess Each Defective Argument against the Statement:**

   - **Generalization (G):** Not applicable. The argument does not generalize based on inadequate or biased sample.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable. The argument does not list all possible causes to claim completeness.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Applicable. The reason given (observing people developing a malady at night) does not conclusively demonstrate night air as the cause.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Applicable. The causal relationship between night air and malaria is weak or unfounded; the observation doesn’t provide a compelling causal link.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Not applicable. The reason is not a repetition of the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Not applicable. There’s no mention of universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Not applicable. The language used (night air causing malaria) is not ambiguous but rather incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The string "It was observed that persons who went out at night often developed the malady. So night air was assumed to be the cause of malaria, and elaborate precautions were taken to shut it out of sleeping quarters" can be classified under:
   
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the reason given does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because the causal basis submitted for the proposition (night air causing malaria) is not compelling and is weak.

So, the IDAA for the given string results in the classification of the string as containing defective arguments of types **IR** and **WCB**.
