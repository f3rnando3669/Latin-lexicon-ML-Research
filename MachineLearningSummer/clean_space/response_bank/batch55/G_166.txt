For 
To apply IDAA to the given string "Mrs. Miller taught your older brother, who was the class clown. She decides to be strict with you from the very first day of class because she thinks you will be a clown, too.", we will decompose the task of classifying the string as a specific defective argument type into specific steps.

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Proposition (P): Mrs. Miller decides to be strict with you from the very first day of class.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Reason (R): Because she taught your older brother, who was the class clown, and thinks you will be a clown too.

3. **Determine if additional arguments strengthen the Reason (PR):**
   - In this case, the argument only relies on the comparison with the older brother; no additional corroborative arguments are provided, so we don’t need to identify PR here.

4. **Classify the argument as one of the defective types:**

   - **Generalization (G):** This occurs if the proposition is an assertion based on a part or majority but not necessarily applicable to all. In this case, Mrs. Miller extrapolates your behavior based on your older brother’s behavior.
  
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This would be a case where the argument presumes a complete enumeration of possibilities but misses out on some pertinent ones. This does not seem to be the case here.
  
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** If the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. This may partially apply, as the behavior of the older brother doesn’t necessarily determine the younger sibling’s behavior conclusively.
  
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** If the causal basis submitted is not compelling, such as Mrs. Miller’s prior experience with the older brother not being strong enough to justify her assumption. This could also apply.
  
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This is when the reason repeats the proposition. This does not apply here.
  
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** If the argument claims universal agreement on something still in dispute. This does not apply to this context.
  
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** If the proof can be taken in another sense than was intended. This does not apply here.

5. **Determine the most fitting defective argument type:**
   Given the steps above, it appears that the argument is a case of **Generalization (G)**, as Mrs. Miller’s decision is based on the behavior of your older brother and assumes it will apply to you, without considering that your behavior might be different.

### Conclusion:
Applying IDAA to the given string suggests the defective argument type **Generalization (G)** best describes it.
