To apply IDAA (the task of decomposing IDA, the classification task, into specific steps) to the string "This makes you think you need to believe or buy something because everyone else is. Which technique is it?", follow these steps:

1. **Understand the String:**
   - Carefully read the given string and understand its content.
   - The string suggests a technique designed to persuade someone to believe or buy something because "everyone else is."

2. **Identify Potential Defective Argument Types:**
   - Recall the definitions of defective argument types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

3. **Analyze the Argument Type:**
   Based on the understanding of the string:
   - The phrase "because everyone else is" suggests the use of a consensus or majority opinion to persuade.
   - This implies that the argument is leveraging the idea that something is true or necessary simply because it is believed or acted upon by many people.

4. **Match the Argument Type to Definitions:**
   - **Generalization (G):** Refers to applying an assertion from a part to the whole.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Refers to claiming to have addressed all options while missing some.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Refers to the reason failing to conclusively demonstrate the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Refers to a weak causal basis for the proposition.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Occurs when the reason repeats the proposition without adding support.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Refers to assuming something is true because it is "universally agreed upon" although it may still be in dispute.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Refers to the proof being taken in another sense than intended.

5. **Select the Appropriate Defective Argument Type:**
   - The string specifically leverages a majority opinion to persuade.
   - This closely aligns with **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**, where the argument relies on an assumed universal agreement that is still disputed.

6. **Conclude the Classification:**
   - Based on the definitions and analysis, the defective argument type for the string "This makes you think you need to believe or buy something because everyone else is. Which technique is it?" is **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.

By breaking down the task into these steps (understanding, identifying potential types, analyzing, matching to definitions, and concluding), we applied IDAA to classify the statement as FU (Presumptuous Consensus).
