For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "I had this book that proved that leprechauns are real and have been empirically verified by scientists, but I lost it. I forgot the name of it as well -- and who the author was.", let's decompose the task of classifying the defective argument into several specific steps.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
Define the proposition that the argument is trying to assert. The proposition in this case is:
- Leprechauns are real and have been empirically verified by scientists.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Identify the reason for why the proposition is claimed to be true. The reason given in the argument is:
- There was a book that proved this.

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
Identify the proof provided for the reason. In this argument, the proof is:
- The speaker asserts they had the book but then mentions losing it and forgetting the details about it.

### Step 4: Analyze the Argument for Defective Types
Compare the argument against potential defective argument types.

#### **Type <G> - Generalization:** 
- **Analysis:** No, the argument doesn't use a generalization based on a small sample.

#### **Type <FE> - Incomplete Enumeration:**
- **Analysis:** No, the argument isn’t making a claim based on a faulty enumeration of possibilities.

#### **Type <IR> - Inconclusive Reason:**
- **Analysis:** Yes, the reason given (a book that supposedly proved the claim) is inconclusive, especially since the book cannot be verified.

#### **Type <WCB> - Insufficient Causal Basis:**
- **Analysis:** Yes, not only is the reason inconclusive because the proof (the book) cannot be verified, the book itself (had it been presented) would need strong empirical evidence to back such an extraordinary claim.

#### **Type <RR> - Faulty Repetition of Proposition:**
- **Analysis:** No, the reason provided isn’t just a restatement of the proposition.

#### **Type <FU> - Presumptuous Consensus:**
- **Analysis:** No, the argument does not mention or presuppose a universal agreement.

#### **Type <DEP> - Ambiguous Language Use:**
- **Analysis:** No, the argument does not rely on ambiguous language use.

### Step 5: Classify the Defective Argument
Based on the analysis, the argument falls into the following defective argument types:
- **<IR> - Inconclusive Reason**, because the reason provided does not conclusively support the proposition.
- **<WCB> - Insufficient Causal Basis**, because the causal support for the proposition (the book exists) is weak and unverifiable.

### Conclusion
The argument "I had this book that proved that leprechauns are real and have been empirically verified by scientists, but I lost it. I forgot the name of it as well -- and who the author was," is classified as involving both **<IR> - Inconclusive Reason** and **<WCB> - Insufficient Causal Basis** based on the decomposition and analysis conducted.
