For 
Certainly! Let's apply <IDAA> to the given string step by step.

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**
The proposition is the main statement or claim that the argument intends to prove. In this case, the proposition is:
"Mr. Equalminded's idea for implementing affirmative action in the university's admission process is complete folly."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**
The reason provides a causal basis for the proposition. In this case, the reason is:
"He says he wants the student body to represent diversity in the community."
This reason is then argued against by stating:
"I suppose this means we'll have to throw out our academic standards while we're at it."

**Step 3: Identify any Proof of Reasoning (<PR>)**
Proof of Reasoning corroborates the reason with additional arguments. In this case, the proof is:
"After all, if we're going to let students into our prestigious institution just because of their gender or the color of their skin, then what's going to happen to our reputation?"
This statement supports the reason by claiming that academic standards will be compromised and reputation harmed.

**Step 4: Classify the Argument's Type (<IDA>)**
We need to classify whether the argument is of type <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

Let's analyze the argument:
1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument does not contain an obvious generalization.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not attempt to enumerate all possible outcomes or reasons.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This could be a potential classification, as the reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate why Mr. Equalminded's proposal is folly.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This is also a potential classification, as the reason implies a weak causal basis for the proposition.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The reason does not repeat the proposition in a different form.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument does not claim a universal agreement.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The language used is not necessarily ambiguous to mislead.

**Step 5: Evaluate and Classify**
From the analysis, it's evident that the given argument could fall into both <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis). 

**Inconclusive Reason**:
The reason provided ("He says he wants the student body to represent diversity in the community") does not conclusively demonstrate why Mr. Equalminded's proposal is folly.

**Insufficient Causal Basis**:
The causal link between promoting diversity and the decline in academic standards and reputation is weak and not compelling.

**Final Classification:**
The argument is classified as both <IR> and <WCB>, with primary emphasis on <WCB> due to the weak causal basis. 

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the given string, we classify it primarily as <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) with a secondary classification of <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
