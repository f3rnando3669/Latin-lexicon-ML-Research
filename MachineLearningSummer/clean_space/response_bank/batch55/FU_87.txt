For 
To apply \( <IDAA> \) to the string "Susie bought a flip-phone, so all of her friends bought flip-phones," we need to classify the argument type \(<s>\) by decomposing the classification task (\( <IDA> \)) into specific steps (\( <D> \)). Here is the detailed decomposition and application process:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of \( <IDA> \) into \( <D> \):

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( <P> \))**:
    - Determine the main assertion or claim in the argument.
  
2. **Identify the Reason (\( <R> \))**:
    - Determine the causal basis or reasoning given to support the proposition.
  
3. **Evaluate the Argument to Identify Defect Type**:
    - **Check for Generalization (\( <G> \))**:
        - Does the proposition apply a characteristic of one or some individuals universally?
    - **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (\( <FE> \))**:
        - Does the argument claim to cover all possibilities but misses pertinent ones?
    - **Check for Inconclusive Reason (\( <IR> \))**:
        - Is the reason given insufficient to conclusively support the proposition?
    - **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (\( <WCB> \))**:
        - Is the causal reasoning provided weak or non-compelling?
    - **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( <RR> \))**:
        - Does the reason simply restate the proposition?
    - **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (\( <FU> \))**:
        - Is there an assumption of universal agreement on a point still in dispute?
    - **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (\( <DEP> \))**:
        - Is there a use of language that could be interpreted differently than intended?

### Application of \( <IDAA> \) to the Given String

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( <P> \))**: 
    - "All of her friends bought flip-phones."

2. **Identify the Reason (\( <R> \))**:
    - "Susie bought a flip-phone."

3. **Evaluate the Argument to Identify Defect Type**:
    - **Generalization (\( <G> \))**:
        - Yes. The argument takes the fact that Susie bought a flip-phone and generalizes it to claim that all of her friends did the same. This is a generalization because the behavior of one individual (Susie) is assumed to be representative of the entire group (all of her friends) without sufficient evidence to support such a broad claim.
    
4. **Conclusion**:
    - The given string "Susie bought a flip-phone, so all of her friends bought flip-phones." is an argument of type \( <G> \) (Generalization).

Therefore, the argument classified as \( <G> \) is based on the identification that the proposition in the argument improperly generalizes from the actions of a single individual to a whole group.
