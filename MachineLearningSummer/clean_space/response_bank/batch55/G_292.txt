For 
Let's apply the decomposition of the task \( IDA \) (classifying the type of defective argument) step by step as specified in \( IDAA \).

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Application

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   The first step is to identify the proposition in the given string. The proposition typically is the statement being put forth for examination.
   
   - **Proposition (P):** "Blondes are less intelligent than people with other hair colors."

2. **Evaluate for Generalization (G):**
   Check if the statement is making an assertion about a group based on inadequate or insufficient evidence.

   - **Evaluation for G:** The statement asserts something about all blondes based on a characteristic (intelligence) without providing specific evidence or data. This is a generalization since it applies a characteristic (intelligence) to an entire group based on an unspecified sample size.
   
   - **Conclusion:** The argument type is \( G \) (Generalization).

3. **Evaluate for Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   Check if the statement claims completeness in enumeration of possibilities but omits pertinent ones.

   - **Evaluation for FE:** The statement does not claim completeness in enumerating possibilities. Hence, FE does not apply here.

4. **Evaluate for Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   Determine if the reason provided (if any) does not conclusively support the proposition.

   - **Evaluation for IR:** The statement does not provide specific reasons within the statement context. Hence, IR does not apply.

5. **Evaluate for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   Assess if the causal basis given for the proposition is weak or not compelling.

   - **Evaluation for WCB:** No causal basis is provided in the statement itself. Hence, WCB does not apply.

6. **Evaluate for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   Check if the reason given is simply a restatement of the proposition.

   - **Evaluation for RR:** No reason is presented. Hence, RR does not apply.

7. **Evaluate for Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   Evaluate if the proof is assumed to be certain on a consensus which actually is under dispute.

   - **Evaluation for FU:** No universal consensus is cited in the statement. Hence, FU does not apply.

8. **Evaluate for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   Determine if the language used in the proof is ambiguous and could be taken in another sense than intended.

   - **Evaluation for DEP:** The language in the statement is clear in its derogatory and generalizing intent. Hence, DEP does not apply.

### Final Classification:
Based on the evaluation, the defective argument type for the string "Blondes are less intelligent than people with other hair colors." is:

- **Generalization (G):** The statement makes a broad assertion about all blondes without sufficient evidence or specific reasoning, applying a characteristic to an entire group based on an unstated and insufficient sample.

Therefore, the \( IDAA \) conclusion for the provided string is \( G \).
