For 
To apply the IDAA (application of decomposition to classify arguments) to the given statement, "My roommate said her philosophy class was difficult, and the one I’m in is difficult, too. All philosophy classes must be hard," we will follow a structured approach to identify its type:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDAA on the Given String

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**
The proposition is the assertion we intend to prove. In this case, it is:
"All philosophy classes must be hard."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**
The reason is the causal basis for the proposition. Here, it is:
"My roommate said her philosophy class was difficult, and the one I’m in is difficult, too."

**Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**
The proof of reason would be any additional arguments that corroborate the reason:
In this statement, there does not appear to be a separate proof of reason beyond what is stated in the reason.

**Step 4: Evaluate the Argument for Defects**
Based on the defective argument types defined, let's assess if the given argument falls into any of those categories:

- **Generalization (<G>)**
  - The argument bases the proposition on only two instances (the roommate's class and the speaker's class) and generalizes this experience to encompass all philosophy classes. This matches the definition of Generalization, where an assertion based on some parts or a majority of individuals is referred to all.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
  - The argument does not appear to enumerate all possible examples of philosophy classes. However, it also doesn’t claim to have considered all possibilities explicitly in its assertion.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
  - The reason provided (two difficult classes) might not conclusively demonstrate that all philosophy classes are difficult. However, this defect might more accurately fit Generalization rather than Inconclusive Reason given the pattern of reasoning involved.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
  - The argument does not delve into causality beyond observational instances, but this would not typically be classified under insufficient causal basis if the causal relationship is not the primary focus.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**
  - The reason does not merely repeat the proposition in different words but gives specific examples to support it, so this doesn’t fall under faulty repetition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
  - No universal agreement or consensus is presumed in the argument.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**
  - The language in the reason and proposition appears clear without significant ambiguity.

**Step 5: Conclude Classification**
Based on the evaluation, the argument fits most closely with the defect type defined as Generalization (<G>):

### Conclusion:
The given statement should be classified as a Generalization (<G>), since it extends the difficulty of two specific philosophy classes to all philosophy classes based on limited examples.
