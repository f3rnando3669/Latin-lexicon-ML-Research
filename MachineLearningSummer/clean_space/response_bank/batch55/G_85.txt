For 
To apply <IDAA> to "A person hanging out in a bar will be an alcoholic," we need to decompose the advanced task of classifying the statement according to the provided defective argument types into specific steps and then carry out those steps.

Letâ€™s break down the steps <D> to classify this statement:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <D> into Classification <IDA>:

1. **Step 1**: Identify the Proposition \[P\].
   - In the given statement, the proposition is: "A person hanging out in a bar will be an alcoholic."

2. **Step 2**: Identify the Reason \[R\], if implicitly or explicitly present.
   - The statement does not explicitly offer a reason, but it implies a reason: "Hanging out in a bar leads to alcoholism," which underlies the proposition.

3. **Step 3**: Identify any Proof of Reason \[PR\], if present.
   - The statement does not provide any additional proof to back up the reason.

4. **Step 4**: Analyze the task \[IDA\] using the given defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>.
   - **Generalization <G>**: This occurs when a general conclusion is based on a subset of cases. The proposition in the statement assumes that because some people who hang out in bars may become alcoholics, this holds true for all people.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>**: This occurs when an argument falsely claims to have covered all possibilities. The given statement doesn't enumerate possibilities; it makes a direct assertion.
   - **Inconclusive Reason <IR>, Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>, Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>, Presumptuous Consensus <FU>, Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>**: We evaluate if the reason (whether implicit or explicit) conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the proposition, if it is a strong causal basis, if it has faulty repetition, presumption of consensus, or ambiguous language use.

### Applying Analysis to the Given Statement:

1. **Generalization <G>**:
   - The statement "A person hanging out in a bar will be an alcoholic" generalizes from the behavior of some people to all people. It assumes all people will necessarily become alcoholics if they hang out in a bar, which is not logically sound. This is a classic case of generalization.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>**:
   - Not applicable here, as the statement does not pertain to a list of possibilities.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason <IR>**:
   - The reason that hanging out in bars causes alcoholism is not presented conclusively or conclusively demonstrated.
   
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>**:
   - The causal relationship presented is weak. There are people who hang out in bars and do not become alcoholics, thus the causal basis is not compelling.
   
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>**:
   - Not applicable, as the reason and proposition are not identical in wording or substance in this isolated statement.
   
6. **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>**:
   - Not applicable. The statement does not argue from a supposed universal agreement.
   
7. **Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>**:
   - Not readily applicable, as the statement is quite straightforward and not ambiguous in sense.

### Conclusion:
The most fitting defective argument type for the statement "A person hanging out in a bar will be an alcoholic" is **Generalization <G>**. It leaps from an unsupported premise that some who hang out in bars will become alcoholics to a broad generalization that this will happen to everyone who frequents bars.

Thus, the defective argument type for <s> "A person hanging out in a bar will be an alcoholic" is <G>.
