Sure! Let's decompose the advanced task of classifying the string "The speaker or writer appeals to the audience's trust by establishing his credibility or trustworthiness as a writer or speaker" according to the defined defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Decomposition of the Task <IDA>:
1. Identify the Proposition (<P>) if present in the string.
2. Identify the Reason (<R>) if present in the string.
3. Identify any Proof of Reason (<PR>) if present in the string.
4. Check for any defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP> within the <P>, <R>, or <PR>.

### Application of <D> to <IDA>:
Let's walk through these steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition (<P>) could be: The speaker or writer appeals to the audience's trust.
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason (<R>) given could be: By establishing his credibility or trustworthiness as a writer or speaker.
   
3. **Identify any Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - In this case, no additional proof or supporting argument is provided in the string itself, so <PR> is absent.

4. **Check for defective argument types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** The argument is not making a broad generalization based on limited data.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument is not presenting a complete list of possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This might be a possibility. The reason given (establishing credibility/trustworthiness) does not automatically ensure that the audience's trust is earned; itâ€™s suggestive but not definitive.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The Reason (R) is different from the Proposition (P), so RR does not apply.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This is also a possibility as simply establishing credibility may not be a strong enough causal basis for appealing to trust.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The argument does not rely on assumed universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The terms "credibility" and "trustworthiness" could potentially be taken in various senses, leading to an interpretation issue.

### Conclusion for <IDAA>:
After analyzing the string, we can classify it in terms of defective argument types as follows:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal link between establishing credibility and appealing to trust lacks compelling force.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The terms "credibility" and "trustworthiness" could be taken in multiple senses, leading to ambiguity.

Therefore, the string "The speaker or writer appeals to the audience's trust by establishing his credibility or trustworthiness as a writer or speaker" can be classified mainly as <IR>, <WCB>, and <DEP>.
