Certainly! To apply IDAA (the decomposition of IDA into specific steps) to the string "Doing something because everyone else is doing it," we need to break down the process step by step for classifying this statement into one of the defective argument types. Here's how we can do it:

### Step 1: Understand and Analyze the String
- **String (s)**: "Doing something because everyone else is doing it."
- **Objective**: Determine the classification of this argument based on the given defective argument types.

### Step 2: Identify the Components of the Argument
- **Proposition (<P>)**: The implied proposition here is "Doing something."
- **Reason (<R>)**: The reason given is "because everyone else is doing it."

### Step 3: Match the Reason to the Defective Argument Types
1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Does this statement apply a general rule based on a subset?
   - No, it does not seem to be generalizing based on a subset but rather implies an action based on a group behavior.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Does this falsely assume complete enumeration of possibilities?
   - No, it doesn't enumerate possibilities or omit any.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Does the reason fail to demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
   - This may be a candidate since the reason ("because everyone else is doing it") does not conclusively validate the action.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Is the causal basis insufficient to strongly support the proposition?
   - This may also apply since the reasoning isn't a compelling justification for the action.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Is the reason just a repetition of the proposition?
   - No, the reason is distinct from the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Is the proof of reason based on presumed universal agreement?
   - Yes, the statement suggests that the action is acceptable merely because it is universally adopted, without additional justification.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Is the language ambiguous?
   - No, the language is clear in its intention.

### Step 4: Determine the Most Fitting Defective Argument Type
- The string "Doing something because everyone else is doing it" most closely fits the definition of **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**, since it implies that the action is justified merely because it is universally accepted.

### Conclusion
The given string is classified as a defective argument type **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.

By following these decomposed steps, we correctly identified the defective argument type of the given string.
