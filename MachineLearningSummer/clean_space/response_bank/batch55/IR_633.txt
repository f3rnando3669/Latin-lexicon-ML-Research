For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of the decomposition of the advanced task into specific steps) to "Which of the following is true?", we need to decompose the task of classifying the string as one of the defective argument types into specific steps. Below is the step-by-step decomposition:

1. **Identify Proposition <P>:**
   Examine if the string contains a proposition stating what it intends to prove.
   
   Since the string is "Which of the following is true?", there is no clear proposition <P> stating what intends to be proven. 

2. **Identify Reason <R>:**
   Look for any causal basis provided that aims to establish the truth of the proposition <P>.
   
   In this case, the string does not provide any causal basis. 

3. **Identify Proof of Reason <PR>:**
   Look for any additional arguments corroborating the Reason (if stated).
   
   As there is no Reason found, consequently, no Proof of Reason can be identified.

4. **Determine Defective Argument Type:**
   Compare the string against the definitions of defective argument types to classify it accurately.

   - **Generalization (<G>):** The string does not make a broad assertion based on a part or majority but refers to no specific proposition.
   
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The string does not claim to have made a complete enumeration of possibilities.
   
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** There is no mentioned reason that fails to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of a proposition.
   
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** There is no weak causal basis provided for a proposition.
   
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** There is no repetition of a reason that says the same as the proposition.
   
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** There is no assumed proof based on universal agreement.
   
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The string does not contain language that could be taken in a different sense than intended by the speaker, but it is a question seeking truth without a clear argument context.

Since none of the defective arguments' criteria seem directly applicable, the string "Which of the following is true?" appears not to fit any of the specified defective argument types directly because it lacks the structure of an actual argument with a proposition, reason, or proof.

**Conclusion:**
The string "Which of the following is true?" does not seem classifiable under any of the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>, as it lacks the fundamental components of a structured argument (Proposition, Reason, Proof of Reason). Therefore, it does not appear to be a defective argument as per the given definitions.
