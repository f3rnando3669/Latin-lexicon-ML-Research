Sure, let's use the defined approach (IDAA) to classify the argument "You can’t give me a C. I’m an A student!" step by step.

1. **Understanding the Argument:**  
   Let's break down the provided text.  
   - Proposition (P): "You can’t give me a C."  
   - Reason (R): "I’m an A student!"

2. **Evaluate the Reason**  
   To identify the type of defective argument, we need to evaluate whether the reason effectively supports the proposition.

3. **Classifying the Defective Argument Types:**  
   - **Generalization (G):** This would be the case if the example provided is assumed to apply to all instances. This is not the issue here since it's not a generalization of individual cases.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This would be trying to cover all possibilities and missing some. The argument doesn't claim to cover all possibilities, so it doesn't apply.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This is when the reason provided (R) doesn’t conclusively support the proposition (P). "I’m an A student" does not necessarily imply that the student cannot receive a C. Grades are given based on performance in specific assessments, not overall student labeling.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This argues the provided reason doesn’t compellingly support the proposition. The fact of being an A student in general doesn't compel the conclusion that this particular grade (C) isn’t appropriate. 
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This would involve repetition where the reason essentially restates the proposition. This is not the case here since the proposition and reason are different statements.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Assuming something as universally agreed upon without sufficient evidence. That isn’t the issue being presented here.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Ambiguity in the phrase provided. Here, the language is clear regarding what is being contended.

4. **Determining the Best Fit:**
   - The strongest fit for the argument here appears to be:
     - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

In detail:
- **Inconclusive Reason:** The reason “I’m an A student” does not directly support the proposition “You can’t give me a C” adequately. It doesn't address the specific performance relevant to the given grade.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The fact of being generally classified as an A student does not have a compelling link to the proposition against being given a C in a specific instance, making the causal connection weak.

**Final Classification:** The provided argument can be categorized under both **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
