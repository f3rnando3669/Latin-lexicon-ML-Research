For 
Alright, let's apply **<IDAA>** to the given statement: "At soccer practice, Willeidy tells Aida, 'Pace's soccer team was losing until I bought new shoes. We have not lost a game since I got my lucky shoes!'"

**1. Decompose <IDA> into specific steps (<D>):**

1. Identify the Proposition (<P>).
2. Identify the Reason (<R>).
3. Determine what type of defective argument the statement falls under:
   - Generalization (<G>)
   - Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
   - Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
   - Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
   - Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
   - Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)

**2. Apply these steps to classify the given statement:**

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**
The proposition in the statement is: "Pace's soccer team was losing until I bought new shoes. We have not lost a game since I got my lucky shoes!"

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**
The reason given is: "I bought new shoes" and "they are lucky."

**Step 3: Determine the type of defective argument**

Now, let's analyze the statement based on the types of defective arguments:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: This does not represent a generalization since it is not making a broad assertion about many instances based on a few.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The completeness of enumeration isn't really an issue here since the argument doesn't involve listing possibilities.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason given (lucky shoes) does not provide a conclusive logical basis for the proposition (the team has not lost a game because of the shoes). 

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal link between the shoes and the team's success is weak and unsubstantiated, making the "lucky shoes" argument insufficient.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: There is no repetition of the proposition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: There is no universal consensus claimed in the argument.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: There does not seem to be a significant ambiguity in the language used.

The statement can be classified as **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, as the reason provided (lucky shoes) does not logically or convincingly establish the truth of the proposition.

**Conclusion:**
Applying **<IDAA>** to the statement, we classify it as types **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason) and **<WCB>** (Insufficient Causal Basis). The reasoning given for the soccer team's success is neither conclusive nor compelling.
