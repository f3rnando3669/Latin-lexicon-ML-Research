For 
To apply IDAA (decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument into specific steps) to the string "claiming that an idea or belief is true simply because it is what most people believe," we need to break down the process into clearly defined steps to identify the type of defective argument.

Here are the steps:

1. **Identify the String (<s>):**
   - The string to classify is "claiming that an idea or belief is true simply because it is what most people believe."

2. **Determine the Nature of the Argument:**
   - Analyze the assertion in the string to understand what it is proposing and the basis for this proposal.

3. **Examine the Potential Defects:**
   - Compare the assertion against the defined defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) to see which one fits most closely.

4. **Validate Based on Definition:**
   - Ensure that the identified defective argument type aligns correctly with the string according to its definition.

Let's perform each step:

### Step 1: Identify the String (<s>)
- String <s> is: "claiming that an idea or belief is true simply because it is what most people believe."

### Step 2: Determine the Nature of the Argument
- The argument in the string asserts that a belief is true based on its popularity ('most people believe it') rather than any empirical evidence or logical reasoning.

### Step 3: Examine the Potential Defects
   - **<G> Generalization**: This involves extending the application of an idea beyond the valid cases. This doesn't seem to apply directly as the assertion is about consensus.
   - **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: This involves missing out on possibilities. This doesn't seem to apply directly.
   - **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The reason provided (popularity) may not conclusively establish the correctness of the proposition.
   - **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: The causal basis (popularity) for the proposition (truth of the belief) could be seen as insufficient.
   - **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: This involves merely restating the proposition as the reason, which is not what's happening here.
   - **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: This involves asserting something as true because it is universally agreed upon or popular. This could be closely related.
   - **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: This involves the argument being misunderstood due to ambiguous language, which isn't the focus here.

### Step 4: Validate Based on Definition
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus** fits: The assertion believes something to be true merely because it is what most people believe, which aligns precisely with the definition of <FU>.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason** might also apply: The reason (popularity) does not conclusively demonstrate the truth of the belief.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis** might also apply: The causal basis being the popularity is weak and not a compelling reason to establish truth.

However, the most directly fitting defective argument type is <FU>.

### Conclusion
By following the decomposed steps (IDAA), the string "claiming that an idea or belief is true simply because it is what most people believe" is identified as being a type **<FU>: Presumptuous Consensus**.
