To apply the decomposition of the task of classifying the given argument into specific steps, we will break down the argument and analyze it to determine which type of defective argument it represents. Here is the step-by-step process:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The proposition in the given argument is: "Oplan Tokhang is an effective operation."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason given for the proposition is: "Famous actors like Alex Gonzaga and Philip Salvador support Oplan Tokhang."

3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (if any) (<PR>):**
   - There is no additional proof or elaboration provided to support the reason. The argument relies solely on the statement that famous actors support the operation.

4. **Classify the Argument Based on the Types of Defective Arguments:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** The argument does not appear to be generalizing from some one part or a majority of individuals to all individuals.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument does not claim to have made a complete enumeration of possibilities, so it is not incomplete enumeration.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason that famous actors support the operation does not conclusively demonstrate the effectiveness of the operation.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The support of famous actors is not a compelling causal basis for establishing the effectiveness of an operation.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason provided is not a repetition of the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The argument does not claim universal agreement; it merely mentions the support of specific famous individuals.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** There is no ambiguity in the language used in the argument.

By analyzing the steps and evaluating the argument based on the types of defective arguments, we can conclude that the given argument is an example of **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** because the support of famous actors does not compellingly demonstrate the effectiveness of Oplan Tokhang as an operation. Additionally, it can also be seen as **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** since the reason provided does not sufficiently prove the truth of what is being urged (the effectiveness of the operation). Therefore, the argument fits both **<WCB>** and **<IR>** classifications.

This completes the application of **IDAA** to the given argument.
