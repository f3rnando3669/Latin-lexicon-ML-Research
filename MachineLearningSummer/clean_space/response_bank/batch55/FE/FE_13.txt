To apply the IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument into specific steps) to the string "You either are for us or you are all against":

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - In this case, the proposition is: "You either are for us or you are all against."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Here, it appears that there is an implicit assumption rather than an explicit reason. The statement suggests that every possible stance falls into one of two categories.

3. **Evaluate if the Reason (<R>) conclusively supports the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Since there is no explicit reason given, we evaluate the proposition itself as it stands. The statement presupposes a binary condition without justifying why other possibilities cannot exist.

4. **Classify the argument based on known defective arguments:**
   - Let's review the defective argument types:
     - **Generalization (<G>):** Not applicable; the statement does not refer to some part or majority of individuals but makes a universal assertion.
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Likely applicable; the statement claims to represent all possibilities (either support or opposition) but omits the possibility of neutrality or other positions.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Not applicable; there is no reasoning provided that needs to conclusively support the proposition.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Not applicable; there is no causal reasoning provided.
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Not applicable; the string does not repeat the proposition as a reason.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Not applicable; the statement does not appeal to a universal agreement as its support.
     - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Not directly applicable; the statement's language is not ambiguous, though it reduces a complex situation into a binary choice.

Given the above steps, the classification that fits best is **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** because the argument presents an either-or scenario (dichotomy) that doesn't account for the multiple other possibilities that might exist (neutrality, partial agreement, or different perspectives).

### Final Classification:

The string "You either are for us or you are all against" is classified as **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** under the defective argument types.
