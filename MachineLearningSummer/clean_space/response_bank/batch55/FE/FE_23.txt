For 
To perform IDAA (the application of D (decomposition) to IDA (classification of s as a defective argument)), we first need to break down the task IDA into specific steps (D) and then apply those steps to the given string.

### Decomposition (D) Steps for IDA
1. **Identify the Proposition (P) and Reason (R):**
   - Find the claim or proposition being made (P).
   - Identify the supporting reason (R) provided for the proposition.

2. **Analyze the Argument:**
   - Evaluate whether the reason (R) supports the proposition (P) conclusively or if there are any logical flaws.
   - Check for common types of defective arguments (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP) by scrutinizing the nature of the proposition (P) and the reason (R).

3. **Classify the Argument:**
   - Based on the analysis, classify the argument as one of the defective types.

### Application of Decomposition (D) to the given string:
String: "I thought you were a good person, but you were not at church today."

1. **Identify the Proposition (P) and Reason (R):**
   - **Proposition (P):** "You are not a good person."
   - **Reason (R):** "You were not at church today."

2. **Analyze the Argument:**
   - Examine the causal link between being at church and being a good person.
   - Is not being at church a conclusive reason to determine someone's goodness?
   - Assess whether the argument exhibits any known defects.

3. **Classify the Argument:**
   - **Generalization (G):** This does not apply as it isn't about generalizing a characteristic from a part to the whole.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This does not apply as it doesn’t claim a complete enumeration of possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This might apply because the reason (not being at church) does not necessarily prove the proposition (not being a good person). Attendance at church is not a conclusive metric for determining someone’s moral character.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This could also apply because the causal basis (not being at church) is weak and not compelling enough to establish the proposition.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This does not apply because the reason provided isn’t just a repetition of the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There’s no mention of a universal agreement, so this does not apply.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** This does not apply as there’s no ambiguity in the terms used.

### Conclusion:
The argument "I thought you were a good person, but you were not at church today." is best classified as either **"Inconclusive Reason (IR)"** or **"Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)"**. Given that we need to choose the most fitting classification, the more precise classification would be **"Inconclusive Reason (IR)"** because the reason provided is not sufficient to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. However, both classifications show valid points.

The final classification for "I thought you were a good person, but you were not at church today." is **<IR>**.
