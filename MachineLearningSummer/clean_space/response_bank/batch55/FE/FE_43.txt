To apply <IDAA> to the argument presented, let's follow the decomposition of the task into specific steps for classifying the string as one of the defective argument types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>), the Reason (<R>), and the Proof of Reason (<PR>) inside the argument.**

- **Person 1's statement:**
  - Proposition (<P>): "You’re either for the war or against the troops."

- **Person 2's statement:**
  - Proposition (<P>): The implied proposition is that they do not want the troops sent into a dangerous war.
  - Reason (<R>): The argument that Person 2 does not address directly.

**Step 2: Analyze the Proposition and Reason to identify any defects.**

- **Person 1's statement analysis:**
  - Proposition: "You’re either for the war or against the troops."
    - The statement sets up a binary choice, suggesting there are only two possibilities.

- **Assessment of Defective Arguments:**
  - **Generalization (<G>)**: This is not a simple generalization.
  - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This argument falsely presents only two options without considering other possibilities (e.g., one can support the troops but not the war).
  - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: There’s no causal demonstration as expected of a reason proving a proposition.
  - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The reason given does not repeat the proposition verbatim.
  - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: There's no causal link attempted.
  - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: No assumption based on universal agreement.
  - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The language isn't particularly ambiguous, but it’s falsely dichotomous.

Based on the analysis, **Person 1's statement** can best be classified as **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** since it limits the choices incorrectly by failing to account for other possibilities.

- **Person 2's statement analysis:**
  - Person 2’s response doesn’t directly establish a new reason or proof of reason and doesn't fit into the defective argument types above.

**Step 3: Conclusion and Classification.**

From the above steps:
- Statement by Person 1: Classified as **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**.
- Statement by Person 2: Doesn't fit the defective argument types defined.

Thus, applying **<IDAA>** to "Person 1: You’re either for the war or against the troops. Person 2: Actually, I do not want our troops sent into a dangerous war," the critical defective argument identified is **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** presented by Person 1.
