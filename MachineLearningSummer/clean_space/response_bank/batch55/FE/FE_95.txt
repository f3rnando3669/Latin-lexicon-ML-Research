For 
To apply IDAA to the sentence "Jollibee or McDonalds for lunch?" and determine its type of fallacy, we'll decompose the task into specific steps using the definitions provided. Here's the step-by-step decomposition process:

### Step 1: Identify the Parts
First, we will identify the components of the given sentence in the context of the argument types defined.

- The sentence is "Jollibee or McDonalds for lunch?"
- This can be interpreted as a form of a proposition (P) where the intent is to choose one option for lunch.

### Step 2: Determine if It's Defective
Next, we will ascertain whether the argument present in the sentence is defective by evaluating it against the types of fallacies defined:

- **Generalization (G):** This doesn’t apply here as the sentence does not generalize from some part to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This applies if the sentence presents a limited set of options and implies that they are the only possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Not applicable as there's no stated reason attempting to support the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Not applicable as there's no causal reasoning provided.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Not applicable as there isn’t a repetition of the proposition in the reasoning format.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Not applicable as there's no assumption of universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Not applicable since the language is clear in its limited scope but does limit the options.

### Step 3: Classify the Sentence
Now, evaluating against the above checks, the most fitting classification for the sentence is **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**. 

### Step 4: Explain the Classification
The sentence "Jollibee or McDonalds for lunch?" implies that these are the only two options available for lunch, thus disregarding all other possible choices (such as other restaurants, homemade food, skipping lunch, etc.). This falls under the **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** fallacy as it fails to consider all possible options, presenting an incomplete set of choices.

### Conclusion
Based on the above steps, the sentence "Jollibee or McDonalds for lunch?" is an example of the fallacy type **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**.
