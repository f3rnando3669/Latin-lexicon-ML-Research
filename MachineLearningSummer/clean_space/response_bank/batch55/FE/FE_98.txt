To apply the process of decomposing the task of classifying the string "You are either a leader or a follower" into specific steps, we need to break down <IDAA> for <IDA> into smaller, manageable steps:

1. **Understand the String:**
    - **Input String:** "You are either a leader or a follower."

2. **Identify Components of the Argument:**
    - Determine if the string contains a Proposition, Reason, or Proof of Reason.
    - **String Analysis:** The string "You are either a leader or a follower" appears to be making a categorical statement, effectively stating what it assumes to be a comprehensive list of possible roles.

3. **Map to Defective Argument Types:**
    - Compare the argument with the definitions of defective arguments:

        - **Generalization (<G>):** An assertion based on some part or majority but not applicable to all.
        - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** A complete enumeration claim that misses some possibilities.
        - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition.
        - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Reason is weak and not compelling.
        - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Reason repeats the proposition.
        - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Assumed proof based on universal agreement which is still in dispute.
        - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Proof can be taken in a different sense than intended.

4. **Classify the Argument:**
    - Assessing the given string:
        - The statement "You are either a leader or a follower" appears to present a dichotomous proposition.
        - It divides people into two exclusive categories without any supporting reason or proof.

5. **Evaluate for Defective Argument Fit:**
    - **Generalization (<G>):** Not applicable, as it does not suggest that all individuals are being in such roles without evidence.
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This seems fitting as it simplifies options to only two, yet there could be more contexts where individuals neither fit as leaders nor followers (e.g., self-directed individuals, collaborators).
    - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Not applicable as no reason is provided.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Not applicable as no causal basis is provided.
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Not applicable as no separate reason is provided.
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Not applicable as it does not reference any widely held belief.
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Not particularly applicable, though the terms "leader" and "follower" can be broad, it doesn't fit the specific definition of DEP.

6. **Final Classification:**
    - The most fitting defective argument type is **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** because it reduces the complex spectrum of human roles to an oversimplified dichotomy without acknowledging other possibilities.

**Conclusion:**
The classified defective argument type for the string "You are either a leader or a follower" is **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**.
