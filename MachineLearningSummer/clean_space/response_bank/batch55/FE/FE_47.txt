For 
To apply the task of classifying the given string "People either like coffee or hate it" as one of the defective argument types, we will employ the defined task IDAA (the application of decomposition D to the task of classification IDA). Here is a step-by-step decomposition (D) of the task IDA:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of IDA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   Extract the main assertion being made in the argument.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   Determine the causal basis or reasoning provided to support the proposition (if any).

3. **Evaluate Completeness of Enumeration (FE):**
   Check if the argument claims to have enumerated all possibilities but omitted some.

4. **Check for Generalization (G):**
   Assess if the argument is making an over-generalized claim based on insufficient data.

5. **Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   Evaluate if the reason provided conclusively supports the proposition.

6. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   Evaluate if the causal basis provided is compelling and sufficient.

7. **Identify Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   Check if the reason is merely a repetition of the proposition.

8. **Determine Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   Check if the argument assumes consensus without providing proof.

9. **Identify Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   Determine if there is any ambiguity in the language that can be interpreted differently.

### Applying the Steps to "People either like coffee or hate it":

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Proposition (P): "People either like coffee or hate it."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - No explicit reason (R) is provided in the statement. The argument is making a direct claim without supporting reasoning.

3. **Evaluate Completeness of Enumeration (FE):**
   - The statement claims to encompass all possible opinions on coffee by declaring that people either like it or hate it, with no middle ground or alternative views considered.
   - This is indicative of an Incomplete Enumeration (FE) because it misses out on the possibility that some people may be indifferent or have mixed feelings about coffee.

4. **Check for Generalization (G):**
   - The statement makes a sweeping generalization about people's opinions without backing data. However, this aspect is encapsulated more strongly in the concept of incomplete enumeration.

5. **Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - There is no reason provided, so there can be no inconclusive reason.

6. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - No causal basis is offered, hence WCB is not applicable.

7. **Identify Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - No reason is presented, so repetition cannot occur.

8. **Determine Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - The argument does not assume any consensus, so FU is not applicable.

9. **Identify Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - The language of the statement is not particularly ambiguous in its phrasing.

### Classification of the Argument:
Based on the analysis, the primary issue with the statement "People either like coffee or hate it" is that it commits the defect of **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**. It claims to account for all possible opinions about coffee but fails to consider other possibilities, such as indifference or mixed feelings.
