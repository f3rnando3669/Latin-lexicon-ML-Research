Sure! Let's apply IDAA to the given string "Either we pass this ordinance or there will be rioting in the streets." by decomposing the task of classifying the argument into specific steps.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDAA:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
**Proposition (<P>):** "Either we pass this ordinance or there will be rioting in the streets."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- **Reason (<R>):** The reason implied here is: "Passing the ordinance will prevent rioting in the streets."

#### Step 3: Check for Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** There is no additional argument or evidence given that corroborates the reason. The statement itself stands as an assertion without further proof.

#### Step 4: Identify Defective Argument Types
Now, we need to classify whether the argument fits any of the defective types defined (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>):

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - This argument doesn't generalize based on some individuals or majority, so it's not <G>.
  
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The argument presents a dichotomy, suggesting only two possibilities (pass the ordinance or there will be rioting), potentially missing other possible outcomes (e.g., peaceful protest, public negotiation, etc.). Thus, this might fit <FE>.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The reason "Passing the ordinance will prevent rioting" may not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. There could be other factors involved in preventing or causing riots. This makes the reason undermined and possibly <IR>.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The causal basis assumes passing the ordinance is sufficient to prevent riots without justification. Therefore, it could be seen as <WCB>.
  
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - The reason does not merely repeat the proposition.
  
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - The statement does not claim universal agreement as proof.
  
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - The argument "Either...or..." is not necessarily ambiguous here.

#### Step 5: Classify <s>
Based on the analysis, the most fitting defective argument types are:
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: By presenting only two outcomes (either passing the ordinance or facing riots), it misses other relevant possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason given does not conclusively prove the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The provided reason may not be compelling enough to establish the truth of the proposition.

Therefore, the argument "Either we pass this ordinance or there will be rioting in the streets." can be classified as predominantly <FE>, <IR>, and <WCB>.

### Conclusion:
The string is classified under:
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
