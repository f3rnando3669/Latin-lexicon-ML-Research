To apply IDAA (the application of the decomposition of a task into specific steps) to the classification task (IDA) to determine which defective argument type a given string belongs to, let's proceed step by step.

### Step 1: Break Down the Task (D for IDA)
1. **Identify the proposition (P):** Determine the main statement or assertion being made.
2. **Identify the reason (R):** Find the causal basis or rationale provided for the proposition.
3. **Identify the proof of reason (PR):** Look for additional arguments that corroborate the reason.
4. **Analyze for defects:**
   - a. Generalization (G)
   - b. Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
   - c. Inconclusive Reason (IR)
   - d. Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
   - e. Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
   - f. Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
   - g. Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)

### Step 2: Apply Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - "We must raise tuition to cover the cost of new books. Otherwise the library will be forced to close."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - "To cover the cost of new books."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   There isn't a clear additional argument presented that corroborates the reason in this short text.

4. **Analyze for Defects:**
   Let's evaluate the different defect types to see which fits:

   - **Generalization (G):** Not applicable as the argument doesn't generalize a claim from a part to a whole.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument doesn't claim a complete enumeration of possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason "to cover the cost of new books" may not conclusively demonstrate why raising tuition is the only solution because there could be other ways to raise money or cut costs.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis provided ("to cover the cost of new books") might not be compelling enough to justify "raising tuition" as the only solution. It doesn't necessarily follow that the library will close if tuition is not raised.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason given is different enough from the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There are no claims here relying on "it is universally agreed upon."
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language used is pretty clear and not ambiguous.

Among the defective argument types IR (Inconclusive Reason) and WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis), the most fitting seems to be:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Because the argument says they must raise tuition to cover the cost of new books and presents it as the only solution or else the library will close, but it doesn't provide a compelling causal basis to show why other alternatives wouldn't work.

### Conclusion:
The fallacy in the given argument is **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The reason given ("to cover the cost of new books") does not sufficiently justify why raising tuition is the only or necessary solution to prevent the library from closing.
