To apply the decomposition process (IDAA) for classifying the given string into one of the defective argument types, we follow these specific steps:

1. **Understand the Task Description:**
   - Given the string, we need to classify it into one defective argument type out of the set {G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP}.

2. **Break Down the String Information:**
   - The string describes a type of fallacy known as "false dilemma" where a complex issue is reduced to two options with a veiled threat.

3. **Analyze Key Features of Each Defective Argument Type:**
   - **Generalization (G):** Assertion is based on a part or majority but not universally applicable.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Claims a complete list but misses pertinent possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason is merely a repetition of the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Reason has a weak causal basis for the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Assumes proof by stating it is universally agreed upon.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Proof can be interpreted differently than intended.

4. **Determine the Nature of the Fallacy in the String:**
   - The string explicitly defines "false dilemma" as making a complex issue appear to have only two options. This fits the criteria for **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** because it provides a limited enumeration of possibilities, potentially overlooking other relevant options.

5. **Classify the String:**
   - Based on the definition and our analysis, the string "This fallacy (also known as “false dilemma”) occurs when a speaker or writer makes a veiled threat by reducing a complex issue to two options: either you see it my way or this bad thing will happen." is an example of **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**.

Thus, we conclude:

```plaintext
Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
```

In summary, by decomposing the advanced task (IDAA) into understanding the string, analyzing attributes of possible defective argument types, and identifying the key characteristics of the described fallacy, we have classified the string as an example of Incomplete Enumeration (FE).
