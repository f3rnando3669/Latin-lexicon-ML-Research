For 
To apply the process of IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a string as a defective argument type) to the given statement, follow these steps:

Step 1: Identify and understand the task.
The task (<IDA>) is to classify the argument "Either the city should provide recycling bins or throw out the Recycling Act" as one of the defective argument types: <G> (Generalization), <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration), <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis), <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus), or <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use).

Step 2: Break down (decompose) the task into specific steps.
For <IDA>, we can break it down into:
1. Analyze the structure of the proposition (<P>), reason (<R>), and proof of reason (<PR>).
2. Determine which defective argument type(s) may apply by examining the characteristics of each.
3. Match the argument with the defective type based on the analysis.

Step 3: Analyze the given argument.
The given argument states: "Either the city should provide recycling bins or throw out the Recycling Act."

Step 4: Examine the structure of the proposition.
This statement presents two alternatives: providing recycling bins or throwing out the Recycling Act, implying a need for action on recycling management.

Step 5: Determine the relevant defective argument type(s).
- <G> (Generalization): Does not fit, as the statement does not generalize from a specific part to the whole.
- <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration): This appears plausible, as the statement presents a false dilemma with only two alternatives, neglecting other possible options.
- <IR> (Inconclusive Reason): Not applicable, as there is no reason or evidence given in the statement.
- <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition): Not applicable, as the reason is not a repetition of the proposition.
- <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis): Not applicable, as there is no causal basis provided.
- <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus): Not applicable, as there is no presumed universal agreement.
- <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use): Not applicable, as there is no ambiguous language.

Step 6: Match the argument with the defective type based on the analysis.
The most fitting defective argument type for "Either the city should provide recycling bins or throw out the Recycling Act" is <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration), because it suggests a complete enumeration of alternatives but omits other pertinent possibilities.

Thus, the classification of the argument is:
**Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**.
