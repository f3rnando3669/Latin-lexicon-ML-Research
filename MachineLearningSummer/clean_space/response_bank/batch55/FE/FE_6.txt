For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to classify the string "There are two kinds of people in this world: those who like penguins, and those who are terrible monsters," we will decompose the task of identifying the type of defective argument into specific steps. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Understand the Proposition (<P>)
Identify the main claim or proposition that is being presented. 
- Proposition: "There are two kinds of people in this world: those who like penguins, and those who are terrible monsters."

### Step 2: Examine the Reason (<R>)
Look for any reasons presented to support the proposition.
- Reason: Implicitly, the claim suggests that people can be categorized entirely based on their opinions about penguins.

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
Look for additional arguments or evidence that corroborate the reason given.
- Proof of Reason: There isn't any explicit proof or evidence provided in the statement.

### Step 4: Analyze for Defective Argument Types
Classify the proposition and its supporting elements according to the defective argument types \( <G> \), \( <FE> \), \( <IR> \), \( <RR> \), \( <WCB> \), \( <FU> \), and \( <DEP> \).

### Step 5: Match to Defective Argument Types
Determine which defective argument type the proposition falls under:
- **Generalization (\(<G>\))**: The proposition makes a broad assertion based on a whole population ("people in this world") but without sufficient support or evidence.
  - In this case, it is assuming that the world can be divided strictly into just two categories based on a single criterion (liking penguins).
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\(<FE>\))**: The proposition might seem like it tries to exhaust all possibilities, but it actually misses many.
  - Here it suggests there are only two kinds, not contemplating other nuanced views about people and penguins.
  
- **Inconclusive Reason (\(<IR>\))**: No reason given conclusively demonstrates the proposition.
  - The claim lacks a logical reason that categorically separates people into two such extreme categories.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(<WCB>\))**: The reason given is not a compelling one.
  - The reason is weak under scrutiny; "liking penguins" is not a sufficient basis to classify people as monsters or not.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(<RR>\))**: Checking if the reason merely repeats the proposition.
  - Not applicable here as no reason provided repeats the proposition verbatim.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (\(<FU>\))**: Assuming a consensus where there might not be one.
  - It attempts to assert a definitive claim without considering common disagreement.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (\(<DEP>\))**: The claim's interpretation can be different than the intended.
  - The language is relatively clear but extreme, not necessarily ambiguous.

### Conclusion
Given the nature of the proposition and its lack of supporting evidence, it most closely aligns with two defective argument types: 

1. **Generalization (\(<G>\))**: The string makes an overgeneralized assertion by dividing all people into two categories without sufficient evidence.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\(<FE>\))**: It incorrectly simplifies the enumeration of categories of people.

Based on specific analysis, "Generalization" appears to be the primary defective argument type as it broadly applies a quality based on a unilateral characteristic.

Thus, the defective argument type for the given string is:

\[ \boxed{<G>} \]
