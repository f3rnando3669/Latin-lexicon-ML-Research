For 
Certainly, I'm going to follow the Decomposition process (\<D\>) step by step to classify the given string (\<s\>) as a type of defective argument.

### Step 1: Understand and Identify the Core Elements of the Statement

Let's start by breaking down the given statement to understand its core components:

Given Statement:
```plaintext
"If you do not submit your requirements today, you should drop your classes with Sir Lean."
```

### Step 2: Identify the Proposition (\<P\>)
The proposition (\<P\>) here is the primary assertion or claim made in the statement:
```plaintext
"You should drop your classes with Sir Lean."
```

### Step 3: Identify the Reason (\<R\>)
The reason (\<R\>) provided to support the proposition is:
```plaintext
"If you do not submit your requirements today."
```

### Step 4: Evaluate the Relationship Between \<P\> and \<R\>

- **Generalization (\<G\>)**:
  - Scenario: Assertion based on a part or majority of individuals but not necessarily applicable to all.
  - Analysis: There is no evidence that the argument is generalized to all students. This type does not apply here.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)**:
  - Scenario: An assertion claiming complete enumeration of possibilities but missing some.
  - Analysis: The statement does not list possibilities. It gives a simple conditional statement based on a single condition. This type does not apply here.

- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**:
  - Scenario: The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
  - Analysis: The statement assumes that not submitting requirements today logically leads to dropping classes, which is not necessarily a conclusive reason. Itâ€™s possible that the student can submit the requirements later or face lesser consequences.
  - Verdict: This type may apply here.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**:
  - Scenario: The causal basis submitted for the proposition is not compelling.
  - Analysis: Similar to \<IR\>. The reason provided does not necessarily compel the outcome suggested in the proposition. It could be seen as an insufficient causal basis.
  - Verdict: This type may apply here.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)**:
  - Scenario: The reason repeats the proposition.
  - Analysis: The reason is not a repeat of the proposition. This type does not apply here.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)**:
  - Scenario: The proof of reason is assumed as certain because it is universally agreed upon, but it's still in dispute.
  - Analysis: The statement does not rely on presumed consensus. It states a conditional. This type does not apply here.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)**:
  - Scenario: The proof can be taken in another sense than intended.
  - Analysis: The language of the statement does not appear ambiguous or open to different interpretations based on the information given. This type does not apply here.

### Step 5: Conclusion 

The given statement primarily suffers from issues of \(\<IR\>\) (Inconclusive Reason) and \(\<WCB\>\) (Insufficient Causal Basis) based on the provided definitions.

So, applying \( \text{IDAA} \) to the statement, the classification of the defective argument types would be:

```plaintext
The given statement "If you do not submit your requirements today, you should drop your classes with Sir Lean." is of type \(\<IR\>\) (Inconclusive Reason) and \(\<WCB\>\) (Insufficient Causal Basis).
```

This completes the step-by-step decomposition and classification of the given string.
