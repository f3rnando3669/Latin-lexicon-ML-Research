For 
To apply the decomposition and classification of the argument statement "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today" into the specified defective argument types, we will follow systematic steps. The goal is to determine whether the statement fits into one of the defined defective argument categories (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (`<D>`) of the Task (`<IDA>`):

1. **Identify the Proposition (`<P>`)**:
   - In the given statement, identify the proposition or claim that is being made.

2. **Identify the Reason (`<R>`)**:
   - Determine the causal basis or reason given for the proposition.

3. **Corroborate with Proof of Reason (`<PR>`), if any**:
   - Check for additional arguments supporting the reason. 

4. **Evaluate for Defective Argument Types (`<G>`, `<FE>`, `<IR>`, `<RR>`, `<WCB>`, `<FU>`, `<DEP>`)**:
   - Generalization (`<G>`)
   - Incomplete Enumeration (`<FE>`)
   - Inconclusive Reason (`<IR>`)
   - Insufficient Causal Basis (`<WCB>`)
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (`<RR>`)
   - Presumptuous Consensus (`<FU>`)
   - Ambiguous Language Use (`<DEP>`)

### Applying `<IDAA>`:

1. **Identify the Proposition (`<P>`)**:
   - "I thought you were a good person."

2. **Identify the Reason (`<R>`)**:
   - "You weren’t in class today."

3. **Corroborate with Proof of Reason (`<PR>`), if any**:
   - The statement does not provide additional arguments or evidence. It solely relies on the assertion that not being in class negates being a good person.

4. **Evaluate for Defective Argument Types**:

   - **Generalization (`<G>`)**: This does not seem to fit since the claim does not extend an observation about one instance to all instances.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (`<FE>`)**: This is not about listing possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (`<IR>`)**: The reason that not attending class makes someone not a good person is not conclusively demonstrating the correctness of the proposition (being a good person) since there could be various reasons for not attending class.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (`<WCB>`)**: The causal connection between being a good person and attending class is weak. The reason provided is not compelling to conclude that not attending class undermines being a good person.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (`<RR>`)**: The reason does not merely repeat the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (`<FU>`)**: No claim is made based on universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (`<DEP>`)**: The terms and language used are clear; the issue is with the strength of the connection.

### Conclusion:

The argument fits best under **Insufficient Causal Basis (`<WCB>`)** since the causal reason given ("You weren’t in class today") is not compelling enough to establish the proposition ("I thought you were a good person"). The reasoning does not sufficiently support the conclusion.
