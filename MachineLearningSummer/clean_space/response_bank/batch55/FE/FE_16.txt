For 
To apply **<IDAA>** (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument into specific steps) to the given statement, we will systematically break down and analyze the argument step by step. Here is the step-by-step decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Statement to be proven or asserted.
   - In this case, the proposition is: "We must tear the building down."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason provided for the proposition.
   - In this case, the reason is: "We shouldn't risk anyone’s safety."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Evidence or arguments given to support the reason.
   - In this case, the proof of reason includes: "The school is in bad shape. Either we tear it down and put up a new building, or we continue to risk students’ safety."

4. **Classify the Argument Type:**
   - Use the definitions of defective argument types to determine if any of them apply to the identified parts.

Let's examine the argument:

- **Step 1: Classify for <G> (Generalization):**
  - Does the proposition generalize based on some or most individuals?
  - No, the proposition does not generalize from specific instances.

- **Step 2: Classify for <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):**
  - Does the proposition claim a complete enumeration of possibilities but miss out on pertinent ones?
  - Yes, the argument presents a false dichotomy by claiming there are only two options: tear the building down or continue to risk student safety. It neglects other potential solutions (e.g., repairing the building, implementing temporary safety measures).

- **Step 3: Classify for <IR> (Inconclusive Reason):**
  - Does the reason (we shouldn't risk anyone’s safety) conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (we must tear the building down)?
  - No, while the reason is valid, it does not conclusively prove the specific action of tearing the building down as the only solution.

- **Step 4: Classify for <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):**
  - Is the causal basis (cause-and-effect relationship between the reason and proposition) not compelling?
  - The causal link between the school being in bad shape and tearing the building down is weak because it overlooks other possible solutions.

- **Step 5: Classify for <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):**
  - Does the reason merely repeat the proposition in different words?
  - No, the reason does not simply repeat the proposition.

- **Step 6: Classify for <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):**
  - Is the proof of reason (evidence that the school is in bad shape) assumed as certain because it is universally agreed upon?
  - No, the proof of reason is not assumed valid solely on universal agreement.

- **Step 7: Classify for <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):**
  - Is the proof of reason ambiguous or interpretable in multiple ways?
  - There is no significant ambiguity in the language used in the proof of reason.

Given the analysis, the most fitting classification for this argument appears to be **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)** because it falsely restricts the potential solutions to only two options, thereby overlooking other viable alternatives.

Thus, the defective argument type in the given string is **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**.
