For 
To apply the framework <IDAA> to classify the defective argument type of the statement "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights," we need to decompose the task <IDA> into specific steps <D>:

### Step-by-step Decomposition of <IDA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition <P>:**
   - The proposition in the statement is claiming that support for Hillary Clinton is synonymous with belief in women's rights.
   
2. **Identify the Reason <R>:**
   - The reason implied here is that the only way to demonstrate belief in women's rights is through supporting Hillary Clinton.

3. **Evaluate the Given Proposition and Reason:**
   - Check for defects according to the defined defective argument types.

### Application to the Specific Statement:

1. **Generalization <G>:**
   - The statement assumes a binary perspective, suggesting that the only way to support women's rights is by supporting a specific person. This falls under the defect type of <G> as it generalizes all belief in women's rights to one individual's candidacy.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>:**
   - The statement does not account for other ways to support women's rights apart from supporting Hillary Clinton. Hence, it is an incomplete enumeration of possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason <IR>:**
   - The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. Supporting Hillary Clinton is not the only measure of belief in women's rights.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>:**
   - The causal basis (support for women's rights leading to support for Hillary Clinton) is weak and not compelling as it overlooks the multifaceted nature of political and social support.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>:**
   - This does not apply in the given context as the reason is not a mere repetition of the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>:**
   - The statement assumes everyone agrees that supporting Hillary Clinton is the only way to show support for women's rights, which is a matter still in dispute. Hence, this applies.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>:**
   - The language in the statement is relatively clear and unambiguous, so this defective argument type does not apply.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evaluation, the defective argument type for the statement "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" falls under <G> (Generalization), <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration), <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis), and <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).

### Summary:
The defective argument type <IDA> for the statement is a combination of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, and <FU>.
