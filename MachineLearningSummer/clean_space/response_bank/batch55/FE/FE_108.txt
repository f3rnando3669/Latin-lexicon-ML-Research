For 
To apply IDAA to the argument "Either you recycle or you don't care about human life," we first need to decompose the task of IDA (classifying the defective argument) into specific steps. We'll break it down into steps and then carry out each step.

### Decomposition of IDA (D):
1. **Understand the Argument Structure**: Identify the Proposition (P), Reason (R), and Proof of Reason (PR) if they exist.
2. **Identify the Type of Defective Argument**: Use definitions to match the defective argument type.
3. **Testing Against Defective Argument Types**:
   - Generalization (G)
   - Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
   - Inconclusive Reason (IR)
   - Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
   - Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
   - Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)

### Step-by-Step Application of IDAA:

#### Step 1: Understand the Argument Structure
- **Proposition (P)**: "If you don't recycle, you don't care about human life."
- **Reason (R)**: Implied reason is that not recycling equals not caring for the environment, which impacts human life.

No additional Proof of Reason (PR) is explicitly provided.

#### Step 2: Identify the Defective Argument Types

- **Generalization (G)**: Does the Proposition (P) make an assertion based on one part or a majority and apply to all?
  - Analysis: The statement jumps from a single action (not recycling) to an overall conclusion about one's character (not caring about human life). This is overly broad and not necessarily applicable to all individuals who don't recycle.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Does the Proposition (P) claim a complete list of alternatives and miss pertinent ones?
  - Analysis: This argument presents a false dichotomy: it only includes two extreme options and excludes other possibilities (e.g., someone caring about human life but not recycling for different reasons).

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Does the Reason (R) fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of Proposition (P)?
  - Analysis: The reason given (implied environmental impact) does not conclusively prove that anyone who doesn't recycle inherently doesn’t care about human life.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Is the Reason (R) weak or unconvincing for establishing Proposition (P)?
  - Analysis: The implied reasoning is weak as it oversimplifies the relationship between recycling behavior and concern for human life.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Does the Reason (R) restate the Proposition (P) without new information?
  - Analysis: The Reason doesn't just repeat the Proposition but is implicitly weak.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Is the Proof of Reason (PR) assumed as certain based on a supposed universal agreement?
  - Analysis: This doesn’t apply as there is no explicit Proof of Reason (PR) stated in this argument.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Can the Proof of Reason (PR) be interpreted differently than the speaker intended?
  - Analysis: This doesn't apply as there is no ambiguity in the terms recycling or caring about human life in this context.

#### Step 3: Conclusion

The primary defective argument type this falls under is **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, with a strong overlap with **Generalization (G)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The argument presents a false dichotomy by omitting other potential motivations or considerations and generalizes the consequence of one action to a broad conclusion about one's values.

### Classification: <FE>, with aspects of <G> and <WCB>.

Thus, the argument "Either you recycle or you don't care about human life" is primarily classified as "Incomplete Enumeration (FE)," suggesting it falsely considers only a limited set of alternatives and fails to capture the complexity of possible scenarios.
