For 
To apply the task IDAA (decomposition [D] of the task of identifying a defective argument type [IDA]) to classify the argument "If you can't prove that Ken had an affair with the nanny, then he's been faithful to his wife," let's break down the steps as follows:

### Step 1: Understand the Proposition <P> and Reason <R>
Identify the main claim or assertion (Proposition) and the reasoning provided (Reason).

- **Proposition (<P>):** Ken has been faithful to his wife.
- **Reason (<R>):** If you can't prove that Ken had an affair with the nanny.

### Step 2: Analyze the Structure of the Argument
Identify how the proposition and the reason are connected.

The argument is structured as follows:
- The claim (Ken has been faithful) is asserted to be true based on the inability to prove a contrary action (an affair with the nanny).

### Step 3: Classify the Defective Argument Type
Match the identified structure with known defective argument types:

- **Generalization (G):** Not applicable here as the argument is not generalizing based on a part.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable because it is not about missing possibilities in an enumeration.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This looks promising because the inability to prove a negative action (an affair) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the positive action (faithfulness).
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This is also applicable because the reasoning lacks a compelling causal connection; lack of evidence of an affair does not directly prove faithfulness.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Not applicable since the Reason is not repeating the Proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Not applicable as itâ€™s not relying on a presumed universal consensus.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Not applicable since the language is not ambiguous.

### Step 4: Select the Most Appropriate Defective Argument Type
Determine which defective argument type best fits the given argument.

Based on steps 1-3:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The <R> does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the <P>.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis for <P> is weak because the lack of proof of an affair does not strongly support the faithfulness claim.

### Step 5: Final Classification

The argument "If you can't prove that Ken had an affair with the nanny, then he's been faithful to his wife." is likely best classified as both **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

Among these, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** seems the most direct and fitting classification because the reason provided is not sufficient to conclusively prove that the proposition is true.

### Conclusion
The defective argument type for the string "If you can't prove that Ken had an affair with the nanny, then he's been faithful to his wife." is:

**Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
