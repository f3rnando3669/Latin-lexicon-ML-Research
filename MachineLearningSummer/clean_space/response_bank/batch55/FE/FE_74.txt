For 
To apply \(\text{IDAA}\) to the string "If you are not with us, you are against us," we need to first decompose the task of \(\text{IDA}\) into specific steps and then follow each step to classify the argument type.

### Decomposition \(\text{D}\) of \(\text{IDA}\):
1. **Identify the Proposition (\(P\)):**
   Determine what statement or assertion the proposition (\(P\)) is setting forth.

2. **Identify the Reason (\(R\)):**
   Determine the reason offered to support the proposition.

3. **Evaluate the Reason (\(R\)):**
   Examine the reason to see if it satisfactorily supports the proposition and if it falls under any defective argument types.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type (\(G\), \(FE\), \(IR\), \(RR\), \(WCB\), \(FU\), \(DEP\)):**
   Based on the evaluation, classify the argument as one of the defective types if applicable.

### Step-by-Step Application

1. **Identify the Proposition (\(P\)):**
   - In the statement "If you are not with us, you are against us," the proposition is that if someone is not aligned with 'us,' then they are against 'us.'

2. **Identify the Reason (\(R\)):**
   - The implicit reason given here is that neutrality or lack of alignment with 'us' equates to opposition.

3. **Evaluate the Reason (\(R\)):**
   - This reason is making a binary classification, implying there are no other possibilities beyond being with 'us' or against 'us.' 

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:**
   - The key issue here is that the reason excludes other potential positions such as neutrality, indifference, or partial agreement. This constitutes a false dichotomy or a failure to include all possible options.

Thus, the argument is an example of defective reasoning which can be classified under:
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (\(FE\))**, because it claims a complete enumeration of possibilities (with us or against us) but actually excludes other possible positions.

### Conclusion:
The argument "If you are not with us, you are against us." is classified as a defective argument type \(\text{Incomplete Enumeration (FE)}\).
