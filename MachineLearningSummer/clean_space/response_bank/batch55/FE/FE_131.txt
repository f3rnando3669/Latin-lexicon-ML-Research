For 
To apply **IDAA** (the application of decomposition to the task of identifying defective arguments) to the given argument, we will break down the steps required for **IDA** and then perform those steps on the given string.

Here is a step-by-step decomposition **D** for the task **IDA**:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Extract the main assertion or claim from the argument.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine the causal basis or justification given for the main assertion.

3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Check for any supporting evidence or supplementary arguments provided to corroborate the <R>.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument:** 
   - Compare the structure and content of the argument against the definitions of defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

Now, applying these steps to the given argument:

**String:** "Politician: We have to decide if we are going to support school choice or if we are going to support failing schools. Those are the only two options."

### Decomposition and Analysis:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The main assertion is: "We have to decide if we are going to support school choice or if we are going to support failing schools."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The implicit reasoning behind the assertion is that the two options presented are mutually exclusive and exhaustive.

3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - No additional supporting evidence or supplementary arguments are provided to corroborate the reason. The reason itself is the assumption that these are the only two options.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument:**
   - The argument suggests that there are only two options, neglecting any other possible alternatives.
   - This fits the definition of <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration), where the Proposition is defective due to the claim that all possibilities are enumerated, but relevant possibilities are omitted.

Therefore, the classification of the argument "We have to decide if we are going to support school choice or if we are going to support failing schools. Those are the only two options." is <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration).
