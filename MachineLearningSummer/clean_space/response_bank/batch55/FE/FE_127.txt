For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of identifying a defective argument) to the proposition "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don’t believe in women’s rights," we need to break down the task of classifying this argument step by step.

### Step 1: Understanding the String
Let's first fully understand the string that we're analyzing: 

"You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don’t believe in women’s rights."

This sentence presents a dichotomy which can be identified as a proposition intended to be a complete argument, although we suspect it might be defective.

### Step 2: Identifying Proposition <P>
Identify <P> (Proposition):

Proposition: "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don’t believe in women’s rights."

### Step 3: Identifying Reason <R>
Identify possible Reason <R>:

Reason: It implicitly presents the reasoning that not supporting Hillary Clinton means opposing women's rights.

### Step 4: Proof of Reason <PR>
Identify possible Proof of Reason <PR>:

Proof of Reason: This is where the argument would typically provide evidence or additional arguments to support the Reason. The provided string does not give explicit supporting evidence, it assumes the Reason as self-evident.

### Step 5: Classifying the Defective Argument
Now, classify which type of defective argument this might fall into by evaluating the string against each defective argument type:
1. **<G> Generalization**: This type doesn't apply here because it's not making a general claim about a subset and implying it for all.
2. **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: This type seems to apply here because the proposition falsely presents a binary choice (support Clinton or reject women's rights), ignoring other possible stances.
3. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: While the reasoning is weak, it's not where the fault lies directly; rather, it’s the false dichotomy.
4. **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: There's no repetition of the same statement as the reasoning.
5. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: This could also be considered because the causal connection implied (not supporting Clinton means opposing women's rights) is not compelling or justified.
6. **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: This doesn't fit as the argument isn't relying on universal agreement.
7. **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: The terms aren't ambiguous; the issue is more about the structure.

### Conclusion
Based on our analysis, the primary defective argument type here is:

- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: The string presents a false dichotomy, ignoring other possibilities (e.g., supporting women's rights but preferring another candidate).

So, the classification of the string "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don’t believe in women’s rights." is of type <FE>.
