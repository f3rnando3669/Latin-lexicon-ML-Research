For 
To apply IDAA to the given string "The academic decathlon, Mr. Iglesias? That's a rich kid thing.," we need to decompose the task IDA into specific steps and classify the statement as one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**
In the given string, the Proposition is that the academic decathlon is a "rich kid thing." This can be restated as: "The academic decathlon is primarily participated in by wealthy students."

**Step 2: Look for the Reason (<R>)**
The Reason for this Proposition is implied in the statement but not explicitly stated. It suggests that the activities in the academic decathlon cater to or are accessible primarily to wealthy students. The given statement lacks explicit causal basis or reasoning.

**Step 3: Evaluate for Proof of Reason (<PR>)**
There is no explicit Proof of Reason provided in the given statement. The statement does not corroborate the Reason with any additional arguments or evidence.

**Step 4: Classify the Argument Type**
Next, we classify the statement based on the identified Proposition, Reason, and lack of Proof of Reason. According to the definitions:

- **<G> Generalization**: This is an assertion based on an insufficient sample size, applied to all instances.
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: Missing some pertinent elements.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: Reason does not conclusively support the Proposition.
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: Reason repeats the Proposition without adding new information.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: Weak Reason with no compelling causal basis.
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: Assumed Proof based on presumed universal agreement.
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: Proof taken in another sense than intended.

**Step 5: Determine the Specific Defective Argument Type**
Given the lack of explicit Reason and Proof of Reason, let’s consider each type one by one:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement "The academic decathlon is a rich kid thing" could be seen as a *Generalization*, as it takes a potentially limited observation and applies it broadly to all students participating in academic decathlons.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: There’s no enumeration of possibilities here, so this is not applicable.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The Reason is not even presented explicitly, which makes the argument weak rather than inconclusive.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: There’s no repetition since Reason is lacking.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: While Reason is not explicitly given, if we infer, it’s still an implied weak causal basis because it isn’t compelling.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: There is no suggestion that the proof is universally agreed upon.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: There’s no ambiguous use of language noted here.

**Conclusion**
The statement "The academic decathlon, Mr. Iglesias? That's a rich kid thing." is best classified as a **Generalization (<G>)**. It takes a potentially limited observation and applies it broadly without sufficient evidence to support such a claim.
