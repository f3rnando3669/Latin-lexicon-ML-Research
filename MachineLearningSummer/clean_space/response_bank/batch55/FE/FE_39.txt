For 
To apply IDAA to "Reduce complicated issues to only two possible courses of action," we need to break down the advanced task of classifying this string as one of the defective argument types into specific steps. Here is the step-by-step decomposition and analysis:

### Step 1: Understand the Given String
The string "Reduce complicated issues to only two possible courses of action" suggests a scenario where complex matters are simplified to a binary choice.

### Step 2: Identify Key Features of the String
- The string involves a reduction of complexity.
- It simplifies a multifaceted issue into only two options.

### Step 3: Match Key Features with Defective Argument Types
Based on the definitions provided for defective argument types, we need to consider which type best matches the notion of reducing complexity to two choices.

### Step 4: Evaluate Against Each Defective Argument Type
- **<G> Generalization:**
  - Not applicable because the string does not generalize from a sample to a whole group.
  
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:**
  - This might be a strong candidate since the string implies that only two choices are available when, in reality, there might be more. The notion of reducing complicated issues to two options naturally overlooks other potential solutions.

- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:**
  - Not directly applicable as the string does not provide a reason that fails to demonstrate the correctness of a proposition.
  
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:**
  - Not applicable; the string does not repeat a proposition.
  
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:**
  - Not applicable; the string does not present a causal reason.
  
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:**
  - Not applicable as the string does not claim universal agreement on a disputed point.
  
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:**
  - Potentially applicable if reducing to only two courses can be taken ambiguously. However, the major issue here seems to be the simplification rather than ambiguity.

### Step 5: Conclude Classification
Based on the specific features of the given string, the defective argument type that most accurately describes it is:

- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**

### Final Step: Deliver Classification
The string "Reduce complicated issues to only two possible courses of action" is classified as **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration** because it simplifies the issue by reducing the possible solutions to just two, ignoring other pertinent options.
