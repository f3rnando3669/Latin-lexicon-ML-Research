For 
To apply the process of decomposing the task of identifying a defective argument type for the string "We either have to cut taxes or leave a huge debt for our children," we need to systematically break the task into steps and then classify the argument according to the definitions provided. Let's follow the steps to perform <IDAA>:

### Step 1: Understand <s> 
First, let's clearly understand and analyze the argument contained in the string <s>. 

String <s>: "We either have to cut taxes or leave a huge debt for our children."

This statement presents a binary choice between two options: cutting taxes or leaving a huge debt for future generations.

### Step 2: Identify the Proposition <P>
A Proposition <P> is what we are intending to prove. In this case, the proposition is that we must either cut taxes or leave a huge debt for the children.

### Step 3: Identify the Reason <R>
The Reason <R> sets forth the causal basis for the proposition. Here, the implied reason is that there are no other alternatives besides the two presented.

### Step 4: Investigate any Proof of Reason <PR>
There isn't an explicitly provided Proof of Reason <PR> in this statement. The argument relies entirely on the immediate logical structure (bifurcation) without additional corroborative arguments.

### Step 5: Classify <s> using <IDA>
Now we will classify <s> by examining it against the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

#### Checking for <G> (Generalization)
- No generalization is being made here about individuals or groups.

#### Checking for <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)
- The argument claims to list all possible options ("We have to cut taxes or leave a huge debt"), but it is likely there are other possibilities (e.g., finding other ways to increase revenue or cut spending in other areas). This fits the definition of Incomplete Enumeration.

#### Checking for <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)
- The reason does not conclusively support the proposition. The presented choice does not account for other potential solutions.

#### Checking for <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)
- The reason does not merely repeat the proposition identically; it adds a logical bifurcation.

#### Checking for <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)
- The causal basis, a binary choice without explaining why these are the only options, is weak but this fits under <FE> more directly.

#### Checking for <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)
- The argument does not claim universal agreement or consensus, so it's not <FU>.

#### Checking for <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)
- The language is not particularly ambiguous; the terms are used clearly in context.

### Step 6: Conclude the Classification
Given the checks and fit, the best classification for the argument type in the string "We either have to cut taxes or leave a huge debt for our children." is <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration).

Therefore, according to <IDAA>, the defective argument type for the string is classified as <FE>.
