For 
To apply <IDAA>—the decomposition of the task of classification <IDA>—to the string "You can either support our police or Black Lives Matter," we will break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Proposition <P>
Identify the main proposition set forth in the argument.
- Proposition <P>: "You can either support our police or Black Lives Matter."

### Step 2: Analyze the Reason <R>
If stated, identify the reason that supports the proposition.
- In this string, no explicit reason <R> is provided.

### Step 3: Analyze the Proof of Reason <PR>
If stated, identify the proof provided to corroborate the reason.
- In this string, no explicit proof of reason <PR> is provided.

### Step 4: Classify the Type of Defective Argument
Evaluate the string "You can either support our police or Black Lives Matter" based on the definitions of defective argument types.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The string does not attempt to generalize a property from one or a few instances to all instances.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The <P> ("You can either support our police or Black Lives Matter") falsely presents a binary choice, ignoring other possibilities. It implies there are only two options, which is a classic case of incomplete enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - No explicit reason <R> is provided, so this does not apply here.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - No explicit reason <R> is provided, so this does not apply here.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - No separate reason <R> is provided that repeats <P>, so this does not apply here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - No consensus is presumed to be universal in the string, so this does not apply here.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
   - The language is quite clear in its bifurcation, does not seem to suffer from ambiguous interpretation.

### Step 5: Conclusion
Based on the analysis above, the string "You can either support our police or Black Lives Matter" falls under the category of **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**. This is because it presents a false dichotomy by claiming that one must choose between supporting either the police or Black Lives Matter, without considering that one could potentially support both or have other nuanced positions.

**Classification: Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**.
