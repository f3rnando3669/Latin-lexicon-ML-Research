To apply the process of decomposing the task of classifying the string into steps and then identifying the type of defective argument, we need to follow a structured approach. Here, we'll break down the classification task (IDA) into specific steps (D) and then apply these steps to the given string.

### Decomposition (D) of the Task (IDA) into Specific Steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine the main assertion or proposition put forth in the argument.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Determine the reasoning or causal basis provided to support the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**: Assess any additional arguments or evidence used to corroborate the reason.
4. **Classify the Argument (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP)**:
    - **Generalization (G)**: Check if the proposition is a general assertion based on insufficient or non-representative evidence.
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Check if all pertinent possibilities are not considered.
    - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Check if the reason doesn’t conclusively support the proposition.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Check if the reason provided lacks a strong causal basis.
    - **Circular Reasoning/Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Check if the reason merely repeats the proposition in different words.
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Check if the proof of reason is assumed certain based on a disputed consensus.
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Check for ambiguity in the language that could lead to different interpretations.

### Application of IDAA:

Now, let's apply this decomposition to analyze the given string: "You can start a family early, or build financial stability for a better family life in the future.”

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - **P**: "You can start a family early" or "You can build financial stability for a better family life in the future."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - The statement doesn’t explicitly provide a causal basis or a reason for either proposition. It presents two alternative courses of action without explaining the rationale behind them.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   - The string does not contain any further evidence or additional arguments to support the given propositions.

4. **Classify the Argument**:
   - The string compares two different options but does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of either option. This implies an incomplete consideration of possibilities.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument presents a false dilemma by implying that these are the only two choices available or relevant when discussing family planning and financial stability. However, it does not account for other possibilities such as balancing both goals simultaneously or prioritizing other aspects of life.

Therefore, based on the detailed examination:

### Conclusion:
- The string "You can start a family early, or build financial stability for a better family life in the future." falls under the defective argument type **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**. This is because it suggests a limited set of possibilities without considering all relevant alternatives.
