For 
To apply the concept of <IDAA> (decomposition of an advanced task into specific steps) to the task of classifying the string ", when in fact more possibilities exist." as one of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>), we must first decompose the task (<IDA>) step by step. Here's the step-by-step decomposition and analysis:

### Step 1: Parse the String
Start by analyzing the given string as a candidate for a defective argument type:

**String:** ", when in fact more possibilities exist."

### Step 2: Identify Context
Understand the context and the general meaning of the string. The phrase suggests that there are more possibilities than initially considered.

### Step 3: Consider Each Defective Argument Type
Review each defective argument type to see which one fits the string:

1. **<G> (Generalization):**
   - **Definition:** Where the <P> is an assertion based on some one part or on a majority of individuals, but not necessarily applicable to all, is referred to all.
   - **Analysis:** The string does not discuss majority or minority applicability.

2. **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):**
   - **Definition:** Where the <P> is defective when we claim to have made a complete enumeration of the possibilities, but actually miss out on some pertinent ones.
   - **Analysis:** The phrase explicitly mentions that more possibilities exist, indicating that an enumeration of all possibilities was incomplete.

3. **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):**
   - **Definition:** Where <R> does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the <P>.
   - **Analysis:** The string does not deal with the conclusive demonstration of a reason.

4. **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):**
   - **Definition:** Where a <R> is weak when it appears to be presented as the <R>, but says precisely the same as was said in the <P>.
   - **Analysis:** The string doesn't repeat the proposition; it indicates missing possibilities.

5. **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):**
   - **Definition:** Where <R> is weak if the causal basis which it submits for the <P> is not a compelling one.
   - **Analysis:** The string doesn't address the strength or weakness of a causal basis.

6. **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):**
   - **Definition:** Where a <PR> is assumed as certain, on the ground that "it is universally agreed upon," a thing which is still in dispute.
   - **Analysis:** The string does not reference consensus or agreement.

7. **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):**
   - **Definition:** Where a <PR> can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended.
   - **Analysis:** The string does not seem to involve ambiguous language.

### Step 4: Select the Matching Type
On the basis of the analysis, the string fits the definition of <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration) most closely.

### Conclusion
**Result:** The string ", when in fact more possibilities exist." is classified as <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration).

### Summary
- **String:** ", when in fact more possibilities exist."
- **Defective Argument Type:** <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)

Using the decomposition of steps, we classified the string by evaluating the context and comparing it against the definitions of defective argument types.
