For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to the string "In the United States, one can vote for either Democrats or Republicans," we will decomposed the advanced task \( \text{IDA} \) (classifying the given string as of type \( \text{G} \), \( \text{FE} \), \( \text{IR} \), \( \text{RR} \), \( \text{WCB} \), \( \text{FU} \), or \( \text{DEP} \)) into specific steps (\( \text{D} \)) and follow them. Here are the specific steps for this approach:

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( \text{P} \))**:
   - Break down the given string to isolate the main assertion or proposition. 

2. **Analyze the Assertion**:
   - Determine whether the assertion fits any of the defective argument categories (\( \text{G} \), \( \text{FE} \), \( \text{IR} \), \( \text{RR} \), \( \text{WCB} \), \( \text{FU} \), or \( \text{DEP} \)).

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\( \text{P} \))

The given string is: "In the United States, one can vote for either Democrats or Republicans."

The proposition (\( \text{P} \)) here is:
- "One can vote for either Democrats or Republicans in the United States."

#### Step 2: Analyze the Assertion

Now, we will analyze this proposition against each defective argument type.

- **Generalization (\( \text{G} \))**:
  - Is the assertion making a general claim based on limited evidence? 
  - **Analysis**: The assertion is somewhat categorical but does not generalize based on limited evidence. It simply states a perceived binary option.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (\( \text{FE} \))**:
  - Does the assertion claim to have enumerated all possibilities but miss some?
  - **Analysis**: The assertion indeed enumerates only two possibilities for voting and claims completeness by specifying "either Democrats or Republicans," which may miss out on other options like third-party candidates or independent candidates.

- **Inconclusive Reason (\( \text{IR} \))**:
  - Does the reason provided not conclusively support the proposition?
  - **Analysis**: There is no explicit reason provided in the assertion.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( \text{RR} \))**:
  - Does the reason repeat the proposition without adding new information?
  - **Analysis**: There is no distinct reason provided separately from the proposition.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( \text{WCB} \))**:
  - Is the causal basis for the reason weak?
  - **Analysis**: Again, no causal basis is provided in the assertion itself.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (\( \text{FU} \))**:
  - Is the proof of reason assumed as certain because it is "universally agreed"?
  - **Analysis**: There is no claim of universal agreement present in the assertion.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (\( \text{DEP} \))**:
  - Can the proposition or proof of reason be interpreted differently than intended?
  - **Analysis**: The assertion is clear in its language without an obvious second interpretation.

Given this analysis, the most fitting classification for the defective argument type is **Incomplete Enumeration (\( \text{FE} \))** because the assertion claims a situation of complete enumeration by stating "either Democrats or Republicans," thus missing out on other voting options available in the United States like third-party or independent candidates.

### Conclusion

Applying \( \text{IDAA} \) to the string "In the United States, one can vote for either Democrats or Republicans" identifies the defective argument type as **Incomplete Enumeration (\( \text{FE} \))**.
