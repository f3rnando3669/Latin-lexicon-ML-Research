For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "We can give cadets awards for doing well, or we can have a disciplined squadron. We can’t do both,” let's break down the task <IDA> of classifying the statement into specific steps, which is the process <D>. Here are the steps for the decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine the main assertion the argument is making.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the causal basis provided for the proposition.
3. **Identify any Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Determine any supporting arguments that corroborate the reason.
4. **Classify the Argument Type (<IDA>)**:
   - Check if the proposition might be a Generalization (<G>).
   - Check if the proposition has Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>).
   - Check if the reason is Inconclusive (<IR>).
   - Check if there is Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).
   - Check if the reason is a Faulty Repetition of the Proposition (<RR>).
   - Check if the proof of reason is a Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>).
   - Check if there is Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

Following these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The main assertion is: "We can give cadets awards for doing well, or we can have a disciplined squadron." 

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason provided is: "We can’t do both."

### Step 3: Identify any Proof of Reason (<PR>)
There is no additional proof provided to support the reason in this statement.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument Type (<IDA>)

- **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement does not seem to be extending the attributes of a part or majority to the whole.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement sets up a false dichotomy, asserting there are only two mutually exclusive options without considering other possibilities. This is a classic case of incomplete enumeration.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The statement assumes that one action precludes the other without conclusive evidence. This overlaps with incomplete enumeration but primarily fits <FE>.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal connection between giving awards and maintaining discipline is not compellingly demonstrated.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The reason provided is not just a repetition of the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: There's no claim to universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The language is not particularly ambiguous.

### Conclusion
The argument type most fitting for the statement "We can give cadets awards for doing well, or we can have a disciplined squadron. We can’t do both” is Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>).

Thus, applying <IDAA>, we classify the argument as <FE>.
