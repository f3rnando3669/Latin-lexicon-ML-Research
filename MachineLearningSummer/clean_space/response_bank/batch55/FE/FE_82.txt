For 
To apply \(IDAA\) (the decomposition and classification process) to the argument provided, let's take it step by step.

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\(P\)) and Reason (\(R\)) in \(s\):**
- **Proposition (\(P\)):** "We must raise tuition to cover the cost of new books."
- **Reason (\(R\)):** "Otherwise, the school library will close!"

**Step 2: Evaluate whether the Reason (\(R\)) is logically sound and provides a compelling causal basis for the Proposition (\(P\)).**
- The Reason (\(R\)), which is "Otherwise, the school library will close!", implies that the only way to keep the library open is by raising tuition for new books. This sets up an either/or scenario, but doesn't consider other potential solutions.

**Step 3: Determine if the issued Reason (\(R\)) suffers from any of the defects defined.**

Let's analyze it against each defect:
- **Generalization (\(G\))**: This argument does not fit the characteristics of generalization. It is not broadening a statement based on one or few instances.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\(FE\))**: This seems closer. The argument presents a false dilemma, implying that no other options exist to avoid the library's closure other than raising tuition. It may be missing other potential solutions to the problem.
- **Inconclusive Reason (\(IR\))**: The Reason provided is speculating on the consequences without definitive proof that raising tuition is the only solution.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(WCB\))**: The causal connection here is weak because there may be other methods to fund the library which are not considered.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(RR\))**: The Reason does not merely restate the Proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (\(FU\))**: The Reason is not claiming universal agreement on something in dispute.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (\(DEP\))**: The Reason is not using language that could be interpreted differently than intended.

**Step 4: Classify the fallacy.**

Based on the analysis, the strongest match appears to be **“Incomplete Enumeration” (\(FE\))**, because the argument falsely narrows the options to a binary choice, missing out on other possibilities such as alumni donations, grants, budget reallocations, etc.

Therefore, this argument is an example of:

**Incomplete Enumeration (\(FE\)).**
