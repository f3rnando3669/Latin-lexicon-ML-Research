For 
Let's apply the decomposition task, <D>, to the classification task <IDA> step by step to identify the type of defective argument in the given statement:

### Step-by-Step IDAA Application

**Step 1: Break down the argument into its components**
1. **Proposition (<P>):** The expectation of strong opposition to the amendment when it is voted on next month.
2. **Reason (<R>):** Recent polling indicates that no voters in the county are strongly in favor of the proposed amendment.

**Step 2: Evaluate the Reason (<R>) for defects**
We need to classify the reason provided (<R>) against the given defective argument types.

**Step 3: Compare <R> with defective argument types**

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - This would mean that an assertion is based on a part or majority but applied universally. In this case, it doesn't seem to assert beyond what the polling data suggests; thus, not <G>.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - This would imply that the argument claims to cover all possibilities but misses out on some. There's no indication that the Reason claims to be an exhaustive list of all possible opinions, so not <FE>.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - This would mean the reason doesn't conclusively support the proposition. Here, recent polling just indicates a lack of strong support but does not account for possible voter turnout, swing votes, or apathy, which means it doesn't conclusively prove there will be strong opposition. This suggests <IR>.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The Reason needs a strong causal link to the Proposition. While the polling indicates something, it doesn't provide a compelling causal basis for predicting strong opposition (rather, it suggests a lack of strong support). This suggests <WCB>.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - This is where the Reason just repeats the Proposition. The Reason here is not a repetition of the Proposition, so not <RR>.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - This implies assuming something is agreed upon when it is not. The statement doesnâ€™t claim universal agreement, so not <FU>.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - This involves ambiguous language. The statement is quite clear in its polling data and what it implies, so not <DEP>.

**Step 4: Make a determination**
Given the analysis, <R> seems to fall into both <IR> and <WCB> but more strongly aligns with <IR> since the Reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition (expectation of strong opposition).

Therefore, the defective argument type for the given statement is primarily **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**.
