For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument type) to the specific string "You can either start using plastic straws or continue killing ocean life with plastic pollution," we need to break down the advanced task of classifying the string into specific steps as follows:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA> (Defective Argument Classification):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The proposition in the argument is: "You can either start using plastic straws or continue killing ocean life with plastic pollution."

2. **Determine the Type of Defective Argument by Analyzing Components:**
   - Break down the proposition into its components and evaluate for any logical flaws.

3. **Analyse for Specific Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** Does the argument apply a general rule from a limited sample?
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Does the argument claim a complete list of possibilities but ignore others?
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Does the reason provided fail to conclusively support the proposition?
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Is the causal basis not compelling enough?
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Does the reason merely repeat the proposition?
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Does the argument claim consensus on a disputed point?
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Can the argument be interpreted differently than the speaker intended?

### Application of Steps to the Given String:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>):

- **Proposition (<P>):** "You can either start using plastic straws or continue killing ocean life with plastic pollution."

### Step 2: Determine the Type of Defective Argument by Analyzing Components:

- The proposition presents a binary choice, implying these are the only two options.

### Step 3: Analyse for Specific Defective Argument Types:

- **Generalization (<G>):** This doesn't seem to generalize from limited data.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument indeed claims there are only two possibilities, ignoring other potential solutions like using alternative biodegradable straws, reducing overall plastic use, recycling, or implementing more effective waste management systems.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Not applicable here as there's no explicit separate reason given.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Not applicable here as the causal link isn't weak but rather misleading by omission.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Not applicable here since there is no separate reason given.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Not applicable here.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Not applicable here since the language used is clear, but the argument is an oversimplification.

### Conclusion:
The given string "You can either start using plastic straws or continue killing ocean life with plastic pollution." is best classified as an **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**. This is because it presents a false dilemma by omitting other viable options for addressing plastic pollution, therefore failing to consider the complete range of possibilities.

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the provided string results in identifying it as an Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>).
