For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "You can go to bed in 5 minutes or you can go to bed in ten minutes. What's your choice?", we need to decompose the task of classifying the string into the broken-down steps of the classification process. Here is the step-by-step procedure:

1. **Understand the Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (G)**
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**

2. **Analyze the Given String for the Argument Structure:**
   - "`You can go to bed in 5 minutes or you can go to bed in ten minutes. What's your choice?`" does not explicitly present a complex argument structure with a Proposition (P), Reason (R), or Proof of Reason (PR). Rather, it presents a choice between two options.

3. **Detect Defective Argument Elements:**
   - Looking closer, we realize the statement might imply that the choice is complete and exhaustive, i.e., the only options are going to bed in 5 minutes or in 10 minutes.

4. **Classify Based on Defective Arguments Definitions:**
   - **Generalization (G):** This doesn't seem to involve asserting something about all members of a group based on a sample.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The statement presents a limited set of choices but does not cover all possible options for going to bed (e.g., immediately, after 15 minutes, etc.). This indicates an incomplete enumeration.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** There is no apparent reasoning provided that needs to be demonstrated as conclusive or inconclusive.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** No causal basis is given or needed here.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** There is no repeating proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument does not rely on assumed universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language is clear and not ambiguous.

5. **Determine the Final Classification:**
   - Given that the argument presents limited options but does not cover all possibilities, it falls under **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**.

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the given string, we classify it as type **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**.
