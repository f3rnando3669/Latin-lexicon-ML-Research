To apply the technique of IDAA (the application of task decomposition to the task of identifying defective arguments), we'll break down the process step by step. The goal is to classify the given string as one of the defective argument types defined earlier. Here is how we can proceed:

### Step 1: Identify the Components of the Argument

First, let's break down the given string into its argument components (Proposition, Reason, and Proof of Reason if available):

**String:**
"**You've got to teach the boys logic!** If you don't teach them logic, they won't learn how to think, and **they'll become hobos and die in prison!** Don't you care about your sons? (Mother to Father)"

- **Proposition (P):** "You've got to teach the boys logic!"
- **Reason (R):** "If you don't teach them logic, they won't learn how to think, and they'll become hobos and die in prison!"
- **Implied Challenge/Question (CQ):** Not an essential part of argument structure but adds emotional weight – "Don't you care about your sons?"

### Step 2: Verify the Completeness and Relevance of Components

**Proposition (P):**
Is the claim the speaker intends to prove:
- "You've got to teach the boys logic!"

**Reason (R):**
The causal basis given to support (P):
- "If you don't teach them logic, they won't learn how to think, and they'll become hobos and die in prison!"

Is there Proof of Reason (PR)?
- There is no additional corroboration provided beyond the assertion within the Reason (R).

### Step 3: Classify the Argument Based on Given Defective Types

Now, let's classify (R) under different defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - **Test**: Is the assertion based on some part/majority and inaccurately applied to all?
   - **Analysis**: The assertion that not learning logic will inevitably lead to becoming hobos and dying in prison is an overgeneralization.
   - **Classification**: This fits the classification of **Generalization (G)**.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - **Test**: Does it incorrectly claim to enumerate all possibilities?
   - **Analysis**: The argument does not attempt to list all alternatives or possibilities.
   - **Classification**: Does not fit **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - **Test**: Does the reason conclusively demonstrate the proposition?
   - **Analysis**: The Reason does not conclusively connect the lack of learning logic to the extreme outcomes stated.
   - **Classification**: Fits **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - **Test**: Is the causal basis weak or not compelling?
   - **Analysis**: The causal connection between learning logic and avoiding extreme negative outcomes is weak.
   - **Classification**: Fits **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - **Test**: Does the Reason merely restate the Proposition?
   - **Analysis**: The Reason does not repeat the Proposition exactly, it extends the discussion, though weakly.
   - **Classification**: Does not fit **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - **Test**: Does it assume a universal agreement that's still in dispute?
   - **Analysis**: Assumes common knowledge or consensus about outcomes of not learning logic incorrectly.
   - **Classification**: Fits **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - **Test**: Could the Proof of Reason be interpreted differently than intended?
   - **Analysis**: There’s no significant ambiguity in the language context.
   - **Classification**: Does not fit **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**.

### Step 4: Conclusion

The argument exhibits multiple defective characteristics. 
Predominantly, it fits **Generalization (G)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, and **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.

By **IDAA** (decomposition), we classify the string as primarily a case of **Generalization (G)** due to the sweeping connection between not learning logic and ending up in severe life conditions. Additionally, it exemplifies **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, and **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** due to weak causal connection, a general assumption of dire outcomes, and assuming consensus on the importance of learning logic to such an extreme degree.
