To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying the string into steps) to the provided string, we'll follow a systematic approach to diagnose it step by step:

**Step 1: Understand the String**

"Whilst rallying support for his plan to fundamentally undermine citizens' rights, the Supreme Leader told the people they were either on his side, or they were on the side of the enemy."

**Step 2: Identify the Proposition <P>**

In this string, the proposition (<P>) (the main assertion or statement being made) appears to be:
- "The Supreme Leader told the people they were either on his side, or they were on the side of the enemy."

**Step 3: Identify the Reason <R>**

To find the reason (<R>), look at what is being used to support the proposition:
- From the string, it is implied that the reason is a dichotomous framing, "either on his side, or ... on the side of the enemy."

**Step 4: Confirm the Presence of a Proof of Reason <PR>**

Here, the statement mostly stays within a dichotomous proposition and doesn't explicitly provide additional arguments (proofs) to corroborate the presented Reason.

**Step 5: Determine Argument Type**

Next, we check the argument against recognized defective argument types.

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - Not applicable, since it doesn't generalize from a specific instance to an entire group.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - Relevant. The statement presents a dichotomy (either on his side or the side of the enemy) which overlooks other possibilities, hence failing to enumerate all potential stances.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - Could apply, since the reason given doesn't conclusively establish the correctness of the <P>.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - Not directly applicable in this context.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - Doesn't apply here; the Reason isn't repeating the Proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - Not applicable, no universal agreement claim here.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
   - There is no ambiguity in language that leads to misinterpretation present.

**Step 6: Classify the String**

Given that the proposition creates a false dichotomy by presenting the audience with only two possible options without acknowledging other potential stances, the defect is best described by **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**.

**Conclusion:**

The string "Whilst rallying support for his plan to fundamentally undermine citizens' rights, the Supreme Leader told the people they were either on his side, or they were on the side of the enemy." should be classified as of type **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**.
