To apply the decomposition of the advanced task \(<D>\) to the task \(<IDA>\) and classify the given string as one of the defective argument types, we can break it down into a series of specific steps. We'll call this process \(<IDAA>\).

Here's the detailed step-by-step breakdown of \(<IDAA>\), applied to the string "Either you are for us, or you're against us!":

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\(<P>\))
First, we need to extract and identify the main assertion or proposition (\(<P>\)) set forth in the string.

**Proposition (\(<P>\))**: "Either you are for us, or you're against us!"

### Step 2: Look for the Reason (\(<R>\))
Identify if there is a causal basis (\(<R>\)) for the proposition that establishes its truth.

**Reason (\(<R>\))**: The statement does not explicitly give a causal basis; it sets a binary choice without explaining why these are the only options.

### Step 3: Seek Proof of Reason (\(<PR>\))
Check if there's any proof or additional argument (\(<PR>\)) provided to corroborate the reason.

**Proof of Reason (\(<PR>\))**: The statement provides no additional arguments or proof.

### Step 4: Identify Defective Argument Type
Now we need to classify the defective argument type based on the definitions given:

- **\(G\)**: Generalization – The statement does not generalize from a part to the whole.
- **\(FE\)**: Incomplete Enumeration – The statement presents two options as the complete set of possibilities.
- **\(IR\)**: Inconclusive Reason – No reason is provided to demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **\(WCB\)**: Insufficient Causal Basis – No causal basis is provided, weak or otherwise.
- **\(RR\)**: Faulty Repetition of Proposition – The reason just restates the proposition (though in this case, no explicit reason was given).
- **\(FU\)**: Presumptuous Consensus – No claim is made about universal agreement.
- **\(DEP\)**: Ambiguous Language Use – The language does not seem ambiguous but sets a false dichotomy.

### Step 5: Determine the Closest Defective Argument Type
Given the options, “Either you are for us, or you're against us!” most closely fits:

- **\(FE\)**: Incomplete Enumeration – The proposition is defective because it claims to have enumerated all possibilities but actually misses out on other pertinent options such as neutrality or partial agreement/disagreement.

### Conclusion
Hence, the string "Either you are for us, or you're against us!" is best classified as an example of **Incomplete Enumeration (\(<FE>\))**.

This completes the application of \(<IDAA>\) to the given string.
