For 
To apply \( <IDAA> \) to the task of classifying the argument "Either you are with me or you are against me," we need to decompose the advanced task \( <IDA> \) into specific steps.

Here is the decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( <P> \)) and Reason (\( <R> \))**:
   - In the statement "Either you are with me or you are against me", the \( <P> \) is the proposition being asserted, i.e., a dichotomy of being either with or against the speaker.
   - No explicit \( <R> \) is provided in this statement. 

2. **Evaluate type of defective argument \( <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP> \)**:
   - **Generalization (\( <G> \))**: Does the proposition incorrectly generalize from limited data to all cases?
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (\( <FE> \))**: Does the proposition wrongly claim a complete enumeration of possibilities?
   - **Inconclusive Reason (\( <IR> \))**: Is any reason given insufficient to support the proposition? (Since there is no explicit reason in the statement, this may not apply directly).
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( <RR> \))**: Does the reason merely repeat the proposition without adding new information?
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( <WCB> \))**: Is the causal basis weak if it were to exist?
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (\( <FU> \))**: Does it assume a consensus that does not exist?
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (\( <DEP> \))**: Could the language be taken in another sense than intended?

3. **Analyze the context and nuances for each type**:
   - **Generalization (\( <G> \))**: Here, the statement is not about a majority or minority, but about an absolute dichotomy. It does not fall into \( <G> \).
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (\( <FE> \))**: The statement presents a binary choice, excluding other possibilities such as neutrality, more nuanced positions, or different contexts. This suggests that it might be an instance of \( <FE> \).
   - **Inconclusive Reason (\( <IR> \))**: There is no reason ( \( <R> \)) provided that could be inconclusive, so \( <IR> \) is not applicable here.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( <RR> \))**: Since there is no explicit reason, \( <RR> \) does not apply.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( <WCB> \))**: Without a clear reason provided, this does not apply.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (\( <FU> \))**: The statement does not claim consensus, so \( <FU> \) doesnâ€™t apply.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (\( <DEP> \))**: The language of "with me" or "against me" is not particularly ambiguous; it is clear and direct.

4. **Conclude the classification**:
    Based on the analysis, the most appropriate classification of the argument "Either you are with me or you are against me" is \( <FE> \):
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (\( <FE> \))**: This argument is defective because it falsely presents only two possibilities as a complete enumeration, neglecting other possible stances or nuances.

So, the argument "Either you are with me or you are against me" is classified as \( <FE> \) - Incomplete Enumeration.
