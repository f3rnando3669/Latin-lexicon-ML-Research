Sure, let's proceed step by step to apply <IDAA> to the statement: "I’m raising funds to help cure XYZ disease. If you don’t donate, then you’re part of the problem."

### Step 1: Decompose the task <IDA>:
The goal of <IDA> is to classify the argument as one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step 2: Analyze the statement:
- **Proposition (<P>)**: "I’m raising funds to help cure XYZ disease."
- **Reason (<R>)**: "If you don’t donate, then you’re part of the problem."

### Step 3: Identify potential defects:

#### Examine for <G> (Generalization):
- Check if the <P> or <R> involves an unwarranted generalization.
- The statement does not generalize based on insufficient data. No generalization fallacy detected.

#### Examine for <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):
- Check if the <P> claims completeness but misses possibilities.
- The statement does not enumerate possibilities, so <FE> is not applicable here.

#### Examine for <IR> (Inconclusive Reason):
- Check if the <R> does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the <P>.
- The reason provided ("If you don’t donate, then you’re part of the problem") does not conclusively establish that raising funds will cure the disease. It pressures by inducing guilt rather than providing a causal link between donation and cure.

#### Examine for <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):
- Check if the <R> merely repeats the <P>.
- The reason provided does not just repeat the proposition. Thus, <RR> is not applicable here.

#### Examine for <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):
- Check if the causal basis for the <P> is insufficient.
- The causal relationship between not donating and being part of the problem is weak as it fails to substantiate the direct impact of an individual's donation on the cure. This fits the definition of insufficient causal basis.

#### Examine for <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):
- Check if the <PR> assumes consensus where there is none.
- There is no assumed universal agreement stated, thus <FU> is not applicable.

#### Examine for <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):
- Check if ambiguous language allows for multiple interpretations of the <PR>.
- The terms used are clear and not ambiguous, so <DEP> is not applicable.

### Step 4: Classify the argument:
Based on the analysis:

- <IR> (Inconclusive Reason): The reason does not conclusively prove the proposition.
- <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis): The causal basis presented is weak.

### Conclusion:
The argument "I’m raising funds to help cure XYZ disease. If you don’t donate, then you’re part of the problem" can be classified under:
- <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)
- <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)
