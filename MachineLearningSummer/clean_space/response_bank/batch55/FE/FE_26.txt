To apply the decomposition of the task of classifying the statement "Either we go to war or we appear weak." into specific steps, let's elaborate on the process step-by-step. We'll try to identify which type of defective argument the statement falls into among the given options: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step 1: Identify the Major Components of the Argument
Identify the proposition (P), reason (R), and proof of reason (PR) from the statement if they exist.

#### Analysis:
The statement "Either we go to war or we appear weak." seems to be making an assertion in a binary form:
- Proposition (P): We need to go to war.
- Alternative scenario: If we do not, we will appear weak.

### Step 2: Determine the Nature of the Proposition
Analyze the proposition to see if it is asserting something broadly or inclusively.

#### Analysis:
By setting up a binary choice (go to war, or appear weak), the proposition (P) is implicitly making a broad generalization about the consequences of not going to war.

### Step 3: Match with Defective Argument Types
Examine if the statement fits any of the defective argument types based on the identified components.

#### Analysis:

1. **<G> (Generalization)**:
   The statement assumes that either one of the two outcomes will occur (go to war, or appear weak) without considering other possibilities. This is a typical trait of a false dichotomy, closely related to generalization as it oversimplifies the complexity of the situation.

2. **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**:
   The statement claims there are only two possibilities without fully enumerating all possible outcomes, which is a sign of incomplete enumeration.

3. **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**:
   There's no reason provided that conclusively supports the stark binary choice presented. It demands more explanation to show why those are the only two outcomes and why no other solutions or mitigations exist.

4. **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**:
   The argument might lack strong causation showing why not going to war makes us appear weak; however, without further reason (R), this cannot be determined from the given statement alone.

5. **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**:
   This doesn't seem to have a case of repetition. 

6. **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**:
   The argument doesn't seem to be leaning on a presumed universal consensus; therefore, this can be ruled out.

7. **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**:
   The language, while forceful, does not seem ambiguous regarding the intended sense. It is a clear binary choice presented forcefully.

### Step 4: Conclude on Classification
From the above analysis, the statement mostly aligns with being an <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration) due to its binary framing of only two outcomes, missing out on other feasible outcomes.

### Final Classification
The defective argument type of the statement "Either we go to war or we appear weak." is primarily:
**<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**
