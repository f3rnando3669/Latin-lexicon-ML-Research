For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to the statement "If Mom didn't turn off the air conditioner, then clearly she must be too hot," we'll break down each step of \( D \) in the process of classifying \( s \):

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\( P \))
Determine the main assertion that is being made in the statement.

> **Proposition (\( P \))**: Mom must be too hot.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\( R \))
Determine the causal basis that supports the proposition.

> **Reason (\( R \))**: Mom didn't turn off the air conditioner.

### Step 3: Identify the Type of Defective Argument
Next, we need to determine if the argument falls into any of the defective argument types listed. We will analyze the relationship between \( P \) and \( R \):

- **Generalization (\( G \))**: Does not apply as the statement does not generalize from a part to the whole.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\( FE \))**: Does not apply as it does not claim to exhaust all possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \))**: Possibly applicable. The reason alone (Mom didn’t turn off the air conditioner) may not conclusively demonstrate that she must be too hot, as there could be other reasons for not turning it off (e.g., she forgot, she thinks someone else might want it on).
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \))**: Applicable. The causal basis (\( R \)) is not sufficiently compelling to prove the proposition (\( P \)).
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( RR \))**: Does not apply as \( R \) and \( P \) are not saying the exact same thing.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (\( FU \))**: Does not apply as the argument does not invoke a consensus.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (\( DEP \))**: Does not appear to apply, as the language in the proposition and reason is clear and unambiguous.

### Step 4: Conclusion
Based on our analysis, the statement fits most appropriately under the defective argument type of Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \)). The reason given (Mom didn’t turn off the air conditioner) is not a strong enough causal basis to conclusively establish the proposition (Mom must be too hot).

Therefore, the application of \( IDAA \) to the statement yields:

> **Classification (\( IDA \))**: \( WCB \) (Insufficient Causal Basis).
