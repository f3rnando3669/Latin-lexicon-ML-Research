To apply the process of decomposing the task of identifying a defective argument type to the given statement "Force people to choose between two extreme choices intentionally ignoring the whole spectrum of other possibilities," we need to follow a series of systematic steps. Here's how <IDAA> can be applied to this <IDA> task step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Statement
First, we comprehend the given statement thoroughly:
- "Force people to choose between two extreme choices" implies presenting only two options that are at extremes.
- "Intentionally ignoring the whole spectrum of other possibilities" indicates a deliberate omission of other potential options.

### Step 2: Identify the Argument Structure
Let's interpret the structure and identify where the statement fits:
- The statement asserts a scenario in which a choice is forced between two extremes.
- There's an underlying reasoning implied here that suggesting this binary choice is somehow faulty due to the ignored spectrum of options.

### Step 3: Match the Statement with Defective Argument Types
Next, we'll compare this scenario with known defective argument types to identify a potential match:
1. **Generalization (G)**: This type misses generalizing based on insufficient data. Irrelevant here.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Claims a complete enumeration but misses some possibilities. This seems probable.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Reason doesn't conclusively prove the proposition. Probably not fitting here.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: We need to examine if there's a weak causal argument. Probably not fitting here.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Repeating the proposition as reason. Irrelevant here.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assumption based on presumed consensus. Irrelevant here.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Ambiguity in the language used. Irrelevant here.

### Step 4: Analyze Incomplete Enumeration
Given that "incomplete enumeration" claims to have considered all options but neglects some, it aligns closely with the statement. The act of presenting only two extreme choices while ignoring other possibilities reflects this defect.

### Step 5: Conclude the Classification
Based on the decomposition and alignment:
- The statement "Force people to choose between two extreme choices intentionally ignoring the whole spectrum of other possibilities" fits the definition of **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**.

### Conclusion
Therefore, applying <IDAA> to the statement leads us to classify the argument type as **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**.
