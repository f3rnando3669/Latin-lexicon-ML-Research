For 
To apply IDAA to the given string "Caldwell Hall is in bad shape. Either we tear it down and put up a new building, or we continue to risk students’ safety. Obviously we shouldn’t risk anyone’s safety, so we must tear the building down.", we'll decompose the task into specific steps and analyze each step to classify the string according to the defective argument types defined earlier.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Analysis:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition is the main statement or claim that is being made. 
- In this case, the proposition is: "Caldwell Hall is in bad shape."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason sets forth the causal basis for the proposition.
- The reason provided is: "Either we tear it down and put up a new building, or we continue to risk students’ safety."

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
The proof of reason corroborates the reason by means of additional arguments.
- The proof of reason here is: "Obviously we shouldn’t risk anyone’s safety, so we must tear the building down."

#### Step 4: Classify the Argument
Now that we have identified <P>, <R>, and <PR>, we need to classify the argument type based on the defective argument categories.

#### Analysis:
1. **Generalization (<G>):**
    - Does the argument generalize from a single or non-representative sample to a broader conclusion?
    - This does not seem to be a case of generalization because the argument does not rely on an insufficient sample size.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
    - Does the argument claim to enumerate all possibilities but miss pertinent ones?
    - The argument presents only two options: tearing down the building or risking safety. It doesn't consider other potential solutions (e.g., renovating the building). This could be an example of Incomplete Enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
    - Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
    - The reason here asserts that the only options are tearing down the building or risking safety, without demonstrating why there are no other viable solutions. This suggests that the reasoning is inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
    - Is the causal basis weak or unconvincing in supporting the proposition?
    - The causal basis involves a false dilemma (either/or fallacy) which makes the causal basis weak, tipping towards this category as well.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
    - Is the reason just a restatement of the proposition?
    - The reason is not merely a restatement of the proposition; it introduces a conditional statement.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
    - Does the proof of reason assume consensus on a disputed matter?
    - The argument implies that risking students' safety is universally unacceptable (which is likely uncontested) but the leap to tearing down the building might assume all agree without sufficient argument. This aspect exists but is not as clear cut.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
    - Can the proof of reason be interpreted differently than intended by the speaker?
    - There does not seem to be ambiguous language that could be taken in a sense other than what the speaker intended here.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the string most clearly fits the defective argument type:

**Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** – The argument presents a false dichotomy, ignoring other possible solutions for ensuring safety without tearing down the building.

It also arguably fits:
**Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** – The reasoning does not fully conclude the issue, as it presents a limited perspective on the potential solutions, leading to a weak causal basis.
 
So the primary classification is:
### Classification: <FE>
