To apply the task of classifying the given string as one of the types of defective arguments using the steps of decomposition, let's proceed step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Definitions

First, let's recall the defined types of defective arguments:

1. **Generalization (<G>)** 
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**

### Step 2: Analyze the Given String

The provided string is as follows:

1. The discussion starts by mentioning an argument for the existence of God.
2. It points out the evolution of arguments from creationism to intelligent design as scientific understanding advances.
3. It suggests a pattern where arguments for God change as scientific explanations become available (classic argument from ignorance).
4. It distinguishes this pattern from the logical fallacy "moving the goalposts."

### Step 3: Identify Elements 

- **Proposition (<P>):** The main assertion (or claim) could revolve around the pattern of arguments for the existence of God evolving with scientific advancement.
- **Reason (<R>):** Performance of the pattern of changing arguments (once science explains a phenomenon, a new argument is posed).
- **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Instances like the move from creationism to intelligent design, and potentially, from origin of life arguments to new unknowns as science progresses.

### Step 4: Match to Defective Argument Types

1. **Generalization (<G>):** Does this argument take an assertion based on some or a majority and applies it to all?
   - Not clearly a case of overextending a specific observation to a general rule.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Is there a claim of complete enumeration of possibilities but significant ones missing?
   - There is no enumeration of possibilities being claimed as exhaustive.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Does the provided reasoning not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
   - The reasoning here appears to be historical and observational rather than conclusive or definitive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Is the causal connection weakly established?
   - The reason provided is based on a historical pattern, but it doesnâ€™t strongly establish a causative chain for the change in arguments.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Is the reason merely repeating the proposition?
   - No evidence of repetition for pseudo-corroboration spotted.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Is the proof assumed certain because it is universally agreed upon?
   - The argument does not claim universality or consensus as proof.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Can the reasoning be taken in different senses than intended?
   - There is no significant ambiguous language to confuse the intended sense.

### Step 5: Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given argument seems to be suggesting a pattern citing historical shifts rather than providing a logically rigorous causative argument. The most fitting classification could be **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**, as it mentions a reason related to the pattern of argument evolution but provides a less compelling causal explanation.

Therefore, the classification of the given string under **IDA** would be **<WCB>**.
