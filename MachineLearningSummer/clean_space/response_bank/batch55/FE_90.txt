For 
To apply <IDAA>, which involves decomposing the task of classifying an argument (IDA) into specific steps and applying those steps to classify a given argument, let's follow a structured approach to analyze the argument, "If we are too scared to open the economy completely, then we'll have to keep it closed forever."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of IDA

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine the main statement or claim being made. 

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Extract the causal basis provided for the proposition.

3. **Analyze the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Look for supporting evidence or arguments validating the reason.

4. **Compare with Defective Argument Types:**
   - Generalization (<G>)
   - Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
   - Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
   - Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
   - Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
   - Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)

5. **Determine Defective Argument Type:**
   - Evaluate whether the argument fits into any of the defective argument categories.

### Application of <IDAA> to the Given Argument

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - "<P>": "If we are too scared to open the economy completely, then we'll have to keep it closed forever."
   - This is a conditional statement that claims a necessity to keep the economy closed if there is any fear of opening it.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The implied <R> here is the fear of opening the economy completely. The argument presupposes that fear or caution will indefinitely prevent the economy from reopening.

3. **Analyze the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - There is no direct proof presented for the reason in this statement.

4. **Compare with Defective Argument Types:**
   - Start with each defective argument type and see which one applies:
     - **Generalization (<G>):** This is not a generalization based on a part or majority as it doesn't make such comparisons.
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This does not enumerate possibilities, missing out on some. Rather, it presents a binary scenario.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason does not conclusively show that caution will lead to perpetual closure. 
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The reason is weak as it assumes fear will indefinitely influence closure without compelling evidence.
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason is not just a repetition of the proposition.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** It doesn't assume consensus on disputed points.
     - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** No ambiguity in the language as presented.

5. **Determine Defective Argument Type:**
   - The most fitting category here is **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**. The reason provided (fear of reopening) is weak and not compelling enough to logically conclude that the economy must stay closed forever.

### Conclusion

Based on the step-by-step analysis, the argument "If we are too scared to open the economy completely, then we'll have to keep it closed forever." falls under the defective argument type **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
