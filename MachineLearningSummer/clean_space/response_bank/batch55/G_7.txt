For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying the string into specific steps) to the statement "Saying that men don't ever ask for directions," we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   Start by identifying the main assertion or proposition in the statement.

   - Proposition (<P>): "Men don't ever ask for directions."

2. **Analyze the Reason (<R>) and Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   Determine if there is an explicit causal basis or any supporting evidence provided for the proposition.

   - In this instance, the statement does not provide a direct causative reason or any evidence to support it.

3. **Check for Defective Argument Types**:
   Evaluate the statement against each type of defective argument (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP) to classify it correctly.

   - **Generalization (G)**: Check if the proposition is a generalization based on a subset of individuals.
     - Yes, the statement "Men don't ever ask for directions" is a generalization, as it takes the behavior of some or many men and applies it to all men universally.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Comprehensively list all possibilities and evaluate if the proposition ignores some.
     - No, the statement is not an enumeration of possibilities, so it doesn't fit this category.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Assess if the reason provided (if any) conclusively supports the proposition.
     - The statement does not provide any reason, making this category inapplicable.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Determine if the reason (if any) provided offers a weak causal basis.
     - There's no causal reason provided, making this category inapplicable.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Check if the reason repeats the proposition.
     - No reason is provided, hence this category isn't applicable.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Investigate if the proof assumes universal agreement on a disputed issue.
     - No proof or consensus is assumed, making this category inapplicable.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Determine if the proposition or proof is ambiguous.
     - The statement is unambiguous but absolute in its phrasing.

4. **Classify the Statement**:
   Based on the analysis, classify the statement into one of the defective argument types.

   - The most fitting classification for "Saying that men don't ever ask for directions" is **Generalization (G)** because it extends an observation about some men to all men without sufficient evidence to support such a universal claim.

Therefore, "Saying that men don't ever ask for directions" classifies as Generalization (G).
