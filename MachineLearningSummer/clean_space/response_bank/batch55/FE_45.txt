To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the string "This tactic plays upon a viewer's lack of knowledge by forcing the idea that the situation is static. Unless the audience is well-informed and aware of this deception, they may think that they have only two choices," we need to decompose the task <IDA> into specific steps (as part of task <D>) and then follow these steps systematically.

### Step 1: Understanding <IDA>
**Task <IDA>**: This task is to classify the given string into one of the defective argument types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

### Step 2: Identify Components of the String
First, we need to identify the Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), and Proof of Reason (<PR>) in the string, if they are present.

**String**: "This tactic plays upon a viewer's lack of knowledge by forcing the idea that the situation is static. Unless the audience is well-informed and aware of this deception, they may think that they have only two choices."

- **Proposition (<P>)**: The main claim being made.
  - "**This tactic plays upon a viewer's lack of knowledge**."

- **Reason (<R>)**: The causal basis for the proposition.
  - "**by forcing the idea that the situation is static**."

- **Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Any additional arguments that corroborate the Reason.
  - "**Unless the audience is well-informed and aware of this deception, they may think that they have only two choices**."

### Step 3: Analyzing Defective Argument Types
Next, we analyze if the Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), or Proof of Reason (<PR>) fits into one of the defective argument types defined:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Assertion based on some or a majority of individuals but not necessarily applicable to all.
   - Not applicable. The string does not make a sweeping generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Claim to have made a complete enumeration of possibilities but misses some.
   - Possibly applicable. The string says, "the audience... may think that they have only two choices", but it implies there are only two choices without listing them or considering other options.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: <R> does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of <P>.
   - Not directly applicable. The string suggests that the audience's perception of limited choices is due to lack of knowledge, which is a plausible reason.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: <R> merely restates <P>.
   - Not applicable. The <R> that the situation is "forced to be static" elaborates rather than restates.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: <R> is not a compelling causal basis for <P>.
   - Not the strongest match, as the causal connection between lack of knowledge and the idea that the situation is static is generally credible.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: <PR> assumed as certain because "it is universally agreed upon."
   - Not applicable. The string does not claim universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: <PR> can be taken in another sense.
   - Possibly weak applicability; however, the phrase "only two choices" might be ambiguous without further context.

### Step 4: Conclusion and Classification
From the analysis above, the most fitting defective argument type appears to be **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** due to the implication that the audience may think they have only two choices without expanding on what those choices are or considering other pertinent options. Therefore, we classify the string as:

- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**

This constitutes the step-by-step application of the decomposition (D) to classify the string regarding a defective argument type (IDA).
