Sure, let's apply the step-by-step decomposition (D) process to the classification task (IDA) for the given statement: "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) for Classifying Argument Types (IDA)

1. **Identify the parts of the argument:**
   - **Proposition (P):** Donald Trump got elected.
   - **Reason (R):** because liberals took political correctness too far.

2. **Assess if Proposition (P) is a Generalization (G):**
   - Is the proposition based on an assertion that applies a characteristic to all based on some individuals or a majority?
   - No, the proposition is a specific event: Donald Trump got elected. It doesn't attempt to generalize a characteristic to all individuals or situations.

3. **Assess if Proposition (P) is an Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - Does the proposition claim to have made a complete enumeration of all possibilities but miss out on some?
   - No, the proposition does not appear to enumerate possibilities.

4. **Assess if Reason (R) is an Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - Does the reason provided (liberals took political correctness too far) conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (Donald Trump got elected)?
   - This requires evaluating whether the given reason is sufficient to serve as a direct cause for the election outcome. The reason is a specific viewpoint, but it does not conclusively demonstrate that it was the only or even the primary cause.

5. **Assess if Reason (R) is Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - Is the causal basis (liberals took political correctness too far) not compelling enough to establish the proposition (Donald Trump got elected)?
   - This is somewhat subjective, but typically this causal argument is considered insufficient since the election outcome is influenced by a multitude of factors, and this one reason alone doesn't provide a compelling causal link.

6. **Assess if Reason (R) is a Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - Does the reason simply restate the proposition in different words?
   - No, the Reason (liberals took political correctness too far) is not simply a restatement of the Proposition (Donald Trump got elected).

7. **Assess if Proof of Reason (PR) is a Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - Is the proof assumed as certain based on the notion that it is "universally agreed upon"?
   - The original statement does not provide additional proof thus there's no presumptuous consensus in this context.

8. **Assess if Proof of Reason (PR) involves Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - Can the proof be taken in another sense than intended due to ambiguous language?
   - There's no provided proof in the argument statement thus this ambiguity in proof (PR) does not apply.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evaluation of each possible defective argument type, the most fitting classification for:
"The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far."

### Analysis result:
- The argument could be deemed as having **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because the causal link provided is weak and not compelling enough to establish the claim alone without more robust evidence or consideration of multiple factors. Alternatively, it might be considered an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** due to not conclusively demonstrating the correctness of the proposition.

Thus, the most fitting defect type based on our step-by-step analysis would be **<WCB>**.
