For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string, "Eric: For my lottery numbers, I chose 6, 14, 22, 35, 38, 40.  What did you choose? Steve: I chose 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Eric: You idiot!  Those numbers will never come up!," we will first decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps and then systematically classify the string accordingly.

### Decomposition Steps (<D>):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Determine the main statement or claim being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Identify the causal basis or reasoning provided to support the Proposition.
3. **Check for Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Determine if there is any additional argumentation that corroborates the Reason.
4. **Classify the Argument Type:** Evaluate if the identified Reason and Proof of Reason (if any) align with any of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step by Step Application to the String:
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
    - Eric’s main claim is: "Those numbers will never come up!" This is the proposition he is making about Steve's lottery numbers.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
    - Eric doesn’t provide an explicit reasoning in his statement. Although he uses a strong declarative statement, he does not justify why Steve's numbers will never come up.

3. **Check for Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
    - There is no additional argumentation or evidence presented by Eric to support his Reason. His exclamation is a standalone assertion.

4. **Classify the Argument Type:**
    - Since Eric's statement lacks a causal basis and does not present any reasoning to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition, it resembles the defective argument type <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
    - The statement might also be considered as <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) if we interpret the assertion about the improbability of Steve's numbers as an inherently weak basis without additional context or support.

### Conclusion:
The argument primarily suffers from <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) because Eric does not provide any causal basis for his assertion. There is no reasoning or evidence presented to support the statement "Those numbers will never come up!" Therefore, the string can be classified under the defective argument type <IR>.
