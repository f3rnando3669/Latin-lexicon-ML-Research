For 
To apply the task of decomposing the argument classification task (known as <IDAA>) to the string "Everybody else is doing it, why don't you?", we'll follow a series of methodical steps to classify the string according to the defective argument types defined. Here we go:

### Step 1: Understand the given string
The string is: "Everybody else is doing it, why don't you?"

### Step 2: Identify the possible defective argument types
The string needs to be classified as one of these types:
- Generalization (<G>)
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
- Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
- Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)

### Step 3: Analyze the string against each argument type:
#### <G> (Generalization):
- **Examine if the argument is generalizing a specific case as universally true.**
  - The string does make an assertion based on "everybody else," suggesting a collective behavior as a basis for individual action.

#### <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):
- **Check if the argument is claiming to exhaustively cover all possibilities but misses some.**
  - The string doesn’t list out possibilities; it implies a single choice based on common action. Incomplete Enumeration doesn't seem relevant here.

#### <IR> (Inconclusive Reason):
- **Determine if the Reason supplied fails to conclusively support the Proposition.**
  - It implies that because others are doing something, you should too, but this reasoning lacks a solid basis for why an individual should follow.

#### <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):
- **Evaluate if the causal reason supplied is compelling enough for the Proposition.**
  - Similar to <IR>, the causal basis here ("everybody else is doing it") is weak as it doesn’t provide a strong reason for individual action.

#### <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):
- **See if the Reason simply repeats the Proposition without adding information.**
  - The Reason given doesn't directly repeat the Proposition; it bases the reasoning on others' actions.

#### <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):
- **Assess if the argument assumes consensus without proof of such universality.**
  - The argument does assume that "everybody else" is a consensus, but there's no clear indicator showing it as presumptuous to the extent defined by <FU>.

#### <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):
- **Evaluate if the argument is using ambiguous terms that can be interpreted differently.**
  - The argument uses terms that are fairly clear in intention; ambiguity isn't a central issue here.

### Step 4: Conclude the classification
Given the analysis:
- <G> seems to fit as the argument generalizes the behavior of others to suggest an individual should follow suit.
- <IR> and <WCB> have relevance due to the inconclusive or weak reasoning provided by the argument.

### Step 5: Determine the most relevant defective argument type
Though all three could be partially applicable, <G> (Generalization) fits most directly because the central point of the argument assumes that because a group is doing something, an individual should as well, directly embodying the essence of over-generalization.

### Conclusion:
Applying <IDAA> to "Everybody else is doing it, why don't you?" classifies the argument as type <G> (Generalization).
