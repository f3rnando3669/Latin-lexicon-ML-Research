For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the statement "Guys are messy and unclean, but are really hard workers.", we'll follow a systematic approach by breaking down the process into specific steps. Here's the decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine what is being claimed.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Identify the causal basis presented for the proposition.
3. **Check for Proof of Reason (PR)**: Verify if there are additional arguments or proofs presented for the reason.
4. **Classify Defective Argument**:
    a. Check for Generalization (G)
    b. Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
    c. Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR)
    d. Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
    e. Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
    f. Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
    g. Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)

Now let's apply these steps:

### 1. Identify the Proposition (P)
- Proposition (P): "Guys are messy and unclean, but are really hard workers."

### 2. Identify the Reason (R)
- Reason (R): There is no explicit causal basis provided in the statement, just two assertions about guys.

### 3. Check for Proof of Reason (PR)
- Proof of Reason (PR): There are no additional arguments presented to support either claim.

### 4. Classify Defective Argument

#### a. Check for Generalization (G)
- The statement is a generalization about guys being messy, unclean, and hard workers. 
- The characteristic of messiness and being unclean is attributed to "guys" in general, which may not necessarily apply to all individuals.

#### b. Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
- The argument does not involve an enumeration of possibilities, so this does not apply.

#### c. Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR)
- There is no reason provided, so this does not apply.

#### d. Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
- There is no causal basis provided, so this does not apply.

#### e. Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
- There is no repetition of the proposition, so this does not apply.

#### f. Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
- The statement does not claim universal agreement, so this does not apply.

#### g. Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)
- The terms "messy and unclean" and "hard workers" are relatively clear, so this does not apply.

### Conclusion
The statement "Guys are messy and unclean, but are really hard workers." is an example of **Generalization (G)** because it makes broad, collective assertions about a group based on characteristics that may not be universally applicable to all members of that group.
