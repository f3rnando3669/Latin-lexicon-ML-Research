For 
To apply the process of IDAA to the string "If we let this child bring the permission slip late, there is no reason to ever set a deadline for anything again!", we need to decompose the task of classifying the argument as one of the defective argument types into specific steps. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of this process:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine the main assertion or statement in the string that is intended to be proved.
   
   - **Proposition (<P>)**: "There is no reason to ever set a deadline for anything again."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine what causal basis is provided to support the Proposition.
   
   - **Reason (<R>)**: "If we let this child bring the permission slip late."

3. **Evaluate the Argument Structure**: Check the relationship between the Proposition and the Reason, and see how they are linked.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**:
    - **Generalization (<G>)**: Is the Proposition based on an assertion from one part or majority of individuals to all?
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Does the Proposition claim a complete enumeration of possibilities but misses some?
    - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Does the Reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition?
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Does the Reason merely repeat the Proposition? 
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Is the causal basis weak or not compelling enough to support the Proposition?
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Is the Proof of Reason assumed as certain based on universal agreement while it is still in dispute?
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Can the Proof of Reason be taken in another sense than intended?

5. **Compare and Match**: Based on the defects identified above, match the argument to the most appropriate defective argument type.

### Application:

**Proposition (<P>)**: "There is no reason to ever set a deadline for anything again."
   
**Reason (<R>)**: "If we let this child bring the permission slip late."

- **Evaluation**:
   - The Proposition is an extreme or broad assertion.
   - The Reason provided is a particular case of a child bringing a permission slip late.

- In this statement, the Reason does not provide a strong causal basis for the Proposition. Allowing one child to bring a permission slip late does not logically lead to the conclusion that there should be no deadlines at all for anything in the future. This seems to suffer a flaw in logical reasoning.

### Classification:

The argument fits the definition of **Generalization (<G>)**. It takes a specific instance (a child bringing the permission slip late) and generalizes it to an extreme and broad conclusion (no reason to set any deadlines ever again).

So the classification of the string is:

**<G> Generalization**

Thus, following the structured approach, we have classified the argument as a Generalization (<G>) because it broadly generalizes from a specific instance to an unjustifiably broad conclusion.
