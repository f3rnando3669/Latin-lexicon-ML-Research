For 
To apply <IDAA> (decomposition of the task IDA) to classify the given string based on the specified defective argument types, we proceed step by step:

1. **Identify and Understand the Components of the Argument**:
   - **Proposition (P)**: A claim or statement that is intended to be proven.
   - **Reason (R)**: The causal basis or rationale provided to support the proposition.
   - **Proof of Reason (PR)**: Additional arguments or evidence that support the reason.

2. **Analyze the Provided String**:
   The provided string is: "Bill claims that tax breaks for corporations increases development. Of course, Bill is the CEO of a corporation."

3. **Break Down the Argument**:
   - Proposition (P): "Tax breaks for corporations increase development."
   - Implicit Reason (R): It is assumed that Bill's position (as the CEO of a corporation) implies a conflict of interest or potential bias.

4. **Evaluate the Reason and Proof of Reason**:
   - The implicit reason used here is essentially an ad hominem (i.e., attacking the person rather than the argument) implying that because Bill is a CEO of a corporation, his claim is biased and thus questionable.

5. **Identify the Defective Argument Type**:
   We will use each of the defective argument definitions to see which (if any) applies:
   
   - **Generalization (G)**: The argument does not make a broad generalization based on insufficient evidence here.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not list possibilities or miss out on pertinent ones.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason given, which is an attack on Bill's character, does not help conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Since the argument focuses on an attack on character, rather than establishing a weak causal basis with evidence, this doesn't seem to fit perfectly.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason does not repeat the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument does not assume something is universally agreed upon.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: There is no ambiguous language use here that can be taken in another sense.

6. **Conclusion**:
Based on the analysis, the argument fits the category of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. The reason provided (i.e., Bill is the CEO of a corporation) does not conclusively demonstrate whether tax breaks for corporations actually increase development or not.

**IDAA Result**: The given string "Bill claims that tax breaks for corporations increases development. Of course, Bill is the CEO of a corporation." is classified as **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**.
