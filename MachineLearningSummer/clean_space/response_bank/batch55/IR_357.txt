For 
Certainly! Applying <IDAA> to the given string involves decomposing the task (which in this case is the classification of the argumentative defect) into specific steps:

### Step-by-Step Breakdown (<D>):

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>):** 
   - Locate the main assertion that the argument intends to prove.

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Find the causal basis that supports <P>.

**Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Identify any further arguments or evidence provided to corroborate <R>.

**Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument:**
   - Determine if any of the identified parts (<P>, <R>, <PR>) correspond to one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Application to the Given String:

**Given String:**
"Edward Johns claimed to be psychic, but when his 'abilities' were tested under proper scientific conditions, they magically disappeared. Edward explained this saying that one had to have faith in his abilities for them to work."

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>):
The proposition here seems to be: 
"Edward Johns claimed to be psychic."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>):
The reason given is essentially suggesting an explanation for why Edward's abilities failed under scientific testing:
"One had to have faith in his abilities for them to work."

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):
The proof of reason (if any) is implicit in Edward Johnsâ€™ explanation. There is no tangible proof provided, just an assertion that faith is needed.

#### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: Not applicable here, as the argument is not applying a characteristic of a part to the whole.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not applicable, the argument does not enumerate all possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This fits because the reason provided ("one had to have faith in his abilities for them to work") does not conclusively demonstrate the truth of the proposition that Edward is psychic. It only provides an unfounded excuse for the failure.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This is also applicable because the reason given (faith needed) is not a compelling or sufficient causal basis to prove the proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Not applicable here, as the reason is not merely a repetition of the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Not applicable because no consensus or universally agreed-upon statement is used.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Not directly applicable; the language in the reason isn't ambiguous per se but rather weak.

### Final Classification:
The argument has defects of type **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** and **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.

- **<IR>**: The reason ("faith is needed") does not conclusively establish the proposition (Edward is psychic).
- **<WCB>**: The causal basis provided is not a compelling one to support the claim.

Hence, the string "Edward Johns claimed to be psychic, but when his 'abilities' were tested under proper scientific conditions, they magically disappeared. Edward explained this saying that one had to have faith in his abilities for them to work." can be classified as having both <IR> and <WCB> defects.
