For 
To apply the process of IDAA to the task of classifying the fallacy in Matt's argument, we decompose the task into the following steps:

**Step 1: Identify the components of the argument.**
- Proposition (P): "My opponent does not deserve to win."
- Reason (R): "She is a smoker and she cheated on her boyfriend last year."

**Step 2: Determine if the proposition (P) and reason (R) fit into any defective argument types.**
- Generalization (G): The argument is applied to all but based on limited information.
- Incomplete Enumeration (FE): Misses out on other relevant factors.
- Inconclusive Reason (IR): The reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
- Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB): The causal basis is not compelling.
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR): Reason repeats the proposition.
- Presumptuous Consensus (FU): Assumes consensus where there isnâ€™t any.
- Ambiguous Language Use (DEP): Reason or proof taken in a different sense than intended.

**Step 3: Analyze the reason (R) in relation to the proposition (P).**
- In this case, the reason (R) that "she is a smoker and she cheated on her boyfriend last year" does not directly or conclusively pertain to the qualifications or suitability of the opponent for the position of class president.

**Step 4: Match this analysis with the definitions of the defective argument types.**
- The reason provided by Matt does not conclusively demonstrate that his opponent is not deserving to win the class president election. The personal behaviors mentioned (smoking and cheating) are not directly related to the opponent's capabilities or qualifications for the position. This fits the definition of an inconclusive reason (IR), as the given reasons are inadequate to establish the truth of the proposition.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the steps of analyzing and matching, the fallacy Matt has committed corresponds to **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. The reasons he used do not conclusively support the claim he is making about his opponent's suitability for class president.
