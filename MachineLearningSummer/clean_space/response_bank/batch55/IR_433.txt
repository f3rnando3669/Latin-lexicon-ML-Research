For 
To apply IDAA to the given string "It's common sense that if you smack your children, they will stop the bad behavior. So don't tell me not to hit my kids.", we will break down the process of classifying the defective argument into specific steps. Here's the step-by-step decomposition and classification:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
Examine the string to identify the core proposition being put forth.

- **Proposition (<P>):** "Don't tell me not to hit my kids."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Examine the string to identify the reason given to support the proposition.

- **Reason (<R>):** "If you smack your children, they will stop the bad behavior."

### Step 3: Examine the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
Evaluate if there is any supporting evidence provided to substantiate the reason.

- **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** "It's common sense."

### Step 4: Evaluate Potential Defective Argument Types
Now, we'll determine if the proposition, reason, or proof of reason falls into any of the defective argument types defined.

#### 4a: Check for Generalization (G)
Is the assertion based on an individual or majority experience, but not necessarily applicable to all?

- **Assessment:** The statement assumes "common sense" applicability universally without supplying concrete evidence. It doesn't categorize as a pure Generalization (G).
  
#### 4b: Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
Does the argument miss out on pertinent possibilities while claiming a complete list?

- **Assessment:** This argument does not claim completeness.

#### 4c: Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR)
Does the reason fail to conclusively support the proposition?

- **Assessment:** The reason "If you smack your children, they will stop the bad behavior" is not conclusively proven and is contentious in itself.

#### 4d: Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
Is the reason weak due to an insufficient causal basis?

- **Assessment:** The causation provided is not compelling as child behavior change due to smacking is a debatable and disputed claim. This fits WCB.
  
#### 4e: Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
Does the reason merely restate the proposition without adding new information?

- **Assessment:** The reason and proposition are not mere repetitions of each other.

#### 4f: Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
Is the proof of reason assumed as certain based on presumed universal agreement?

- **Assessment:** The phrase "It's common sense" attempts to use presumed universal agreement to prove the reason. This fits FU.

#### 4g: Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)
Can the proof of reason be interpreted in multiple ways?

- **Assessment:** The language "common sense" is ambiguous and can be taken to mean different things to different people. This fits DEP.

### Step 5: Conclude Defective Argument Type
Based on the evaluation above, the given argument contains the following defective argument types:
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**

### Conclusion
The string "It's common sense that if you smack your children, they will stop the bad behavior. So don't tell me not to hit my kids." is classified as containing multiple defective argument types: **WCB, FU,** and **DEP**.
