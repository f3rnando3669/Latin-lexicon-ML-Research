For 
Let's apply the task of decomposing and classifying the defective argument "Everyone should like coffee: 95% of teachers do!" by following through the steps of IDAA.

### Step 1: Decompose the statement
We need to break down the argument into its major components: <P> (Proposition), <R> (Reason), and <PR> (Proof of Reason).

- **Proposition (<P>)**: "Everyone should like coffee."
- **Reason (<R>)**: "95% of teachers do [like coffee]."

Since the statement provides a statistic as evidence, "95% of teachers do," the implicit proof of reason (<PR>) is that this statistic is representative of a larger population.

### Step 2: Identify the Defective Argument Type
Next, we need to determine which type of defective argument is presented from the candidate list: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

We will evaluate the given components against the definitions of defective arguments:
- **Generalization (<G>)**: An assertion is based on some part or majority of individuals but not applicable to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Claiming to have made a complete enumeration, but missing possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis for the Reason is not compelling.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Reason repeats the Proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Proof of Reason assumed as certain based on universal agreement, which is disputed.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Proof of Reason can be taken in another sense than the intention.

### Step 3: Classify the Argument
"P: Everyone should like coffee" is the broader claim.
"R: 95% of teachers do" uses the percentage of a subgroup (teachers) to support the Proposition for everyone. This implies:

1. The statement makes an assertion based on a specific group (teachers) and generalizes it to the whole population.
   - This matches the criteria for a Generalization (<G>).

Given the analysis fits best with the definition of Generalization:

### Result
The defective argument type for "Everyone should like coffee: 95% of teachers do!" is **<G>** (Generalization).

By breaking down the task via IDAA, we've identified the step-by-step enumeration and classification method, arriving at the conclusion that the argument provided is a Generalization.
