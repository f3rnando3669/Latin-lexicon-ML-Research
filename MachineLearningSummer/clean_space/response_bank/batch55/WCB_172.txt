For 
To apply the process of argument decomposition and classification (IDAA) to the statement "Michael Jackson, Kurt Cobain, and Jimi Hendrix were rock stars who died young. Therefore, if you become a rock star, don’t expect to live a long life.", we'll break it down step-by-step according to the defined steps. 

### Decomposition of IDA into Specific Steps (D):
1. Identify the Proposition (P) within the argument.
2. Identify the Reason (R) provided for the Proposition.
3. Identify the Proof of Reason (PR) if applicable.
4. Evaluate each component to determine if it fits any of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Applying Decomposition to the Example:
1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - Proposition (P): "If you become a rock star, don’t expect to live a long life."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - Reason (R): "Michael Jackson, Kurt Cobain, and Jimi Hendrix were rock stars who died young."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   - This statement does not appear to have an additional proof for the reason provided. It relies on the example of three specific individuals to support the reason.

4. **Evaluate the components for defective argument types**:
   - **Generalization (G)**:
     - The argument makes a generalization based on a small sample of individuals. It takes the case of three individuals (Michael Jackson, Kurt Cobain, and Jimi Hendrix) and generalizes it to all rock stars.
     - Yes, this argument fits the type <G>.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
     - The argument does not claim to have made a complete enumeration of all rock stars, but it might fail to account for rock stars who did live long lives.
     - This is not the most fitting category compared to Generalization (G).

   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
     - The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the truth of the proposition since the sample size is too small and unrepresentatively selected.
     - This could apply, but the primary issue seems to be Generalization (G).

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
     - The argument relies on an insufficient causal basis by implying that being a rock star is a causative factor in dying young without considering other factors.
     - Secondary to Generalization, this could be considered as well.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
     - The Reason (R) is not a mere repetition of the Proposition (P).
     - Not applicable.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
     - There's no presumed consensus stated in the Reason (R).
     - Not applicable.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
     - The language used is quite clear and unambiguous.
     - Not applicable.

### Conclusion:
Based on the decomposition, the primary defective argument type for "Michael Jackson, Kurt Cobain, and Jimi Hendrix were rock stars who died young. Therefore, if you become a rock star, don’t expect to live a long life." is **Generalization (G)**. This statement takes a small, specific sample and generalizes it to all rock stars without sufficient justification.
