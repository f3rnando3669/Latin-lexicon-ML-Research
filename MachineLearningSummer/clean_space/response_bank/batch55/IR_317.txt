### Decomposition of IDA Task (D for IDA)

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - Determine if there is a clear statement of what the argument intends to prove.

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - Locate the causal basis or reasoning presented to support the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   - Check if there are additional arguments that corroborate the Reason.

4. **Check for Defective Argument Types**:
   - Compare the argument against each defective argument type definition to classify it.

### Application of D to IDA (IDAA)

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The statement to prove is typically found at the beginning of the argument.
- In this case, "Cari says that we need a major overhaul in education" is the proposition (P).

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason is the causal basis given to support the proposition.
- Here, the reason provided is "Cari gets a speeding ticket every other week."

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
Look for any additional arguments that support the reason.
- There is no additional argument given to support the reason; it just directly ties the speeding tickets to the overhaul in education.

#### Step 4: Check for Defective Argument Types
- **Generalization (G)**: This does not fit as it doesn't generalize a case to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable here since no enumeration of possibilities is attempted.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason given does not logically connect to the proposition, but we need to see if it fits better with RR or WCB.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The relationship between speeding tickets and advocating for education reform is not compelling or relevant, which makes it a candidate for WCB.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This does not repeat the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Thereâ€™s no claim of universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language does not seem ambiguous.

The argument presents a Reason (R) that does not provide a compelling causal link to the Proposition (P), which fits the definition of Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).

### Conclusion

By applying IDAA to the argument "Cari says that we need a major overhaul in education. Cari gets a speeding ticket every other week, so maybe she should learn how to drive instead of worrying about schools," we classify it as **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
