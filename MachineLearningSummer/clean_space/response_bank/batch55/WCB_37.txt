For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given argument "President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up. Jones is responsible for the rise in crime.", we will decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step decomposition (D) of the classification task (IDA):

### Step-by-Step Decomposition 

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine what is being asserted or claimed.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine the causal basis or reason given for the proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Check if there are any supporting additional arguments provided to corroborate the reason.
4. **Check for Defective Argument Types:**
   - Evaluate if the argument falls into any of the defective types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Applying Steps to Given Argument

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The proposition in the argument is: "Jones is responsible for the rise in crime."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason provided is: "President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up."

3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - There is no additional argumentation provided to support the reason. The reason stands on its own as presented.

4. **Check for Defective Argument Types:**
   - Let's evaluate each possible defective argument type:

    - **Generalization (<G>):**
      - This does not seem to be a generalization from a specific case to a general rule.
    
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
      - The argument does not claim to exhaustively list all possible reasons.
    
    - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
      - The reason provided does not directly prove the proposition. The argument assumes a direct causality from the rise in taxes to the increase in crime without showing a concrete link.
    
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
      - The reason provided could be seen as having an insufficient causal basis. Just because one event follows another does not prove a direct cause-effect relationship.
    
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
      - The reason does not simply repeat the proposition. It attempts to show causality but does not merely restate.
    
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
      - The argument does not appeal to universal agreement.
    
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
      - There does not seem to be ambiguous language in the provided statement.

Given the analysis, the argument "President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up. Jones is responsible for the rise in crime." can be classified as:

**<IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and possibly <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**

### Conclusion
The argument fails to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition and offers a weak causal basis for the claim it makes, making it fit the defective argument types <IR> and <WCB>.
