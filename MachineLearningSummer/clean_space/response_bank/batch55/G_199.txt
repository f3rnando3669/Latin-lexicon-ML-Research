For 
To apply IDAA (the application of the decomposition process D to the task of classifying the defective argument IDA) to the provided string "Fred the Australian stole my wallet. All Australians are thieves!" we will follow a step-by-step approach to decompose the task IDA.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of IDA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine the main assertion or claim being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Determine the underlying reasoning or causal basis given for P.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**: Determine any additional arguments or evidence presented to support R.
4. **Classify the Argument**: Using the given definitions, classify the argument as one or more of the defective types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

Let's go through each step for the string "Fred the Australian stole my wallet. All Australians are thieves!"

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The proposition (P) is the main assertion or claim being made:
- Claim: "All Australians are thieves."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason (R) is the underlying reasoning or causal basis given for the proposition:
- Reason: "Fred the Australian stole my wallet."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
Check for additional arguments or evidence supporting R:
- In the given string, no additional evidence or arguments are provided; the proposition directly follows from the reason.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
Using the provided definitions, classify the defective argument type:

- **Generalization (G)**: The <P> is an assertion based on some one part or on a majority of individuals, but not necessarily applicable to all, is referred to all.

In this case:
- The string asserts "All Australians are thieves" based on the behavior of one individual, Fred, who stole the speaker's wallet. This is a clear case of making a generalization about an entire group based on the actions of a single member.

Therefore, the defective argument type for the string "Fred the Australian stole my wallet. All Australians are thieves!" is **Generalization (G)**.

### Conclusion
The string "Fred the Australian stole my wallet. All Australians are thieves!" has been classified as a defective argument of type <G> (Generalization).
