To apply the decomposition of the task <IDAA> to the given string, we need to break down the classification task <IDA> into specific steps and then execute these steps. Here is how we can proceed step by step:

1. **Identify the proposition (<P>):** Determine the main proposition set forth in the string.
2. **Identify the reason (<R>):** Determine the reason provided for the proposition, if any.
3. **Identify the proof of reason (<PR>):** Determine if there's any proof provided to support the reason. 
4. **Evaluate the <P>, <R>, and <PR> against defective argument types:** Check if the argument falls under any of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.
5. **Classify the defective argument type:** Based on the evaluation, classify the argument into one of the defective argument types.

Let's apply these steps specifically:

### Step 1: Identify the proposition (<P>)

The main proposition in the string is: "So you are saying your car is worth $20k. I think it is worth $1, so let’s just compromise and say it is worth $10k."

### Step 2: Identify the reason (<R>)

In this case, the implicit reason (<R>) seems to be that since there is a disagreement about the car's value, a compromise in the middle of the two evaluations is proposed as the solution. 

### Step 3: Identify the proof of reason (<PR>)

No additional proof or argument is provided to support the reason in this statement. The <PR> is assumed as there is a reliance on the idea of compromise without substantiation.

### Step 4: Evaluate the <P>, <R>, and <PR> against defective argument types

- **<G> Generalization:** This does not apply since the argument is not making a generalization based on a subset.
  
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:** This does not apply as the argument does not attempt to enumerate possibilities.
  
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the compromise ($10k value). The argument does not establish a factual or logical basis for why $10k is a fair valuation— it merely suggests it as a middle ground.
  
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** The reason given is not a mere repetition of the proposition.
  
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** The reason (<R>) that relies on the compromise is not compelling because it doesn't provide a solid causal basis to presume $10k as the true value of the car.
  
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** The argument does not assume a consensus.
  
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:** There is no ambiguous language use in this argument.

### Step 5: Classify the defective argument type

The argument best fits the categories:
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** The reason given for the proposition (the mid-value proposal) does not conclusively support the proposition of $10k being the accurate value.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** The reason provided is a compromise but lacks a compelling causal basis for justifying $10k as the appropriate value.

Therefore, the string "So you are saying your car is worth $20k. I think it is worth $1, so let’s just compromise and say it is worth $10k. (Assuming the car is worth $20k)" can be classified as containing defective argument types <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
