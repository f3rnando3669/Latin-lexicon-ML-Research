For 
To apply IDAA (Decomposition of IDA) to classify the argument of the statement "all bachelors are unmarried males," we need to follow the process step-by-step. Let's break down each step and analyze the argument:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The first step in understanding the argument is to identify the proposition, which is what the statement intends to prove or assert. 

**Proposition (P)**: "All bachelors are unmarried males."

### Step 2: Examine the Reason (R) 
The Reason sets forth the causal basis to support the Proposition. In this statement, it seems the proposition itself is a definition rather than requiring any additional Reason.

Since the statement "all bachelors are unmarried males" is definitional, it does not appear to necessitate a causal Reason because it is expressing a tautology:

**Reason (R)**: N/A (The statement is definitional).

### Step 3: Analyze the Proof of Reason (PR)
Examine if the Reason given has been corroborated by additional arguments or premises. For a definition-based argument like this, there isn't an explicit Proof of Reason needed, as the argument stands on its logical equivalence.

**Proof of Reason (PR)**: N/A (No additional proof is typically required for definitional statements).

### Step 4: Determine if there are any Defective Arguments
Now, we will evaluate if the argument is defective by considering the definitions of defective argument types and seeing if any apply:

- **<G> Generalization**: Not applicable. The statement isn't a generalization; it’s a definition.
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: Not applicable. The statement isn’t an enumeration of possibilities.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: Not applicable. Since there is no reason provided (definition).
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: Not applicable. No reasoning was provided that just repeats the proposition.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: Not applicable. There is no causal basis required by the definition.
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: Not applicable. The statement isn't presuming consensus as a Proof.
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: Not applicable. The terms "bachelor" and "unmarried male" are being used in their standard, unambiguous senses.

### Conclusion
Since the statement "all bachelors are unmarried males" is definitional and free from any aforementioned defective arguments, it isn't classifiable under any defective argument category. Every identified step in the process confirms that this argument is valid due to its tautological nature.

Thus, applying IDAA to "all bachelors are unmarried males" results in the conclusion that it does not classify as any defective argument type (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>).
