To apply \(\text{IDAA}\) to the task of classifying the statement in question, we decompose the task \(\text{IDA}\) into specific steps. The goal is to classify the argument type committed by the student:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Determine what the student is asserting.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Determine the basis or reasoning the student provides for their assertion.

3. **Analyze the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - If there is additional corroborative reasoning, identify it.

4. **Match with Defective Argument Types**:
   - Compare the identified parts (\(<P>\), \(<R>\), \(<PR>\)) against the definitions of defective argument types: \(\text{G}\), \(\text{FE}\), \(\text{IR}\), \(\text{RR}\), \(\text{WCB}\), \(\text{FU}\), and \(\text{DEP}\).

Now, let's apply these steps step by step to the given statement: "While in math class, the student next to you says 'math makes no sense, it can’t be real so I must not need this.'"

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (\(<P>\))**:
   - Proposition: "Math makes no sense, it can’t be real."

2. **Identify the Reason (\(<R>\))**:
   - Reason: Because it doesn't make sense to the student, it can't be real, implying that it is unnecessary for them.

3. **Analyze the Proof of Reason (\(<PR>\))**:
   - There does not appear to be an additional corroborative argument beyond the initial reasoning provided.

4. **Match with Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (\(\text{G}\))**: The proposition is not a broad assertion applicable to a whole category based on a limited sample, so \(\text{G}\) does not apply.
   
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (\(\text{FE}\))**: The proposition does not claim a complete enumeration of possibilities, so \(\text{FE}\) does not apply.
   
   - **Inconclusive Reason (\(\text{IR}\))**: The reason "because it doesn't make sense to the student" is an invalid basis to conclude that math is not real or unnecessary, as it does not actually demonstrate the correctness of the proposition "Math makes no sense, it can't be real."
   
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(\text{WCB}\))**: The reason provided is weak, as the student's understanding doesn't causally imply that math is not real or unnecessary.
   
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(\text{RR}\))**: The reason essentially rephrases the proposition by implying that because math does not make sense, it can't be real, reiterating the student's disbelief without additional logic.
   
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (\(\text{FU}\))**: There is no indication that the student is claiming universal agreement.
   
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (\(\text{DEP}\))**: There is no evident ambiguous language that can be taken in another sense.

Based on the analysis, the defective argument types that fit this case are:

- **\( \text{IR} \) (Inconclusive Reason)**: The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **\( \text{WCB} \) (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The reason is weak as it does not compellingly establish the proposition.
- **\( \text{RR} \) (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: The reason reiterates the proposition without offering any substantiating logic.

### Conclusion:
The student committed the fallacies of **Inconclusive Reason (\( \text{IR} \))**, **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( \text{WCB} \))**, and **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( \text{RR} \))**.

This completes the decomposition of \(\text{IDA}\) into the specific steps required to identify the defective argument types committed by the student in the given statement.
