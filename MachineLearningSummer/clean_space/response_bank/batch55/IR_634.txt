For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "The shopping is a red herring, since the original issue was video games.", we will follow the process of decomposing the task of classifying this string into specific steps. Here are the steps for applying <IDAA>:

1. **Identify Proposition (<P>):**
   - First, examine the string to determine if there is a distinct proposition which sets forth what is to be proven.

2. **Identify Reason (<R>):**
   - Identify if there is a reason presented which sets forth the causal basis for establishing the truth of the proposition.

3. **Identify Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Identify if there is a proof of reason given which corroborates the reason presented.

4. **Check for Defective Argument Types:**
   - Evaluate the identified components to see if they fall into any of the defective argument types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

Let's apply these steps to the given string:

1. **Identify Proposition (<P>):**
   - The string seems to put forth the idea that "the shopping is a red herring." This can be considered as the proposition.

2. **Identify Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason presented is "since the original issue was video games." This sets forth a causal basis suggesting why the shopping topic is irrelevant.

3. **Identify Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - There doesn't seem to be an additional proof of reason provided that corroborates the reason for why "shopping is a red herring."

4. **Check for Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** No generalization made from some parts to all.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** No attempt to enumerate possibilities completely.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason "since the original issue was video games" is valid in showing the irrelevance but let's check other categorizations too.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The reason provided directly addresses the relevance issue, though one could argue if it's conclusively sufficient.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** No repetition of proposition as reason.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** No suggestion that the reason is universally agreed upon.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** There is no ambiguous language that can be taken in another sense. The language use is clear.

After evaluating all steps, it seems like the reason provided does address the irrelevance, but without additional proof, it can be considered inconclusive. Thus, this argument could fall under the type:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** where the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition that "the shopping is a red herring."

Therefore, applying <IDAA> to the string "The shopping is a red herring, since the original issue was video games" leads us to classify it primarily as <IR>.
