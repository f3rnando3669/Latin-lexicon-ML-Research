To apply IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of identifying a defective argument type) to the given text, we'll follow a step-by-step approach to decompose the task and identify the possible defective argument types.

### Step 1: Understand the Given Text

We first need to understand the content of the given text:

- The text criticizes the research and reasoning behind a particular intervention.
- It mentions that researchers are not methodologically sophisticated and suggests that data might have been faked, though this is based on rumors.
- It accuses advocates (or opponents) of being fanatical, sloppy thinkers with poor reasoning skills.
- The text concludes that such people are not deserving of being taken seriously.

### Step 2: Identify Propositions and Reasons

Next, we need to identify the propositions and reasons in the text:

- **Proposition (P)**: The research and reasoning behind the intervention are flawed and the researchers/advocates should not be taken seriously.
- **Reasons (R)**:
  1. Researchers are not methodologically sophisticated.
  2. Rumors indicate possible faking of data.
  3. Advocates are fanatical and poor thinkers.

### Step 3: Evaluate the Types of Defective Arguments

Now, we categorize which defective argument types might apply:

- **Generalization (G)**: The text paints all researchers and advocates with the same broad brush, implying that all are flawed based on some of them.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The text does not enumerate all possible researchers or advocates, leading to a possibly incomplete assessment.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Each reason provided does not conclusively prove the proposition. For instance: 
  - Methodological sophistication is not definitively demonstrated.
  - Rumors are used as part of the reasoning, which are not conclusive evidence.
  - Subjective claims about advocates' reasoning skills are not substantiated.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis (poor methodological skills, rumors of data faking, fanaticism) is not compelling without solid evidence.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The text does not seem to repeat the proposition in the form of reasons.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Does not directly appeal to a "universally agreed upon" standard.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Ambiguity is not the primary issue here.

### Step 4: Further Analysis and Conclusion

Let's break down each defective argument type to see which fits best:

- **(G)**: This argument generalizes the flaws of some researchers or advocates to all involved.
- **(FE)**: The argument does not enumerate all possibilities, merely focuses on perceived flaws inspired by rumors.
- **(IR)**: The reasons like methodological flaws and rumors are inconclusive in proving the proposition. 
- **(WCB)**: The provided reasons lack a compelling basis without concrete evidence.
  
### Final Decision

Considering the provided text and our analysis:

1. **(G)**: The argument is generalizing.
2. **(IR)**: The reasoning is inconclusive.
3. **(WCB)**: The causal basis is insufficient.

### Conclusion

The defective argument types applicable to the given text are **Generalization (G)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
