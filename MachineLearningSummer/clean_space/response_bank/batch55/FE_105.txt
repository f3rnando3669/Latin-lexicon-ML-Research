To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task IDA into specific steps) to classify the given string as to whether it falls into one of the defective argument types, we'll proceed step by step. Here is the step-by-step decomposition:

### Step 1: Understand the string
First, comprehend what the string is stating.

The string is: "Either we re-elect Mayor Ruiz, or we watch our city fall to pieces."

### Step 2: Identify and separate the components
Identify the components of the argument:
- Proposition (\<P\>): "Either we re-elect Mayor Ruiz"
- Reason (\<R\>): "we watch our city fall to pieces"

### Step 3: Analyze the type of argument
Determine if there are any clues indicating which defective argument type (\<G\>, \<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<RR\>, \<WCB\>, \<FU\>, or \<DEP\>) this might fall under.

### Step 4: Evaluate the string against each defective argument type
- **\<G\> Generalization:** Does the argument make a claim based on a part or majority but apply it to all? No, this does not seem relevant here.
- **\<FE\> Incomplete Enumeration:** Does the argument claim to offer a complete set of options but miss out on others? Yes, this string implies only two possible outcomes without considering other possibilities.
- **\<IR\> Inconclusive Reason:** Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the proposition? Not the primary issue here.
- **\<RR\> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** Does the reason simply repeat the proposition? No, the reason does not repeat the proposition here.
- **\<WCB\> Insufficient Causal Basis:** Is the causal basis weak or not compelling? The string is more about presenting false dichotomy rather than insufficient causality.
- **\<FU\> Presumptuous Consensus:** Does the proof rest on presumed universal agreement? No, universal agreement is not presented.
- **\<DEP\> Ambiguous Language Use:** Could the argument be misunderstood due to ambiguous wording? Not particularly in this case.

### Step 5: Conclude the classification
Based on the analysis, the argument fits the description of **\<FE\> Incomplete Enumeration** because it presents a limited set of outcomes (either re-elect Mayor Ruiz or the city falls to pieces) without accounting for other potential scenarios.

### Conclusion
Applying IDAA to the provided string, we classify it as:
- **"<FE> Incomplete Enumeration"**

Hence, "Either we re-elect Mayor Ruiz, or we watch our city fall to pieces" is an example of \<FE\> Incomplete Enumeration.
