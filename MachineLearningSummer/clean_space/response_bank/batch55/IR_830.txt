For 
To apply the process of IDAA to the argument presented by Jamila, we will follow a step-by-step decomposition of the task <IDA> (classifying the argument as one of the defective types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>).

1. **Understand the arguments and the context:**
   - Proposition (<P>): Xavier does not deserve to win.
   - Reason (<R>): He is a smoker and he cheated on his reading quizzes last year.

2. **Evaluate the match against defective argument types:**
   - **<G> (Generalization):** The proposition does not seem to assert a generalization based on one or most but not all individuals.
   - **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):** This does not involve enumeration of all possibilities.
   - **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** The reasons provided (smoking and cheating on reading quizzes) do not conclusively relate to why Xavier should not win class president (it does not conclusively establish his qualification for this specific role).
   - **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** This seems closely related, as the reasons provided are weak in establishing the causal basis as to why he shouldn't win (smoking and cheating on quizzes are not strong reasons directly related to the abilities needed for class presidency).
   - **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** The reason provided is not merely a repetition of the proposition.
   - **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):** There is no assertion that something is certain because it is universally agreed upon.
   - **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):** The language used does not appear to be taken in another sense than intended.

3. **Determining the closest match:**
   - The defective argument types that stand out are <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis). In this context, the primary issue is not the strength of the causal link itself (as would be the case with <WCB>), but rather that the reasons provided (smoking and cheating on quizzes) do not logically conclude or sufficiently justify that Xavier doesn't deserve to be class president.

4. **Final classification:**
   - Based on the above evaluation, the fallacy committed is best classified under **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**, as the reasons Jamila provides (smoking and cheating) do not conclusively substantiate her proposition that Xavier does not deserve to win the election for class president.

Thus, Jamila's statement involves the fallacy of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
