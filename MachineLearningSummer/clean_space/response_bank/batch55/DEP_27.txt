To apply the process of IDAA, or the decomposition and classification of the specific task of identifying defective argument types to the given string, let's follow a structured approach to break down the string and assess what type of defective argument it might be.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Extract the Proposition (P):**
   - Analyze the statement to understand the proposition being made.
   - In this case, the speaker claims the facts are reliable because they were seen on a TV program.

2. **Analyze the Reason (R):**
   - Identify the causal basis that establishes the truth of the proposition.
   - The reason given is that the facts were sourced from a TV program.

3. **Assess the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - Look for additional evidence or arguments that corroborate the reason.
   - In this case, there's a lack of identifiable proof or details about the source (the TV program's name is not remembered).

### Classification of Defective Argument (IDA)

Given the string "But professor, I got all these facts from a program I saw on TV once... I don’t remember the name of it though.", let's apply the potential defect types:

- **Generalization (G):** The argument does not seem to be generalizing from a part to a whole.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument does not claim to have covered all possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason given (sourcing from a TV program) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the facts.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The argument does not merely restate the proposition as the reason.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Sourcing information from an unspecified TV program is not a compelling causal basis for the truth of the facts.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument does not rely on an assumed consensus for proof.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The argument is straightforward and does not rely on ambiguous language.

### Conclusion
By examining the structure and the content of the string step-by-step, we can classify the defective argument present:

- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The reason given provides a weak causal basis because simply claiming the information comes from an unspecified TV program does not convincingly establish the truth of the stated facts.

Therefore, the correct classification of the defective argument in "But professor, I got all these facts from a program I saw on TV once... I don’t remember the name of it though." is **<WCB>**.
