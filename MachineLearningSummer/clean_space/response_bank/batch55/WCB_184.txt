For 
To apply IDAA (decomposition of the task of classifying the given string as one of the defective argument types) to the string "You oversleep and then fail a test; so you assume that oversleeping causes you to fail tests," we will break down the task into specific steps to systematically analyze and classify the argument.

### Steps of <D> for Performing <IDA>:
1. **Extract Proposition (P) and Reason (R)**: Identify the stated proposition and the causal reason given for it.
2. **Examine Proof of Reason (PR)**: Determine if any proof or additional argument provided supports the reason.
3. **Identify Defective Argument Type**: Analyze the argument to detect defects based on definitions provided.

### Applying <D> to <IDA>:

#### Step 1: Extract Proposition (P) and Reason (R)
- **Proposition (P)**: "Oversleeping causes you to fail tests."
- **Reason (R)**: "You oversleep and then fail a test."

#### Step 2: Examine Proof of Reason (PR)
- **Proof of Reason (PR)**: There is no additional argument or data to corroborate the reason beyond the single instance provided.

#### Step 3: Identify Defective Argument Type
- The argument makes a general assertion that oversleeping causes failing tests based on a single incident. This fits the definition of a defective argument type called **Generalization (G)** where the proposition is based on one part and is applied to all instances.

By systematically following these steps, we identify the defective argument type:

**Defective Argument Classification:**

The argument "You oversleep and then fail a test; so you assume that oversleeping causes you to fail tests" is classified as **Generalization (G)** because it draws a broad conclusion from a specific event without sufficient justification that the same outcome will occur in all cases.
