For 
To classify the argument in the string "We're going to protest and not get in trouble because Mr. Iglesias said it's okay," as one of the defective argument types, we can apply the decomposition of the classification task (IDA) into specific steps (D). Here’s the application of D to IDA, step by step (IDAA):

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\<P\>)
- The proposition here is: "We're going to protest and not get in trouble."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\<R\>)
- The reason given for the proposition is: "Mr. Iglesias said it’s okay."

### Step 3: Validate the Causal Basis (\<R\>)
- Determine if the reason provided (Mr. Iglesias's approval) is a compelling basis to establish the truth of the proposition (that protest will not result in trouble).

### Analysis of the Reason (\<R\>)
- The reasoning here is that because Mr. Iglesias provided approval, it guarantees no trouble will occur.

### Step 4: Identify the Proof of Reason (\<PR\>)
- There is no additional proof provided to support the reason that Mr. Iglesias's approval will indeed prevent trouble.

### Step 5: Evaluate for Defective Arguments

Now, we'll check for each defective argument type in detail:

1. **Generalization (\<G\>)**
   - Not applicable; the argument does not involve an assertion based on a part or majority being applied to all.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)**
   - Not applicable; the argument does not involve a claim of having enumerated all possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**
   - Applicable. The reason “Mr. Iglesias said it’s okay” does not conclusively demonstrate that no trouble will happen. This reason is insufficient by itself to prove the proposition conclusively.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**
   - This also seems applicable. The causal link between Mr. Iglesias’s statement and not getting in trouble is weak, as his statement by itself does not inherently prevent trouble from occurring.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)**
   - Not applicable; the reason does not simply restate the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)**
   - Not applicable; the argument does not assert the reason is certain due to universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)**
   - Not applicable; the argument does not involve ambiguity in language interpretation.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the argument falls under the categories of **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**:
- **Inconclusive Reason** because Mr. Iglesias's approval does not adequately demonstrate that no trouble will arise.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis** because the reason given (Mr. Iglesias’s statement) is not a compelling causal ground for the proposition.

Thus, the string "We're going to protest and not get in trouble because Mr. Iglesias said it's okay" can be classified as both **\<IR\>** (Inconclusive Reason) and **\<WCB\>** (Insufficient Causal Basis).
