For 
To apply <IDAA> to "When your mom gets your phone bill and you have gone over the data limit, you begin to distract her by talking about how well you did on a test today knowing she has offered to extend your data limit if you make good grades. This is an example of which logical fallacy?", we need to decompose the task of identifying the logical fallacy into specific steps. Here is the step-by-step decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) in the Statement:**
   - **Step 1:** Determine what the main assertion or proposition is within the provided argument. In this case, the implied proposition is that the focus should be on the phone bill and the data overage.
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>) Given in the Statement:**
   - **Step 2:** Pinpoint the reason that is being used to support or divert from the proposition. Here, the reason being presented is the performance on a test.

3. **Evaluate the Connection Between <P> and <R>:**
   - **Step 3:** Assess whether the reason logically supports the proposition or if it distracts from it. In the given scenario, the performance on a test is used to distract from the issue of the phone bill and data overage.

4. **Classify the Nature of the Defective Argument:**
   - **Step 4:** Compare the identified defect with the types of defective arguments (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).
     - **Generalization (<G>)?** No, the argument does not generalize from a part to a whole.
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)?** No, the argument does not miss out on possibilities.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)?** No, the reason given does not fail to conclusively support the proposition; rather, it diverts from it.
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)?** No, the given reason does not repeat the proposition.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)?** No, the causal basis is not weak; it is irrelevant.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)?** No, the assumption of consensus is not invoked.
     - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)?** No, there is no language ambiguity in the reason.

5. **Identify the Logical Fallacy:**
   - **Step 5:** Recognize that this form of argument is a distraction from the main issue (Proposition) by introducing an irrelevant topic (Reason). This is known as a "Red Herring" fallacy, which is not part of the predefined defective argument types. However, within the predefined types, the closest classification would depend on further context, such as intention to divert which might lean towards ambiguity in purpose.

Therefore, based on our predefined categories, we would need to be considerate of whether a broader classification like <DEP> might fit if the distraction introduces ambiguity in purpose. However, strictly by the predefined types, this does not align perfectly with any provided but is best understood as a classic "Red Herring" fallacy outside of these predefined types.
