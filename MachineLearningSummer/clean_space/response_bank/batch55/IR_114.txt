For 
To apply <IDAA> (application of the decomposition process to the task of classifying a defective argument), we need to break down the classification task into specific steps. Let's proceed step by step:

1. **Interpret Proposition (P)**:
   - Identify the proposition <P> in the argument.
   - In this case, the proposition <P> is "Cocaine is good for you."

2. **Identify Reason (R)**:
   - Determine the reason <R> provided to support the proposition.
   - Here, the reason <R> is "Cocaine is all natural."

3. **Analyze the Argument Types**:
   - Consider the types of defective arguments and evaluate if any apply to the reasoning or structure of the argument presented.

Let's now evaluate the argument "Cocaine is all natural; therefore, it is good for you" against the types of defective arguments (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>):

- **Generalization (G)**:
  - This type is about making a broad assertion based on insufficient evidence. The statement does not fit this category directly as it does not generalize on individuals.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
  - This type involves claiming completeness when not all possibilities are considered. The argument does not enumerate possibilities, so this does not apply.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
  - This occurs when the reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
  - "Cocaine is all natural" does not conclusively demonstrate that "Cocaine is good for you." Just because something is natural does not necessarily mean it is beneficial or safe. Hence, this fits the category of an inconclusive reason.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
  - Here, the causal basis is weak or not compelling.
  - Similar to the above, if we scrutinize the causal link ("being natural" to "being good for you"), it is weak and not a compelling basis for saying cocaine is good. Thus, this could also fit the criteria for an insufficient causal basis.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
  - This occurs when the reason simply restates the proposition.
  - In this case, the reason provides new information ("all natural") rather than merely restating the original proposition, so this does not apply.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
  - This involves asserting something is true because it is universally agreed upon when it is still in dispute.
  - The argument does not make any claim about universal agreement, so this does not apply.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
  - This involves ambiguity in the language of the proof.
  - There is no significant ambiguity in the language used in this argument that could be interpreted in another sense.

4. **Final Classification**:
   - From our analysis, the most fitting classifications are <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis). Both point out that the reasoning provided does not conclusively or compellingly establish the proposition that cocaine is good for you.

Therefore, the defective argument types that classify "Cocaine is all natural; therefore, it is good for you" are primarily **<IR>** and **<WCB>**.
