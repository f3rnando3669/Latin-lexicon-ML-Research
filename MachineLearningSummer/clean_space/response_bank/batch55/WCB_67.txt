For 
To classify the given string using the task of decomposition (IDAA), we need to break down the process step by step. Let’s go through it:

### Step 1: Parse and Understand the Proposition <P>
Examine the proposition within the string for what Zohaw intends to prove or claim.
- Proposition (\<P\>): "I must've caused the outage."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
Examine the reason put forward by Zohaw to justify the proposition.
- Reason (\<R\>): "Right when I sneezed, the power went off."

### Step 3: Assess the Reason <R> Relative to the Proposition <P>
Evaluate the reason to see if it logically and causally supports the proposition.

### Step 4: Identify Potential Defective Arguments
Check the relationship between \(\<P=\>\) “I must've caused the outage” and \(\<R=\>\) “Right when I sneezed, the power went off” for any logical fallacies or defects.

Let’s apply this step by step:

1. **Generalization (`<G>`):** It doesn’t fit here as Zohaw is not making a broad assertion based on a part or majority of individuals.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (`<FE>`):** Not applicable since Zohaw is not claiming a complete enumeration of possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (`<IR>`):** This might be possible if the reason given doesn’t conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (`<WCB>`):** This seems plausible as the given reason does not strongly establish a causative link.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (`<RR>`):** Not applicable here; the reason is not a mere restatement of the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (`<FU>`):** Not applicable, since there’s no assumption of universal agreement.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (`<DEP>`):** Not applicable; the language used is not ambiguous.

### Conclusion of Decomposition:

Based on the steps above, we classify the argument:
- Zohaw asserts that sneezing caused the power outage.
- Reason: The power went off when Zohaw sneezed.
- The conclusion of decomposition reveals a causal link that is not sufficiently compelling.

### Classification:

The argument can be classified as:
**<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The causal basis ("sneezed, and the power went off") submitted for the proposition is not a strong or compelling one to conclude that sneezing caused the power outage.

So, applying IDAA to the given string, we classify it as type **<WCB>**.
