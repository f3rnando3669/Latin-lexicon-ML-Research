To apply **IDAA** (the decomposition of the task **IDA** (classifying a defective argument) into specific steps) to the given string "Join the crowd and don’t get left behind!", let's break down the process step by step.

**Step 1: Analyze the Structure of the Argument**

- **<P> (Proposition):** The main claim or assertion being made.
- **<R> (Reason):** The justification or causal basis provided for the <P>.
- **<PR> (Proof of Reason):** Additional arguments to corroborate the <R>.

**Analysis of "Join the crowd and don’t get left behind!":**
- Proposition: "Join the crowd"
  - Implicit assertion: It is beneficial or necessary to join the crowd.
- Reason: "Don’t get left behind!"
  - Implies that being left behind is undesirable and that joining the crowd prevents this.

**Step 2: Identify the Defective Argument Type**

- **<G> (Generalization):** The proposition is not a sweeping generalization.
- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):** The argument does not attempt to enumerate all possibilities.
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** The reason "Don’t get left behind!" is more persuasive and emotional rather than a conclusive logical demonstration.
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The reason provided is weak in causal logic.
- **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** The reason is not just repeating the proposition.
- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):** The argument is appealing to a consensus.
- **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):** The language is not particularly ambiguous.

After analyzing the string with these categories, the defective argument type that fits best is **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**, as it relies on the idea that since everyone is doing something (joining the crowd), one should do it too, assuming a universal agreement on this being the correct or desirable action.

**Step 3: Confirm and Summarize the Classification**

The string "Join the crowd and don’t get left behind!" uses the appeal to the majority and the fear of being left out to persuade the listener. It operates on the assumption that there is a consensus about the desirability of joining the crowd and that being left out is inherently negative, without providing a solid causal basis or reasoning—this makes it a case of **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**.

**Conclusion:**
The classification for the argument "Join the crowd and don’t get left behind!" is **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**.
