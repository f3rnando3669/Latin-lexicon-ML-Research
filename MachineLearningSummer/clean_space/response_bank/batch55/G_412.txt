To accomplish the task of classifying the given argument string using the IDAA method, we start by decomposing the advanced task of classification (IDA) into specific steps (D). Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine the main claim or assertion in the argument.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Find the causal basis or rationale offered for the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Look for any supporting arguments that are meant to corroborate the Reason.

4. **Evaluate for Defective Arguments**: Analyze the argument to see if it fits any of the predefined defective argument types:
    - **Generalization (G)**
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
    - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**

5. **Classify the Argument**: Based on the analysis in step 4, classify the argument into the corresponding defective argument type.

Let's apply these steps to the given argument string:

**Argument String:**
"Brad's mother asked him why he wasn't trying out for the school play. He responded: 'Because if Tom gets the male lead, which he always does, then I'll only be in the chorus, and it's not worth being in the play if I'm only going to be in the chorus.'"

### Step-by-Step Application:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - **P:** "It’s not worth being in the play if I’m only going to be in the chorus."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - **R:** "If Tom gets the male lead, which he always does, then I'll only be in the chorus."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - There is no additional proof given beyond the stated Reason, so this step does not apply directly in this case.

4. **Evaluate for Defective Arguments:**
   - **Generalization (G):** This doesn't seem to generalize beyond Tom and Brad.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This argument doesn't claim to enumerate possibilities exhaustively.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason doesn't conclusively demonstrate the proposition, because the causal link between Tom getting the lead and Brad being in the chorus isn't necessarily definitive. This could be a candidate.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This seems to apply as the reason for not trying out is based on an assumption rather than a compelling causal connection.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This does not repeat the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This argument does not rely on a presumed consensus.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** There is no ambiguity in the language.

5. **Classify the Argument:**
   - The argument can be classified under **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, because Brad's rationale for not trying out is that Tom typically gets the lead, which makes it not worth trying if he will only get the chorus. This is a weak causal basis to conclude that it’s not worth participating.

**Conclusion:**
The logical fallacy illustrated by Brad's argument "Because if Tom gets the male lead, which he always does, then I'll only be in the chorus, and it's not worth being in the play if I'm only going to be in the chorus." is best classified as **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

This step-by-step application showcases how decomposition into specific steps allows for a structured approach to classifying arguments according to predefined fallacies.
