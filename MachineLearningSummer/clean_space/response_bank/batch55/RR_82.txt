For 
Let's apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to classify the given string by decomposing the task \( \text{IDA} \) into specific steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - \(\text{P}\) is the statement we intend to prove.
   - Here, \(\text{P}\) is: "The word of Zorbo the Great is flawless and perfect."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - \(\text{R}\) is the causal basis for \(\text{P}\).
   - Here, \(\text{R}\) is: "It says so in The Great and Infallible Book of Zorbo's Best and Most Truest Things that are Definitely True and Should Not Ever Be Questioned."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   - \(\text{PR}\) corroborates \(\text{R}\).
   - Here, \(\text{PR}\) is not explicitly listed, so we proceed with the evaluation as is.

4. **Evaluate the Reason (R) for Defective Argument Types**:
   - We check \(\text{R}\) against the known defective argument types (\(\text{G}\), \(\underline{\text{FE}}\), \(\underline{\text{IR}}\), \(\underline{\text{RR}}\), \(\underline{\text{WCB}}\), \(\underline{\text{FU}}\), \(\underline{\text{DEP}}\)).

   - **Generalization (G)**: \(\text{R}\) does not make a statistical generalization from a sample to a population.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: \(\text{R}\) is not attempting to enumerate all possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: \(\text{R}\) is not clearly invalid or inconclusive in its attempt to demonstrate \(\text{P}\).
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: \(\text{R}\) does present a causal basis (the bookâ€™s claim), but let's keep this as a candidate for further review.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Here, \(\text{R}\) ("It says so in The Great and Infallible Book of Zorbo's Best and Most Truest Things that are Definitely True and Should Not Ever Be Questioned") repeats essentially what is said in \(\text{P}\). The book's statement and the original assertion echo the same content without providing an independent basis.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: \(\text{R}\) does not assume universal agreement as the basis.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: \(\text{R}\) does not exhibit ambiguous language that could have multiple interpretations beyond the intended one.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the evaluation, the defective argument present in the given string is \(\text{RR}\) (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).

Hence, the string "The word of Zorbo the Great is flawless and perfect. We know this because it says so in The Great and Infallible Book of Zorbo's Best and Most Truest Things that are Definitely True and Should Not Ever Be Questioned." should be classified as type \(\text{RR}\).
