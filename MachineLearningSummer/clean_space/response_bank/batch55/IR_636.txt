To apply the decomposition of the task of classifying the string into specific steps (IDAA), let's break down the process of identifying the type of defective argument into a series of clear steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):** Determine what the main assertion or claim being made is.
2. **Identify the Reason (R):** Identify the basis or groundwork that supports the Proposition.
3. **Analyze for Generalization (G):** Check if the Proposition is an assertion based on a generality that might not apply to every specific case.
4. **Analyze for Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Verify if the Proposition assumes a complete list of possibilities but misses out on some.
5. **Analyze for Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Assess if the Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.
6. **Analyze for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Determine if the Reason is weak and does not provide a strong causal basis for the Proposition.
7. **Analyze for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Check if the Reason merely repeats the Proposition with no added support.
8. **Analyze for Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Evaluate if the corroboration (Proof of Reason) is based on an assumed consensus that is disputed.
9. **Analyze for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Check if the language used in the Proof of Reason can be interpreted differently from what the speaker intended.

Now, let's apply these steps to the string: 

"In class, Ryan turns to Doug and says, 'Smoking cigarettes is nothing short of suicide: the smoker is willingly killing himself. Duh.'"

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - **P:** "Smoking cigarettes is nothing short of suicide."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - **R:** "The smoker is willingly killing himself."

3. **Analyze for Generalization (G):**
   - **Check:** Is the assertion that smoking is equivalent to suicide based on an overgeneralization? This doesn't seem to fit as the statement is making a strong claim rather than generalizing from an insufficient sample.

4. **Analyze for Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - **Check:** Is the Proposition claiming to provide a complete list of possibilities but missing some? This doesn't seem to apply, as it's not enumerating possibilities.

5. **Analyze for Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - **Check:** Does the Reason conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition? 
     - **Analysis:** The Reason states that smoking is willingly killing oneself (akin to suicide), but it doesn't conclusively demonstrate that smoking definitively equates to suicide in every context. This could be seen as an inconclusive reason, depending on how rigorously we require proof.

6. **Analyze for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - **Check:** Is the Reason weak in providing a compelling causal basis?
     - **Analysis:** The Reason provided ("willingly killing himself") isn't a strong causal basis. The health effects and outcomes of smoking are well-documented, but the Reason given is more about intention than a detailed causal relationship. This may not be sufficient to compel the proposition.

7. **Analyze for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - **Check:** Is the Reason merely repeating the Proposition without added support?
     - **Analysis:** Yes, it appears that the Reason is just a rephrasing of the Proposition. It doesn't add new support or evidence to bolster the claim, it merely reiterates it in slightly different words ("nothing short of suicide" and "willingly killing himself").

8. **Analyze for Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - **Check:** Is there an assumption of universal agreement on the proof?
     - **Analysis:** There isnâ€™t an explicit invocation of universal consensus here.

9. **Analyze for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - **Check:** Can the Proof of Reason be taken in another sense than intended?
     - **Analysis:** There is no significant ambiguity in the language used here.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the argument primarily fits **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** because the Reason provided is not supplying new support but instead merely restates the Proposition in slightly different terms.

Thus, the string "In class, Ryan turns to Doug and says, 'Smoking cigarettes is nothing short of suicide: the smoker is willingly killing himself. Duh.'" is categorized as **RR** (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
