To apply the IDAA to the given argument "Paige wants to play a guitar solo on our next recording. Her father is a horrible musician, though, so I doubt that Paula's any good either," we will follow the decomposition of the task IDA into specific steps and apply it to classify the string as one of the defective argument types.

**Step 1: Identify and isolate the Proposition (<P>)**
1. Proposition (<P>): "Paige wants to play a guitar solo on our next recording."

**Step 2: Identify and isolate the Reason (<R>)**
2. Reason (<R>): "Her father is a horrible musician."

**Step 3: Identify and isolate the Proof of the Reason (<PR>)**
3. Proof of Reason (<PR>): There's no explicit additional proof presented within the argument, so we'll note it as being weak or missing.

**Step 4: Determine if the Reason (<R>) provides a causal basis for the Proposition (<P>)**
  - We must see if "Her father is a horrible musician" causally supports the doubt about Paige's ability to play a guitar solo.

**Step 5: Check for defects in the argument based on the defined defective types**

- **Generalization (<G>):** There is an assertion that the musician quality of the father applies to Paige's skills without pertinent evidence.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** There’s no claim of a complete enumeration of possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition; the father’s poor musicianship does not necessarily imply Paige’s abilities.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis is weak, as parent’s skill doesn't directly determine child's skill.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason does not repeat the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** There’s no appeal to universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** There’s no ambiguous language present.

**Step 6: Match the identified defect to a specific type**

The reasoning provided ("Her father is a horrible musician") weakly supports the proposition they are making ("so I doubt that Paula's any good either."). In this context, the poor musicianship of the father does not conclusively determine the skill of the daughter.

The defects that fit the provided statement are **Generalization (<G>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.

**Conclusion:** The main defects in the argument are:
- **Generalization (<G>):** Paige's skills are being judged based on her father's capabilities without specific evidence to support this.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal basis—her father's musicianship—is weak as an indicator of Paige's skill level. 

Thus, the argument can be classified as being both of type **<G>** and **<WCB>**.
