For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "Red had come up six times in a row on the roulette wheel, so Greg knew that it was close to certain that black would be next up. Suffering an economic form of natural selection with this thinking, he soon lost all of his savings.", we will break down the advanced task of classifying the string as either <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP> into specific steps.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
1. Analyze the string and identify the main statement or claim being made.
   - **Identified Proposition:** "Greg knew that it was close to certain that black would be next up."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
2. Determine the causal basis or reason given for the proposition.
   - **Identified Reason:** "Red had come up six times in a row on the roulette wheel."

### Step 3: Determine the Type of Defective Argument
3. Examine the relationship between <P> and <R> to determine if there is a defect according to the types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step 4: Evaluate Against Each Defective Argument Type
4.1 Evaluate for **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - Does <P> generalize from a specific instance to a broader context without sufficient justification?
   - **Evaluation:** No, <P> is not making a generalization about a group or category.

4.2 Evaluate for **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - Does <P> claim to have considered all possibilities but actually miss out on some pertinent ones?
   - **Evaluation:** No, <P> does not enumerate all possibilities.

4.3 Evaluate for **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - Does <R> fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of <P>?
   - **Evaluation:** Yes, the observation that "Red had come up six times in a row" does not conclusively demonstrate that "black would be next up".

4.4 Evaluate for **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - Is the causal basis submitted for <P> not compelling?
   - **Evaluation:** The reason provided (previous occurrences of red) is weak and not a compelling causal basis for predicting that black will be next.

4.5 Evaluate for **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - Does <R> repeat <P> in different words?
   - **Evaluation:** No, <R> does not simply repeat <P>.

4.6 Evaluate for **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - Is <PR> assumed as certain based on a presumption of universal agreement?
   - **Evaluation:** No, <P> does not claim universal agreement.

4.7 Evaluate for **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
   - Can <R> be taken in another sense than intended?
   - **Evaluation:** No, the language used is not ambiguous.

### Step 5: Conclude the Classification
5. Given the evaluations, the defective argument type that best fits the string provided is a combination of <IR> and <WCB>.

- **Defective Argument Type:** **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** because the reason given does not conclusively support the proposition.
- **Secondary Defective Argument Type:** **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** because the causal basis (the previous red outcomes) is not compelling or relevant to predicting the next outcome.

### Final Classification
- **Classification:** <IR> and <WCB>
