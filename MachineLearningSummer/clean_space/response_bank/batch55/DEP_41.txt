For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types) to the given argument, we'll follow a step-by-step approach to identify any defects in the argument. Here are the steps of this process:

1. **Understand the Argument Structure:**
   Break down the argument into its components (Proposition <P>, Reason <R>, and Proof of Reason <PR>).

2. **Analyze Each Component Separately:**
   Identify and evaluate the Proposition, Reason, and Proof of Reason for any defects.

3. **Classify the Defects:**
   Compare the identified defects against the known types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), and Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

### Step 1: Understand the Argument Structure

- **Proposition <P>:** The first forms of life must have come from a living being.
- **Reason <R>:** All living beings come from other living beings.
- **Proof of Reason <PR>:** That living being is God.

### Step 2: Analyze Each Component Separately

**Examination of Proposition <P>:**
- **Proposition <P>:** "The first forms of life must have come from a living being."
  This is the claim that needs to be scrutinized.

**Examination of Reason <R>:**
- **Reason <R>:** "All living beings come from other living beings."
  This is provided as the causal basis for the Proposition.

**Examination of Proof of Reason <PR>:**
- **Proof of Reason <PR>:** "That living being is God."
  This is presented as the corroboration of the Reason.

### Step 3: Classify the Defects

**Generalization (G):**
- The argument doesn't necessarily over-generalize a specific instance to a universal claim.

**Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
- The Proposition claims the first forms of life must have come from a living being without considering other scientific possibilities (e.g., abiogenesis).

**Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
- The Reason (All living beings come from other living beings) does not conclusively prove the Proposition. It addresses known living beings but doesn't address the origin of life.

**Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
- The Reason provided does not compellingly establish the Proposition. There could be insufficient consideration of alternate scientific explanations.

**Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
- The Reason does not simply restate the Proposition.

**Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
- The assertion "That living being is God" assumes a consensus that isn't universally agreed upon, especially within scientific discourse.

**Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
- The argument doesnâ€™t seem to have ambiguously used language.

### Conclusion

Based on the above analysis, the given argument primarily falls under:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** It fails to consider all possibilities regarding the origin of life, such as abiogenesis.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the Proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The Reason provided is not compelling in the context of scientific discourse.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The final statement assumes a consensus about the existence of God, which is in dispute.

Thus, the defective argument types associated with this string are **FE, IR, WCB,** and **FU**.
