For 
To apply IDAA to the given string "I know three redheads who have terrible tempers, and since Annabel has red hair, I’ll bet she has a terrible temper, too," we need to follow the process of decomposition (D) step by step to classify the argument type (IDA). Here are the steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The proposition (P) in the given argument is:
- "Annabel has a terrible temper."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason (R) provided to support (P) is:
- "I know three redheads who have terrible tempers."

### Step 3: Examine the Proof of Reason (PR)
There is no additional proof provided for the reason (R) in this argument. It relies purely on the stated reason.

### Step 4: Check for Generalization (G)
In this step, we need to see if the argument asserts a generalization based on a small or unrepresentative sample:
- The argument generalizes about Annabel based on the fact that three other redheads are known to have terrible tempers. This generalization is drawn from a small sample size (three individuals) and applied broadly to another individual solely based on the shared characteristic of having red hair.

### Step 5: Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
We then need to determine if the argument claims completeness while missing relevant possibilities:
- The argument does not make an explicit claim of complete enumeration regarding temperaments of all redheads.

### Step 6: Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR)
Consider if the reason provided conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the proposition:
- The reason provided ("I know three redheads who have terrible tempers") does not conclusively establish that Annabel, because of having red hair, will have a terrible temper. It is anecdotal and lacks sufficient causal connection.

### Step 7: Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
Determine if the reason's causal basis is insufficient:
- The reasoning provided does show a weak causal basis. The fact that three other redheads have terrible tempers is not a compelling basis to assert that all, or other, redheads including Annabel, must have terrible tempers.

### Step 8: Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
Assess if the reason is simply a repetition of the proposition:
- The reason provided is not a repetition of the proposition. It introduces new information, though weakly linked.

### Step 9: Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
Check if the proof of the reason is based on an assumed universal agreement:
- The argument does not rely on presumptuous consensus; it does not claim that it is universally agreed that redheads have terrible tempers.

### Step 10: Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)
Examine if the proof of reason can be taken in different senses than intended:
- The language used is straightforward and does not present ambiguity in different interpretations.

### Final Classification
Based on the steps taken:

**"G" - Generalization**: The argument is an example of a defective argument type known as Generalization (G). It inappropriately generalizes that Annabel will have a terrible temper based solely on the observed temperaments of three other redheads.

Therefore, the given argument "I know three redheads who have terrible tempers, and since Annabel has red hair, I’ll bet she has a terrible temper, too." is classified as type **<G>**.
