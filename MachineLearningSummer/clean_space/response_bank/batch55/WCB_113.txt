For 
To apply the process of <IDAA> to classify the defective argument type of the statement "Before women got the vote, there were no nuclear weapons," we will decompose the task into specific steps and analyze the statement accordingly.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P> 
In the given statement, the proposition appears to be:
- **Proposition (<P>):** Before women got the vote, there were no nuclear weapons.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
The reason for the proposition is implied:
- **Reason (<R>):** The implication is that there might be a causal link between women getting the vote and the existence of nuclear weapons.

### Step 3: Determine if the Reason <R> is provided and evaluate its strength
The statement does not explicitly provide a reason for the claim, but it suggests a temporal or causal relationship between women getting the vote and the development of nuclear weapons.

### Step 4: Identify the Type of Defective Argument
Evaluate whether the argument fits any of the defective types listed:

#### Possible Types:
1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - Not applicable, as it doesn't generalize from a part to whole.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Not applicable, as it doesn't claim an exhaustive list of possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Potentially applicable, as the reasoning does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. There is no logical foundation provided that links womenâ€™s suffrage to the development of nuclear weapons.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Potentially applicable, since any inferred causal relationship is weak or non-existent. The timing of these events does not imply a causal connection without further evidence.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - Not applicable, as the reason is not merely a repetition of the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - Not applicable, as it does not assume universal agreement on the proposition.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - Not applicable, as the terms used are not ambiguous even though the implied reasoning is faulty.

### Step 5: Decide on the Most Appropriate Type
Between **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**, the latter seems to be more accurate because the given statement implies an insufficient causal correlation.

### Conclusion
The statement "Before women got the vote, there were no nuclear weapons" is best classified as:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The statement implies a causal relationship between two events (women getting the vote and the advent of nuclear weapons) without providing sufficient evidence or reasoning to support this link.

Therefore, applying <IDAA> to the given argument yields that it is of type **<WCB>** (Insufficient Causal Basis).
