To apply the process of decomposing and classifying the provided statement as a specific defective argument type, we'll follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Statement
The statement is: "Everyone was driving over the speed limit, so I shouldn't have gotten a ticket for it!"

### Step 2: Identify the Proposition (P)
The proposition (P) in this statement is: "I shouldn't have gotten a ticket for it."

### Step 3: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason (R) given for the proposition is: "Everyone was driving over the speed limit."

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type
Now let's evaluate which defective argument type it falls under by examining the reasoning provided.

1. **Generalization (G)**
   - **Description:** Making a claim about all based on one or a majority.
   - **Application to Statement:** The statement mentions "everyone" driving over the speed limit, which generalizes the behavior of all drivers at that moment. However, this does not automatically imply that the speaker's specific individual case is unjustifiable without examining the law or rules for speeding.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
   - **Description:** Claiming to have covered all possibilities but missing some.
   - **Application to Statement:** The statement does not enumerate possibilities but rather makes a general assertion. Not applicable here.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
   - **Description:** Reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
   - **Application to Statement:** "Everyone was driving over the speed limit" does not conclusively prove that the speaker should not get a ticket. The law may still apply regardless of others' behavior. This can be a valid classification.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
   - **Description:** Causal basis for P is not compelling.
   - **Application to Statement:** The reasoning here may be weak, but it's more specifically flawed due to how it handles generality and logic rather than weak causality.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
   - **Description:** Reason just repeats the proposition
   - **Application to Statement:** The reason provided does not merely repeat the proposition. Not applicable here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
   - **Description:** Assuming something is certain because it is universally agreed upon.
   - **Application to Statement:** No presumption of universal agreement on speeding is made here. Not applicable.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**
   - **Description:** Using ambiguous language.
   - **Application to Statement:** Language here is not ambiguous. Not applicable.

### Step 5: Conclusion
Based on our step-by-step analysis, the most suitable classification for the defective argument type is:

**Inconclusive Reason (IR)**

### Final Answer
The statement "Everyone was driving over the speed limit, so I shouldn't have gotten a ticket for it!" is an example of the **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** logical fallacy.
