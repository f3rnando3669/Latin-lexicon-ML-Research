For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposing the task of classifying a string as a defective argument into specific steps) to the given string, "If we let our child out of his room, eventually he will want to leave the house, and will end up on the street. If he is walking around on the street then he will be snatched up by a stranger and sold into slavery in a remote region on the World," we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Extract and Identify Parts of the Argument

1. **Proposition (\<P\>):**  
   "If we let our child out of his room, eventually he will want to leave the house, and will end up on the street."
   
2. **Reason (\<R\>):**  
   "If he is walking around on the street then he will be snatched up by a stranger and sold into slavery in a remote region on the World."

### Step 2: Examine the Proposition (\<P\>)

Does the proposition exhibit any of the defective types?
- **Generalization (\<G\>):** Is it making an assertion based on some one part or on a majority, but not universally applicable?
  - No, the proposition isn't making a generalization; it refers specifically to "our child."
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>):** Is it claiming to enumerate all possibilities but missing some?
  - Not applicable directly here since it's more about a chain of events rather than possibilities.

### Step 3: Examine the Reason (\<R\>)

Does the reason provided support the proposition adequately or does it exhibit any defects?
- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>):** Does the reason conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
  - No, the reason seems speculative rather than conclusive. The chain of events seems exaggerated without clear evidence.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>):** Is the causal basis weak or not compelling?
  - Yes, the causal reasoning that leads from being on the street to being sold into slavery is not compelling and seems exaggerated.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>):** Is the reason merely repeating the proposition?
  - No, the reason does add new content by detailing the supposed consequences of ending up on the street.

### Step 4: Examine Proof of Reason (\<PR\>)

Does the argument provide any additional arguments or proof for the reason, and are they defective?
- The argument does not provide additional proof for the reason, hence, we don't evaluate this in this step.

### Step 5: Evaluate for Other Defective Argument Types 

- **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>):** Is there an assumption that something is universally agreed upon without it being settled?
  - No, this string does not assume universal agreement.
  
- **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>):** Could the argument's terms be taken in another sense than intended?
  - No specific ambiguity seems evident in the language used.

### Step 6: Classify the Defective Argument (\<IDA\>)

Based on the analysis in the previous steps, the primary defects identified are:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>):** The chain of events from letting the child out of the room to ending up enslaved is speculative and not conclusively demonstrated.
  
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>):** The causal link between the child being on the street and being sold into slavery is exaggerated and not compelling.

### Conclusion 

Combining all steps, we classify the argument primarily as having the defects of \<IR\> (Inconclusive Reason) and \<WCB\> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
