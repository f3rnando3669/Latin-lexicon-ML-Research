For 
To apply \( IDAA \) to the given string "Student: Logical Fallacies have nothing to do with my life and I don't want to learn them! Teacher: You are too young to understand why it's important! Estudiante: ¡Las falacias lógicas no tienen nada que ver con mi vida y no quiero aprenderlas! Maestro: Eres demasiado joven para entender por qué es importanto!", we need to decompose this advanced task into specific steps and classify any identified defective arguments:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of \( IDA \):

1. **Identify the Propositions (<P>) within the conversation.**
2. **Determine the supposed Reasons (<R>) given to support the Propositions.**
3. **Check for any Proof of Reasons (<PR>) used to corroborate the Reasons.**
4. **Classify the argument or any part of it according to the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>.**

### Applying \( IDAA \):

1. **Identify Propositions (<P>):**

   - **Student's Proposition:**
     - "Logical Fallacies have nothing to do with my life and I don't want to learn them!"
     
   - **Teacher's Proposition:**
     - "You are too young to understand why it's important!"

2. **Determine the supposed Reasons (<R>):**

   - **Teacher's Reason:**
     - "You are too young to understand why it's important!"

3. **Classify the Argument Types:**

   - The teacher's reason "You are too young to understand why it's important!" directly follows the student's proposition without providing a concrete, conclusive basis or evidence about the importance of logical fallacies.
   
   - In this context, the teacher's statement is essentially repeating the proposition without adding substantive reasoning. The fallacy here is **<RR>** (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), where the Reason merely restates the assertion in the form of the Proposition without providing convincing support or new information.
   
4. **Determine if there’s Proof of Reason (<PR>):**

   - There is no additional argument or evidence presented by the teacher to corroborate why understanding logical fallacies is important, other than repeating the claim that the student is "too young."

### Conclusion:

- The argument type identified for the given string is **<RR>** (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).

### Final Classification:
The task \( IDAA \) results in classifying the argument provided in the string as having the defective argument type **<RR>**.
