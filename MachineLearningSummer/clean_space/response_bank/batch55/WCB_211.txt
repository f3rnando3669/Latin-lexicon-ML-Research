For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given statement "Every severe recession follows a Republican Presidency; therefore Republicans are the cause of recessions," we will decompose the task into specific steps and classify the argument.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of Task (D):
1. **Extract the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Identify the statement we intend to prove.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine the causal basis provided for the Proposition.

3. **Determine the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Find any additional support provided for the Reason.

4. **Evaluate Generalization (<G>):**
   - Check if the assertion is based on a partial observation but applied to all instances.
    
5. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - See if the enumeration of possibilities is claimed to be complete but actually misses pertinent ones.

6. **Assess Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Evaluate if the Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.

7. **Examine Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Validate if the Reason provides a weak and non-compelling causal basis for the Proposition.

8. **Look for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - Verify if the Reason merely repeats the Proposition without adding new information.

9. **Investigate Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - Check if the Proof of Reason relies on a presumption that it is universally agreed upon.

10. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
    - Determine if ambiguous language is used in a way that the statement can be misunderstood.

### Application to the given statement:

1. **Extract the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition: "Republicans are the cause of recessions."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason: "Every severe recession follows a Republican Presidency."

3. **Determine the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - There is no additional Proof of Reason presented in the statement.

4. **Evaluate Generalization (<G>):**
   - The statement generalizes that because recessions have followed Republican presidencies, Republicans universally cause recessions. This appears to be a case of Generalization.
  
5. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The statement does not account for all potential factors or scenarios that could lead to recessions. This indicates an Incomplete Enumeration.
  
6. **Assess Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition because correlation does not imply causation.
  
7. **Examine Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The causal basis (R) is weak because it does not provide compelling evidence that Republican policies directly cause recessions. It merely notes a succession.
  
8. **Look for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - The Reason does not merely repeat the Proposition.
  
9. **Investigate Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - The statement does not explicitly rely on a presumption of universal agreement.

10. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
    - The statement's language is not particularly ambiguous, but it does make a questionable causal implication.

### Classification:

Upon evaluating the statement, it is clear the argument suffers from multiple defects:

- **Generalization (<G>):** It generalizes from a set of instances without considering other causal factors.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** It does not account for all plausible causes of recessions.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The Reason does not conclusively prove the Proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal link is weak and not compelling.

Therefore, the statement "Every severe recession follows a Republican Presidency; therefore Republicans are the cause of recessions" should be classified as a defective argument due to multiple issues, specifically <G>, <FE>, <IR>, and <WCB>.
