To apply the task of decomposing the classification of the given string into defective argument types, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break it down step by step:

Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\<P>)
- Look for a statement that summarizes what the speaker intends to prove.

Step 2: Identify the Reason (\<R>)
- Look for the causal basis presented by the speaker to establish the truth of the Proposition.

Step 3: Identify Proof of Reason (\<PR>)
- Look for any additional arguments intending to corroborate the Reason given.

Step 4: Evaluate the components
- Check the identified components for defects.
- Match the defects with defective argument types like Generalization (\<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>), Weak Causal Basis (\<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU>), Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP>).

Step 5: Classify the argument (\<s>) according to the identified defects.

Let's apply this to the provided string:

**String:** 
"Reporter: “It’s been two years since your policies were implemented, and so far they have failed to reduce unemployment rates.”
Politician: “I have been working hard ever since I came into office, and I’m happy to say that I met with many business leaders throughout the country, who all say that they are glad to see that our hard work is paying off.”"

Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\<P>)
- Politician’s statement implies the Proposition: "Our policies are effective and our hard work is paying off."

Step 2: Identify the Reason (\<R>)
- Reason provided: "I met with many business leaders throughout the country, who all say that they are glad to see that our hard work is paying off."

Step 3: Identify Proof of Reason (\<PR>)
- Proof of Reason: The politician doesn't provide additional proof but relies on the statements of business leaders.

Step 4: Evaluate the components
- The Reason given is that many business leaders say that the hard work is paying off.
- Assess if this Reason is conclusive and sufficiently demonstrates the Proposition.

Step 5: Classify the argument (\<s>) according to the identified defects.

**Evaluation of Potential Defects:**

1. **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>):** 
    - The fact that business leaders say they are happy doesn't directly address the Reporter’s claim about unemployment rates. It doesn't conclusively demonstrate the effectiveness of the policy in reducing unemployment.

2. **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU>):** 
    - The politician assumes the views of the business leaders as a universal agreement that the policies are successful, without addressing the specifics or details that support this claim as universally accepted.

3. **Weak Causal Basis (\<WCB>):**
    - Meeting with business leaders and their positive feedback doesn’t necessarily provide a compelling causal basis that proves the policies are effective in reducing unemployment rates.

Analyzing for the most fitting defective argument type:
The most fitting defective argument, according to our breakdown, appears to be Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>), as the politician’s reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition regarding unemployment rates.

So, applying \<IDAA\> to the given string, we classify "Reporter: “It’s been two years since your policies were implemented, and so far they have failed to reduce unemployment rates.” Politician: “I have been working hard ever since I came into office, and I’m happy to say that I met with many business leaders throughout the country, who all say that they are glad to see that our hard work is paying off.”" as an example of an Inconclusive Reason (<IR>).
