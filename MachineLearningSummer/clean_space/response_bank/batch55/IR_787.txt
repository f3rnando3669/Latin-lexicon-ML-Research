For 
To classify the given string as one of the defective argument types using the process of <IDAA>, we'll follow the step-by-step decomposition of the task. Here's how we can approach it:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>) of <IDA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine what the speaker intends to prove or assert.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the causal basis provided to support the Proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Look for arguments that corroborate the Reason.
4. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types**:
    - Check for Generalization (<G>)
    - Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
    - Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
    - Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
    - Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
    - Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
    - Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)

### Applying <IDAA> to the Given Text

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition here is implied rather than explicit, but it can be summarized as follows:
- **Proposition (<P>):** Despite the suffering and persecution, continue the fight for freedom with faith.

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reasons are the experiences of great trials, tribulations, narrow jail cells, persecution, and police brutality.

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
The corroboration is implicit in the shared experiences and the assertion that "unearned suffering is redemptive," suggesting a moral and redemptive value to their struggles.

#### Step 4: Analyze for Defective Argument Types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The argument does not seem to base its proposition on an unsubstantiated assertion about a whole group based on a limited sample.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The argument mentions several places and types of suffering but does not claim to have listed all possibilities exhaustively.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The provided reason (suffering and faith) may not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition that things will change. However, this is more about the moral and emotional appeal rather than a strict logical proof.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - The causal basis is more emotionally and morally compelling rather than an insufficient logical basis. The argument hinges on faith and moral reasoning.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - The reasons do not merely reiterate the proposition in the same manner.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - The argument doesn't claim that something is universally agreed upon without basis.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
   - There may be some ambiguity depending on interpretation ("unearned suffering is redemptive"), but it is more of a rhetorical flourish than a logical ambiguity.

#### Conclusion:
The argument predominantly uses an **emotional appeal** (pathos) grounded in shared experiences, moral convictions, and faith. The primary appeal is not precisely one of the defective argument types listed but could potentially be highlighted as **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** if we critique the logical rigor since it relies heavily on moral and emotional persuasion.

Hence, the primary appeal used in this quote is **emotional/moral appeal (pathos)**, with a potential critique pointing to **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** if we focus on the logical structure.
