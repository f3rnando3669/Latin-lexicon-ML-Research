For 
To apply <IDAA> to the provided string, we need to decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps. Here are the steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Determine what the main assertion or claim is in the argument.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Identify the causal basis that is being set forth to justify the proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Look for any additional arguments or evidence that are used to corroborate the reason.
4. **Classify the Argument:** Compare the identified <P>, <R>, and <PR> against the definitions of defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) to determine which category it falls into.

Now, let's apply these steps to the string: 

"The Americans I know say they elected the new president because they were tired of having their jobs sent overseas. This question of jobs brought this president into office."

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition in this argument appears to be:
- "The Americans I know say they elected the new president."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason provided to support the proposition is:
- "because they were tired of having their jobs sent overseas."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
The proof of the reason is essentially a restatement of the sentiment that:
- "This question of jobs brought this president into office."

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
Now let's assess the argument against the defined defective argument types:

- **Generalization (<G>):** The argument relies on "The Americans I know," which suggests that the reason might not be representative of all Americans, making this a potential generalization issue.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** There is no explicit claim of exhaustive possibilities here, so this doesn't apply.
  
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason provided doesn't conclusively demonstrate why the new president was elected, as it relies on a small, potentially non-representative sample.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal basis (being tired of job loss) is somewhat plausible but might not be strong enough to explain the entire electorate's decision.
  
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The proof of reason restates the initial claim in different words ("This question of jobs brought this president into office") and doesn't add new evidence.
  
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** There is no claim of universal agreement here, so this doesn't apply.
  
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The language used in the argument does not appear particularly ambiguous.

Based on the analysis, the primary defective arguments here are:

- **Generalization (<G>):** Because the argument is based on a limited sample ("The Americans I know"), it might be overgeneralizing the sentiment.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Because the reason slightly rephrases what is essentially the same claim without adding new evidence.

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the string results in classifying it as a mix of Generalization (<G>) and Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>).

To summarize, the provided string mostly exhibits defects of type <G> and <RR>.
