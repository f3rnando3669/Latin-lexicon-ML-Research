For 
Let's decompose the advanced task \( \langle t \rangle \) of classifying a defective argument \( \langle IDA \rangle \) into specific steps \( \langle D \rangle \). We will apply this decomposition to the given example step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\( \langle P \rangle \))

Look for the main assertion or conclusion the argument is trying to prove.

**Example Proposition:** "Members of Congress are adulterers."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\( \langle R \rangle \))

Determine the supporting reason or causal basis presented for the proposition.

**Example Reason:** "Three congressional representatives have had affairs."

### Step 3: Evaluate the connection between \( \langle P \rangle \) and \( \langle R \rangle \)

Assess whether the reason genuinely supports the proposition and what type of logic or inference is being used.

### Step 4: Classify the type of defective argument

Compare the argument to the defined types of defective arguments:
- \( \langle G \rangle \) (Generalization)
- \( \langle FE \rangle \) (Incomplete Enumeration)
- \( \langle IR \rangle \) (Inconclusive Reason)
- \( \langle RR \rangle \) (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)
- \( \langle WCB \rangle \) (Insufficient Causal Basis)
- \( \langle FU \rangle \) (Presumptuous Consensus)
- \( \langle DEP \rangle \) (Ambiguous Language Use)

### Step 5: Match example to the defective argument type

Compare the given example with the characteristics of each defective argument type to classify it.

**Example Analysis:**

1. **Proposition (\( \langle P \rangle \))**: "Members of Congress are adulterers."
2. **Reason (\( \langle R \rangle \))**: "Three congressional representatives have had affairs."
3. **Evaluation**: The argument takes the observation that three representatives have had affairs and generalizes this to all members of Congress.
4. **Classification**:
   - \( \langle G \rangle \): This fits the description of a Generalization because it extends the behavior of a few individuals (three representatives) to an entire group (all members of Congress) without sufficient justification.
   - Other Types: It does not fit \( \langle FE \rangle \), \( \langle IR \rangle \), \( \langle RR \rangle \), \( \langle WCB \rangle \), \( \langle FU \rangle \), and \( \langle DEP \rangle \) based on their specific definitions.

**Conclusion**: The given example "Three congressional representatives have had affairs. Therefore, members of Congress are adulterers." is classified as a \( \langle G \rangle \) (Generalization).
