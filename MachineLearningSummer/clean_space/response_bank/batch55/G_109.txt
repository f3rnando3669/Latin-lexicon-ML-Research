To apply the task of decomposing and classifying the given string "My roommate Fatima said her philosophy class was hard, and the one I’m in is hard, too. All philosophy classes must be hard!” Insisted Baneen." into specific steps, we will follow the defined process of IDAA. Here's the step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
First, we need to identify the main proposition or claim made in the statement:
- Proposition: "All philosophy classes must be hard."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
Next, identify the reason given to support this proposition:
- Reason: "My roommate Fatima said her philosophy class was hard, and the one I’m in is hard, too."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason <PR>
Now, identify any proof given to corroborate the reason:
- In this case, there isn't additional proof beyond the experiences of two individuals. 

### Step 4: Evaluate the Argument
We need to evaluate the components to see if the argument falls into any of the defective categories (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP).

1. **Generalization (G)**: This argument type occurs when a conclusion is drawn about all members of a group based on a sample. Check if this applies:
   - Baneen is concluding that "All philosophy classes must be hard" based on the experience of two classes. This is a clear generalization based on limited examples.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Check if the argument falsely claims to have considered all possibilities:
   - There is no complete enumeration claim here, so this doesn't seem to apply.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Check if the reason given does not conclusively support the proposition:
   - While the experiences of two classes are mentioned, this does not conclusively prove that all philosophy classes are hard. This would fit under the generalization category more specifically.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Check if the causal basis submitted for the proposition is not compelling:
   - The causal basis (two hard classes) is not compelling enough to generalize to all philosophy classes. This overlaps with generalization.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Check if the reason merely repeats the proposition:
   - The reason given does not repeat the proposition but introduces new premises (experience of two classes).

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Check if there is an assumption of universal agreement:
   - There is no claim of universal consensus here.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Check if there is ambiguous language:
   - The language is clear and unambiguous in presenting the experiences and concluding point.

### Step 5: Conclusion
After evaluating the argument against each defective category, we classify the string as:

- **Type <G>: Generalization**

The claim that "all philosophy classes must be hard" based on the limited experiences of only two classes is a classic generalization.

### Summary:
The argument "My roommate Fatima said her philosophy class was hard, and the one I’m in is hard, too. All philosophy classes must be hard!” Insisted Baneen." falls under the defective argument type **<G>: Generalization**.
