For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "My cat sleeps all day, so cats must be pretty lazy," we need to decompose the advanced task of classifying this string as a specific defective argument type into specific steps. Here is the step-by-step decomposition along with the classification:

### Decomposition of Task <t> into Steps (Task <D>)
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Determine what claim or assertion is being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Determine the basis or justification provided for the <P>.
3. **Examine the <R> in relation to the <P>:** Assess whether the <R> satisfactorily supports the <P>.
4. **Identify any corroborative arguments or Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Determine if there are supplementary arguments supporting the <R>.
5. **Classify the Argument Type:**
   - Examine whether the argument fits any defective types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Application of Decomposition (<D>) to <IDA> (Task <IDAA>):
#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - **<P>:** "Cats must be pretty lazy."
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - **<R>:** "My cat sleeps all day."

3. **Examine the <R> in relation to the <P>:**
   - Does the reason "My cat sleeps all day" adequately support the proposition that "cats must be pretty lazy"?

4. **Identify any corroborative arguments or Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - In this case, there are no supplementary arguments provided as <PR>.

5. **Classify the Argument Type:**
   - The assertion (<P>) "Cats must be pretty lazy" is based on the observation of a single instance (<R>) "My cat sleeps all day."
   - This generalizes from one case (or a few cases) to all cases without sufficient evidence to support such a broad assertion.

#### Conclusion:
- This argument fits the defective argument type known as **Generalization** (<G>):
   - The statement "Cats must be pretty lazy" is an assertion extrapolated from the behavior of one cat, which is not necessarily applicable to all cats.

Hence, the classification of the string "My cat sleeps all day, so cats must be pretty lazy." is **<G>** (Generalization).
