To apply IDAA to the argument "Pizza has ingredients from all the food groups. Therefore, pizza must be healthy," we will need to decompose the task of classifying this string into specific steps. Here are the steps involved:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for IDAA:
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Extract the proposition that is trying to be proved.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Extract the reason or reasoning provided in support of the proposition.

3. **Identify the Defective Argument Types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>):**
   - Compare the extracted <P> and <R> with definitions of defective argument types to classify the argument.

Now, let's apply these steps to the given argument:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
Proposition (<P>): "Pizza must be healthy."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Reason (<R>): "Pizza has ingredients from all the food groups."

### Step 3: Identify the Defective Argument Types

- **Generalization (<G>):** The argument doesn't make a general assertion based on limited observations, so <G> doesn’t apply.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument doesn’t enumerate possibilities; hence, <FE> doesn’t apply.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The argument assumes that having ingredients from all food groups automatically implies healthiness, which doesn't conclusively prove the proposition. Therefore, the reason provided is not necessarily conclusive for the healthiness of pizza.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal basis here is that the mere presence of a variety of ingredients from different food groups leads to healthiness. This reason lacks compelling causality, which makes it weak.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason provided is not a repetition of the proposition; hence, <RR> doesn’t apply.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The argument doesn’t claim universal consensus, so <FU> doesn’t apply.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** There is no ambiguity in the language used; hence, <DEP> doesn’t apply.

### Conclusion:
This argument can be classified under both **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**. The argument's reasoning does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition, and the causal basis submitted is weak and uncompelling.

By following steps 1 to 3, we have effectively classified the argument as having both <IR> and <WCB> defective argument types.
