Sure, let's apply the decomposition approach to the task of classifying the defective argument (IDA) in the string "The rooster crows always before the sun rises, therefore the crowing rooster causes the sun to rise." Here's a step-by-step breakdown (IDAA):

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
First, let's identify the key proposition within our string. 

- Proposition (<P>): "The crowing rooster causes the sun to rise."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Next, we identify the causal basis for the proposition, which usually comes before the conclusion:

- Reason (<R>): "The rooster crows always before the sun rises."

### Step 3: Classify the Argument Type
Now, we need to classify this argument and see which of the defective argument types it may fall into. Let's examine each type:

#### Generalization (<G>):
- **G**: This is when a conclusion is drawn about all instances based on a few or majority of instances. 
- **Application**: The given argument does not generalize from a few instances to all instances, so itâ€™s likely not a generalization.

#### Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):
- **FE**: This is when all possibilities are not considered or enumerated.
- **Application**: There is no attempt to enumerate all possibilities, hence it does not fit <FE>.

#### Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):
- **IR**: This is where the reason given does not sufficiently support the truth of the proposition.
- **Application**: The reason given is that of temporal sequence (the rooster crowing always before the sun rises), which does not necessarily establish a causal link. So, it could be <IR>.

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):
- **WCB**: This is when the reason provided for the proposition lacks compelling force.
- **Application**: The reasoning merely suggests a temporal relation and not a true causal connection. This argument could also be <WCB>.

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):
- **RR**: This is when the reason merely restates the proposition in different words.
- **Application**: The reason given does not merely restate the proposition in different words, so it does not qualify as <RR>.

#### Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):
- **FU**: This is when a proof of reason is assumed based on so-called universal agreement.
- **Application**: There is no mention of a presumed consensus to support the argument, so it does not qualify as <FU>.

#### Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):
- **DEP**: This is when ambiguous language leads to different interpretations of the proof of reason.
- **Application**: There is no significant ambiguity in language, so it does not qualify as <DEP>.

### Step 4: Conclusion
By analyzing the argument, it most closely fits the definitions of:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Because the cause (rooster crowing) does not conclusively establish the effect (sun rising), or
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Because the reason merely suggests a temporal relationship and not an actual causal link.

### Decision
The argument "The rooster crows always before the sun rises, therefore the crowing rooster causes the sun to rise." is best classified as an example of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, with a possible secondary classification as **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** due to the weakness of the causal claim.
