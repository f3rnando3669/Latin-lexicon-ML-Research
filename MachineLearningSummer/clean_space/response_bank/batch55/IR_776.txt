For 
To apply IDAA (the application of the decomposition of a task into specific steps) to the task of classifying the string "Being mean to others is wrong. Therefore, it cannot possibly be part of our nature." under IDA (classifying the string as one of the defective argument types G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP), we can break down the task into several steps. Here is the step-by-step process ensuring we understand and analyze the string:

### Step 1: Identify the components of the argument

First, we need to break down the given string into its main components: the Proposition (P), Reason (R), and Proof of Reason (PR), if applicable.

- Proposition (<P>): "Being mean to others is wrong."
- Reason (<R>): "Therefore, it cannot possibly be part of our nature."

### Step 2: Analyze the Reason (<R>)

Next, we need to examine the reason provided to see if it falls into any of the categories of defective argument types we defined. 

### Step 3: Compare the Argument to Defective Types

- **Generalization (G)**: The argument does not create a generalization from a single or majority instance to all cases.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not make an enumeration of possibilities, so it doesn't leave out pertinent possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This category applies when the Reason does not conclusively support the Proposition. Here, the assertion that because something is "wrong" it "cannot possibly be part of our nature" appears to disconnect moral wrongness from natural behavior with no conclusive link.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This category applies if the Reason provides a weak causal basis for the Proposition. The reasoning here is based on a value judgment ("wrong") not causally explaining or sufficiently proving why it can't be part of human nature.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The Reason does not merely restate the Proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument is not based on a universal agreement which is in dispute.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The terms "wrong" and "part of our nature" could be ambiguous, but there's not necessarily an alternative interpretation that changes the speaker's intended meaning here.

### Step 4: Determine the Best-fitting Defective Argument Type

Based on the analysis, the argument appears to suffer from both an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the Reason does not conclusively support the Proposition, and an **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because the Reason lacks a compelling causal basis.

### Step 5: Make a Final Classification Decision

The dominant defect based on our analysis seems to be the **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** since the link between something being morally "wrong" and it "not being part of our nature" is not conclusively demonstrated.

Therefore, the classification of the given argument string is:

```plaintext
The argument "Being mean to others is wrong. Therefore, it cannot possibly be part of our nature." is of type <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
```

### Summary of Steps Applied

1. **Identify the argument components (<P> and <R>):**
   - <P>: "Being mean to others is wrong."
   - <R>: "Therefore, it cannot possibly be part of our nature."
2. **Analyze the Reason (<R> in comparison to defect types):**
   - Not <G>, <FE>, <RR>, <FU>.
   - Possible <IR> and <WCB>.
3. **Classify correctly:**
   - Select <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) as the primary defect.
