For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "marijuana shouldn’t be legalized because it wasn’t socially acceptable," we need to break down the advanced task (<t>) of classifying the string into its specific steps. Here is how we can do this systematically:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)

In any argument, the proposition (<P>) is the claim or statement that is being put forth for acceptance. In this case, the proposition is:

- **<P>: "marijuana shouldn’t be legalized"**

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)

The reason (<R>) provides the causal basis for the proposition and aims to establish the truth of what is being urged. Here, the reason given is:

- **<R>: "because it wasn’t socially acceptable"**

### Step 3: Analyze the Reason (<R>)

To classify the defective argument type, we need to scrutinize whether the reason effectively supports the proposition.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type

We now match the given reason against the defined defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The argument does not appear to generalize from a small sample to a larger population.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The argument does not enumerate possibilities, so this defect does not apply.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The reason provided ("it wasn’t socially acceptable") does not conclusively demonstrate why marijuana should not be legalized. Social acceptance is a subjective measure and may not be a definitive reason for legalization policy.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - The causal basis here is weak. Social acceptance does not necessarily correlate causally with the legal correctness of an action or policy.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - The reason does not just repeat the proposition; it introduces an additional concept of social acceptance.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - The string does not claim universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
   - The term "socially acceptable" might be ambiguous, but there is no gross ambiguity that rephrases the argument fundamentally different from the intent.

Given these analyses, the most fitting classifications are <IR> and <WCB>:

- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The reason does not constitute a compelling causal basis for the proposition.

### Conclusion

The statement "marijuana shouldn’t be legalized because it wasn’t socially acceptable" primarily demonstrates defects of **<IR>** and **<WCB>**.
