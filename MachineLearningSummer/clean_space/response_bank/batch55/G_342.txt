For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "My job interview did not go well. I'll never get a job," we need to decompose the task <IDA> into specific steps and then execute those steps to classify the string appropriately.

### Steps of Decomposition (<D>) for <IDA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Recognize the statement or assertion that is being proposed.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Identify the causal basis that supports the proposition.
3. **Check for Defective Argument Types:**
   - Check for Generalization (<G>)
   - Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
   - Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
   - Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
   - Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
   - Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
   - Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)

### Applying <IDAA> to the string:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition: "I'll never get a job."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason: "My job interview did not go well."

3. **Check for Defective Argument Types:**

   - **Generalization (<G>):** This involves extending the conclusion to all cases based on one instance.
     - The proposition "I'll never get a job" is based on the single instance of "My job interview did not go well."
     - This seems to classify as a Generalization because it extrapolates a single failed job interview to a universal conclusion about all potential job interviews.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This involves claiming completeness without considering all possibilities.
     - The string does not involve an enumeration of possibilities, so <FE> is not applicable here.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This involves a reason that does not conclusively support the proposition.
     - While "My job interview did not go well" might be disappointing, it does not conclusively demonstrate that the person will "never get a job." However, this does not appear to be the best fit for the defective type, considering the identified Generalization fits better.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This involves a weak causal basis.
     - The reason provided is not a strong causal basis for the proposition, but again, Generalization is a more fitting classification.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This involves repeating the proposition as its own reason.
     - This is not applicable as the reason provided is not a repetition of the proposition.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This involves assuming universal agreement without proof.
     - This is not applicable as there is no reference to a universal consensus.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** This involves ambiguity in language which could lead to misinterpretation.
     - The language here is clear and not particularly ambiguous.

### Conclusion:
The string "My job interview did not go well. I'll never get a job." is best classified under the defective argument type **Generalization (<G>)**. The proposition "I'll never get a job" is an overgeneralization based on the single instance of a job interview not going well.
