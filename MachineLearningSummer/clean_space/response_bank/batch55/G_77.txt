For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposition to the classification task of identifying defective argument types) to the given argument string "Delores is a big supporter for equal pay for equal work. This is the same policy that all those extreme feminist groups support. Extremists like Delores should not be taken seriously -- at least politically.", let's decompose the task step-by-step.

1. **Break down the given string into its propositions and reasons:**

   - **Proposition (P):** "Delores is a big supporter for equal pay for equal work."
   - **Reason (R):** "This is the same policy that all those extreme feminist groups support."
   - **Conclusion:** "Extremists like Delores should not be taken seriously -- at least politically."

2. **Determine which parts are relevant for identifying potential defective arguments:**
   
   - The Reason (R) needs to establish a causal connection or logical basis for the Proposition (P).
   - The Conclusion is drawn from the Reason provided.

3. **Evaluate if the conclusion can be substantiated by the given Reason (R).**

4. **Classify the string based on the defective argument types defined:**

   - **Generalization (<G>):** Determine if the argument makes an assertion applicable to a majority or a specific part but refers to all.
     - The Reason links Delores's support for equal pay to "extreme feminist groups." This implicitly generalizes that Delores's stance is extreme because certain feminist groups support it. However, the generalization is not necessarily concluded, rather implied.
   
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Evaluate if the complete set of possibilities is enumerated.
     - The argument does not seem to claim a complete enumeration explicitly. Hence, <FE> might not be the appropriate type here.
   
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Assess if the Reason demonstrably proves the Proposition.
     - The Reason provided fails to conclusively demonstrate why Delores should be dismissed politically. It sets up an associative link based on another group's stance without directly addressing the merits or demerits of Delores's own position.
     - This is a strong candidate for <IR> since the reason does not directly address Delores’s support but rather relies on guilt by association.
   
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Check if the causal basis is compelling.
     - The causality here is weak. Associating Delores's political dismissiveness solely based on group association is not compelling enough as a causal basis for the claim.
     - This is another potential candidate as the causal basis seems insufficient.
   
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Identify if Reason is just a repetition of the Proposition.
     - This is not seen here. The Reason mentions associations with groups, not merely repeating the supporter stance.
   
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Look for assumptions based on a universally agreed point still in dispute.
     - The argument assumes that extreme feminist groups and hence any of their supporters are politically dismissible without substantiating it. This taps into a presumed consensus about extreme feminist groups but an agreement that might not be universally held or substantiated.
     - This could classify as <FU>.
   
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Determine if the Proof of Reason could be misunderstood in another sense.
     - The use of terms such as "extremist" could be ambiguous or loaded with connotations. However, this ambiguity is more about pejorative labeling and not another intended meaning misinterpreted.
     - This classification is less clear and likely not as fitting as some others.

5. **Select the most fitting defective argument type(s) based on the evaluation:**

Having analyzed the argument using above criteria, it seems:
- <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and 
- <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) appear most fitting primarily because the connection provided does not conclusively or sufficiently link Delores’s political dismissiveness to her support for equal pay given other feminist groups' stance.

So the classification task IDA (Identifying Defective Argument) application for the provided argument string would categorize it mainly under Inconclusive Reason (IR) and possibly Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).
