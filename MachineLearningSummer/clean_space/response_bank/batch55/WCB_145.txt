For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of IDA into specific steps) to the given string: "The economy continues to grow as the number of likes on my Instagram account continue to increase. Clearly, the two are linked," we'll break down the task of classifying the string into specific steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
First, we locate and identify the Proposition set forth in the argument.
- **Proposition (P):** "The economy continues to grow as the number of likes on my Instagram account continue to increase. Clearly, the two are linked."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Next, we locate and identify the Reason that sets forth the causal basis for the Proposition.
- **Reason (R):** The belief that there is a causal relationship between "the increase in likes on my Instagram account" and "the growth of the economy."

### Step 3: Check for Proof of Reason (<PR>)
Now, we check if there is any corroborating argument presented to support the Reason.
- **Proof of Reason (PR):** There is no additional argument provided to support the Reason in this case.

### Step 4: Evaluate for Defective Argument Types
We now classify the argument <s> as a defective argument type from the list: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

#### Classification Criteria:
- **Generalization (G):** No evidence of over-generalization based on this single statement.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** No claim to have enumerated all possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason provided doesn't conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition. It assumes a causal link without evidence.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reason is weak because the causal basis claims a link between Instagram likes and economic growth without a compelling argument.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The Reason here doesn't merely repeat the Proposition but suggests an implied causal link.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There's no mention of a universal agreement claimed in the Reason.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** There's no evident ambiguous language which could be misinterpreted.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evaluation, the argument is defective primarily due to the causal explanation not being compelling or adequately reasoned. Thus, the argument can be classified as:
**Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The Reason provided for the Proposition lacks a compelling causal basis.

### Result:
- **Classification:** <WCB>
