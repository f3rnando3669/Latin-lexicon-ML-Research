For 
To apply the process of decomposing the task <IDA> into its specific steps <IDAA>, let's follow the structured approach through which we can classify the given argument.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
In the provided argument, the proposition or intended claim set forth by the politician can be summarized as:
- **<P>**: "We need to get rid of illegal immigrants."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
The reason provided to support this proposition is:
- **<R>**: "People's taxes are high because of illegal immigrants."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason <PR>
The argument lacks explicit additional corroborative detail or evidence, thus it does not contain a clear **<PR>**. This is notable, as it's supposed to substantiate <R>.

### Step 4: Look for defective argument types
Next, we identify if the argument shows any signs of being defective, based on the given types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>:

- **Generalization (G)**: An assertion is made based on part or majority but not necessarily all. ["Illegal immigrants" are blamed for high taxes without statistical comprehensive evidence.]
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Complete enumeration of possibilities is not made. [Other causes of high taxes are not mentioned or refuted.]
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. [Blaming "illegal immigrants" fails to conclusively show they are the primary cause of high taxes.]
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Reason is weak causally. [Claiming a direct cause from illegal immigration to high taxes lacks causal strength.]
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Reason repeats the Proposition. Not present in this argument.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Using universal agreement for proof in dispute. Not applicable here.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Using language that can be taken in another sense. [The term "illegal immigrants" and linkage to high taxes can be interpreted ambiguously.]

### Step 5: Classify the defective argument
From the recognized defects:

- The argument is a **Generalization (G)** since it attributes high taxes to illegal immigrants broadly without supporting evidence.
- It shows **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** because it overlooks other potential causes of high taxes.
- The Reason is **Inconclusive (IR)** due to lack of substantive evidence proving illegal immigrants are the primary cause of high taxes.
- Displays characteristics of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, because the linkage between "illegal immigrants" and high taxes lacks compelling evidence.

### Step 6: Summary of the evaluation
Conclusively, the argument “Mob of people: Lower taxes! Lower taxes! Politician: People, your taxes are high because of illegal immigrants. That's right—illegal immigrants. We need to get rid of them. Mob of people: (murmuring amongst themselves) Hmmm... immigrants. Let's get rid of them!” can be classified as exhibiting multiple defective argument types, primarily:
1. **Generalization (G)**
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

Thus, the argument should be reviewed and refined to address these issues for it to be logical and compelling.
