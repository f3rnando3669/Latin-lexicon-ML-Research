For 
To apply the process defined as IDAA to the string "AttP 11: It is okay to walk across Mr. Jones's property as evidenced by other people walking on his property," we need to decompose the task of classifying the string into specific steps, analyze it according to those steps, and determine the type of defective argument it represents. Here is the step-by-step decomposition and analysis:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\<P\>)
The proposition (\<P\>) is the statement that sets forth what the argument intends to prove.
- **\<P\>:** "It is okay to walk across Mr. Jones's property."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\<R\>)
The reason (\<R\>) sets forth the causal basis for the proposition, establishing the truth of what is being urged.
- **\<R\>:** "As evidenced by other people walking on his property."

### Step 3: Analyze the Reason (\<R\>) in Detail
To classify the defective argument, we need to closely examine the reason provided:
- **\<R\>** is citing the behavior of others (other people walking on his property) as evidence that it is okay to do so.

### Step 4: Determine the Type of Defective Argument
We now classify the argument according to one of the defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - \<P\> is an assertion based on some one part or a majority, not necessarily applicable to all.
   - Example: Making a universal claim based on limited observations.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - \<P\> claims to have considered all possibilities but misses some.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - \<R\> does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of \<P\>.
   - Example: Providing insufficient evidence to establish the truth of the proposition.
   
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - \<R\> submits a weak causal basis for \<P\>.
   - Example: The basis for the reason is not compelling.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - \<R\> merely repeats what was said in \<P\>.
   
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - \<PR\> is assumed as certain because it's "universally agreed upon," even if in dispute.
   
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - \<PR\> can be taken in a different sense than intended.

### Step 5: Match the Reason with Defective Argument Types
- The reason given (\<R\>: "as evidenced by other people walking on his property") does not conclusively demonstrate that it is okay to walk across Mr. Jones’s property. Just because other people do something doesn’t make it justifiable or allowed. This fits the type where reasoning is inconclusive.

### Step 6: Conclusion
- **Defective Argument Type:** Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)

### Final Classification
The argument "AttP 11: It is okay to walk across Mr. Jones's property as evidenced by other people walking on his property" is classified as an Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>).

In summary, applying IDAA resulted in identifying the argument as having an Inconclusive Reason, which means the reason provided does not adequately support the proposition.
