For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of identifying defective arguments) to the statement "Paranormal activity is real because I've seen a ghost," we follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>):**
   - **<P>:** Paranormal activity is real.
   - **<R>:** Because I've seen a ghost.

2. **Analyze the Proposition (<P>):**
   - **<P> is:** Paranormal activity is real. This is a broad claim about the existence of paranormal activity.

3. **Analyze the Reason (<R>):**
   - **<R> is:** I've seen a ghost. This is a personal anecdote used to support the proposition.

4. **Examine the Reason (<R>) against Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** Does <R> imply that the experience of seeing a ghost should be applied universally?
     - Yes, it does. The reason uses a specific personal experience to make a broad claim about the reality of paranormal activity.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Does <P> claim a complete enumeration when some possibilities might be missed?
     - No, it does not. This type does not apply here.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Does <R> provide an inconclusive demonstration of the correctness of <P>?
     - Yes, personal anecdotes are typically considered inconclusive as they lack broader empirical evidence.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Is the causal basis (<R>) insufficient or weak to support <P>?
     - Yes, seeing a ghost provides a weak causal basis for the broad claim of paranormal activity being real.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Does <R> simply restate <P>?
     - No, this does not apply here. The reason is not merely restating the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Does <PR> assume consensus while the matter is still in dispute?
     - No, there is no presumption of universal agreement; it is rather a personal claim.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Is ambiguous language used such that <PR> could be taken in another sense?
     - No, the language is not particularly ambiguous.

5. **Identify the Most Applicable Defective Argument Types:**
   - Based on the analysis, the statement most closely fits the following defective argument types:
     - **Generalization (<G>)**
     - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**

**Final Classification:**
The statement "Paranormal activity is real because I've seen a ghost" can be classified as containing defective arguments of types <G> (Generalization), <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).

Thus, the application of IDAA to the given statement results in the identification of these specific defective argument types.
