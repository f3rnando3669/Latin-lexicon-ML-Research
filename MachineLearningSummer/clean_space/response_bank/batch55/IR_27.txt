For 
In applying <IDAA> (the application of decomposition to classifying a defective argument) to the string "Marty said that his Xbox One X had better resolution than Phil’s PS4 during their gaming console debate. Phil suddenly brought up how powerful his PC was when Marty started talking about the specs of the two gaming consoles," let’s break down the task into specific steps:

1. **Understand the proposition <P>:**
   - Identify the primary Proposition (assertion/claim) made.
     - Marty claimed that "his Xbox One X had better resolution than Phil’s PS4."

2. **Understand the Reason <R>:**
   - Identify if there is a causal basis provided for the Proposition.
     - Phil did not directly address the resolution comparison but brought up an unrelated aspect: the power of his PC.

3. **Examine for Proof of Reason <PR>:**
   - Check if additional arguments or evidence were provided to support the Reason.
     - No evidence was mentioned in Phil’s response regarding his PC’s power in the context of the Xbox One X and PS4 comparison.

4. **Identify the type of defective argument:**
   - Given that Phil's response about his PC’s power does not logically address the original proposition about the resolution comparison between the Xbox One X and PS4, we can classify this as an irrelevant response.

Let's map this to the types of defective arguments defined earlier:

- **Generalization <G>:** Not applicable here since Phil's response is not based on over-generalizing.
- **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>:** Not applicable as completeness of possibilities isn’t the issue here.
- **Inconclusive Reason <IR>:** Phil did not provide any reason related to the original claim to analyze.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>:** Phil didn’t provide a causal basis at all for the resolution comparison.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>:** Not applicable as Phil’s response wasn’t a repetition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>:** Not relevant since no consensus or universal agreement was claimed.
- **Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>:** Not applicable as there’s no ambiguity in the language used.

Given the analysis, the argument fails to address the relevant proposition effectively, but of the defective types listed, it does closely resemble an irrelevant or inconclusive response as it strays off-topic and doesn't engage with the original claim about resolution.

Therefore, the argument is most suitably classified under:

**<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: where the Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition because it diverts to an unrelated subject.
