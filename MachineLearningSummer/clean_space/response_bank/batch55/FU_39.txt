For 
To apply the process defined as <IDAA> to the string "Form: Idea X is popular. Therefore, X is correct," we need to decompose the task <IDA> (which is to classify the string as one of the defective argument types) into specific steps.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>) and Application to <IDA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>):**
   - **Proposition (<P>):** "Idea X is correct."
   - **Reason (<R>):** "Idea X is popular."

2. **Analyze the Type of Defective Argument:**
   - To classify <s> as one of the defined defective argument types, consider each definition in relation to the given <P> and <R>.

3. **Generalization (Type <G>):**
   - A <P> based on a specific part or majority, generalized to all.
   - Here, there's no reference to a specific part or majority making a generalized claim. 

4. **Incomplete Enumeration (Type <FE>):**
   - Defective claim of complete possibilities.
   - There’s no enumeration of possibilities in the argument.

5. **Inconclusive Reason (Type <IR>):**
   - <R> does not conclusively prove <P>.
   - The popularity of an idea does not provide a logically conclusive reason that it is correct.

6. **Insufficient Causal Basis (Type <WCB>):**
   - Weak causal basis for the proposition.
   - Popularity (a weak or non-causal basis) is not a compelling proof of correctness.

7. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (Type <RR>):**
   - <R> repeats <P> in different words.
   - "Idea X is popular" is not a repetition of "Idea X is correct."

8. **Presumptuous Consensus (Type <FU>):**
   - Assuming truth due to universal agreement.
   - “Idea X is popular” might imply presumptive consensus, but it is not sufficient as universal acclaim or a known disputable matter.

9. **Ambiguous Language Use (Type <DEP>):**
   - <PR> could be taken in another sense.
   - No linguistic ambiguity in this context.

### Conclusion:
The argument "Idea X is popular. Therefore, X is correct" can exhibit characteristics of two types of defective arguments:
 - **Insufficient Causal Basis (Type <WCB>)**, since popularity is not a compelling causal reason for correctness.
 - **Inconclusive Reason (Type <IR>)**, since the reason given does not conclusively prove the proposition.

Given a need to classify it definitively under one type:
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (Type <WCB>)** is more specific since it's about the weakness of popularity as a reason.

### Application of <IDAA> Conclusion:
The string "Form: Idea X is popular. Therefore, X is correct." ends classified as **Type <WCB>**: Insufficient Causal Basis.
