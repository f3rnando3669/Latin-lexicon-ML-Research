For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "What’s the point of living? We’re all going to die anyway," we need to decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps and subsequently apply those steps. Here's the decomposition and execution of the classification process:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- **Proposition (<P>)**: The statement or assertion to be evaluated is "What’s the point of living?"

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- **Reason (<R>)**: The causal basis or rationale provided for the proposition is "We’re all going to die anyway."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Argument Type
Using the definitions provided for defective arguments, we need to see if the given argument fits any of the specific types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Does <P> make an assertion based on a part or a majority, but not necessarily applicable to all? 
   - No, the statement doesn't seem to be a generalization about a part or majority but rather a philosophical question.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Does <P> claim a complete enumeration of possibilities but miss some pertinent ones?
   - No, the argument doesn't enumerate possibilities but rather questions the point of an action (living).

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Does <R> fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of <P>?
   - Yes, the reason "We’re all going to die anyway" does not conclusively validate the proposition "What’s the point of living?". It implies that the inevitability of death nullifies the reasons for living, which is not necessarily a conclusive argument.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Is <R> providing a weak causal link for <P>?
   - Yes, the causal basis is weak because stating that we will eventually die doesn’t provide a compelling reason not to live or find purpose while living.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Does <R> repeat <P> rather than provide a new rationale?
   - No, in this case, <R> is not a mere repetition of <P>; it provides a rationale, albeit a weak one.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Is <PR> considered certain merely because it is "universally agreed upon" something still disputed?
   - No, the argument does not rely on universal agreement for its conclusion.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Is there ambiguous language in <PR> that can be interpreted differently than intended?
   - No, the language in <R> and <P> seems clear and not particularly ambiguous.

### Conclusion
Based on the identified aspects and evaluations, the argument "What’s the point of living? We’re all going to die anyway" aligns mostly with the following defective argument types:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: because the reason provided does not conclusively prove the proposition.
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: because the causal basis (inevitability of death) is not compelling enough to justify the conclusion (no point in living).

Thus, the statement can be classified primarily as <IR> and <WCB>.
