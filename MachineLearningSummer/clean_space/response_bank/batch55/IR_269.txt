To apply the decomposition of the advanced task IDA (classifying the argument defect type) step by step to the given string "There's no point listening to your opinion on school lunches. Everybody knows you cheat on your math tests," we first break down the task into smaller steps.

### Steps to Apply IDAA:

1. **Identify the Proposition and Reason(s):**
   - Proposition (P): This is the statement we intend to prove.
   - Reason (R): This is the basis or rationale for the Proposition.

2. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:**
   - Compare the argument to the defined defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - "There's no point listening to your opinion on school lunches."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - "Everybody knows you cheat on your math tests."

3. **Analyze the Argument for Defective Types:**
   - Check if the argument fits any of the defective types.

#### Examination:

- **Generalization (G):**
  - This doesn't seem to be a generalization based on a subset but rather dismissing a viewpoint due to an irrelevant fact.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
  - This is not about missing out on possibilities in enumeration.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
  - The reason provided does not directly relate to the credibility of the opinion on school lunches, thus it is not a conclusive reason for dismissing the opinion.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
  - The reason is not restating the proposition; it introduces a new, albeit irrelevant, fact.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
  - The reason given fails to establish a valid causal link between cheating on math tests and the validity of the opinion on school lunches.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
  - This does involve an assumed truth ("Everybody knows") which may not be universally agreed upon, linking to another unrelated consensus.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
  - The language isn't ambiguous; it's a straightforward, albeit irrelevant, claim.

### Conclusion:
The most fitting defective argument type is **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. The provided reason does not support the proposition reliably; it uses an unrelated fact to dismiss the opinion, hence, the causal basis for the rejection is not established.

### Classification:
- **Defective Argument Type:** Inconclusive Reason (IR)

By applying IDAA, we've decomposed the process and classified the argument:
"There's no point listening to your opinion on school lunches. Everybody knows you cheat on your math tests." as an instance of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because cheating on math tests does not relate to the validity of opinions on school lunches.
