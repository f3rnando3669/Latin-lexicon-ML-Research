To apply the decomposition of the task of classifying the string "If I make an exception for you then I'll have to make an exception for everyone" as a defective argument type (using the definitions provided), we will proceed step by step.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Understand the Proposition Involved:**
   - This step involves identifying the proposition or claim being made in the string.
   
   Proposition (P): "If I make an exception for you then I'll have to make an exception for everyone."

2. **Analyze the Reasoning Provided (if any):**
   - This step aims to discern any reasoning or causal basis given that establishes the truth of the proposition.
   
   Reason (R): The implied reason is that making an exception for one person sets a precedent leading to exceptions for everyone.

3. **Evaluate Supporting Arguments (Proof of Reason):**
   - This step examines any additional arguments provided to support the reasoning.
   
   Proof of Reason (PR): There are no additional arguments presented for scrutiny here.

4. **Classify the String as a Defective Argument Type:**
   - This step considers the different defective argument types and matches the given string to one of them based on the definitions.
   
   ### Matching to Defective Argument Types:

   - **Generalization (G):** Is the argument applying a characteristic from one instance to a broad and diverse group unjustifiably?
     - Analysis: This matches as it generalizes an action for one person to everyone without sufficient justification.
   
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Does the argument fail to consider all possibilities but claims to be complete?
     - Analysis: This string does not claim to enumerate possibilities exhaustively.
   
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Is the reason provided insufficient to conclusively prove the proposition?
     - Analysis: The reasoning doesn't conclusively prove the necessity of the stated outcome.
     
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the causal basis weak or unconvincing?
     - Analysis: In a real-world context, the causal basis that making one exception requires making exceptions for everyone is far from compelling universally.
     
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Is the reason merely repeating the proposition without adding support?
     - Analysis: No, the reason ("leading to have to make an exception for everyone") introduces an additional idea, not a mere repetition.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Is the argument assuming consensus on a disputed point?
     - Analysis: The argument does not rely on assumed universal agreement.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Could the proposition be interpreted in more than one way due to language ambiguity?
     - Analysis: The language use is straightforward and the proposition is not notably ambiguous.

Having considered all the defective argument types, we can conclude:

### Conclusion:
The defect in this argument aligns most closely with **Generalization (G)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The statement suggests a broad general outcome from a specific action without adequate justification, thus matching the definition of a Generalization. Additionally, the reasoning presented lacks a compelling causal basis, fitting the description of Insufficient Causal Basis.

However, since the most prominent feature is the broad and unsupported generalization from one case to all, the primary classification would be **Generalization (G)**.
