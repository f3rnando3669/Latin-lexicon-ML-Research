For 
To apply IDAA (decomposition of a task into specific steps) to identify the type of defective argument in the given sentence, "Since many people believe this, then it must be true," we'll break down the process into detailed steps. 

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Extract the Proposition <P>**:
   - Identify what the argument is intending to prove.
   - In this case: The implicit proposition is "It must be true."

2. **Identify the Reason <R>**:
   - Determine the causal basis that is provided for the proposition.
   - In this case: "Since many people believe this"

3. **Check for Proof of Reason <PR>**:
   - Look for additional arguments that corroborate the Reason.
   - There is no further proof given in the statement.

4. **Analyze for Defective Argument**:
   - Compare the given statement to the definitions of defective argument types.

Based on the definitions provided:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - Check if the Proposition is an assertion based on a part or majority but not necessarily applicable to all.
   - This is not applicable here as it doesn't seem to generalize from a sample to a whole category.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - Check if it claims to have made a complete enumeration of possibilities but misses some.
   - This doesn't fit as the argument does not enumerate possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - Check if the Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.
   - This might be the case, but there's a more precise defect here.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - Check if the Reason provided is weak or not compelling.
   - Again, this is related but there's a more specific match.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - Check if the Reason and the Proposition are essentially saying the same thing.
   - This is not applicable here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - Check if the Proof of Reason assumes something as certain because it is "universally agreed upon."
   - This fits perfectly as the Reason is "many people believe this" and assumes truth from that belief.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
   - Check if any part of the argument could be taken in another sense than intended.
   - This is not applicable as thereâ€™s no ambiguous language.

### Conclusion:
The defective argument type for the given string "Since many people believe this, then it must be true" is **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**. The reason is that it asserts something must be true because it is widely believed, which presumes consensus as a basis for truth without further proof.
