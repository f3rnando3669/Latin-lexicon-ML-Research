For 
To apply \(\langle IDAA \rangle\) to the statement "Birds can fly; therefore, penguins can fly," we need to decompose the task of classifying the defective argument into specific steps. 

### Decomposition \(\langle D \rangle\) of \(\langle t \rangle\):
1. **Identify the Proposition (\(\langle P \rangle\)):** Extract the proposition from the given statement.
2. **Identify the Reason (\(\langle R \rangle\)):** Determine the reason or causal basis for the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\(\langle PR \rangle\)):** Check if thereâ€™s any additional argument provided to support the reason.
4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type (\(\langle IDA \rangle\)):** Determine which specific defective argument type(s) the statement belongs to.

### Applying \(\langle IDAA \rangle\) to "Birds can fly; therefore, penguins can fly":
1. **Identify the Proposition (\(\langle P \rangle\)):**
   - **Proposition (\(\langle P \rangle\)):** "Penguins can fly."

2. **Identify the Reason (\(\langle R \rangle\)):**
   - **Reason (\(\langle R \rangle\)):** "Birds can fly."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\(\langle PR \rangle\)):**
   - There is no additional argument provided to support the reason beyond the initial assertion. 

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type (\(\langle IDA \rangle\)):**
   - **Generalization (\(\langle G \rangle\)):** The reason asserts that "birds can fly," which is a generalization. The proposition "penguins can fly" is a specific instance of birds. However, this overlooks the fact that not all birds can fly (e.g., penguins).
   
Therefore, the statement "Birds can fly; therefore, penguins can fly" is classified as a defective argument of type:

- **Generalization (\(\langle G \rangle\))** because it incorrectly generalizes the ability to fly from the broader group of birds to all birds, including penguins, which are an exception.
