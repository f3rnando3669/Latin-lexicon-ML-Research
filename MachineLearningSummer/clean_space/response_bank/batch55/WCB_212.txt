For 
Let's apply the decomposition of the advanced task (IDAA) to the task of classifying the given string as a defective argument type (IDA).

The given string is: "The economy continues to grow as the number of 'likes' on my Instagram account continue to increase. Clearly, the two are linked."

### Step-by-Step Analysis (D):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Proposition (P): "The economy continues to grow as the number of 'likes' on my Instagram account continue to increase."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Reason (R): "Clearly, the two are linked."

3. **Evaluate the Reason and its Causal Basis:**
   - The reason asserts a cause-and-effect relationship between the growth of the economy and the increase in Instagram likes. However, this connection is not substantiated with evidence nor does it provide a compelling causal basis.

4. **Match with Defective Argument Types:**
   - Check if it fits <G> (Generalization): No, there's no generalization based on a part or majority of a whole.
   - Check if it fits <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration): No, this does not claim complete enumeration of possibilities.
   - Check if it fits <IR> (Inconclusive Reason): It is inconclusive because the 'reason' given ("the two are linked") is not actual evidence but a mere assertion.
   - Check if it fits <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition): No, the reason does not duplicate the proposition.
   - Check if it fits <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis): Yes, the causal basis ("the number of likes on Instagram") is not compelling or sufficient enough to establish the truth of the proposition regarding economic growth.
   - Check if it fits <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus): No, it does not assume universal agreement.
   - Check if it fits <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use): No, there's no ambiguity in language use. 

### Conclusion:
The defective argument type that best matches the given string is <WCB> because the reason provided does not present a compelling causal basis for the proposition.

Thus, the given string is classified as: **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
