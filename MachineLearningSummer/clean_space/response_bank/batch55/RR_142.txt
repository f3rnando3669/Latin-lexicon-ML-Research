For 
Sure, let's decompose the task of classifying the given statement into specific steps:

### Task Decomposition for Identification Task (\<IDAA\>)
1. **Identify the Proposition (\<P\>):**
   - Understand what is being asserted in the statement.

2. **Identify the Reason (\<R\>):**
   - Determine what causal basis is provided to support the proposition.

3. **Analyze the Completeness and Consistency:**
   - Assess if the reason provided sufficiently demonstrates the proposition.

4. **Evaluate the Argument for Defective Types:**
   - Generalization (\<G\>): Is the proposition based on an unwarranted generalization?
   - Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>): Does the argument ignore relevant possibilities?
   - Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>): Does the reason fail to conclusively support the proposition?
   - Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>): Is the reason provided weak or unconvincing?
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>): Does the reason merely repeat the proposition?
   - Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>): Is there an assumption of consensus that isn't established?
   - Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>): Is the language used in an ambiguous manner?

### Applying IDAA to the Statement: "The Philippines is in poverty because of poor people."

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\<P\>):**
- Proposition: "The Philippines is in poverty."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (\<R\>):**
- Reason: "because of poor people."

**Step 3: Analyze the Completeness and Consistency:**
- Does the reason "because of poor people" sufficiently demonstrate why "The Philippines is in poverty"?
  - This requires analyzing whether the poor state of the Philippines is conclusively explained by the existence of poor people.

**Step 4: Evaluate the Argument for Defective Types:**
   
   - **Generalization (\<G\>):**
     - The argument does not appear to generalize from a specific subset to the whole; rather, it makes a nationwide statement.
   
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>):**
     - The argument ignores other possible causes for poverty, such as economic policies, corruption, unemployment rates, etc. It claims a singular cause without considering others.
   
   - **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>):**
     - The reason provided ("because of poor people") does not demonstrate the cause of poverty well. Poverty is a complex issue that cannot be explained solely by the presence of poor people.
   
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>):**
     - The reason is weak because it lacks a compelling explanation of how the presence of poor people is the cause of poverty. It does not provide a valid causal link.
   
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>):**
     - The reason essentially repeats the proposition in different words: saying the Philippines is in poverty because there are poor people is tautological.
   
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>):**
     - The argument does not assume a universal agreement as its basis; it fails for other reasons.
   
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>):**
     - The language used here is not ambiguous; it is quite straightforward.

### Conclusion:
The statement "The Philippines is in poverty because of poor people" is primarily subject to the defective argument types of:
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>):** It overlooks other potential causes of poverty.
- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>):** The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>):** The reason lacks a compelling causal explanation.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>):** The reason repeats the proposition in a circular manner.

Thus, the statement can be classified under \<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<WCB\>, and \<RR\>.
