For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "If we don’t teach teens to work harder, the human race is doomed," we need to decompose the task of classifying this string as one of the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>. Here is the step-by-step decomposition and application:

### Decomposition of <IDA> ("Classifying <s> as one of the defective argument types"):
1. **Identify the propositional part**: Analyze the statement to extract the primary proposition <P>.
2. **Identify the reason part**: Examine the statement to determine the reason <R> provided to support the proposition.
3. **Identify potential defective argument types**: Compare the structure of <P> and <R> with each defective argument type to make a classification.

### Application:

#### Step 1: Identify the propositional part <P>
- **Proposition (P)**: "The human race is doomed."

#### Step 2: Identify the reason part <R>
- **Reason (R)**: "If we don’t teach teens to work harder."

#### Step 3: Identify potential defective argument types
- **Generalization (G)**: 
  - Is <P> based on an assertion regarding all or a majority based on only one part? 
  - **Analysis**: No, the statement does not generalize from a small part to a whole.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: 
  - Does <P> claim complete enumeration but miss some possibilities?
  - **Analysis**: No, the statement does not involve an enumeration of possibilities.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: 
  - Does <R> fail to conclusively demonstrate the truth of <P>?
  - **Analysis**: Yes, simply teaching teens to work harder does not conclusively prove that this alone can prevent the human race from being doomed. There could be many other relevant factors.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: 
  - Is the causal basis in <R> for <P> weak or not compelling?
  - **Analysis**: Yes, the causal link between not teaching teens to work harder and the human race being doomed is insufficient and not compelling.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: 
  - Does <R> repeat <P> in different words?
  - **Analysis**: No, <R> does not repeat <P>. It introduces a different concept regarding teens’ education.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: 
  - Is <PR> taken as certain based on universal agreement where there isn't one?
  - **Analysis**: No, this does not apply here as there is no <PR> that relies on presumptive consensus.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: 
  - Can <PR> be taken in a different sense than intended?
  - **Analysis**: No, the language in the statement is quite clear and specific in intent.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the statement "If we don’t teach teens to work harder, the human race is doomed" primarily suffers from defective argument types:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

Both types are applicable because the reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the truth of the proposition, and the causal basis is weak and not compelling.

### Final Classification:
- The statement is classified as **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
