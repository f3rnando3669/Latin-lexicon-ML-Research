For 
To apply the task of "IDAA" (which stands for the application of the decomposition of a task into specific steps to the task of classifying a string), let's break down the advanced task of identifying and classifying the argument "If you had school pride like the rest of us do, you would wear a mountain lion costume every day." step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the components of the argument

- **Proposition (P)**: "You would wear a mountain lion costume every day."
- **Reason (R)**: "If you had school pride like the rest of us do."

### Step 2: Analyze the Reason (R) to see if it meets the criteria

- **R** should set forth the causal basis for P.

### Step 3: Evaluate the Proposition (P) and Reason (R) for any defects

- **Generalization (G)**: Does P make an assertion based on a part or majority but not applicable to all?
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Does P assume completeness but actually miss out on pertinent possibilities?
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Does R fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of P?
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Is the causal basis in R weak or not compelling?
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Does R merely restate P in different words?
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Does P or R assume universal agreement on something disputable?
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Can any part of the statement be taken in another unintended sense?

### Step 4: Classification of the argument

#### Assess for Generalization (G):
- The assertion in P seems to apply to all in the context but is derived from a part ("like the rest of us do"). This fits the description of a Generalization (G).

#### Assess for Incomplete Enumeration (FE):
- There isn't an explicit enumeration of possibilities, so this may not apply directly.

#### Assess for Inconclusive Reason (IR):
- Is the reason "If you had school pride like the rest of us do" conclusive proof that P ("You would wear a mountain lion costume every day") must be true? No. The reason doesn't necessarily lead to the conclusion.

#### Assess for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):
- The causal link between school pride and wearing a costume every day isn't compelling; hence, this could apply.

#### Assess for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):
- The Reason (R) isn't a repeated version of Proposition (P), so this doesn't apply.

#### Assess for Presumptuous Consensus (FU):
- There's an implicit claim of universal agreement ("like the rest of us do"), which could fall under presumptuous consensus.

#### Assess for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):
- The language seems clear without an alternative interpretation.

### Conclusion:

The argument appears to primarily exhibit the characteristics of:
- **Generalization (G)**: Applying an assertion from the part ("the rest of us") to all.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Where the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Where the reason provided for having school pride leading to wearing a costume every day isn't strong.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Implicitly assuming universal agreement ("the rest of us do").

Given all the above observations, the most fitting classifications for this argument are **<G> (Generalization), <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis), and somewhat <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**. 

For the sake of simplicity and emphasis, we'll primarily classify it as **<G>, <IR>, and <WCB>**.
