Certainly! Applying the decomposition approach to classify the argument "People who read are smart," we'll break down the task step by step.

Step 1: Identify the Proposition \(\ <P> \)
- The proposition here is "People who read are smart."

Step 2: Identify the Reason \(\ <R>\)
- The reason in the statement is implicit, but it suggests that reading contributes to or indicates intelligence.

Step 3: Look for Proof of Reason \(\ <PR>\)
- This statement does not provide additional arguments or evidence to support the reason. It's a simple assertion.

Step 4: Assess for Defective Argument Types
   - **Generalization (G)**: Consider if the argument takes an assertion about some and incorrectly applies it to all.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Consider if it misses out on some pertinent possibilities or conditions.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Consider if the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Consider if the causal basis provided is weak or unconvincing.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Consider if the reason reiterates the proposition without adding new support.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Consider if the argument assumes a universally agreed point that is still in dispute.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Consider if the language can be interpreted in a way not intended by the speaker.

Step 5: Classify the Argument 

Let's classify "People who read are smart" under the defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This seems to be a clear case of generalization. The proposition makes a broad statement about all people who read based on what might be true for some or even most individuals who read. It doesn’t consider exceptions or variations.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument doesn't attempt to deal with the complete spectrum of possibilities. However, this issue is more characteristic of "FE."

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: In this case, the reason often implied by the statement doesn't conclusively prove the proposition. Reading can contribute to knowledge and critical thinking but doesn’t necessarily make everyone who reads "smart".

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal connection between reading and being smart is implied but not compellingly established.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: There’s no repetition for reason here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument does not rely on a presumed consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language isn’t particularly ambiguous.

**Conclusion:** The classification of "People who read are smart" seems most consistent with **Generalization (G)** and **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.

Both these defective argument types are applicable:
- It's a Generalization because it applies a trait to all readers without sufficient evidence.
- The Reason provided (implied) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition, making it an Inconclusive Reason.

Thus, the statement "People who read are smart" can be seen as falling primarily under **Generalization (G)**, and secondarily under **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
