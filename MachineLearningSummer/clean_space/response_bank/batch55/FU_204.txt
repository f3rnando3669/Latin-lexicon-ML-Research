For 
Certainly. To apply IDAA to the problem of "Trying to convince others that everyone is doing it or everyone feels this way so they should too," I will decompose the task (D) into specific steps for classifying the given string (IDA). Here are the steps for the decomposition:

1. **Identify the main proposition (P)**: Determine the primary assertion or claim being made.
2. **Identify the reason (R)**: Determine the causal basis or justification given for the proposition.
3. **Identify the proof of reason (PR)** if present: Check for any additional arguments that corroborate the reason.
4. **Analyze the type of defective argument**: Match the given argument against the definitions of defective argument types, namely G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, and DEP.
5. **Classify the argument**: Assign the correct defective argument type to the given string.

Let's apply these steps one by one:

### Step 1: Identify the main proposition (P)
The main proposition in the given statement is: 
- "Everyone is doing it or everyone feels this way so they should too."
  
This asserts that because a behavior or sentiment is universally or widely upheld, others should follow the same behavior or sentiment.

### Step 2: Identify the reason (R)
The reason provided for this proposition is the idea of widespread or universal consent:
- "Everyone is doing it or everyone feels this way."

### Step 3: Identify the proof of reason (PR) - if present
There doesn't seem to be additional arguments or evidence provided to further corroborate the reason in this statement. The statement relies solely on the assertion of universal consensus.

### Step 4: Analyze the type of defective argument
Now, let's match the given argument against the definitions of defective argument types:

- **Generalization (G)**: Not applicable here as the argument does not take a part or majority and assume it is all-encompassing.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable as there is no claim about a complete enumeration of possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Could be, but we would need to discuss if the reason demonstrates the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Could be, but we would need to check if the causality is weak.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Not applicable as the reason does introduce a new concept (universal consent) rather than repeating the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This matches perfectly as the argument assumes a proposition to be true based on the idea that everyone agrees.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Does not seem applicable as the language in the given statement is clear.

### Step 5: Classify the argument
Based on the definitions provided and the analysis, the given string "Trying to convince others that everyone is doing it or everyone feels this way so they should too" is best classified as Presumptuous Consensus (FU). 

**Conclusion:**
- The string "Trying to convince others that everyone is doing it or everyone feels this way so they should too" falls under the defective argument type FU, Presumptuous Consensus.
