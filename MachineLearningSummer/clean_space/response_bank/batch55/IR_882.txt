For 
To apply the task of identifying the defective argument type (<IDA>) to the statement "You can’t give me a C. I’ll lose my scholarship," we need to break down the advanced task (<t>) using the decomposition approach (<D>). Let's do this step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - What is the main assertion or claim being made?

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - What is the causal basis or reason given to support the Proposition?

3. **Evaluate the Proposition and Reason**:
   - Determine if the Reason (<R>) conclusively supports the Proposition (<P>).
   - Check if the Reason is a repetition of the Proposition.
   - Identify if the Reason involves generalization, incomplete enumeration, insufficient causal basis, etc.
   
4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type (<IDA>)**:
   - Based on the evaluation, classify the given string according to the defined defective argument types.

### Applying <IDAA> to "You can’t give me a C. I’ll lose my scholarship.":

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Proposition (<P>): "You can’t give me a C."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Reason (<R>): "I’ll lose my scholarship."

3. **Evaluate the Proposition and Reason**:
   - Check if the Reason conclusively supports the Proposition: The reason given is that the student will lose their scholarship if they receive a C grade.
   - Analyze if this Reason directly proves the Proposition: The given Reason does not actually address whether the grade was deserved based on academic performance. It instead appeals to the consequences of receiving the grade, which is not a sufficiently compelling basis to argue against the grade.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type (<IDA>)**:
   - The Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition because it appeals to consequences rather than addressing the merit of the grade. Thus, it seems to fall under <IR>, "Inconclusive Reason" since it does not provide a valid justification for why the grade should not be given.

Therefore, the defective argument type (<IDA>) for the statement "You can’t give me a C. I’ll lose my scholarship" is classified as **<IR>**: Inconclusive Reason.
