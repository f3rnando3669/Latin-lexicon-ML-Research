### Decomposition of Task (D) for IDA

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Assess the main claim that is intended to be proven.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Determine the causal basis provided for the Proposition.

3. **Classify the Defective Argument (IDA):**
   - Analyze the given argument and identify if it fits any of the defective argument types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

### Application of Decomposition (IDAA) to the Given Argument

Given argument: "I saw Ashton Kutcher in a prescription drug commercial, therefore it has to be an effective drug."

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**

- **Proposition (P):** The drug has to be effective.

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)**

- **Reason (R):** Ashton Kutcher appeared in a commercial for the drug.

**Step 3: Classify the Defective Argument (IDA)**

Let's analyze the argument:

1. **Generalization (G):** Does this argument make an assertion about the drug's effectiveness based on the involvement of one individual (Ashton Kutcher)?
   - No, it's not exactly about generalization as it does not reference a majority or a specific group but rather a single celebrity.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Is there a claim of completeness in possibilities that is actually missing some pertinent ones?
   - No, the argument does not present itself as an enumeration of all possible factors affecting the drug's effectiveness.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does the reason (appearance of Ashton Kutcher) conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (drug's effectiveness)?
   - The presence of a celebrity in an advertisement does not provide any scientific or medical evidence for the drug’s effectiveness. This suggests an IR as the reason does not logically support the proposition.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the causal basis (Ashton Kutcher being in the commercial) weak in supporting the proposition?
   - Yes, the causal basis of a celebrity endorsement is weak and not directly related to the drug's effectiveness.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Does the reason repeat the proposition in different words?
   - No, the reason about Ashton Kutcher appearing in a commercial is not a repetition of the proposition about the drug’s effectiveness.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Does the argument assume universal agreement on something that is disputed?
   - No, the argument doesn’t assume a consensus but rather relies on the influence of a celebrity which isn’t implied as a universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Can the argument be taken in another sense than intended?
   - No, the argument is clear about linking a celebrity endorsement to the drug’s effectiveness, so no ambiguous language is involved.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the decomposition and analysis, the argument primarily fits the category of Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).

**Final Classification:**
The argument "I saw Ashton Kutcher in a prescription drug commercial, therefore it has to be an effective drug" is of type <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
