For 
To apply the process of <IDAA> to the statement "My dad went to school, so he knows everything about the education system," we will decompose the advanced task <IDA> into specific steps required to classify the argument type. Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Proposition (<P>)
1. **Identify the Proposition**: What is being asserted or intended to be proven?
   - **Proposition**: "My dad knows everything about the education system."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
2. **Identify the Reason offered for the Proposition**: What causal basis is being provided to support the proposition?
   - **Reason**: "My dad went to school."

### Step 3: Look for a Proof of Reason (<PR>)
3. **Identify if there is any additional argument supporting the Reason** (i.e., Proof of Reason):
   - **Proof of Reason**: None explicitly provided in the statement.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument Based on Defective Types
4. **Evaluate the argument against each defective argument type**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement might suggest that from one person's experience (or from the fact that the majority, including the dad, went to school), it is generalized that he knows everything about the education system.
     - **Analysis**: The fact that one person attended school does not necessarily imply comprehensive knowledge of the entire education system.
     - **Decision**: Potentially <G> because it generalizes one individual's experience.
   
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement does not enumerate all possibilities but implies a complete understanding through limited evidence.
     - **Analysis**: It does not apply here because it is not claiming completeness among multiple possibilities.
     - **Decision**: Not <FE>.
   
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition.
     - **Analysis**: Simply going to school does not conclusively prove someone knows everything about the education system.
     - **Decision**: Potentially <IR>.
   
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis provided is not compelling.
     - **Analysis**: Attending school is not a compelling reason to assert comprehensive knowledge of the entire education system.
     - **Decision**: Potentially <WCB>.
   
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The reason is essentially the same as the proposition.
     - **Analysis**: The reason and proposition here are not repeats; they are distinct.
     - **Decision**: Not <RR>.
   
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The statement assumes consensus on a matter still in dispute.
     - **Analysis**: The proposition does not assume universal agreement but rather makes a specific claim about the father's knowledge.
     - **Decision**: Not <FU>.
   
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The proof of reason can be taken differently than intended.
     - **Analysis**: There is no ambiguous language affecting understanding here.
     - **Decision**: Not <DEP>.

### Step 5: Conclude the Classification
5. **Determine the most fitting defective argument type**: Based on the analysis above, identify which defective argument type best classifies the statement.
   - **Conclusion**: The argument type can be classified under:
     - **Primary Classification**:  **<G>** (Generalization)
     - **Secondary Classification**: **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason) and **<WCB>** (Insufficient Causal Basis)

The primary generalization is that attending school does not necessarily mean knowing everything about the education system. Furthermore, the reason given (going to school) is insufficient and inconclusive to establish the proposition that the dad knows everything about the education system.

This concludes the process of applying <IDAA> to classify the statement "My dad went to school, so he knows everything about the education system."
