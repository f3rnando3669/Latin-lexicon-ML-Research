For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "Allowing gay marriage puts us on the way to polygamy and bestiality," we will decompose the task of classifying the string as defective argument type <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP> into specific steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
First, identify the statement intended to be proven.
- In this case, the proposition <P> is: "Allowing gay marriage puts us on the way to polygamy and bestiality."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
Next, identify the reason given to support the proposition.
- The reason <R> here is implicitly that "gay marriage will lead to further changes in marriage norms, thereby progressing to polygamy and bestiality."

### Step 3: Examine the Type of Defective Argument
Now, we analyze the argument to classify it among the defective argument types defined.

#### Step 3.1: Check for Generalization <G>
- Does the argument take an attribute of a part or a majority and unjustly apply it to all? 
  - This doesn't fit the generalization type since it's about a slippery slope rather than generalizing from a part to a whole.

#### Step 3.2: Check for Incomplete Enumeration <FE>
- Does the argument claim a complete enumeration of possibilities but miss out pertinent cases? 
  - This doesn't seem to be about listing possibilities.

#### Step 3.3: Check for Inconclusive Reason <IR>
- Does the Reason <R> not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of Proposition <P>?
  - Yes, the reason that allowing gay marriage will lead to polygamy and bestiality is highly speculative and does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. 

#### Step 3.4: Check for Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>
- Is the Reason <R> weak because the causal basis submitted for <P> is not compelling?
  - Yes, the causal connection between allowing gay marriage and leading to polygamy and bestiality is not substantiated with any compelling evidence or logical basis.

#### Step 3.5: Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>
- Does the Reason <R> merely restate the Proposition <P> rather than provide support for it?
  - In this case, the reason does attempt to add something by claiming a causal relation, so it doesn't merely repeat the proposition.

#### Step 3.6: Check for Presumptuous Consensus <FU>
- Is the Proof of Reason <PR> assumed as certain based on a presumed consensus?
  - There is no mention of universal agreement or consensus in this argument, so this does not apply.

#### Step 3.7: Check for Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>
- Can the Proof of Reason <PR> be taken in another sense than intended?
  - The language here is relatively clear in its intent.

### Step 4: Choose the Most Appropriate Type
Based on the analysis:

- The argument fits *both* <IR> ("Inconclusive Reason") and <WCB> ("Insufficient Causal Basis") as it fails to conclusively demonstrate the proposed outcome, and the causal link proposed is weak and unsubstantiated.

### Conclusion
Based on applying <IDAA>, the string "Allowing gay marriage puts us on the way to polygamy and bestiality" is classified as either:
- <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)
- <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)
