For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a string as a type of defective argument) to the given statement, we need to break down the task into specific steps and then classify the string. Here is the step-by-step process:

1. **Identify the Proposition**:
   - Proposition (<P>): The statement summarizes what is intended to be proved.
   - In the given statement: "Since 88% of people polled believe in UFOs, they must exist,” the Proposition seems to be "UFOs must exist."

2. **Identify the Reason**:
   - Reason (<R>): This sets forth the causal basis for the proposition.
   - In the given statement: "Since 88% of people polled believe in UFOs," is given as the Reason.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason**:
   - Proof of Reason (<PR>): This corroborates the Reason with additional arguments.
   - In this specific case, there doesn't seem to be an additional argument provided in the statement, other than referencing the poll statistics.

4. **Decompose to Check for Defective Argument Types**:
   - We will now check the statement against each defective argument type defined:

   a. **Generalization (<G>)**: Does the Proposition refer to all based on a partial or majority opinion?
      - "Since 88% of people polled believe in UFOs" applies findings from a poll to make a universal claim about the existence of UFOs.
      - This fits Generalization (<G>).

   b. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Does the argument claim completeness but miss pertinent possibilities?
      - The statement doesn't enumerate possibilities, so this is not applicable.

   c. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Does the Reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the Proposition?
      - The belief of 88% of people is an opinion, not a conclusive proof of existence.
      - This also fits Inconclusive Reason (<IR>).

   d. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Is the causal basis not compelling enough?
      - The belief of individuals is not a strong causal basis for the existence of UFOs.
      - This could fit Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).

   e. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Is the Reason just a rephrased version of the Proposition?
      - The Reason is different from the Proposition, so this is not applicable.

   f. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Is there an assumption of universal agreement which is disputed?
      - The 88% suggests a consensus, but it's not said to be "universally agreed upon,” hence not strongly fitting here.

   g. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Can the Proof of Reason be interpreted in a different sense than intended?
      - The statement is straightforward in language, so this is not applicable.

5. **Classify the String**:
   - From the analysis, the statement "Since 88% of people polled believe in UFOs, they must exist" can fit into three categories: Generalization (<G>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), and Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).

Among the strongest fits are:
- Generalization (<G>): as it takes a partial opinion and applies it to a universal claim.
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>): as the Reason does not conclusively prove the Proposition. 

Hence, final classification:
- Primary Classification: Generalization (<G>)
- Secondary Classification: Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)

Applying IDAA reveals that "Since 88% of people polled believe in UFOs, they must exist" primarily fits the defective argument type of Generalization (<G>), with a secondary possibility of Inconclusive Reason (<IR>).
