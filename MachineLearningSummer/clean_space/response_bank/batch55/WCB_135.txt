To apply the IDAA framework to the given statement, we need to decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps. We will break down and analyze the statement from Tony to determine which type of defective argument it represents.

Here is the statement:
"Tony: I bought a book on the law of attraction and two days later I won $30k in a lottery. I wasn’t a believer of the law of attraction before, but now I am!"

Steps for Decomposition (D):
1. Identify the Proposition (P) in Tony's statement.
2. Identify the Reason (R) provided for the Proposition.
3. Determine if the Reason (R) conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the Proposition (P).
4. Examine supporting details and context to ensure no other pertinent possibilities are missed.
5. Analyze the Relationship between the Proposition (P) and the Reason (R), and check for repetition, ambiguity, or presumption.

Step-by-step Application (IDAA):

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**
Tony's Proposition (P) is: "I am now a believer in the law of attraction."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)**
Tony's Reason (R) is: "I bought a book on the law of attraction and two days later I won $30k in a lottery."

**Step 3: Determine if the Reason (R) conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the Proposition (P)**
To determine if the Reason conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the Proposition, we need to check whether the Reason logically and compellingly supports the Proposition with evidence. In this case, the Reason is based on a temporal correlation (he bought the book and then won the lottery), but it does not provide a convincing causal link that the law of attraction caused him to win the lottery.

**Step 4: Examine supporting details and context to ensure no other pertinent possibilities are missed**
Tony's statement does not account for other factors such as chance, the large number of participants in lotteries, or randomness which are relevant in this context. The argument lacks a comprehensive enumeration of all potential factors that could have led to him winning the lottery.

**Step 5: Analyze the Relationship between the Proposition (P) and the Reason (R), and check for repetition, ambiguity, or presumption**
- Check for repetition: There is no clear repetition where the Proposition and the Reason say precisely the same thing.
- Check for ambiguity: There is no ambiguous language used in the Reason or Proposition as defined by the defective argument type DEP.
- Check for presumption: There is no clear case of Presumptuous Consensus (FU) in Tony's argument.

Considering the steps above, Tony's argument type most closely matches **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the Reason provided (temporal correlation) does not conclusively demonstrate the Proposition (that he became a believer due to the law of attraction’s efficacy).

### Final Classification:
The statement:
"Tony: I bought a book on the law of attraction and two days later I won $30k in a lottery. I wasn’t a believer of the law of attraction before, but now I am!"
Is of type:
**<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**
