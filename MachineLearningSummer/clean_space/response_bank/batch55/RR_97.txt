For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of IDA into specific steps) to the task of classifying the argument "President Reagan was a great communicator because he had the knack of talking effectively to the people," we need to follow a structured approach. Let's decompose the task and then classify the argument step by step.

### Step 1: Break down the Argument into Component Parts
Identify the Proposition (P), Reason (R), and possibly Proof of Reason (PR):
- **P (Proposition)**: President Reagan was a great communicator.
- **R (Reason)**: He had the knack of talking effectively to the people.

### Step 2: Assess Each Component of the Argument
Check if the Proposition (P) and Reason (R) are formulated correctly and what type of defect, if any, exists.

### Identify the Appropriate Defective Argument Type

#### Inconclusive Reason (IR)
- **Definition**: The Reason (R) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition (P).
- **Evaluation**: 
  - The Reason here is that Reagan "had the knack of talking effectively to the people."
  - While this suggests that his communication might be effective, it does not conclusively prove that he was a "great communicator."
  - There could be other factors involved in being a great communicator that are not addressed by simply having a knack for talking.

Therefore, the given argument has the hallmarks of an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** since the provided Reason does not sufficiently establish the Proposition on its own.

### Step 3: Conclude the Classification
Based on the decomposition and evaluation in the previous steps, we classify the string as follows:

- **Classified as**: Inconclusive Reason (IR)

Therefore, after applying the IDAA method to "President Reagan was a great communicator because he had the knack of talking effectively to the people," the argument is classified as **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**.
