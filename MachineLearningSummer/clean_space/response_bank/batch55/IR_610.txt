For 
To apply \( IDAA \) to the argument exchange between the Mother and Daughter, we will decompose the task \( IDA \) into specific steps. Here’s the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Identify the Propositions (\( P \)) and Reasons (\( R \))
First, we need to identify the key propositions and reasons in the argument.

**Mother:**  
\( P_{M} \): You should stop smoking.  
\( R_{M} \): It's harmful to your health.

**Daughter:**  
Response: Why should I listen to you? You started smoking when you were 16!

Since the Daughter’s response aims to challenge the Mother’s credibility rather than addressing the health risks directly, we analyze this separately in the subsequent steps.

### Step 2: Determine if the Propositions (\( P \)) and Reasons (\( R \)) are Defective
We now check each identified proposition and reason to see if they fall into any of the defective argument categories.

#### Analyzing the Mother’s Argument:
1. **Generalization (\( G \))**: There is no over-generalization in the Mother’s argument presented, as she does not make a broad, unqualified statement.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\( FE \))**: The Mother’s argument does not attempt to list all possibilities, so \( FE \) does not apply.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \))**: The reason provided (harmful to health) is generally considered a strong and conclusive reason to avoid smoking, so \( IR \) does not apply.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \))**: The health risks of smoking are well-documented, making the causal basis strong, so \( WCB \) does not apply.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( RR \))**: The reason is not a repetition of the proposition. The proposition is about stopping smoking, and the reason is about health risks, so \( RR \) does not apply.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\( FU \))**: The Mother does not claim that the health risks are universally agreed upon but states it as a fact, so \( FU \) does not apply.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\( DEP \))**: The statement "harmful to your health" is clear and unambiguous, so \( DEP \) does not apply.

#### Analyzing the Daughter’s Response:
The Daughter does not present a direct refutation of the health risks but rather challenges the Mother's authority based on her past behavior. To categorize the Daughter's argument:
   - The Daughter's response is more of an ad hominem argument rather than fitting any of our predefined defect categories directly.
   - It implies that the Mother's past actions undermine her current advice, which is a type of fallacy not explicitly defined in our list.

### Step 3: Classify the Argument Based on Defective Argument Types
After analyzing, we classify the components according to identified defects. For the Daughter’s argument:

- Her stance can be interpreted as an **Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \))** since she does not provide a valid reason for continuing to smoke but rather shifts the focus to the Mother’s past actions, which do not address the health dangers of smoking.

### Step 4: Final Classification of the Argument
Given the analysis, the Daughter's response is most closely related to \( IR \). It does not appropriately counter the reason presented by the Mother and instead distracts from the actual health issue, making the Mother’s argument not conclusive.

### Summary:
**Mother:** No defects identified.  
**Daughter:** **Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \))**

By decomposing the task and analyzing step-by-step, we conclude that the Daughter’s response falls under \( IR \), as it fails to provide a conclusive reason against the Mother’s health-related argument.
