For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given task, we need to decompose the process of identifying the logical fallacy into specific steps. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Understand the Argument:**
   - First, let's break down the argument presented:
     - Proposition \( \langle P \rangle \): "The Professor is wrong about The Bridges of Madison County being smarmy trash and lacking artistic worth."
     - Reason \( \langle R \rangle \): "It was on the best-seller list for over 100 weeks."

2. **Identify the Definable Elements \( \langle G \rangle, \langle FE \rangle, \langle IR \rangle, \langle RR \rangle, \langle WCB \rangle, \langle FU \rangle, \langle DEP \rangle \):**
   - Here, we need to assess whether the reason provided (being on the best-seller list for over 100 weeks) logically supports the proposition about artistic worth and whether the argument aligns with one of the types of defective arguments defined.

3. **Match the Given Argument with the Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization \( \langle G \rangle \)**: This doesn't seem to apply as there is no generalization from a part to the whole.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration \( \langle FE \rangle \)**: This doesn't apply as the argument doesn't enumerate possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason \( \langle IR \rangle \)**: This might apply because the reason (commercial success) doesn't conclusively prove artistic worth.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition \( \langle RR \rangle \)**: This doesn't apply as R is not simply a repetition of P.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis \( \langle WCB \rangle \)**: This might apply since the causal link between a book's time on a best-seller list and its artistic worth is weak or non-compelling.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus \( \langle FU \rangle \)**: This doesn't apply as there's no claim of universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use \( \langle DEP \rangle \)**: This doesnâ€™t apply as there is no ambiguous language.

4. **Evaluate the Argument Against Each Type:**
   - The reason \( \langle R \rangle \) given for the proposition \( \langle P \rangle \) is that the book was on the best-seller list for over 100 weeks.
   - Being on a best-seller list is more of an indicator of popularity and commercial success rather than an indicator of artistic worth.
   - The argument seems to fall under the defective argument types of both \( \langle IR \rangle \) Inconclusive Reason (since popularity does not conclusively demonstrate artistic worth) and \( \langle WCB \rangle \) Insufficient Causal Basis (because the connection between being a best-seller and artistic value is weak).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The argument commits a fallacy best described by \( \langle WCB \rangle \), Insufficient Causal Basis, since the reason provided for the proposition does not strongly support the conclusion that the book has artistic worth.
   - Additionally, \( \langle IR \rangle \), Inconclusive Reason, also applies as the reasoning does not conclusively prove the proposition.

Thus, the logical fallacies committed in the argument are primarily \( \langle WCB \rangle \) Insufficient Causal Basis, and also \( \langle IR \rangle \) Inconclusive Reason.
