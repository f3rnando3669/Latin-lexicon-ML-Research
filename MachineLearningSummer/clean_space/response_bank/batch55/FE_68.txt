For 
To apply <IDAA> (the process of decomposing the task of identifying defective arguments) to the statement "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t at church today," we will follow these detailed steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
Examine the statement to find what proposition it aims to establish:
- Proposition (<P>): "You are not a good person."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Determine the causal basis offered for <P>:
- Reason (<R>): "You weren’t at church today."

### Step 3: Identify any Proof of Reason (<PR>)
Check if there are any additional arguments corroborating the reason:
- Proof of Reason (<PR>): Not explicitly provided in the statement.

### Step 4: Determine if the Argument is Defective
Analyze whether the argument fits any of the defective argument types.

### Step 5: Categorize the Defective Argument
Compare the details of the argument with the definitions of defective argument types to classify it properly.

#### Analysis:
- **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument does not seem to be based on extrapolating characteristics from some individuals to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not claim to list all possibilities but omits consideration of other factors.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason given does not conclusively demonstrate that the person is not good simply because they were not at church.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The cause (not being at church) is not a compelling or sufficient basis to establish the proposition (not being a good person).
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The reason given is not merely a restatement of the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: There is no assumption of universal agreement in the reason presented.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The language is not ambiguous in a way that affects the logic of the argument.

### Conclusion:
The statement "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t at church today" falls into the category of **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**. The rationale provided (not being at church) is not a sufficient or compelling basis for claiming that someone is not a good person.

Thus, this is a type of **<WCB>**: "Insufficient Causal Basis."
