For 
Applying the process of <IDAA> (decomposing the task of classifying defective arguments into specific steps) to the given string:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of Task

1. **Identify the Proposition <P>**: 
    - Determine the main assertion or claim being made.
2. **Identify the Reason <R>**:
    - Find the causal basis or reasoning provided to support the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason <PR>**:
    - Look for any additional arguments or evidence corroborating the reason.
4. **Evaluate for Defective Argument Types**:
    - Check for each type of defective argument:
        - <G> Generalization
        - <FE> Incomplete Enumeration
        - <IR> Inconclusive Reason
        - <RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition
        - <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis
        - <FU> Presumptuous Consensus
        - <DEP> Ambiguous Language Use

### Application of Decomposition to Given String

#### 1. Identify the Proposition <P>:
Proposition: "How could anyone condemn such a wonderfully human process as unethical?"

#### 2. Identify the Reason <R>:
Reason: "There are so many experiences in the human realm that are wonderful. Sexual intimacy between two willing adults who love each other is wonderful. A therapist helping a client is wonderful. When the relationship between a therapist and client is so deep that it could be characterized as love, it's wonderful. When all these acts become part of one process between two people, it must be exceptionally wonderful."

#### 3. Identify the Proof of Reason <PR>:
Proof of Reason: The examples listed attempting to show the wonderfulness of these experiences.

#### 4. Evaluate for Defective Argument Types: 

- **Generalization <G>**:
  - The argument lists specific wonderful experiences and concludes that a combination of these must also be wonderful, potentially generalizing subjective experiences without objective basis. However, it does not directly assert this for all human experiences but focuses on the ones mentioned. Thus, not necessarily a clear case of overgeneralization.

- **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>**:
  - The argument lists some activities presumed to be wonderful without an exhaustive list. We may question if all pertinent examples have been included, but there's no explicit claim made that this is a complete enumeration of all possible human experiences.

- **Inconclusive Reason <IR>**:
  - The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the ethical nature of the combined process. The wonderful nature of individual components does not necessarily lead to the ethical conclusion when combined, making the reasoning inconclusive.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>**:
  - The reason does not merely repeat the proposition; it provides examples to support why the process is considered wonderful.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>**:
  - The causal basis (that individual wonderful experiences sum up to an exceptionally wonderful process) is weak since wonderfulness of parts does not guarantee the wonderfulness or ethical nature of the whole process.

- **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>**:
  - There is no indication of reliance on presumed universal agreement.

- **Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>**:
  - The term "wonderful" could be taken in a subjective and varying sense, but it does not seem to lead to a misunderstanding critical to the argument's core.

### Conclusion:
Upon evaluating the argument, the primary defects identified are:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason does not conclusively establish that what is described as wonderful (the combination of acts) is indeed ethical.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal link between individual wonderful experiences and the ethical nature of their combination is not compelling.

Final classification: The argument "There are so many experiences in the human realm that are wonderful..." can be identified as both <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
