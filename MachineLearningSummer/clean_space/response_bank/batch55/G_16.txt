To apply IDAA to the given string, we'll follow the steps outlined in the decomposition of the task IDA (Individual Defective Argument classification) in order to classify the argument type.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\<P\>)
First, we determine the main assertion (Proposition) set forth in the argument.

**Proposition (\<P\>):**
Jason argues that "you shouldn't believe everything you read about meta-analyses of methodologically sound studies showing proven causal relationships."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\<R\>)
Next, we determine the Reason provided to support the Proposition.

**Reason (\<R\>):**
Jason's reason is that "his grandfather smoked 30 cigarettes a day and lived until 97."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (\<PR\>)
Then, we determine whether there is any additional argument or evidence provided to support the Reason.

**Proof of Reason (\<PR\>):**
There appears to be no explicit further proof provided to support the Reason beyond the anecdotal statement about Jason's grandfather.

### Step 4: Analyze the Structure of the Argument
We analyze the structure to identify any defective elements based on the definitions provided.

- **Generalization (\<G\>):**
  Jason's argument uses a single anecdote about his grandfather to generalize against the conclusions of meta-analyses on smoking. Therefore, the issued statement generalizes based on one exceptional case.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>):**
  This doesn't seem to be an enumeration issue, as thereâ€™s no list provided or implied completeness.

- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>):**
  The reason provided (one anecdote) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition as it goes against empirical evidence.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>):**
  The causal basis (anecdotal evidence) provided for the Proposition is not compelling when compared to methodologically sound studies.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>):**
  The Reason restates the Proposition by implying you should not trust studies because of an outlier's anecdotal experience, so it essentially repeats the same idea with different words.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>):**
  There is no presumptuous consensus argument here; the argument does not appeal to what is universally agreed upon.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>):**
  The language is not ambiguous in the argument; it directly critiques the reliability of studies based on an anecdote.

### Step 5: Classify the Argument
Based on our analysis, the primary defective argument type(s) appear to be:

1. **Generalization (\<G\>)**: The argument generalizes from the anecdote about Jason's grandfather.
2. **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**: The reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**: The anecdotal evidence is weak compared to the empirical evidence it attempts to refute.

### Conclusion
The primary defective argument types in the given string "Jason said that that was all cool and everything, but his grandfather smoked, like, 30 cigarettes a day and lived until 97 - so don't believe everything you read about meta analyses of methodologically sound studies showing proven causal relationships." are:

- **Generalization (\<G\>)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**
