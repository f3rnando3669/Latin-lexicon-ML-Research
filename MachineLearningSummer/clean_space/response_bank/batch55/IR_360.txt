For 
To apply the IDAA (decomposition of IDA into specific steps for classification of a defective argument) to the statement "No one should believe our dear lady Senator who have had an adulterous relationship," we'll follow a systematic approach to identify its defectiveness step by step. The steps are as follows:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The proposition in the statement is "No one should believe our dear lady Senator."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason provided to support the proposition is "who have had an adulterous relationship."

3. **Check for each defective argument type (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>):**
   - **Generalization (G):** 
     - Assertion based on some or majority but not all. Does this apply?
     - The argument does not seem to generalize a trait or behavior to all members of a group.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** 
     - Claims to have made a complete list of possibilities but misses some. Does this apply?
     - The statement does not present an enumeration of possibilities.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** 
     - Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
     - The argument's reason, "having had an adulterous relationship," does not conclusively demonstrate why this person should not be believed in all matters. It attacks the character rather than logically connecting it to the proposition about credibility.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** 
     - Reason is weak as the basis is not compelling.
     - A personal moral failing, such as an adulterous relationship, is presented as sufficient reason for disbelief in all matters, which is not compelling enough. This can also overlap with IR.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** 
     - Reason is the same as the proposition.
     - This does not apply here as the reason provided does not merely repeat the proposition.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** 
     - Assumes a point as certain because it is "universally agreed upon."
     - There is no claim or assumption of universal agreement presented in the argument.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** 
     - Proof Reason can be taken in another sense than intended.
     - The language in "having had an adulterous relationship" is specific and does not show ambiguity as presented.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the analysis, the statement falls under **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** as the reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition. It likely could also be considered under **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** since the causal connection between having an adulterous relationship and being untrustworthy in all matters is weak and non-compelling.

Therefore, the classification of the string "No one should believe our dear lady Senator who have had an adulterous relationship" is primarily **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
