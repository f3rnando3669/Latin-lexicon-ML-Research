For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as a defective argument type) to "Lahat nakamove-on na ikaw na lang hindi pa. #MarcosIsAHero," we need to analyze and break down the string to identify the type of defective argument it represents. Let's go step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the String
The string "Lahat nakamove-on na ikaw na lang hindi pa. #MarcosIsAHero" translates from Filipino to English as "Everyone has moved on, only you haven't. #MarcosIsAHero."

### Step 2: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition here is implicitly suggesting that everybody else has moved on from discussing the hero status of Marcos, and therefore, the person being addressed should also move on. The hashtag "#MarcosIsAHero" suggests that the discussion revolves around the whether Marcos should be considered a hero.

### Step 3: Analyze the Argument
We need to determine what reasoning and proof (if any) are implied in the statement, and then assess whether it fits any of the defective argument classifications.

#### Possible Reasoning (<R>)
- The reasoning seems to be "since everyone has moved on, you should too."

#### Possible Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- The proof of reason might be implied as the supposed consensus that everyone else has moved on, suggesting the audience should conform.

### Step 4: Match with Defective Argument Types
Based on the definitions provided:

#### <G> Generalization
- This argument could be considered a generalization if "everyone has moved on" is an assertion based on some people moving on but is being applied to everybody.

#### <FE> Incomplete Enumeration
- This argument does not appear to be citing an enumeration of possibilities, so this type is not applicable.

#### <IR> Inconclusive Reason
- The reasoning provided ("everyone has moved on, so you should too") is not necessarily conclusive about why one should move on. This fits somewhat, but other types fit better.

#### <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis
- The causal basis ("everyone has moved on") is not necessarily compelling as it doesn't provide a reasoning directly related to why Marcos is or isn't a hero. Therefore, this type fits.

#### <RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition
- This isn’t simply repeating the proposition as the reason.

#### <FU> Presumptuous Consensus
- This argument implies that there is a universal consensus about moving on, which might not actually be the case. This suggests a presumptuous consensus.

#### <DEP> Ambiguous Language Use
- The language doesn’t appear ambiguous in a sense that can be taken in another way than intended.

### Step 5: Conclusion
Considering the breakdown and analysis, the string "Lahat nakamove-on na ikaw na lang hindi pa. #MarcosIsAHero" is best classified as:

1. **<G> Generalization**: The assertion that "everyone has moved on" is overly generalizing from an unspecified sample to the entire population.
2. **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: It assumes a universal agreement that everyone has moved on and hence the listener should too, despite this being a matter of dispute.
3. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: The cause provided ("everyone has moved on") doesn't compellingly support the implicit claim related to the hero status of Marcos. 

Given these three types, the most fitting classification could be **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**, as it heavily relies on the assumed consensus which could still be in dispute.

### Final Classification:
**<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**
