For 
To apply IDAA (the advanced task of decomposing the task IDA into specific steps) to the given argument "The Bible is true because God exists, and God exists because the Bible says so," we'll break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Argument Structure
First, we need to identify the different parts of the argument:
- Proposition \(<P>\): "The Bible is true"
- Reason \(<R>\) for the Proposition: "because God exists"
- Proof of Reason \(<PR>\): "and God exists because the Bible says so"

### Step 2: Identify Any Defective Argument Types
Now, we examine the argument components to classify any defective argument types based on the defined categories:

1. **Generalization \(<G>\)**:
   - This type involves asserting a general claim based on insufficient evidence from a subset.
   - This argument doesn't seem to fit into this category as there isn't a generalization based on a subset.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration \(<FE>\)**:
   - This involves claiming a complete enumeration of possibilities but missing some.
   - This doesn't apply here since the argument is not enumerating possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason \(<IR>\)**:
   - This occurs when the reason does not conclusively prove the proposition.
   - "God exists" doesn't conclusively demonstrate "The Bible is true."

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis \(<WCB>\)**:
   - This is when the reason given is weak or doesn't provide a compelling causal basis.
   - In this case, the link between "God exists" and "The Bible is true" could be seen as insufficient causal basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition \(<RR>\)**:
   - This occurs when the reason essentially repeats the proposition.
   - The circular reasoning ("The Bible is true because God exists, and God exists because the Bible says so") seems to fit this. It is repeating the claim in a circular manner.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus \(<FU>\)**:
   - This is assuming something is true because of a supposed universal agreement.
   - This doesn't fit this argument as it doesn't rest on universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use \(<DEP>\)**:
   - This involves the use of ambiguous language that can be interpreted in multiple ways.
   - There is no significant ambiguous language here.

### Step 3: Classify the Defective Argument
From the analysis, the argument primarily fits the category of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition \(<RR>\)**, which describes circular reasoning.

### Conclusion
Based on the decomposition of the task \( IDA \) for the given argument \( s \):
"The Bible is true because God exists, and God exists because the Bible says so" is classified as a defective argument type of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition \(<RR>\)**.
