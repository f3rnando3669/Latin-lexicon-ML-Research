For 
Sure, let's apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of identifying defective argument types) to the sentence "How many school shootings should we tolerate before we change the gun laws?" step by step.

**Step 1: Identify the Components of the Argument**
The given sentence is an argumentative question. To identify if it's defective, we will consider the typical elements of a defective argument:
   - Proposition (<P>)
   - Reason (<R>)
   - Proof of Reason (<PR>)

The sentence presents the proposition, implicitly suggesting that there have been school shootings and questioning the tolerance before a change in gun laws is enacted.

**Step 2: Analyze the Proposition**
The proposition (<P>) can be interpreted as: "We should not tolerate school shootings before changing gun laws."

**Step 3: Analyze the Reason**
The reason (<R>) can be implicitly inferred as: "School shootings are a compelling reason to change gun laws."

**Step 4: Determine if There Exists Proof of Reason**
The proof of reason (<PR>) might not be explicitly stated within the sentence but might be generally assumed by the audience, such as: "There have been multiple school shootings, showing that current gun laws are inadequate."

**Step 5: Evaluate for Defective Argument Types**
Now, we need to check if the argument falls into any of the predefined defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**
   - *Is this a generalization?* It does seem to generalize the tolerance of any number of school shootings to the necessity of changing gun laws.
   - *Evaluation:* The argument could be seen as a generalization if it's assuming that any number of school shootings necessarily implies that gun laws should change.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
   - *Is this an incomplete enumeration?* The argument focuses on school shootings without necessarily considering other factors related to gun laws.
   - *Evaluation:* No clear incomplete enumeration is presented here regarding options or causes.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
   - *Does the reason conclusively support the proposition?* The question structure implies emotional weight rather than a definitive logical correlation.
   - *Evaluation:* The reason (school shootings) does imply urgency, but it's not a conclusive demonstration that changing gun laws will solve the problem.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
   - *Is the causal basis weak?* Whether the number of school shootings alone is a compelling reason to change gun laws could be debatable.
   - *Evaluation:* There's a possibility of WCB if the argument doesn't thoroughly establish the causal link between changing gun laws and preventing school shootings.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
   - *Is the reason just repeating the proposition?* The sentence does not directly repeat in this fashion.
   - *Evaluation:* Not applicable here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
   - *Is there an assumption of universal agreement?* The argument might suggest an assumed consensus on the need to tolerate zero school shootings.
   - *Evaluation:* It could imply that the minimal tolerance level is universally agreed upon, even if in practice it’s debated.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**
   - *Can the argument be taken in another sense?* The term "tolerate" could be subjective, and the urgency may be variably interpreted.
   - *Evaluation:* There’s some ambiguity in terms like "tolerate" and the necessary level for "how many."

**Step 6: Conclusion**
Based on the evaluation:
- This argument most closely falls into the category of **Generalization (G)**, assuming any number of incidents universally implies the need for legislative change.
- It may also show traits of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** if the causal link isn't fully developed.
- There’s also an element of **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**, assuming a universal intolerance level that's contentious.

**Final Classification**
While the primary classification is Generalization (<G>), there are elements that might also be identified under Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>) and Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>).

By applying <IDAA> to the given sentence, the primary defect identified is Generalization (<G>).
