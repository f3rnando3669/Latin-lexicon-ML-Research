For 
To apply \(IDAA\) to the statement "We shouldn’t put her in jail even if she stole billions of pesos. She is already too old to be locked up," we need to decompose the task of classifying the statement (\(IDA\)) into specific steps (\(D\)).

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\(P\))

**Proposition**: "We shouldn’t put her in jail even if she stole billions of pesos."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\(R\))

**Reason**: "She is already too old to be locked up."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Completeness and Appropriateness of the Reason

Consider if the Reason (\(R\)) provided conclusively supports the Proposition (\(P\)):

- Does the Reason (\R) provide a causal basis for the Proposition (\P)?
- Is the Reason compelling and sufficient to justify the Proposition?

### Step 4: Check for Defective Argument Types

Classify the argument based on the definitions provided for defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (\(G\))**: Does the Proposition apply an assertion broadly based on limited cases?
   - Not applicable here.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\(FE\))**: Does the Proposition claim completeness but miss other possibilities?
   - Not applicable here.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (\(IR\))**: Does the Reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition?
   - Yes, the Reason that "she is already too old to be locked up" does not conclusively argue why she shouldn’t be jailed, especially considering the severity of stealing billions of pesos.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(WCB\))**: Does the Reason provide a weak causal basis for the Proposition?
   - Yes, the argument that age alone is a sufficient reason not to imprison someone is weak, especially given the severity of the crime.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(RR\))**: Is the Reason merely a repetition of the Proposition?
   - Not applicable here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\(FU\))**: Does the Proof of Reason assume something as universally agreed upon that is still in dispute?
   - Not applicable as there is no Proof of Reason presented.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\(DEP\))**: Can the Proof of Reason be taken in another sense than intended?
   - Not applicable as there is no complex language use here.

### Step 5: Classify the Argument Based on Identified Deficiencies

Given the evaluation:
- The argument is classified as both \(IR\) (Inconclusive Reason) and \(WCB\) (Insufficient Causal Basis).

### Conclusion

The argument "We shouldn’t put her in jail even if she stole billions of pesos. She is already too old to be locked up," is defective due to \(IR\) and \(WCB\). The Reason provided does not conclusively justify the Proposition and offers a weak causal basis for such a significant claim.
