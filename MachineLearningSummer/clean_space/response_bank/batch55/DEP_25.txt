For 
To apply the decomposition of advanced tasks (IDAA) to the classification of defective arguments (IDA), we will follow a systematic approach to identify which type of defective argument the given string represents. 

Given string:
"The police said they suspect several people of setting the fire. Therefore, I can't be under suspicion because I was alone all night."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (IDAA applying D to IDA):

1. **Analyze the Proposition (P) and Reason (R):**
   - **Proposition (P):**
     - "I can't be under suspicion because I was alone all night."
     - This is the statement the argument aims to prove.
   - **Reason (R):**
     - "The police said they suspect several people of setting the fire."
     - This is the causal basis provided to support the proposition.

2. **Classify the Argument Type by Looking for Defects:**
   - **Generalization (G):**
     - Check if the argument makes a broad assertion based on an insufficient sample.
     - Not applicable here.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
     - Check if the argument fails to account for all possibilities.
     - Not applicable here.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
     - Check if the reason does not conclusive support the proposition.
     - The reason about the police suspecting "several people" does not conclusively prove that the speaker cannot be under suspicion, because being alone does not preclude police suspicion.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
     - Check if the reason lacks a compelling basis for the proposition.
     - Related, but seems more about conclusiveness.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
     - Check if the reason simply repeats the proposition.
     - Not applicable here.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
     - Check if the proof is assumed correct based on alleged universal agreement.
     - Not applicable here.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
     - Check if the argument can be interpreted in a way not intended by the speaker.
     - Not applicable here.

3. **Determine the Most Applicable Defective Argument Type:**
   - The best match is **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the reason provided ("The police said they suspect several people of setting the fire.") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition ("I can't be under suspicion because I was alone all night.").

### Conclusion
By systematically decomposing the task of identifying the defective argument, we determine that the given argument, "The police said they suspect several people of setting the fire. Therefore, I can't be under suspicion because I was alone all night," is an example of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. The reason provided does not conclusively establish the truth of the proposition.
