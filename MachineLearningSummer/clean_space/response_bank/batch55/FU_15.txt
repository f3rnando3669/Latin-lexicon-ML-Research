To apply the decomposition of the task of classifying the string (IDA) into specific steps (D), we proceed as follows:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of IDA:

1. **Identify Proposition (\<P>)**: Determine the core assertion or claim being made.
2. **Identify Reason (\<R>)**: Determine the causal basis provided for the claim.
3. **Identify Proof of Reason (\<PR>)**: Look for additional arguments corroborating the Reason.
4. **Identify Defect Types**: Check for any presence of defective argument types in the dialogue.

Let's apply IDAA to the given dialogue:

### Step 1: Identify Proposition (\<P>)

- **Mark**: Do you believe in virgin births?
    - Proposition here is the question whether Sue believes in virgin births.
- **Sue**: You mean that babies are born virgins?
    - No explicit proposition here, just seeking clarification.
- **Mark**: I mean birth without fertilization.
    - Clarification of the initial proposition.
- **Sue**: No.
    - Sue's proposition is her belief: "I do not believe in virgin births."
- **Mark**: How could you not believe in virgin births? Roughly two billion people believe in them, donâ€™t you think you should reconsider your position?
    - New proposition: "Sue should reconsider her belief about virgin births because roughly two billion people believe in them."

### Step 2: Identify Reason (\<R>)

- **Reason** provided by Mark: "Roughly two billion people believe in them."
    - This is presented as the causal basis for Sue to reconsider her belief.

### Step 3: Identify Proof of Reason (\<PR>)

- No additional explicit arguments or evidence are presented by Mark to corroborate his Reason other than stating the number of believers.

### Step 4: Identify Defect Types (Classify Defects)

- **Evaluate the Reason (\<R>)** and the argument's support (\<PR>):
  
  - **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU>)**: 
    - Mark appeals to the belief of a large number of people ("roughly two billion people believe in them") to argue that Sue should reconsider her position. This is an example of using consensus (universally agreed upon) as if that itself makes the proposition true. This fits the definition of \<FU> as assuming the proof is certain because "it is generally agreed upon."

- **Generalization (\<G>)** could also be considered:
    - Mark generalizes that because a large number of people believe in virgin births, this belief should be reconsidered. However, the strength of this depends on the context that "appealing to majority" falls under generalization here.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE>)** and **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>)**:
    - There is no explicit enumeration to be incomplete here.
    - The reason provided by Mark (belief of two billion people) does not in itself conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition about virgin births.

### Final Classification:

For the dialogue provided, the most fitting defective argument category is:

- **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU>)**: Mark assumes that the large number of believers is sufficient reason for Sue to reconsider her belief, despite the belief still being in dispute.

Thus, applying IDAA to the given dialogue yields the classification of the argument as primarily an example of **\<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**.
