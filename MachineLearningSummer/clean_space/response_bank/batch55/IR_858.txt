For 
To apply <IDAA> (i.e., decompose the task of classifying the string as one of the seven defective argument types), we will follow a structured approach to examine and classify the given string "Senator Ribbit is a liar. You shouldn't listen to him on anything."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Analysis

1. **Identify and Summarize the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition: "Senator Ribbit is a liar."
   - Conclusion/Claim: "You shouldn't listen to him on anything."

2. **Identify the Reasoning (<R>) Provided:**
   - Reason: "Senator Ribbit is a liar."

3. **Evaluate if there is any Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - No additional proof or detailed argument is provided to prove "Senator Ribbit is a liar."

4. **Classify the Argument Based on the Given Types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>):**

   - **Generalization (<G>):** Does the argument make broad assertions based on limited data?
     - No, this argument is not making a generalization based on limited data.
   
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Does the argument falsely represent a complete list of possibilities without including all relevant cases?
     - No, thereâ€™s no enumeration or listing of possibilities.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Does the reason fail to conclusively prove the correctness of the proposition?
     - Yes, saying "Senator Ribbit is a liar" does not conclusively prove that you should not listen to him on anything. This conclusion requires more evidence or reasoning.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Is the causal basis for the proposition weak or not compelling?
     - Yes, the causal basis ("Senator Ribbit is a liar") for the conclusion ("You shouldn't listen to him on anything") is weak. Being labeled a liar doesn't necessarily mean one shouldn't be listened to on every topic.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Is the reason just a repetition of the proposition?
     - No, the reason is not a repetition of the proposition but rather a character attack.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Does the argument assume a consensus on something still in dispute?
     - No, the argument doesn't assume a universal agreement.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Is the argument based on ambiguous language that can be interpreted differently?
     - No, the language used is clear in this context.

### Conclusion
The argument primarily suffers from issues related to <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) as well as <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis). It fails to convincingly link the proposition that "Senator Ribbit is a liar" to the conclusion that "You shouldn't listen to him on anything."

Thus, the classification of the string "Senator Ribbit is a liar. You shouldn't listen to him on anything." is:
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**

This completes the application of <IDAA> to the given string.
