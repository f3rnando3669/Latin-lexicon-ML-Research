For 
To apply IDAA (the task of decomposing the process of identifying defective arguments) to the provided string, we will follow a clear, step-by-step approach. 

Here's the step-by-step decomposition (D) of the task IDA (identifying defective arguments):

1. **Comprehend the Argument**:
   - Parse the given string.
   - Identify the components of the argument - Proposition (P), Reason (R), and Proof of Reason (PR).
   
2. **Categorize Each Component**:
   - Match the identified components against potential defective argument types.
   - Use definitions of defective argument types to classify each component properly.
   
3. **Determine Defective Type**:
   - Decide which defective argument type applies based on the classification.

Now, let’s apply these steps to "We admit that this measure is popular, but we also urge you to recognize that there are so many other bond issues on this ballot it is getting ridiculous."

### Step 1: Comprehend the Argument

- **Proposition (P)**: This measure is popular.
- **Reason (R)**: There are many other bond issues on this ballot; it is getting ridiculous.

### Step 2: Categorize Each Component

- **Proposition (P)**: "This measure is popular."
  - The implication is that popularity might be considered a justification or reason, but it’s not stated directly as what needs proving.
  
- **Reason (R)**: "There are so many other bond issues on this ballot it is getting ridiculous."
  - This seems to be trying to divert attention from the main proposition.
  - It contrasts with the proposition by suggesting an alternative reason which does not logically connect or provide a causal basis.

### Step 3: Determine Defective Type

- The mentioned reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
  - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason does not demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. The fact that there are many bond issues does not logically argue for or against the measure’s popularity or validity.
- There is also an element of deflecting or distracting from the main issue at hand without directly countering or addressing the proposition effectively.

In summary:

Applying IDAA to "We admit that this measure is popular, but we also urge you to recognize that there are so many other bond issues on this ballot it is getting ridiculous." classifies this argument as type **IR**, Inconclusive Reason, because the presented reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the associated proposition.
