For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "The news is fake because so much of the news is fake," we need to follow the steps of decomposing the task of classifying the given string into each of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>). 

Here are the steps broken down:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - "The news is fake" -- This is the statement that is intended to be proven.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - "because so much of the news is fake" -- This clause provides the reasoning or justification for the proposition.

3. **Check for each type of defective argument:**

   - **<G> (Generalization):**
     - This occurs when an assertion is made based on some part or majority, but not necessarily applicable to all.
     - The Reason ("so much of the news is fake") does not clearly limit itself universally to the whole of the news being fake, so it could seem like a hasty generalization, but it's not the most obvious flaw here.

   - **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):**
     - This occurs when all possibilities are not considered.
     - The Reason does not enumerate possibilities; it asserts a condition. Hence, <FE> does not apply here.

   - **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):**
     - This occurs when the Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.
     - The Reason provided could be seen as insufficient to conclusively demonstrate that the news is fake overall, but we should further consider other defects.

   - **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):**
     - This occurs when the Reason is merely a restatement of the Proposition.
     - "The news is fake because so much of the news is fake" is essentially repeating the same idea without adding new information. This is a strong candidate.

   - **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):**
     - This is when the Reason fails to provide a compelling causal basis for the Proposition.
     - The Reason in this example logically ties to the Proposition but doesn't provide new supporting evidence beyond restating the initial claim.

   - **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):**
     - This occurs when the Proof of Reason is assumed to be certain due to universal agreement.
     - In this statement, there is no mention of any consensus or universal agreement, so this does not apply.

   - **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):**
     - This occurs when the Proof of Reason can be taken in another sense than intended.
     - There doesn't seem to be any ambiguity in language use here. The meaning of the terms is quite direct.

4. **Conclude the classification:**
   - Based on the analysis, the defective argument most applicable to "The news is fake because so much of the news is fake" is <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), as the Reason merely repeats the Proposition without providing additional justification or evidence.

Therefore, applying <IDAA> to the given string, we classify it as <RR>.
