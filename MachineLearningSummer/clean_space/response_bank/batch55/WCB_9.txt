Applying <IDAA> to classify the argument "Texting has killed people’s ability to write in complete sentences with proper grammar." involves decomposing the task into specific steps and then executing those steps to determine the type of defective argument it may represent.

### Decomposition of Task (Applying <D> to <IDA>):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
    - Extract the main assertion or proposition from the argument.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
    - Determine the causal basis provided to support the proposition (*Note: In the provided statement, <R> might be implicit, but we need to infer it if not directly stated*).

3. **Classify the Type of Defective Argument:**
    - Compare the argument against definitions of each defective argument type (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).
    - Choose the defective argument type that best describes the logical flaw.

### Apply Decomposition to Argument:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
    - The proposition here is: "Texting has killed people’s ability to write in complete sentences with proper grammar."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
    - The reason appears to be implied rather than stated explicitly. We might infer it’s something like: "People frequently use texting language."

3. **Classify the Type of Defective Argument:**
    - Evaluate the argument against each defective argument type:

   - **Generalization (<G>):**
        - Is the argument asserting something based on a part or majority, not necessarily applicable to all? 
        - Yes. The statement claims texting has broadly affected everyone’s ability to write properly, generalized from specific observations.
        - **Potential Classification: <G>**

    - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
        - Is the proposition failing to consider all possible influences on writing skills?
        - Yes. Other factors might contribute to poor writing skills, not solely texting.
        - **Potential Classification: <FE>**

    - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
        - Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
        - Yes. Frequent use of texting does not conclusively establish that people’s ability to write complete sentences with proper grammar has been "killed."
        - **Potential Classification: <IR>**

    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
        - Is the causal basis weak or not compelling enough?
        - Yes, assuming "frequent use of texting language" as the reason is not a compelling cause.
        - **Potential Classification: <WCB>**

    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
        - Does the reason simply repeat the proposition?
        - No. The statement does not repeat its assertion in the form of reason.
        - **Not Applicable**

    - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
        - Is the reason assumed certain based on a universal agreement?
        - No universal agreement is referenced.
        - **Not Applicable**

    - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
        - Can the argument be taken in another sense than the intended one?
        - The statement about texting "killing" writing skills is hyperbolic but not necessarily ambiguous in a different sense.
        - **Not Applicable**

### Final Classification: 
Based on the analysis and comparison, the argument "Texting has killed people’s ability to write in complete sentences with proper grammar" is best classified as a combination of:
- <G> (Generalization)
- <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)
- <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)
- <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)

An argument can simultaneously exhibit multiple kinds of defects, but it’s most strongly identified as a generalization (<G>), given it broadly applies a specific trend to the entire population.
