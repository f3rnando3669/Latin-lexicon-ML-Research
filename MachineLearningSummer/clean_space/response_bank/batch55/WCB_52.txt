To apply the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument (<IDAA>) to the given argument, let's proceed step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the given argument structure

We have the argument:
1. P1: A sedentary lifestyle contributes to obesity.
2. P2: People have become more sedentary in the last few decades.
3. C: Therefore, the rise in obesity can be fixed by people getting more exercise.

### Step 2: Identify the components of the argument

- **Proposition (<P>):** This can be interpreted as the conclusion since it is what the argument is trying to prove.
  - <P>: The rise in obesity can be fixed by people getting more exercise.

- **Reason (<R>):**
  - <R>: A sedentary lifestyle contributes to obesity.
  - <R>: People have become more sedentary in the last few decades.

- **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** These are additional premises used to support the reasons:
  - In this argument, <P1> can be seen as a <PR> to <P2>, providing additional support to the causal link between sedentary behavior and obesity.

### Step 3: Assess the validity of the Reason (<R>)

Evaluate against defective argument types:

- *Generalization (<G>):* This type would overgeneralize from specific instances. No sign of overgeneralization evident in <P>, <R>, or <PR>.

- *Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):* This would involve claiming completeness while missing possibilities. There’s no explicit enumeration of all causes of obesity; however, it doesn’t claim to be a complete list.

- *Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):* This would mean the reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
  - <IR> could be relevant here; stating that a sedentary lifestyle contributes to obesity does not conclusively demonstrate that simply getting more exercise will fix the rise in obesity—a multifaceted issue could have other causes.

- *Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):* Weak causal link or insufficiency in causation demonstrated.
  - The argument somewhat simplifies a complex issue. Contributing to obesity is not strictly equivalent to solving it by reversing contributions. This might hint at <WCB>.

- *Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):* The reason repeats the proposition.
  - Doesn’t occur here; reasons provide distinct premises.

- *Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):* Assuming something as universally agreed.
  - No indication that the argument relies on a presumed consensus.

- *Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):* The argument’s terms seem precise without evident ambiguity.

### Step 4: Classification of the argument

Among detected defects:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
  - The rise in obesity being solvable merely by more exercise is not conclusively derived from the premises that sedentary lifestyle contributes to obesity.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
  - The causal connection between solving obesity and increasing exercise oversimplifies the issue lacking compelling thoroughness in the solution suggested.

### Conclusion: Classifying the argument

After dissecting the premises and the conclusion:
- The best classification among the types of defective arguments provided would be a combination of:
  - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and 
  - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.

The argument fails to conclusively demonstrate that increased exercise alone will resolve the rise in obesity and oversimplifies the complexity of the issue, applying weak causal logic.

Thus, the complete process of <IDAA> identifies that the primary issues in the argument at hand can be classified as both **<IR> and <WCB>**.
