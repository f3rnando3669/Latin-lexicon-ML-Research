For 
Sure! Let's apply IDAA to the given string, "Everytime I wash my car it rains, therefore, washing my car makes it rain."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition
1. **Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P).**
   - The proposition is the statement or claim that we intend to prove.
   - In this case, the proposition is: **"washing my car makes it rain."**

2. **Step 2: Identify the Reason (R).**
   - The Reason sets forth the causal basis for the proposition.
   - Here, the reason provided is: **"Everytime I wash my car it rains."**

3. **Step 3: Evaluate the Reason (R).**
   - We need to check whether the reason is sufficient and conclusive for establishing the proposition.
   - In this example, we must determine if the statement "Everytime I wash my car it rains" conclusively demonstrates that washing the car causes it to rain.

4. **Step 4: Check for Defective Argument Types.**
   - **Generalization (G):** This involves extending an observation from a part to the whole.
     - The proposition might be derived from a limited set of observations.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This involves missing out on pertinent possibilities.
     - The given reason considers limited occurrences without ruling out other possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This involves the reason not conclusively proving the proposition.
     - The reason "Everytime I wash my car it rains" might be suggestive but does not definitively prove causation.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This involves the causal basis being weak or uncompelling.
     - Here, the reason does not provide a scientific or logical causal mechanism.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason is just a repeat of the proposition.
     - In this case, the reason and proposition are similar but not identical.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Assuming something is universally agreed upon.
     - There is no assumption of universal agreement in this argument.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Misinterpretation due to ambiguous language.
     - The language here is straightforward with no ambiguity.

### Step-by-Step Application
- The reason "Everytime I wash my car it rains" is not a robust demonstration of causality.
- No scientific or logical causal mechanism is provided.
- The argument could be an overgeneralization of specific observations.

Given the above steps, the argument represents multiple defective types including Generalization (G), Inconclusive Reason (IR), and Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB). However, for the most direct classification:

- **Primary Defective Argument Type:**
  - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The reason provided is not compelling enough to establish the proposition that washing the car causes it to rain. 

Thus, the string "Everytime I wash my car it rains, therefore, washing my car makes it rain." is classified as **(WCB)**.
