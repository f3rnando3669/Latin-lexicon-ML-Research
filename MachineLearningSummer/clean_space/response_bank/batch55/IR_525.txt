To apply the IDAA method to the task of classifying the argument "A mother tells her children not to leave the yard because there might be wild animals in the woods," we will decompose the task into specific steps. Here are the steps to follow:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\<P\>)
The proposition is the main assertion or claim being made.

- **Proposition (\<P\>):** The mother tells her children not to leave the yard.

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\<R\>)
The reason sets forth the causal basis for the proposition.

- **Reason (\<R\>):** Because there might be wild animals in the woods.

#### Step 3: Analyze the Completeness of the Argument
Determine if the argument is missing any crucial components (Proposition, Reason, Proof of Reason).

- The argument includes a Proposition (\<P\>) and a Reason (\<R\>).
- There is no Proof of Reason (\<PR\>) provided.

#### Step 4: Classify Any Defective Arguments
Check the argument against the types of defective arguments (\<G\>, \<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<WCB\>, \<RR\>, \<FU\>, and \<DEP\>).

- **Generalization (\<G\>):** Is the Proposition based on an assumption applicable to a broader scope than justified?  
  - Not applicable here. The Proposition is about a specific scenario involving her children.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>):** Does the argument claim to have listed all possibilities but miss some pertinent ones?
  - This might apply slightly. The Reason (\<R\>) suggests a single potential threat (wild animals), but actual threats could be more diverse.

- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>):** Does the Reason not conclusively demonstrate the Proposition?
  - This applies here. The Reason (\<R\>) ("there might be wild animals") is speculative and does not conclusively demonstrate that the children must not leave the yard.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>):** Is the Reason a weak causal basis for the Proposition?
  - This also applies. "Might be wild animals" is a weak causal basis since it is based on possibility rather than certainty.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>):** Does the Reason simply restate the Proposition?
  - Not applicable. The Reason introduces new information regarding potential danger.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>):** Is the Proof of Reason assumed universally agreed upon?
  - Not applicable. No \<PR\> is given or assumed as universally agreed upon.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>):** Can the Proof of Reason be taken in another sense than intended?
  - Not applicable. No \<PR\> is present and the Reason is clear in its meaning.

#### Step 5: Summarize the Findings and Classify the Argument
Based on the analysis, classify the argument into the most relevant defective argument types.

- **Primary Classification:** 
  - **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>):** The Reason (\<R\>) does not conclusively show that the children must not leave the yard because it is speculative.
  - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>):** The Reason (\<R\>) is weak as it is based on a possibility rather than a strong causal basis.

### Conclusion
The argument "A mother tells her children not to leave the yard because there might be wild animals in the woods" primarily fits the classifications of **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**.
