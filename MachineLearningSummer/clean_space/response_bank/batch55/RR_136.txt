For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the statement "How do I know that Beth is the most intelligent person in our geometry class? I know because she's so smart," we need to decompose the task of classification into specific steps and then apply these steps to the given string.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine what is being asserted or claimed in the argument.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Find the causal basis offered for the proposition.

3. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:**
   - Examine the given proposition and reason for any of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

### Applying the Steps

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
- The proposition in the statement is: "Beth is the most intelligent person in our geometry class."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>):**
- The reason given is: "she's so smart."

**Step 3: Classify the Defective Argument Type:**

Let's analyze the argument according to the defective types:

- **Generalization (<G>):** The argument does not appear to be a generalization based on a majority or part but referring to a specific individual.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This does not fit, as there is no claim of having done a complete enumeration of possibilities.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason "she's so smart" is vague and does not conclusively demonstrate that Beth is the most intelligent compared to others. It lacks a comparative measure.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The reason is weak as it does not provide a compelling causal basis for why Beth is the most intelligent.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason "she's so smart" is essentially a repetition of the proposition and does not add any new factual basis or logical support.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** There is no appeal to a general consensus in the argument.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** There is no significant ambiguity in the language that could lead to a different interpretation.

The defective argument type that best fits the statement is:

**Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**
- The reason given ("she's so smart") simply reiterates the proposition without providing additional support or evidence.

### Conclusion

The classification of the given string "How do I know that Beth is the most intelligent person in our geometry class? I know because she's so smart." is:

**<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**
