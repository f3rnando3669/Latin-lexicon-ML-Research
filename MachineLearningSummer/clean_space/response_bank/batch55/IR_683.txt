For 
To apply the process of <IDAA> to the string "Andrea Dworkin has written several books arguing that pornography harms women. But Dworkin is just ugly and bitter, so why should we listen to her?”, we follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand and Analyze the Argument 
First, we need to break down the argument presented in the string.

1. **Proposition (<P>)**: Andrea Dworkin has written several books arguing that pornography harms women.
2. **Reason (<R>)**: But Dworkin is just ugly and bitter.
3. **Conclusion**: Therefore, we should not listen to her arguments (implied).

### Step 2: Identify the Type of Defective Argument
Next, classify the identified proposition, reason, and conclusion according to the defined defective argument types.

Given the string, the reasoning part "But Dworkin is just ugly and bitter" does not address the actual argument about whether pornography harms women. Instead, it attacks Dworkin's character.

### Step 3: Classify According to Defective Argument Types
Let us categorize this argument:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument is not making a generalization about a group; therefore, it is not <G>.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument is not based on incomplete possibilities; therefore, it is not <FE>.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided (<R>) does not bring conclusive evidence regarding the proposition (<P>). It is based on attacking Dworkin’s character rather than presenting conclusive evidence regarding her argument.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reason does not have a causal basis that addresses the proposition. Instead, it attacks Dworkin’s character, which is irrelevant.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The reason doesn’t repeat the proposition; therefore, it is not <RR>.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument does not claim something controversial as universally agreed; therefore, it is not <FU>.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The argument does not involve ambiguity; therefore, it is not <DEP>.

### Step 4: Conclusion of IDAA
After analyzing the string, the defective argument type involved here is <IR> — Inconclusive Reason. The reason provided attacks Dworkin’s character rather than offering a conclusive reason to support or reject the proposition that pornography harms women.

Thus, the string "Andrea Dworkin has written several books arguing that pornography harms women. But Dworkin is just ugly and bitter, so why should we listen to her?” can be classified as **<IR>**.
