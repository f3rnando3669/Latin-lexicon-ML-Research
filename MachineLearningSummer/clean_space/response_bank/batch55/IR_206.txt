For 
To apply the process of breaking down the task of identifying the type of defective argument in the given string step by step (IDAA), we will follow the principles of decomposition (D). Here, we will decompose the task of identifying the defective argument (IDA) into specific steps and then apply it to the string in question.

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**

First, we need to pinpoint the Proposition within the given string. The proposition is what the speaker is attempting to assert or prove.

String: "Dr. Fauci says we need to wear masks, but Dr. Fauci is the oldest, meanest doctor around. I’m sure what he says isn’t true at all."

Proposition (P): "We do not need to wear masks."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)**

Next, we must identify the Reason, which is the basis provided to support or establish the truth of the Proposition.

Reason (R): "Dr. Fauci is the oldest, meanest doctor around."

**Step 3: Identify the type of Defective Argument (if any)**

With both the Proposition and the Reason identified, we need to determine whether the argument contains any logical fallacies or defective components as defined (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

Analyzing the Reason:
- The Reason provided attacks Dr. Fauci's character rather than addressing the actual claim about wearing masks. This is an example of an ad hominem fallacy, which isn't explicitly listed but fits closely with certain forms of inconclusive reasoning because it diverts from addressing the actual issue or evidence which would corroborate the Proposition in a sound manner.

Considering the definitions provided:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The Reason (R) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition (P).

Here, the attack on Dr. Fauci's character does nothing to speak to the validity or invalidity of wearing masks. It’s an attempt to discredit the proposition by discrediting the person who stated it without addressing the argument itself.

**Conclusion:**

The argument is an example of an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the reason given does not directly bear on the truth of the proposition that we do not need to wear masks. It fails to provide a substantial causal basis to invalidate the need for masks.

Hence, the IDA for the provided string is classified as **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
