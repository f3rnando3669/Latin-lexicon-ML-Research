For 
To apply IDAA (the application of the decomposition of the task into specific steps to the identification and classification of a defective argument), we need to break down the task of classifying the given statement into specific steps. Here, our task (t) is the identification of defective arguments (IDA).

Let's decompose the task of IDAA step by step:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDA:
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - What is the main claim or assertion that is being made?
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - What is the reasoning or causal basis provided to support the proposition?

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Is there additional corroborative information or argument provided to support the reason?

4. **Classify the Argument:**
   - Compare the identified components against the types of defective arguments (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) and classify accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Application on the Given Statement:
**Statement: "Executions are moral because we must have a death penalty to discourage violent crime."**

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The proposition is: "Executions are moral."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason given is: "because we must have a death penalty to discourage violent crime."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - There is no additional corroborative information provided to support the reason; the reason is simply asserted.

4. **Classify the Argument:**
   - We need to determine if there is a defect in the argument by comparing it to the types of defective arguments:

   **(G) Generalization:**
   - The argument isn't making a broad generalization about a part representing the whole.
   
   **(FE) Incomplete Enumeration:**
   - The argument doesn't seem to be about an incomplete list of possibilities.
   
   **(IR) Inconclusive Reason:**
   - The reason "we must have a death penalty to discourage violent crime" does not conclusively establish that "executions are moral." There could be many other considerations required for declaring something moral beyond deterrence, making the reasoning inconclusive.

   **(RR) Faulty Repetition of Proposition:**
   - The reason does not appear to be a repetition of the proposition.
   
   **(WCB) Insufficient Causal Basis:**
   - The causal basis provided for the proposition ("we must have a death penalty to discourage violent crime") might not be compelling enough to establish the morality of executions. However, this is a matter of interpretation and could be subjective.

   **(FU) Presumptuous Consensus:**
   - The argument doesn't rely on an assumed universal agreement that isnâ€™t established.
   
   **(DEP) Ambiguous Language Use:**
   - There doesn't appear to be ambiguous language that could be taken in a different sense than intended.

Given the analysis above, the most fitting classification would be:

- **(IR) Inconclusive Reason:** The reason presented does not conclusively establish the correctness of the proposition.

Thus, the argument "Executions are moral because we must have a death penalty to discourage violent crime" seems to be a case of an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
