For 
Sure, let's apply <IDAA>, which involves decomposing the task of classifying the given string <s> into specific steps, to the string "No one has ever been able to prove that extraterrestrials exist, so they must not be real."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The proposition is the statement we intend to prove. Here, the proposition is: "extraterrestrials must not be real."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason is the causal basis set forth to establish the truth of the proposition. Here, the reason is: "No one has ever been able to prove that extraterrestrials exist."

3. **Classify any Defective Arguments:**
   - Now we need to examine if the <R> provided is sufficient and appropriate to establish the <P>, or if it fits any of the defective argument types.

### Classification Process:

- **Generalization (<G>):**
  - This doesn't fit the definition of generalization since the <P> and <R> here aren't based on an assertion about a part or majority but are categorical in nature (exist vs. not exist).

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
  - This doesn’t fit the criteria for incomplete enumeration because it’s not about missing some possibilities in enumeration; it's an assertion about the lack of evidence.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
  - Considering <IR>, where <R> does not conclusively demonstrate the <P>. The reason provided ("No one has ever been able to prove that extraterrestrials exist") does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition ("extraterrestrials must not be real"). Lack of proof is not proof of absence.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
  - Here <R> doesn’t provide a compelling causal basis for <P>. Lack of evidence is not a strong causal basis to conclude non-existence.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
  - The reason here is not simply a restatement of the proposition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
  - This is not based on assuming something is certain because it's "universally agreed upon," thus <R> doesn’t fit <FU>.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
  - There is no ambiguous language in the <R> and <P>, so it doesn’t fit the criteria of ambiguous language use.

### Conclusion:
Based on the breakdown, we observe that the reason given ("No one has ever been able to prove that extraterrestrials exist") is not sufficient to conclusively demonstrate the proposition ("extraterrestrials must not be real"). Therefore, the defective argument type that fits best is **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**.

So, applying <IDAA> to "No one has ever been able to prove that extraterrestrials exist, so they must not be real":
- <s> is classified as **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**.
