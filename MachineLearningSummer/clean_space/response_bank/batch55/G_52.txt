For 
To apply the decomposition of the task (IDAA) to classify the given string as of type G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, or DEP, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)

The Proposition (P) in the argument sets forth what is to be proved. In this case, the main Proposition can be summarized as:
- P: "We should make animal experimentation illegal right now."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)

The Reason (R) provides the causal basis for P, establishing why P should be accepted. The Reason provided in the argument is:
- R: "Animal experimentation reduces our respect for life."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)

The Proof of Reason (PR) corroborates R with additional arguments. Here are the additional arguments provided to support R:
- PR1: "If we donâ€™t respect life, we are likely to be more and more tolerant of violent acts like war and murder."
- PR2: "Soon our society will become a battlefield in which everyone constantly fears for their lives."
- PR3: "It will be the end of civilization."

### Step 4: Evaluate if the argument contains any defective argument types

Let's check each part of the argument to see if it matches any of the defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - G involves asserting that something applies universally when it does not necessarily apply to all.
   - The argument does not make a universal generalization without evidence; it is conditional and foresees potential outcomes.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - FE is when the argument claims to have considered all possibilities but misses some pertinent ones.
   - This argument does not claim to have enumerated all possibilities; it follows a specific causal chain.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - IR occurs when the Reason (R) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition (P).
   - The link between animal experimentation reducing respect for life and the end of civilization may be seen as speculative and not conclusively supported.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - WCB occurs when the Reason (R) is weak due to a non-compelling causal basis.
   - Saying that reduced respect for life due to animal experimentation will lead to societal collapse could be considered a weak causal basis since it involves many speculative links.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - RR is when the Reason (R) is just a restatement of Proposition (P).
   - The Reason (R) in this argument is different from the Proposition (P); it does not restate it.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - FU is when the Proof of Reason (PR) is assumed to be certain based on universally agreed upon beliefs that are actually in dispute.
   - The argument does not appeal to a presumed universal consensus to support its claims.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - DEP is when ambiguous language in Proof of Reason (PR) allows for different interpretations.
   - The language used in the argument is clear and not ambiguous.

### Conclusion

Based on the evaluation:

- The argument strongly leans towards **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the Reason (R) does not conclusively establish the correctness of the Proposition (P). The speculative nature of the chain of events (that reduced respect for life due to animal experimentation will definitely lead to the end of civilization) is a key point.
- It also leans towards **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because the causal relationship provided in the Reason (R) is weak and not compelling enough to support the Proposition (P).

Hence, we can classify the given string primarily as **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** and secondarily as **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
