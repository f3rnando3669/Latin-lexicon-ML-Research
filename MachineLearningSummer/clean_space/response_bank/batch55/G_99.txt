For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to "That type of car is poorly made; a friend of mine has one, and it continually gives him trouble," we will decompose the task of classifying the string into specific steps and go through each one methodically:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\( P \))
First, we need to identify the proposition that is being made in the argument.

**Proposition (\( P \)):** "That type of car is poorly made."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\( R \))
Next, we identify the reason given to support the proposition.

**Reason (\( R \)):** "a friend of mine has one, and it continually gives him trouble."

### Step 3: Check for Defective Argument Types
We will now examine which, if any, defective argument types (\( G \), \( FE \), \( IR \), \( RR \), \( WCB \), \( FU \), or \( DEP \)) apply to the argument.

#### 3.1 Generalization (\( G \))
- **Definition:** The proposition is an assertion based on some one part or on a majority of individuals, but not necessarily applicable to all, is referred to all.
- **Application:** The proposition "That type of car is poorly made" is based on a single instance ("a friend of mine has one, and it continually gives him trouble"). This is a classic example of generalizing from a single case.

#### 3.2 Incomplete Enumeration (\( FE \))
- **Definition:** The proposition claims to have made a complete enumeration of the possibilities, but misses out on some pertinent ones.
- **Application:** This argument does not attempt to enumerate all cars of the type, so \( FE \) is not applicable.

#### 3.3 Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \))
- **Definition:** The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **Application:** The given reason ("a friend of mine has one, and it continually gives him trouble") does not conclusively demonstrate that the type of car is poorly made. This fits, but it's secondary to the generalization.

#### 3.4 Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( RR \))
- **Definition:** The reason is weak when it appears to be presented as the reason but says precisely the same as was said in the proposition.
- **Application:** The reason provided does not merely repeat the proposition, so \( RR \) is not applicable.

#### 3.5 Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \))
- **Definition:** The reason is weak if the causal basis which it submits for the proposition is not a compelling one.
- **Application:** The causal basis (one friendâ€™s car trouble) is weak. This supports \( WCB \) but is secondary to generalization.

#### 3.6 Presumptuous Consensus (\( FU \))
- **Definition:** The proof of reason is assumed as certain, on the ground that "it is universally agreed upon," a thing which is still in dispute.
- **Application:** This argument does not assume a universal consensus, so \( FU \) is not applicable.

#### 3.7 Ambiguous Language Use (\( DEP \))
- **Definition:** The proof of reason can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended.
- **Application:** The language used does not seem to be ambiguous, so \( DEP \) is not applicable.

### Step 4: Conclude the Classification
After examining the defective argument types, we conclude that the predominant defective argument type here is:

**Classification:** \( G \) (Generalization)

**Reason:** The proposition that "That type of car is poorly made" is based on the experience of a single individual, which is a generalization from an insufficient sample.
