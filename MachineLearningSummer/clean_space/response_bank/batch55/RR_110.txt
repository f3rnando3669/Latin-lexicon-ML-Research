For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying defective arguments) to the given sentence "Mr. Casal got sick last week, so it was likely due to the students," let's break down the process step-by-step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P> and Reason <R>
- **Proposition (P):**
  - "It was likely due to the students."
- **Reason (R):**
  - "Mr. Casal got sick last week."

### Step 2: Evaluate the Proposition <P> and Reason <R>
- **P (Proposition)** is claiming a likely cause for Mr. Casal’s sickness.
- **R (Reason)** is providing a basis for this claim, namely, the fact that Mr. Casal got sick.

### Step 3: Analyze the Reason <R>'s Sufficiency and Causal Link
Evaluate if the reason (Mr. Casal got sick last week) sufficiently supports the proposition (it was likely due to the students):
- Is the reason conclusive?
- Does the reason provide a strong causal basis?

### Step 4: Consider Possible Defective Argument Types
Let's look at the defective argument types and see which one fits:

- **Generalization (G):** Is the argument making a general claim based on limited evidence?
  - <Not applicable>: The argument does not make a claim about all students based on Mr. Casal’s sickness.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Does the argument fail to consider other possibilities?
  - <Applicable>: The argument does not consider other possible causes for Mr. Casal's sickness, such as other exposures or personal health issues.
  
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does the reason not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
  - <Applicable>: The reason "Mr. Casal got sick last week" is inconclusive and does not definitively demonstrate that the students were the cause.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the causal basis weak or not compelling?
  - <Applicable>: The reason provided does not establish a compelling causal link between the sickness and the students.
  
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Does the reason merely repeat the proposition in different words?
  - <Not applicable>: The reason offered is not simply a repetition of the proposition.
  
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Is the proof assumed based on presumed universal agreement?
  - <Not applicable>: There is no mention of universal agreement in the argument.
  
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Can the reason be interpreted in a different sense than intended?
  - <Not applicable>: The language used does not appear to be ambiguous.

### Step 5: Classify the Argument
Given the analysis, the argument can be classified under multiple defect types, but the most fitting ones are:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument fails to consider other potential causes for Mr. Casal's illness.
2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The proposed causal link is weak and unconvincing.

### Conclusion
Based on the steps above, the sentence "Mr. Casal got sick last week, so it was likely due to the students" can be classified as containing the following defective argument types: **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
