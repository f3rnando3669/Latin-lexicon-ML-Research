For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "You moved the goalposts or made up an exception when your claim was shown to be false," we need to break down the task of classifying this string into specific steps. Hereâ€™s how we can proceed step by step:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of <IDA>:
1. **Understand the Argument and Identify Components**: Comprehend the given argument and identify if it contains a Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), and Proof of Reason (<PR>).
2. **Evaluate for Defective Argument Types**:
   - Check for Generalization (<G>)
   - Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
   - Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
   - Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
   - Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
   - Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
   - Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)

### Step-by-Step Application of <IDAA>:

#### Step 1: Understand the Argument and Identify Components
The given string is "You moved the goalposts or made up an exception when your claim was shown to be false."

1. **Proposition (<P>)**: The speaker claims that the opponent moved the goalposts or made up an exception.
2. **Reason (<R>)**: The opponent's claim was shown to be false.
3. **Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: The string suggests a reason but doesn't provide additional arguments to back up the claim definitively.

#### Step 2: Evaluate for Defective Argument Types

1. **Check for Generalization (<G>)**:
   - Does it assert something based on an individual or majority, but inaccurately apply it to everyone? 
   - No, this doesn't seem to be a Generalization.

2. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - Does it claim a complete enumeration but miss pertinent possibilities?
   - No, Incomplete Enumeration does not apply here.

3. **Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - Does the Reason conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition?
   - No, this is a label for what the opponent is accused of, rather than a complete argument.

4. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - Does the Reason repeat the Proposition without adding new information?
   - No, the Reason doesn't just repeat the Proposition; it provides more context.

5. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - Is the causal basis for the Proposition compelling?
   - Unsure, but the claim lacks depth of explanation which can suggest insufficient causal basis.

6. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - Is the Proof of Reason assumed as certain based on universal agreement?
   - No, there is no indication of universal agreement being used as a basis.

7. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
   - Can any part of the Proof of Reason be taken differently than intended?
   - No, the language is clear in its accusation.

Based on the above evaluation and steps, the most suitable match is likely **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. This argument type fits because the statement implies a weakness in the causal reasoning; it suggests that the opponent's actions are dubious but doesn't provide a compelling reason beyond that their initial claim was rebutted.

### Final Classification

The string "You moved the goalposts or made up an exception when your claim was shown to be false" most likely corresponds to the defective argument type <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
