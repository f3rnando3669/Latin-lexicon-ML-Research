To apply IDAA to the task of classifying the string "Which type of logical fallacy is used when a writer incorrectly states that one event has caused another?" let's break it down systematically.

### Step 1: Decomposition (<D>) of the Advanced Task (<t>)

#### Task Definition
- The advanced task (<t>) here is the identification of the logical fallacy type. In this case, we want to classify a string related to logical fallacies under one of the defective argument types.

#### Specific Steps for Decomposition
1. **Identify the core proposition** in the string.
2. **Examine the causal basis** or reasoning indicated.
3. **Bring corroborative proof** if needed, by comparing the defective argument types definitions.
4. **Match the observed defect** to one of the predefined defective argument categories (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>).

**Application Plan:**
- Step 1: Extract the central proposition (P) from the string.
- Step 2: Determine the implied Reason (R) for the proposition.
- Step 3: Check for Proof of Reason (PR) if available or implied.
- Step 4: Analyze the causal relationship and conclude which defective argument type is applicable.

### Step 2: Application of Decomposition to Classification Task (<IDAA>)

**Apply Decomposition Steps to the String**

**String to Classify:** "Which type of logical fallacy is used when a writer incorrectly states that one event has caused another?"

#### Step 1: Extract Proposition (P)
- Here, the central issue is an assertion about the use of a logical fallacy.

Parsed Proposition: "One event has caused another."

#### Step 2: Determine Implied Reason (R)
- The rationale stated implies a causal relationship between two events that is incorrectly presented.

Implied Reason: "The writer incorrectly attributes causation between two events."

#### Step 3: Check for Proof of Reason (PR)
- Evidence or additional arguments aren't explicitly stated but are implied: the erroneous attribution itself is posed as the proof of the reasoning flaw.

#### Step 4: Analyze the Defect Type
- Now, we match this logical flaw, which revolves around incorrect causation, to our defective argument definitions:

  - **Generalization (G):** Not applicable as there is no broad assertion made.
  - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable as enumeration isn't involved.
  - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Could apply if the reason doesn't conclusively prove P, but our key focus is the nature of incorrect causation.
  - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Relevant as it explicitly mentions causal basis and whether it's compelling.
  - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Not applicable because this isn't a repetitive statement.
  - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Not applicable as thereâ€™s no presumptive argument about consensus.
  - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Not applicable as no ambiguous language use is exploited.

The defect revolves around the causal connection lacking sufficient proof or legitimacy, thus making WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis) the most fitting classification. 

**Conclusion:** The logical fallacy in question is **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

### Final Step: Production of the Result
By following the decomposed steps, it is clear that the given logical fallacy is best classified under **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)** when a writer incorrectly states that one event has caused another.
