For 
To apply the task of classifying ("IDA") the string "He can't be a great athlete; he didn't adopt the stray dog on the street." as one of the defective argument types, we follow the decomposition ("D") step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\<P\>)
- **Proposition (\<P\>)**: The primary statement we intend to prove is that "He can't be a great athlete."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\<R\>)
- **Reason (\<R\>)**: The reason given for supporting the proposition is "he didn't adopt the stray dog on the street."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Argument for Defect Types
We now need to assess if the argument contains any defects based on the argument types:

1. **Generalization (\<G\>)**: Does the proposition rely on a generalization that is not justified?
    - **Analysis**: No, the argument does not rely on a generalization of individual cases.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)**: Does the proposition claim a complete enumeration but miss pertinent cases?
    - **Analysis**: No, the argument does not claim to enumerate all possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**: Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
    - **Analysis**: Yes, the reason provided ("he didn’t adopt the stray dog") is inconclusive with regard to proving he can't be a great athlete. Whether someone adopts a dog has no bearing on their athletic abilities.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**: Is the reason's causal basis not compelling?
    - **Analysis**: Yes, the causal connection between adopting a dog and being a great athlete is insufficient and not compelling.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)**: Is the reason just a repetition of the proposition?
    - **Analysis**: No, the reason given is different from the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)**: Does the argument assume universal agreement on something that is still in dispute?
    - **Analysis**: No, the argument does not rely on presumed universal consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)**: Can the proof be taken in another sense than the speaker intended?
    - **Analysis**: The language used is not ambiguous.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument Based on Defects Found
Considering the analysis, the appropriate classifications for this defective argument are:

- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**: The reason stated does not conclusively demonstrate that "he can't be a great athlete."
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**: The reason ("he didn’t adopt the stray dog") provides an insufficient and non-compelling causal basis for the proposition.

### Conclusion
The classification (\<IDA\>) of the string "He can't be a great athlete; he didn't adopt the stray dog on the street." is:

- **\<IR\>**
- **\<WCB\>**

Both classifications apply to this defective argument.
