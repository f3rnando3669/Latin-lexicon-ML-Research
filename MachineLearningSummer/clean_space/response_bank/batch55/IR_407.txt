For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the statement "A bank with the heart for every Filipino" - Veterans Bank as either <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU> or <DEP>, we will decompose the task into specific steps and identify which type of defective argument, if any, the statement falls under.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of <IDA> Task

1. **Identify and Analyze the Proposition (P):**
   - Determine what the statement is intending to prove or assert.

2. **Determine the Reason (R):**
   - Identify any causal basis or reason provided that supports the proposition.

3. **Evaluate Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - Look for additional arguments or evidence provided to corroborate the reason.

4. **Check for Generalization (<G>):**
   - Assess if the assertion applies a specific case to all cases without sufficient justification.

5. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Examine if the statement suggests a complete enumeration of possibilities but misses some.

6. **Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Evaluate whether the reason conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the proposition.

7. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Assess if the reason given is a weak or non-compelling causal basis for the proposition.

8. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - Determine if the reason merely repeats the proposition without adding substantial justification.

9. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - Look for assertions that rest on an assumed universal agreement that isn't actually certain.

10. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
    - Evaluate if the statement contains ambiguous language that can be interpreted in multiple ways.

### Applying <IDAA> to "A bank with the heart for every Filipino":

**Step 1: Identify and Analyze the Proposition (P)**

- **Proposition (P):** Veterans Bank is a bank with the heart for every Filipino.

**Step 2: Determine the Reason (R)**

- **Reason (R):** The statement does not provide a specific causal basis or reason within the statement itself.

**Step 3: Evaluate Proof of Reason (PR)**

- **Proof of Reason (PR):** The statement does not include additional arguments or evidence to support the proposition.

**Steps 4-10: Check for Defective Argument Types**

**Step 4: Check for Generalization (G)**

- **Analysis:** The statement attempts to generalize that Veterans Bank has a heart for every Filipino without specific evidence. This could imply <G>.

**Step 5: Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**

- **Analysis:** The statement does not claim to provide a complete enumeration of possibilities, so it does not appear to fall under <FE>.

**Step 6: Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR)**

- **Analysis:** There isn’t an explicit reason given, so it’s hard to judge conclusiveness. This makes it less likely to be <IR>.

**Step 7: Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

- **Analysis:** Since no causal basis is provided, it cannot be said to have an insufficient causal basis. Not a case for <WCB>.

**Step 8: Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**

- **Analysis:** The statement does not seem to repeat itself to establish the reason. <RR> does not apply here.

**Step 9: Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**

- **Analysis:** The statement does not rely on a presumed universal agreement. Not a case for <FU>.

**Step 10: Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**

- **Analysis:** The phrase "a bank with the heart" could be interpreted in various ways. It doesn’t clearly define what having "the heart for every Filipino" entails. This can be ambiguous and fits <DEP>.

### Conclusion:

The statement "A bank with the heart for every Filipino" - Veterans Bank can be classified as:
- **<G> (Generalization):** It makes a generalized claim without specific evidence.
- **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):** The phrase is ambiguous and can be interpreted in multiple ways.

Thus, the statement displays both generalization and ambiguous language use.
