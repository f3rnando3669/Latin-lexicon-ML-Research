For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to the argument "I started exercising twice a week, and I just got a babysitting job. Exercising leads to new jobs!", we need to break down the task of \( \text{IDA} \) (identifying defective arguments) into specific steps and then apply these steps to classify the given argument. We'll follow the structured approach below:

### Step-by-Step Analysis (\( \text{IDAA} \))

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\( P \))**

The Proposition in the argument is:
- \( P \): "Exercising leads to new jobs."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (\( R \))**

The Reason provided to support the Proposition is:
- \( R \): "I started exercising twice a week, and I just got a babysitting job."

**Step 3: Evaluate for Defective Argument Types**

We now need to check if the Proposition and Reason fit any of the defective argument types defined:

1. **Generalization (\( G \))**
   - Does the Proposition make a broad assertion based on a limited set of instances?
   - Yes, this appears to be a Generalization because the conclusion that "Exercising leads to new jobs" is drawn from a single personal experience that may not be universally applicable.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\( FE \))**
   - Does the argument claim a complete consideration of possibilities while actually missing some?
   - No, the argument does not make an explicit claim that all possibilities have been enumerated.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \))**
   - Does the Reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition?
   - Yes, the Reason provided ("I started exercising twice a week, and I just got a babysitting job") does not conclusively prove that exercising leads to new jobs because correlation does not imply causation.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \))**
   - Is the causal basis presented weak or unconvincing?
   - Yes, the causal linkage between exercising and getting a job is weak. There's no compelling evidence showing that exercise was the reason for getting the job.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( RR \))**
   - Does the Reason simply restate the Proposition without providing additional support?
   - No, the Reason provided is not a repetition of the Proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\( FU \))**
   - Does the Proof of Reason wrongly assume universal agreement on a disputed point?
   - No, the argument does not assume anything is universally agreed upon.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\( DEP \))**
   - Can the Proof of Reason be taken in another sense than intended?
   - No, the language used is not ambiguous; the issue lies more in the logical connection.

**Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument**

Based on the above analysis, the argument primarily fits:
- \( G \) (Generalization): A broad assertion based on a single or limited personal experience.
- \( IR \) (Inconclusive Reason): The Reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.
- \( WCB \) (Insufficient Causal Basis): The causal basis is weak and unconvincing.

**Conclusion**

The argument "I started exercising twice a week, and I just got a babysitting job. Exercising leads to new jobs!" can be classified as containing defective argument types \( G \), \( IR \), and \( WCB \). This means the argument is based on an unwarranted generalization, provides inconclusive reasoning, and presents an insufficient causal basis for the conclusion.
