For 
To apply the task of IDAA, which involves decomposing the task of classifying defective arguments and then applying that decomposition to the provided statements, we'll break down the process into specific steps and then follow those steps systematically.

**Steps for Decomposition of IDA (D):**
1. Identify the Proposition \( P \)
2. Identify the Reason \( R \)
3. Determine if \( P \) fits into any defective argument type (\(\{G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP\}\))
4. Determine if \( R \) fits into any defective argument type (\(\{G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP\}\))
5. Determine if Proof of Reason \( PR \) fits into any defective argument type (\(\{G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP\}\))

Now, let's apply these steps:

**Statement 1: "If the government allows psychologists to prescribe medications there will be no basis to block them from obtaining competence and legal authority to conduct other traditionally medical procedures such as diagnosing minor skin irritations, treating a sprained ankle, setting a broken bone, and performing neurosurgery."**

Step 1: Identify the Proposition \( P \)

- \( P \): Psychologists will be able to conduct other traditionally medical procedures if they are allowed to prescribe medications.

Step 2: Identify the Reason \( R \)

- \( R \): There will be no basis to block them from obtaining competence and legal authority to conduct other traditionally medical procedures.

Step 3: Determine if \( P \) fits into any defective argument type

- **FE (Incomplete Enumeration)**: The proposition lists some medical procedures but doesnâ€™t account for the full spectrum of medical practices, implying a complete enumeration, which is not substantiated.

Step 4: Determine if \( R \) fits into any defective argument type

- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The reason provided ("no basis to block them") is weak as it assumes a slippery slope without compelling evidence that prescribing medications will lead to full medical practice rights.

Step 5: Determine if Proof of Reason \( PR \) fits into any defective argument type

- No explicit \( PR \) provided in this statement.

**Statement 2: "Never reduce a fee for any patient for any reason or else you'll find yourself constantly reducing fees for everyone, everyone will take advantage of you, your patients will lose respect for you and for therapy, and you'll lose money and go bankrupt."**

Step 1: Identify the Proposition \( P \)

- \( P \): Never reduce a fee for any patient for any reason.

Step 2: Identify the Reason \( R \)

- \( R \): If you do, you'll find yourself constantly reducing fees for everyone, being taken advantage of, losing respect, losing money, and going bankrupt.

Step 3: Determine if \( P \) fits into any defective argument type

- **G (Generalization)**: The proposition is a broad generalization that does not necessarily apply to all scenarios of fee reduction.

Step 4: Determine if \( R \) fits into any defective argument type

- **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**: The chain of consequences provided in the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of \( P \); it assumes extreme outcomes without clear linkage.

Step 5: Determine if Proof of Reason \( PR \) fits into any defective argument type

- No explicit \( PR \) provided in this statement.

**Summary:**

- For the first statement:
  - \( P \) fits the type **FE** (Incomplete Enumeration)
  - \( R \) fits the type **WCB** (Insufficient Causal Basis)

- For the second statement:
  - \( P \) fits the type **G** (Generalization)
  - \( R \) fits the type **IR** (Inconclusive Reason)
