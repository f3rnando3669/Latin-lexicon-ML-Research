For 
To apply IDAA to the given statement, "I asked six of my friends what they thought of the new spending restraints and they agreed it is a good idea. The new restraints are therefore generally popular," we need to decompose the task of classifying this string into specific steps. Hereâ€™s how we can proceed step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- The proposition sets forth what we intend to prove.
- **Proposition (P)**: "The new restraints are generally popular."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- The reason sets forth the causal basis for <P>.
- **Reason (R)**: "I asked six of my friends what they thought of the new spending restraints and they agreed it is a good idea."

### Step 3: Determine the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- The proof of reason corroborates the reason with additional arguments.
- **Proof of Reason (PR)**: N/A in this context since the statement doesn't provide an additional argument other than surveying six friends.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument
- Analyze the statement and see if it fits any defective argument type definitions:
  - **Generalization (G)**: The assertion is based on a sample that might not be representative.
  - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Missing some possibilities in enumeration.
  - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
  - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Weak causal basis for the proposition.
  - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Reason repeating the proposition.
  - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assuming general consensus without proper basis.
  - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Ambiguity in interpretation of the proof or reason.

### Step 5: Evaluate the Argument Against Defective Types
1. **Generalization (G)**
   - The reason is based only on the opinions of six friends. This small sample is not representative of the general population.
   - This matches the definition of <G> as the assertion is made based on one part (a minority subset) rather than the whole.

### Conclusion
- The argument falls under the category of **Generalization (G)**.
- Complete classification: 
  - Type: <G> (Generalization)
  - Proposition: "The new restraints are generally popular."
  - Reason: "I asked six of my friends what they thought of the new spending restraints and they agreed it is a good idea."

By following the decomposition of the task step by step, we classified the argument successfully.
