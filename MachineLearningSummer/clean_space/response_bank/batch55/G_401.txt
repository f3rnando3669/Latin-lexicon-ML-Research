For 
To apply IDAA to the statement "My father smoked four packs of cigarettes a day since age fourteen and lived until age sixty-nine. Therefore, smoking really can’t be that bad for you," we need to follow a structured approach to classify the defect in the argument. Here are the steps we take for IDAA:

### Step 1: Parse the Statement into Components
First, identify the proposition (P) and the reason (R) within the statement.
- **Proposition (P):** "Smoking really can’t be that bad for you."
- **Reason (R):** "My father smoked four packs of cigarettes a day since age fourteen and lived until age sixty-nine."

### Step 2: Identify the Argument Type
Read the provided definitions of the defective argument types and decide which one best fits the argument presented.

### Step 3: Analyze for Generalization (G)
Check if the proposition makes an assertion based on a single example (one part) or on a majority, but attempts to generalize it to all.
- **Analysis:** The statement uses a single instance (the father’s lifespan while being a heavy smoker) to generalize about the overall harmfulness of smoking. 

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
Compare the analysis to the definition of each defective argument type to determine the classification. In this case:
- **Generalization (G):** Fits because the argument uses one person's experience to draw a broad conclusion about smoking's harmfulness, ignoring the vast amount of evidence about the health risks of smoking.

### Conclusion
The defective argument type for the statement is **Generalization (G)**.

So, applying IDAA to the given statement, we classify it as **Generalization (G)**.
