Sure, let's break down the advanced task of classifying the statement according to the defective argument types step-by-step:

### Decomposition of the Task (D) ###
1. **Identify the Propositions (\<P>) in the String (\<s>)**:
   Extract the main claims or assertions that are being presented.

2. **Identify the Reasons (\<R>) Provided**:
   Determine what causal basis or reasons are set forth to support each proposition.

3. **Identify the Proofs of Reasons (\<PR>)**:
   Examine if there are any corroborative arguments presented to support the reasons given.

4. **Evaluate Completeness and Relativity**:
   Check the completeness of the enumeration, relative applicability of generalization, and conclusiveness of reasons.

5. **Identify Defects Based on Given Definitions**:
   Compare the identified propositions, reasons, and proofs of reasons with the definitions of the defective argument types (\<G>, \<FE>, \<IR>, \<RR>, \<WCB>, \<FU>, \<DEP>).

### Application to the Given String ###
Let's apply these steps to the provided string:

#### Step 1: Identify the Propositions (\<P>)
- **P1**: "I won't be able to get into a good college."
- **P2**: "I won't be able to get a job."
- **P3**: "I am going to end up homeless."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reasons (\<R>)
- **R1**: "If I don't take the right classes in high school."
- **R2**: "If I don't get into a good college."
- **R3**: "If I can't get a job."

#### Step 3: Identify the Proofs of Reasons (\<PR>)
Not explicitly provided in the string, but the overall structure suggests a chain of causal relationships without additional corroborative proofs.

#### Step 4: Evaluate Completeness and Relativity
- The string implies a causal chain, assuming a direct connection between each fact but lacks an in-depth exploration of each step's completeness and relevance.
- Potential gaps or overgeneralizations in the causality chain: assuming that not taking the right classes will necessarily lead to not getting into a good college, and so forth.

#### Step 5: Identify Defects Based on Given Definitions
- **\<G> (Generalization)**: The argument overgeneralizes the outcomes by not considering other factors, such as extracurriculars, personal statements, recommendation letters, networking in job searching, etc.
- **\<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: The argument does not account for other possibilities or pathways to obtain a job or avoid homelessness.
- **\<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: Each reason does not conclusively prove the next proposition. For example, many factors contribute to college acceptance beyond classes in high school.
- **\<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: This defect does not seem to apply as the reasons are not mere repetitions of propositions.
- **\<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The causal bases provided (e.g., not taking the right classes) are not compelling enough on their own to ensure the stated outcomes (e.g., not getting into a good college).
- **\<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: There is no apparent appeal to universal agreement in the example.
- **\<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: Ambiguous language is not clearly evident in the example.

### Conclusion
Upon classification, the primary defects evident in the argument are:
- **\<G> (Generalization)**
- **\<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**
- **\<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**
- **\<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**

Thus, the given string primarily exhibits characteristics of Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, and Insufficient Causal Basis.
