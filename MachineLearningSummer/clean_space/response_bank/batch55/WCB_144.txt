To apply IDAA, which entails decomposing the task of classifying the given string into specific steps, we need to carefully break down and analyze the argument to determine which type of defective argument it represents. Below is the step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
Identify the main claim or assertion (Proposition) in the given string.

- **Proposition (<P>)**: "The crowing rooster causes the sun to rise."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
Identify the reasoning provided to support the Proposition.

- **Reason (<R>)**: "The rooster crows always before the sun rises."

### Step 3: Determine if there is a Proof of Reason <PR>
Identify any additional arguments that corroborate the Reason.

- In this case, there is no additional argument presented beyond the reasoning itself, so we do not specifically have a Proof of Reason (<PR>).

### Step 4: Evaluate the Reason <R>
Analyze the Reason to determine if it conclusively supports the Proposition.

- Let's examine the reasoning: The statement claims that because the rooster crows before the sun rises, the rooster's crowing causes the sun to rise.

### Step 5: Classify the Defect
Compare the identified parts with the definitions of defective arguments to classify the argument.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This does not involve a generalization about a group.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This is not involving a supposedly complete list of possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The Reason (correlation) does not conclusively demonstrate the causation claimed in the Proposition.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis that the rooster's crow causes the sun to rise is weak because the situation presents a correlation rather than a causational relationship.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The Reason and Proposition are not identical statements.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This does not involve an assumed consensus.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The argument does not hinge on ambiguous language.

### Step 6: Select the Most Applicable Defective Argument Type
Based on our evaluation:
- The Reason provided does not establish a strong causal link for the Proposition, indicating an **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
- Additionally, the Reason provided (the rooster crows always before the sun rises) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition (the crowing rooster causes the sun to rise), indicating an **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**.

### Conclusion
- The argument is most appropriately classified as **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** as the provided Reason does not conclusively establish the correctness of the Proposition. It is also valid to consider it as **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** given the weak causal link suggested.

Thus, the defective argument in the given string can be classified under **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**.
