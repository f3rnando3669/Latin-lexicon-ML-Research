For 
To apply the IDAA (decomposition of IDA into specific steps) to the statement "If your neighbor robs a bank, should you go to jail? is an example of.....," we'll breakdown the task step-by-step:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition to Classify the Defective Argument (IDAA):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: The proposition in this statement is implied; it suggests that there is some argument being made that is flawed.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: We need to identify the reason behind the proposition or the main argument being made. In this case, the implied argument seems to be questioning the fairness or logic of the situation.

3. **Assess the Potential Flaw**: Evaluate the possible defects according to the types defined: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

4. **Classify**: Based on the understanding from the proposition and reason, classify the statement into one of the defective argument types.

### Application to the Given Statement:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**
- The implied proposition here is "If your neighbor robs a bank, you should go to jail."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**
- The Reason implied is questioning the fairness or the logic of assigning guilt by association, i.e., someone should not be punished for another's crime.

**Step 3: Assess the Potential Flaw**
- Generalization (<G>): The statement does not really generalize from a part to a whole.
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>): The argument isn't about enumerating possibilities.
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>): The statement actually presents a rhetorical question rather than a reason that fails to prove the conclusion.
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>): Thereâ€™s no repetition of the proposition in the reason.
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>): The causal basis (one should be jailed because their neighbor robbed a bank) is indeed weak, as it lacks a compelling connection.
- Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>): The argument does not assume a consensus.
- Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>): There is no ambiguity in the language used.

**Step 4: Classify**
- The most fitting classification would be Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), as the reason (your neighbor's action should result in your punishment) presented for the proposition (you should go to jail) does not provide a compelling causal basis.

Therefore, the statement "If your neighbor robs a bank, should you go to jail? is an example of..." is classified as <WCB>, Insufficient Causal Basis.
