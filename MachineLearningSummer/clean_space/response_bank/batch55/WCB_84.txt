For 
To apply **IDAA** (the application of the decomposition of a task into specific steps) to **IDA** (the task of classifying a given string as a defective argument type), we will break down the task step-by-step. Here, we need to classify the given string according to the types of defective argument listed: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

### Step-by-Step Application:

1. **Understand the Proposition (<P>):**
   - In the given string, the proposition is: "That must be why I’m having such a bad day today. It’s bad luck."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reasons offered for the proposition are:
     - "Yesterday, I walked under a ladder."
     - "I had an open umbrella indoors."
     - "I spilled salt."
     - "In front of a black cat."
     - "I forgot to knock on wood with my lucky dice."

3. **Evaluate Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - There is no additional independent corroboration provided for the reasons (i.e., no further evidence or argumentation validating the reasons given).

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:**

   - **Generalization (<G>):** 
     - This doesn’t fit because it does not attempt to generalize from a part or majority to the whole.
   
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
     - This also does not fit since the argument does not claim completeness over enumerating all possible superstitions or causes of bad luck.
   
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
     - This seems to fit. The reasons provided (walking under a ladder, an open umbrella indoors, spilling salt, etc.) are examples of superstitions. These reasons do not conclusively demonstrate that the bad day is a result of the supposed bad luck caused by these actions. These actions and their outcomes (bad day) are not causally linked by evidence but by superstition.
   
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
     - This could also be fitting because the causal basis (superstition) is not a compelling or scientifically valid reason for the proposition (having a bad day). Belief in superstitions does not establish a robust causal connection.
   
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
     - This does not apply, as the Reasons are not simply restatements of the Proposition.
   
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
     - This does not seem to fit per se because it doesn't hinge on the ground that “it is universally agreed upon” but more on personal belief in superstitions.
   
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
     - This does not fit because the argument's language is clear and unambiguous in its presentation.

### Conclusion:
Given the above evaluation, the argument fits most closely with **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and potentially **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** due to its reliance on superstitions without a compelling causal basis or proper evidence.

### Most Fitting Classification:
<IR> - **Inconclusive Reason**.

So, the defective argument type for the given string is **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**.
