For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task "Hannah argues that because her friend was brainwashed as a child into thinking that people are generally good, people are not generally good. Name that fallacy:", we will decompose the task into specific steps and systematically classify the given argument.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Understand the Argument:**
   - Proposition (<P>): People are not generally good.
   - Reason (<R>): Her friend was brainwashed as a child into thinking that people are generally good.

2. **Identify the Type of Defective Argument:**
   - Assess the nature of the Reason (<R>):
     - <G> Generalization?
     - <FE> Incomplete Enumeration?
     - <IR> Inconclusive Reason?
     - <RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition?
     - <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis?
     - <FU> Presumptuous Consensus?
     - <DEP> Ambiguous Language Use?

3. **Classify the Reasoning & Identify Fallacy:**
   - The argument does not seem to make a generalization based on insufficient data (<G>).
   - It does not claim an enumeration of possibilities (<FE>).
   - It is not using ambiguous language (<DEP>).
   - It does not rely on a presumed consensus with something still in dispute (<FU>).
   - It does not seem to be repeating the Proposition (<RR>).

4. Determine whether the Reason is Insufficient or Inconclusive:
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This fallacy would apply if the Reason is weak and the causal basis for the Proposition is not compelling.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This fallacy would apply if the Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.

5. **Evaluate <R> Given <P>:**
   - The Reason given (friend being brainwashed) does not logically demonstrate that people are not generally good. The argument attempts to discredit a belief based on the state of mind of a specific individual rather than providing substantive evidence against the belief itself.

### Conclusion:
- The fallacy here is most appropriately classified as **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. The Reason presented does not conclusively establish or demonstrate the truth of the Proposition.

### Final Answer:
Apply <IDAA> to the argument, and we identify that the fallacy is **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
