Certainly! To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task into specific steps) to IDA (the classification of the given string into one of the defective argument types), let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the proposition (\<P>)
In the given string, the proposition (\<P>) is: "A mother says that she does not trust her pediatrician."

### Step 2: Identify the reason (\<R>)
The reason (\<R>) provided for the proposition is: "because he has never been a mother."

### Step 3: Analyze the argument for defects
Now, we'll analyze the given argument to see which defective argument type it falls into:

1. **Generalization (\<G>)**: This error involves making a broad assertion based on a limited sample size. The given argument doesn't seem to extrapolate a limited observation to all cases, so \<G> does not apply here.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE>)**: This error occurs when we claim completeness but miss out on possibilities. The given string does not claim to list all reasons why a pediatrician might or might not be trustworthy, so \<FE> does not apply here.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>)**: This error occurs when the provided reason does not conclusively support the proposition. The reason given ("he has never been a mother") does not conclusively prove that the pediatrician is untrustworthy. This reason alone is insufficient to establish the truth of the proposition.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB>)**: This is similar to \<IR>, where the causal basis is weak. Again, the argument that a pediatrician's trustworthiness is determined by whether they have been a mother or not is a weak causal basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR>)**: This occurs when the reason simply restates the proposition. Here, the reason "because he has never been a mother" does not simply restate the proposition, so \<RR> does not apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU>)**: This error assumes a reason is indisputable because it is universally agreed upon, which is not the case here.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP>)**: This occurs when the reason can be taken in another sense. There is no ambiguity in the statement about the pediatrician not being a mother.

### Step 4: Classify the argument
Based on the analysis, the defective argument type that fits best is:

- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>)**: because the provided reason does not conclusively establish the trustworthiness of the pediatrician. Additionally, **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB>)** could also apply because the causal link between being a mother and being a trustworthy pediatrician is weak.

### Step 5: State the final classification
The argument "A mother says that she does not trust her pediatrician because he has never been a mother" can be classified as:

- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB>)**

We have completed the steps in IDAA to classify the given string.
