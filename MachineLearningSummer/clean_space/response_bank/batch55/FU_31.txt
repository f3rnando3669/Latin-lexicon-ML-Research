For 
To apply the IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types) to the string "More and more people are buying sports utility vehicles. It is time you bought one, too!", we need to take the following steps:

### Step 1: Identify the components of the argument
1. **Proposition (\<P>):** 
   - What does the argument intend to prove?
   - In this case, "\<P>" is: "It is time you bought a sports utility vehicle."

2. **Reason (\<R>):**
   - What reason is given to support the proposition?
   - Here, "\<R>" is: "More and more people are buying sports utility vehicles."

### Step 2: Assess whether the components are correctly formed
1. **Check if \<P> is a valid proposition:**
   - "\<P>" should clearly state what is intended to be proven.
   - The proposition seems to be clearly stated.

2. **Check if \<R> is a valid reason:**
   - "\<R>" should provide a causal basis to support "\<P>".
   - The given reason is more about a trend or a majority action, which might suggest social proof but does not necessarily causally justify the proposition.

### Step 3: Identify if any reason-based defective arguments are apparent
Using the definitions provided:
1. **Generalization (\<G>):**
   - "\<G>" is an assertion based on the actions of some or a majority but not necessarily applicable to all, referred to all.
  
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE>):**
   - "\<FE>" claims a complete enumeration of possibilities but misses some pertinent ones.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>):**
   - "\<IR>" occurs when the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB>):**
   - "\<WCB>" is when the causal basis for the reason is weak.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR>):**
   - "\<RR>" is simply restating the proposition as the reason.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU>):**
   - "\<FU>" assumes the proof as certain because it is "universally agreed upon."

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP>):**
   - "\<DEP>" occurs when the proof can be taken in another sense than intended.

### Step 4: Match the argument to the defective types
1. The reason "\<R>" "More and more people are buying sports utility vehicles" indicates a trend and does not inherently offer a conclusive causal basis for "\<P>". This could indicate an **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>)**, as the reason does not necessarily justify the correctness of the proposition in a causal manner.
   
2. Furthermore, the argument is suggesting that because others are doing it, you should too. This resembles the defective argument type **Generalization (\<G>)**, where an action by a group is applied to an individual case without a strong basis.

3. Since it appeals to what the majority is doing rather than a well-founded causal reason, it also falls under **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB>)**.

### Step 5: Conclude and classify
Given the evaluation, the argument "More and more people are buying sports utility vehicles. It is time you bought one, too!" can be classified primarily as a **Generalization (\<G>)** because it uses the growing popularity of the action as the basis for suggesting an individual do the same. Additionally, it also demonstrates elements of **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB>)**.

Therefore, the most fitting classification for this argument, considering its strongest characteristic, is **Generalization (\<G>)**.
