To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task IDA into specific steps) to classify the given string as one of the defective argument types, let's break down the process step by step.

### <D>: Decomposition of the Task <t>
1. **Identify** the components of the argument within the given string.
2. **Evaluate** each component against the definitions of defective argument types.
3. **Determine** which defective argument type (if any) applies based on the evaluation.

### Application of <D> to <IDA>

#### Step 1: Identify Components of the Argument
1. **Lucas's statement**: "I remember when I was about three years old my mother saved me from almost being eaten by a shark."
   - This is the Proposition <P>, where Lucas is asserting a specific memory.

2. **Katie's response**: "I doubt that. What you are experiencing is what cognitive psychologists refer to as a 'false memory'."
   - This is the Reason <R>, where Katie suggests a causal basis for Lucas's statement being incorrect.

#### Step 2: Evaluate Each Component
We need to evaluate Katie’s response and determine if it fits into any of the defective argument types.

1. **Evaluate for Generalization (G)**: There is no broad generalization in either Lucas's or Katie's statement.
   
2. **Evaluate for Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Katie is not claiming a complete enumeration of possibilities.
   
3. **Evaluate for Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Katie reasons that Lucas’s memory might be false based on cognitive psychology. The reason <R> provided by Katie could be considered inconclusive as she does not provide further evidence or explanations other than mentioning "false memory."

4. **Evaluate for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Katie’s reasoning that Lucas has a false memory because cognitive psychologists describe such phenomena might be seen as weak, as it does not offer a compelling causal explanation specific to Lucas's situation.

5. **Evaluate for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Katie's response does not merely restate what Lucas said.
   
6. **Evaluate for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Katie does not make an appeal to universal agreement.
   
7. **Evaluate for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The term "false memory" is a specific term from cognitive psychology, and Katie uses it with a clear intended meaning.

#### Step 3: Determine the Defective Argument Type
Based on the evaluation:

- The reasoning provided by Katie could be seen as not conclusively establishing that Lucas’s memory is false, making it potentially an inconclusive reason (<IR>).
- Additionally, the explanation that this is a false memory lacks a sufficiently compelling causal basis, suggesting an insufficient causal basis (<WCB>).

Since Katie's argument can fit more than one category, we select the type that best characterizes the primary issue with the reasoning.

### Conclusion
After applying the process of IDAA, we classify the given string primarily as:
**WCB: Insufficient Causal Basis**.

Katie's reasoning that Lucas's memory is false because cognitive psychologists describe such phenomena is not sufficiently compelling without additional evidence or reasoning specific to the case.
