For 
Decomposing the task of classifying the string "You should choose to work more overtime at the same rate of pay. After all, you wouldn’t want to lose your job, would you?" into specific steps to identify the defective argument <IDA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - Proposition: "You should choose to work more overtime at the same rate of pay."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - Reason: "You wouldn’t want to lose your job, would you?"

3. **Examine the Reason (R) for any potential defects**:
   - Does the Reason provide a conclusive causal basis for the Proposition?
   - Does the Reason generalize, miss possibilities, or use language ambiguously?
   - Is the Reason repetitive of the Proposition?
   - Is the Reason insufficiently compelling or based on presumptuous consensus?

Now let's apply each potential defective argument type to determine which one fits:

- **Generalization (G)**:
  - The Reason does not appear to generalize based on individuals or apply to all.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
  - The Reason does not attempt to enumerate possibilities.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
  - The Reason ("you wouldn’t want to lose your job, would you?") utilizes a scare tactic rather than providing concrete evidence that working more overtime at the same rate of pay will prevent job loss. This makes the Reason inconclusive.
  
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
  - The Reason is not a repetition of the Proposition.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
  - The Reason presents a threat (losing the job) but does not provide a strong, logical basis linking working more overtime and job security.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
  - The Reason does not appeal to a universal agreement that is actually in dispute.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
  - The Reason does not use ambiguous language.

Given this detailed analysis:

The Reason provided "you wouldn’t want to lose your job, would you?" is **both** insufficiently compelling and **inconclusive**. However, since "Insufficient Causal Basis" (WCB) might overlap with the reasoning being weak and not compelling enough, in this context, it can also be simplified to "Inconclusive Reason" (IR) as it more precisely covers the non-conclusive aspect of the Reason.

Therefore, the classification of the string "You should choose to work more overtime at the same rate of pay. After all, you wouldn’t want to lose your job, would you?" is:
  
**<IR>**: Inconclusive Reason
