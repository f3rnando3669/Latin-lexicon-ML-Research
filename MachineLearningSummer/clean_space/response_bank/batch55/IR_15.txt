To apply the advanced task of decomposing the classification of the string into specific steps, let's go through the defined process step by step. This involves decomposing the task of classifying the string as some defective argument type into its specific steps.

##### Task Decomposition (<D>):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) in the given string.**
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>) in the given string.**
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>) in the given string if it exists.**
4. **Evaluate the argument to see if it matches any of the defective argument types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).**

Now, applying this decomposition to the string:

**String**: "We admit that the measure is popular. But we also urge you to note that there are so many bond issues on the ballot that the whole thing is getting ridiculous."

#### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**
- "We admit that the measure is popular."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**
- "But we also urge you to note that there are so many bond issues on the ballot that the whole thing is getting ridiculous."
- Here the reason is stating that since there are many bond issues on the ballot, the situation is getting ridiculous.

**Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>) (if it exists)**
- In this case, a specific proof or additional argument corroborating the Reason is not clearly present.

**Step 4: Evaluate the argument**:
- Let's analyze the components identified:
  - **Proposition**: "We admit that the measure is popular."
  - **Reason**: "There are so many bond issues on the ballot that the whole thing is getting ridiculous."

- Now, determine whether any of the defective argument types apply:
  - **Generalization (<G>)**: The proposition does not seem to generalize from a part to the whole.
  - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not claim a complete enumeration.
  - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided ("there are so many bond issues... getting ridiculous") does not conclusively demonstrate why the measure being popular is problematic or irrelevant. Inconclusiveness is present as the reason given fails to directly address the popularity of the measure.
  - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal link between "many bond issues" and "getting ridiculous" is weak and not compelling enough to dismiss the measure's popularity.
  - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The reason does not repeat the proposition.
  - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: There is no appeal to universal agreement or consensus.
  - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The language in this argument does not seem ambiguously used.

Upon analyzing, the most fitting defect in the argument is:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided does not conclusively counter or establish a compelling basis to disregard the initial proposition ("the measure is popular").

So, the classification of the string "We admit that the measure is popular. But we also urge you to note that there are so many bond issues on the ballot that the whole thing is getting ridiculous." under the task IDAA is:
- **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason)
