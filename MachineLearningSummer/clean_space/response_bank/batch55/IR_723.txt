For 
To apply the task of identifying defective arguments (IDA) to the statement "Trump won't release his tax returns and prove he's clean, therefore he must have something to hide," which involves decomposing it into specific steps, we follow through the detailed step-by-step process (IDAA):

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of <IDA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - Proposition (P): "Trump must have something to hide."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - Reason (R): "Trump won't release his tax returns and prove he's clean."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   - This part is not explicitly provided in the statement but might be implied by suggesting a universal behavior pattern or common assumption about hiding something.

### Steps for Identifying Defective Argument (IDA):

4. **Examine if the argument is a Generalization (G)**:
   - Does the proposition (P) assume a conclusion about all similar situations or individuals based on one instance?
   - In this case, no generalization is being made about all people who do not release their tax returns, so it's not a Generalization (G).

5. **Check if the argument is an Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - Does it claim a complete list but potentially miss out on other pertinent possibilities?
   - The argument does not enumerate possibilities; it focuses on a singular instance, so it isn't an Incomplete Enumeration (FE).

6. **Evaluate if the Reason is Inconclusive (IR)**:
   - Does the reason (R) fail to conclusively establish the proposition (P)?
   - The reason given—failing to release tax returns—does not conclusively prove that Trump must have something to hide. Other reasons could exist for not releasing tax returns that were not considered.

7. **Assess if there is Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - Is the causal basis weak or not compelling?
   - The causal link between not releasing tax returns and 'having something to hide' is not strong or compelling without additional context or evidence.

8. **Determine if there is Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - Is the reason presented essentially the same as the proposition?
   - The statement "Trump won't release his tax returns therefore he must have something to hide" is not a repetition, but an inference, so it is not RR.

9. **Inspect for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - Is a proof presumed certain because "it is universally agreed upon"?
   - The statement does not invoke a universal agreement to substantiate the claim, so it is not FU.

10. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
    - Can the proof of reason (PR) be taken in another sense than intended?
    - The language used is not ambiguous; the terms are straightforward and univocal, so it is not DEP.

### Conclusion:

After going through the decomposition (D) and evaluation steps for each type of defective argument:

The argument "Trump won't release his tax returns and prove he's clean, therefore he must have something to hide" mostly fits the criteria for:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason given does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
  
  and possibly also
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal link provided is weak and not compelling enough to establish the claim with certainty.

Thus, the correct classification for the statement is <IR> with aspects of <WCB>.
