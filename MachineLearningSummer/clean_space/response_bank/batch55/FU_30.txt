For 
To apply the process of IDAA, the task of decomposing the classification of a given string into specific steps for a defective argument type, we need to follow the systematic approach:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
The first step is to identify the central claim, or proposition, in the string. 

For the given string:
"If you were a true Catholic, you would never eat meat on Friday even if it was the only food available."

**Proposition <P>:**
- "If you were a true Catholic, you would never eat meat on Friday even if it was the only food available."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
The next step is to determine the causal basis or reason provided in support of the proposition.

In this string:
- The implication is that being a "true Catholic" causally includes the behavior of never eating meat on Fridays.

### Step 3: Test for Defective Argument Types
Now, we will test the given string against each of the predefined defective argument types to see if any apply.

#### Generalization (G)
- Is the proposition based on an assertion that should apply universally but is based on a partial group?
- No, the proposition does not generalize a specific case to all cases.

#### Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
- Does the proposition claim a complete enumeration but miss out on pertinent possibilities?
- No, there's no claim of complete enumeration here.

#### Inconclusive Reason (IR)
- Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
- The reason is grounded in a specific religious doctrine, but it does not explicitly fail to demonstrate correctness.

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
- Is the reason weak because the causal basis submitted for the proposition is not compelling?
- This might be applicable since the claim uses a strong "true Catholic" identity to assert behavior, which is not compelling without further justification.

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
- Does the reason merely repeat the proposition?
- No, the reason elaborates on a belief system rather than repeating the proposition.

#### Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
- Is the proof assumed as certain based on a presumed universal agreement?
- Yes, this could be applicable since the assertion seems to rely on a presumed consensus about what it means to be a "true Catholic."

#### Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)
- Can the proof be taken in another sense than the speaker intended?
- There might be some ambiguity in what constitutes a "true Catholic," but this argument doesn't rely on a wordplay or ambiguous language specifically.

### Step 4: Conclude the Classification
On evaluation, two types of defective arguments seem potentially applicable: Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB) and Presumptuous Consensus (FU).

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The proposition's reason is based on a subjective view of what constitutes a "true Catholic" without compelling evidence.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The proposition assumes a consensus on the strict behavior of a "true Catholic."

The more fitting classification here appears to be **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** because the definitive identity of a "true Catholic" is assumed without acknowledging the variability and disputes in religious observance.

### Conclusion
The string "If you were a true Catholic, you would never eat meat on Friday even if it was the only food available." is classified as **<FU>, Presumptuous Consensus**.
