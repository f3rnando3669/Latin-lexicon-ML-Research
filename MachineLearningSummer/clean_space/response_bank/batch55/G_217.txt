For 
To apply the concept of **IDAA** (the decomposition of the task IDA into specific steps) to classify the statement "Science fiction books are not worth the time it takes to read them," we'll decompose the task into systematic steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition \(\mathbf{<P>}\)
- **Proposition (P):** Science fiction books are not worth the time it takes to read them.

### Step 2: Look for the Reason \(\mathbf{<R>}\)
The statement does not explicitly provide a reason or causal basis for the proposition. A reason might typically look something like: "Science fiction books are not worth the time it takes to read them **because they are not educational**."

### Step 3: Examine potential Proof of Reason \(\mathbf{<PR>}\)
Since the statement does not include an explicit reason, there is no additional argument presented to support the reason. An example of a proof might be: "Studies show that science fiction books do not improve knowledge retention or critical thinking skills."

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument
Let's go through each type to determine which category the given statement falls into:

1. **Generalization (G)**
   - Case: Generalizes about science fiction books without presenting specific evidence.
   - **Applicability:** Considering the statement makes a blanket assertion about all science fiction books based on an implied general point of view, it could be a Generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
   - Case: Claims completeness but leaves out pertinent possibilities.
   - **Applicability:** The statement doesn't enumerate any possibilities, so this type is less applicable.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
   - Case: The reason provided does not conclusively support the proposition.
   - **Applicability:** No reason is provided, rendering this type inapplicable here.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
   - Case: The causal basis submitted for the proposition is not compelling.
   - **Applicability:** Again, the lack of a reason makes this type inapplicable.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
   - Case: The reason repeats the proposition.
   - **Applicability:** Without a provided reason, this type doesn't fit.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
   - Case: Assumes a proof of reason is certain based on presumed universal agreement.
   - **Applicability:** There's no mention of universal agreement, so this is not applicable.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**
   - Case: The proof of reason can be misinterpreted.
   - **Applicability:** Without a proof of reason, this is inapplicable.

The most applicable category is:

### Classification of the given statement:
**Generalization (G)**
- The statement "Science fiction books are not worth the time it takes to read them" implies a general assertion without specific evidence, suggesting that all science fiction books are not worth reading, which can be classified as a **Generalization**.

### Summary:
- **Proposition (P):** Science fiction books are not worth the time it takes to read them.
- **Reason (R) and Proof of Reason (PR):** Not explicitly provided.
- **Classified as:** Generalization (G)
