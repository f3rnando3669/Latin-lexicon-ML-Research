To apply the advanced task decomposition method (IDAA) to the task of classifying the argument "Either we ban teenagers from possessing cell phones or we continue to let thousands of young students fail their classes." let's break down the task into specific steps and then analyze the argument according to each step.

### Step 1: Identify the Parts of the Argument
1. **Proposition (P):** The main thesis or conclusion.
   - In this case, it would be: "We should ban teenagers from possessing cell phones."
   
2. **Reason (R):** The causal basis for the proposition.
   - In this case, it appears to be: "Letting teenagers possess cell phones causes thousands of young students to fail their classes."

### Step 2: Determine if the Argument is Defective
Evaluate each part of the argument against the defective argument types defined:

1. **Generalization (G):** An assertion based on a subset which is applied to all.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Claiming to have covered all possibilities but missing some.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason does not convincingly support the proposition.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis submitted is weak.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason says the same as the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The proof of reason is assumed to be certain because it is "universally agreed upon."
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The proof of reason can be understood in a different sense than intended.

### Step 3: Apply the Classification Criteria

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - Does the argument apply a specific case (e.g., some students failing due to cell phones) to all students?
     - Yes, the argument implies that all teenagers having cell phones leads to the failure of many students, which is a generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - Does the argument claim a complete plan of possibilities? 
     - Yes, it presents a false dichotomy: ban cell phones or accept failure, ignoring other potential solutions.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - Does the reason conclusively demonstrate the proposition?
     - No, there is no conclusive evidence given that banning cell phones will prevent student failure.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - Is the causal link between cell phone possession and failing classes strong and well supported?
     - There is a weak causal basis; the argument does not adequately prove that cell phones are the primary cause of academic failure.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - Does the reason merely repeat the proposition?
     - No, the reason differs from the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - Is the argument relying on assumed universal agreement?
     - No, this particular argument doesn't rely on universal consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - Could the argument be interpreted in multiple ways?
     - The language is clear in its intention, though extreme; it doesn't fall under ambiguous language.

### Step 4: Conclusion

The argument fits multiple categories of defective argument types. Here is the classification:

- **Generalization (G):** It generalizes that allowing teenagers to have cell phones leads to failure for all students.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** It presents only two options, ignoring other possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** It does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of banning cell phones as a solution.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal link between cell phones and academic failure is not compellingly established.

Thus, the string can be classified as falling under types: **G**, **FE**, **IR**, and **WCB**.
