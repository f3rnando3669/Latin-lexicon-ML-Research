For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as a defective argument into specific steps) to the string "If we get rid of assault weapons for citizens then we will also soon lose freedom of speech and all freedoms as other countries rush in to conquer us (if the zombies don’t exterminate us first!)", we will proceed as follows:

### Step-by-Step Classification

1. **Identify Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition in the given statement is: "If we get rid of assault weapons for citizens then we will also soon lose freedom of speech and all freedoms."

2. **Identify Reason (<R>):**
   - The Reason presented is: "as other countries rush in to conquer us (if the zombies don’t exterminate us first!)"

3. **Identify the Type of Defective Argument:**
   - Now, we need to determine which defective argument type best fits this structure based on given options.

   - **Generalization (<G>):** The proposition here doesn't seem to generalize from a specific part to the whole but rather makes a chain reaction claim (slippery slope).

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The statement doesn't enumerate possibilities but rather jumps to a conclusion of loss of all freedoms.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason provided does not conclusively show how losing assault weapons will directly lead to the loss of all freedoms; the causal link is weak and speculative without clear evidence.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This is similar to IR but specific to the causal aspect. The reason given (countries rushing in to conquer us) does not sufficiently support the proposition and is highly speculative. The mention of zombies further adds to the lack of a realistic causal basis.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The Reason is not repeating the Proposition.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** There's no appeal to universal agreement here.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** There is no clear ambiguity in the terms used for the Proposition and Reason.

   Given these considerations, the best fit seems to be:

   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The Reason does not provide a conclusive link to the Proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Additionally, the Reason provides an insufficient causal basis because it introduces speculative and unrealistic scenarios, particularly with the mention of zombies.

4. **Classify the Statement:**
   - The statement can be classified as both **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** and **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)** due to its speculative and weak causal connection between losing assault weapons and the loss of all freedoms.

### Final Classification:
The statement "If we get rid of assault weapons for citizens then we will also soon lose freedom of speech and all freedoms as other countries rush in to conquer us (if the zombies don’t exterminate us first!)" is classified as:
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**

These classifications signify the defective nature of the argument due to its weak and implausible causal reasoning.
