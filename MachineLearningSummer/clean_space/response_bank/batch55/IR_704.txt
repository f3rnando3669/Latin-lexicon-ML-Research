To apply IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying the given string as one of the defective argument types), we begin by breaking down the task IDA (classifying the string) into specific steps.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Locate the main assertion or claim in the statement. This is what the speaker is intending to prove or argue against.
  
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Locate the justification or causal basis provided for the proposition. This is the evidence or reasoning given to support the claim.

3. **Identify any Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - Look for any additional arguments or evidence given to corroborate the Reason.

4. **Evaluate the Proposition, Reason, and Proof of Reason**:
   - Determine if any of these components are present in a defective manner as defined by <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.
  
5. **Classify Defective Argument**:
   - Based on the evaluation, classify the argument as one of the defective types.

### Application of Decomposition to Given String (IDAA):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - The main claim seems to be: "Lowering taxes will be a good idea."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - The reason given appears to be: "This is coming from a woman who eats a pint of Ben and Jerry’s each night.”

3. **Identify any Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - There does not seem to be any additional evidence or arguments corroborating the reason.

4. **Evaluate the Proposition, Reason, and Proof of Reason**:
   - The proposition and reason together suggest the argument is questioning the credibility of the proponent rather than addressing the merits of the proposition itself.

5. **Classify Defective Argument**:
   - **Type <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: No, the language is not ambiguous or being used in a different sense.
   - **Type <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: No, the argument is not about an assumed universal agreement.
   - **Type <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: No, the reason is not a repetition of the proposition.
   - **Type <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: No, although the causal basis is insufficient, it is more clearly an issue of relevance rather than just insufficient causality.
   - **Type <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: No, the reason does not even attempt to address the correctness directly.
   - **Type <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: No, there is no enumeration of possibilities here.
   - **Type <G> (Generalization)**: No, there is no over-generalization here.

The most accurate classification here is an argument type not explicitly listed but known as **Ad Hominem** (attacking the person rather than the argument). However, given our set of defective argument types, it best falls under **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)** because the causal connection between eating ice cream and the validity of tax policy suggestions is extremely weak and irrelevant.

### Conclusion:
The string "My opponent suggests that lowering taxes will be a good idea -- this is coming from a woman who eats a pint of Ben and Jerry’s each night!" is best classified under defective argument type **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**, given the context provided.
