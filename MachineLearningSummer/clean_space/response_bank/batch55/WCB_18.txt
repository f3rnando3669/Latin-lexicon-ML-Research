For 
To apply **IDAA** (application of task decomposition to the task of classifying defective arguments) to the example "Every sunrise, the rooster makes a sound. So it is the rooster which makes the sun rise," we need to decompose the classification task into specific steps. Here are the steps for classifying the given defective argument:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine what is intended to be proven in the argument.
   - In the given example: "So it is the rooster which makes the sun rise."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine the causal basis presented to establish the truth of the proposition.
   - In the given example: "Every sunrise, the rooster makes a sound."

3. **Determine if the Proposition has a Defective Argument Type:**
   - Check if the <P> falls under any of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

4. **Evaluate the Reason for Defective Argument Types:**
   - Assess if the <R> contributes to a defective argument type.

5. **Conclude the type of Defective Argument:**
   - Based on the above assessments, classify the argument into one of the defective types.

Now let's apply these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
**<P>**: "So it is the rooster which makes the sun rise."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
**<R>**: "Every sunrise, the rooster makes a sound."

### Step 3: Determine if the Proposition has a Defective Argument Type
- Check if the proposition is a defective argument.

### Step 4: Evaluate the Reason for Defective Argument Types
- The reason provided (R) is a correlation between two events: the rooster crowing and the sunrise.

### Step 5: Conclude the Type of Defective Argument
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. Just because the rooster crows every sunrise does not necessarily mean the rooster is causing the sun to rise. This is a classic example of a logical fallacy called "correlation does not imply causation."
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The reasoning is weak if the causal basis does not compellingly support the proposition. In this case, the claim that the rooster causes the sun to rise lacks a compelling causal justification.

Given the analysis, the argument "Every sunrise, the rooster makes a sound. So it is the rooster which makes the sun rise." can be classified under **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** and **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**, as it fails to establish a conclusive and compelling causal relationship.
