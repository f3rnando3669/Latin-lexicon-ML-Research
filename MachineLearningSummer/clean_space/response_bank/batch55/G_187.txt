For 
Certainly! Let's apply the process of decomposing the classification task (IDA) into specific steps (D) for the given argument. We'll classify "If we let the government implant tracking devices in criminals, it's not going to stop there! They're going to want to track us at work, our school children, and then eventually everyone!" into one of the defective argument types.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of IDA Task:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The proposition is the central claim or assertion the argument intends to prove.
   - In this case: “If we let the government implant tracking devices in criminals, it’s not going to stop there!”

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason supports the proposition and provides the causal basis for it.
   - Here: “They’re going to want to track us at work, our school children, and then eventually everyone!”

3. **Check if the Reason is Conclusive and Sufficient (<IR>, <WCB>):**
   - Determine if the reason conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the proposition and if the causal basis submitted is compelling.
   - In this argument:
     - The reason given does not provide concrete evidence for the claim that government tracking of criminals will lead to tracking everyone. 
     - The causal link between tracking criminals and eventually tracking everyone is not demonstrated. This suggests a weak causal basis (<WCB>).

4. **Check for Generalization (<G>):**
   - Determine if the argument is overgeneralizing from a specific case or a majority to claim that it applies to everyone.
   - Review:
     - The argument does extrapolate from the specific case of criminals to everyone without sufficient evidence, which is consistent with a generalization error (<G>).

5. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - See if the argument fails to consider other pertinent possibilities or scenarios.
   - The focus here is not on the enumeration of possibilities but more on the slippery slope argument, thus <FE> is less applicable.

6. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - Verify if the reason merely restates the proposition.
   - Here, the reason isn’t simply repeating the proposition but instead, attempting to project potential future outcomes.

7. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - See if the proof of reason relies on an assumed universal agreement on a point that is still in dispute.
   - This argument doesn’t rest on presumed consensus; it rests on a projected slippery slope.

8. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - Determine if the language can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended.
   - The language here doesn’t appear to be ambiguous but rather speculative.

### Final Classification:

Based on the decomposition and analysis:
- The argument primarily stretches from a specific scenario (tracking criminals) to a general outcome (tracking everyone) without a solid causal basis. This makes it a **Generalization (<G>)** as it infers an unwarranted general outcome.

Thus, the classification of the given string is: **<G> (Generalization)**
