For 
To apply **Decomposition** (**_<D>_**) to the task of **Identifying Defective Arguments** (**_<IDA>_**), we need to break down **_<IDA>_** into specific steps. Then, we'll apply these steps to classify the string **"Since it was a deathbed confession, it must be true."**

### Steps for Decomposition of IDA (IDAA):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Determine the main assertion or claim in the statement.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Determine the causal basis that supports the Proposition.
3. **Classify the Defectiveness:** Compare the statement against the definitions of defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) to identify any defects.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
**<P>:** The claim here is "it must be true."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
**<R>:** The reason given is "Since it was a deathbed confession."

### Step 3: Classify the Defectiveness
Let's compare the identified **Proposition** and **Reason** against the defined types of defective arguments.

- **<G> - Generalization:** The proposition is based on the assumption about the reliability of deathbed confessions. This is not a generalization.
- **<FE> - Incomplete Enumeration:** The argument doesn’t mention a complete list of possibilities. This doesn’t apply here either.
- **<IR> - Inconclusive Reason:** The reason "Since it was a deathbed confession" doesn’t conclusively demonstrate the correctness of "it must be true," as deathbed confessions can still be false.
- **<WCB> - Insufficient Causal Basis:** The causal basis provided (deathbed confessions are true) is potentially weak and not compelling because mere circumstances (being on a deathbed) don't ensure truthfulness.
- **<RR> - Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** The reason and proposition don't repeat the exact same thing.
- **<FU> - Presumptuous Consensus:** There's no assumption based on universal agreement.
- **<DEP> - Ambiguous Language Use:** The language is not ambiguous in itself, even though the conclusion drawn is weak.

### Classification
The primary defect here aligns with **<IR> - Inconclusive Reason** and potentially **<WCB> - Insufficient Causal Basis**.

### Conclusion
**<IR>**: The reason “it was a deathbed confession” does not conclusively demonstrate the truth of the proposition.
**<WCB>**: The causal basis implies that deathbed confessions are inherently true, which is not compelling without further evidence.

So, the final classification of the string "Since it was a deathbed confession, it must be true." is primarily **<IR>**, and secondarily **<WCB>**.
