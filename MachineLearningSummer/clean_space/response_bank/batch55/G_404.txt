For 
To apply <IDAA> to "Teenagers are too immature and self-absorbed to understand anything about global issues," we will decompose the task of classifying the string into specific steps. This process will involve analyzing the statement according to the definitions of defective arguments provided. Here is the step-by-step decomposition:

### Step 1: Identify and Define the Proposition (<P>)
First, we need to identify the proposition in the given statement.

**Proposition (<P>):** The assertion that "Teenagers are too immature and self-absorbed to understand anything about global issues."

### Step 2: Identify the Type of Defective Argument
Next, we need to classify the proposition according to the types of defective arguments defined:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** Does this proposition make a sweeping assertion based on behavior or attributes of some or most teenagers and assert it as true for all teenagers?
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Is the proposition defective by claiming completeness where there may be exceptions or missing pertinent possibilities?
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Does it lack a reason that conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the proposition?
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Is the reason behind the proposition weak or not compelling enough to justify the claim?
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Does the reason simply repeat the proposition?
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Does it assume universal agreement on something still in dispute?
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Can the proposition be taken in a different sense than the speaker intended?

### Step 3: Match the Proposition to Defective Argument Types
Now, we will analyze the proposition by examining each type of defective argument and determining if the proposition falls within any of these categories.

#### Analysis:

**Generalization (<G>):** The statement makes a broad assertion that all teenagers are too immature and self-absorbed to understand global issues. This is a typical case of generalization, as it takes specific attributes (immaturity and self-absorption) believed to be true for some teenagers and applies them to all teenagers.

**Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The statement does not make a claim about the completeness of possibilities, so it does not fall under this defective argument type.

**Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The statement does not provide any specific reason to support the proposition, so it doesn't apply here.

**Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** No reason is given, thus this category isn't applicable.

**Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Since no distinct reason is given, this type also doesn't apply.

**Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The statement does not argue based on a presumed universal agreement.

**Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The meaning of the proposition is clear and straightforward, with no ambiguity in the language.

### Step 4: Arrive at Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the defective argument type that fits the given statement "Teenagers are too immature and self-absorbed to understand anything about global issues" is:

**Generalization (<G>)**

### Conclusion
The statement "Teenagers are too immature and self-absorbed to understand anything about global issues" is best classified as **Generalization (<G>)**.
