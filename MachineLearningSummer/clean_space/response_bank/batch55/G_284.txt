To apply the task of classifying the given argument as an instance of defective argument according to the defined defects, we need to follow some structured steps. These steps involve parsing the argument, identifying the propositions, reasons, and proofs of reasons, and determining if any of them fall into one of the defective categories. Below are the steps and the application of these steps to classify the given argument.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown (D):

1. **Identify Propositions (<P>) and Reasons (<R>) within the Argument:**
   - Parse through the argument to distinguish between assertions (Propositions) and their justifications (Reasons).

2. **Identify Proofs of Reasons (<PR>):**
   - Look for parts of the argument that serve as evidence or additional justification for the reasons given.

3. **Analyze the Argument for Defective Types:**
   - Compare identified propositions, reasons, and proofs against defective argument types G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, and DEP to see if they qualify for any of these categories.

4. **Classify the Argument as Defective if Applicable:**
   - Determine the defect type by matching the argument's structure and content with the definitions of the defects.

### Applying IDAA to the Given Argument:

#### Parsing the Argument:

1. **Identify Propositions (<P>):**
   - **<P1>:** "A person apparently hopelessly ill may be allowed to take his own life."
   - **<P2>:** "Then he may be permitted to deputize others to do it for him should he no longer be able to act."
   - **<P3>:** "The judgment of others then becomes the ruling factor."
   - **<P4>:** "Euthanasia is no longer personal and voluntary, for others are acting on behalf of the patient as they see fit."

2. **Identify Reasons (<R>):**
   - **<R1>:** "The judgment of others then becomes the ruling factor."
   - **<R2>:** "Others may be inclined to act on behalf of other patients who have not authorized them."
   - **<R3>:** "It is a small step from voluntary euthanasia to directed involuntary euthanasia as a social policy."

3. **Identify Proofs of Reasons (<PR>):**
   - **<PR1>:** "Already at this point euthanasia is not personal and voluntary, for others are acting on behalf of the patient as they see fit."
   - **<PR2>:** "Others may well incline to act on behalf of other patients who have not authorized them to exercise this judgment."

#### Analyzing the Argument for Defective Types:

- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):**
  - The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate that allowing voluntary euthanasia inevitably leads to involuntary euthanasia. The leap from voluntary to directed and involuntary euthanasia is asserted without sufficient causal linkage.

- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):**
  - The argument seems to claim a comprehensive consideration of possibilities ("It is only a short step" phrase), but it ignores other safeguards, regulations, and ethical considerations that could prevent the slippery slope it describes.

- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):**
  - The reason that allowing voluntary euthanasia will inevitably lead to a broader, non-authorized euthanasia policy lacks a compelling causal basis.

- **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):**
  - There could be elements where the reasoning simply reiterates the proposition in a different way but does not add new evidence to substantiate it.

#### Classifying the Argument:

For the given argument: 
- The primary defect appears to be <IR> because it suggests a causal relationship without conclusive proof, indicating that the reasons provided (e.g., judgement of others becoming the ruling factor) do not necessitate the transition to involuntary euthanasia.
- Additionally, there are elements of <FE> and <WCB>, as the purported inevitability of moving from voluntary to involuntary euthanasia omits consideration of other controls and measures and lacks a robust causal basis.

Therefore, the argument has aspects that can be classified as **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** primarily but also shows traits of **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
