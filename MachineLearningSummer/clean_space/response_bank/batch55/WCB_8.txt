To apply IDAA to the task of classifying the argument in the provided statement, we will decompose the task into specific steps and then apply those steps to perform the classification.

**Step-by-Step Decomposition (D):**
1. Identify the Proposition (\<P>): Determine the main assertion or claim being made.
2. Identify the Reason (\<R>): Determine the causal basis or reasoning provided to support the Proposition.
3. Identify the Proof of Reason (\<PR>): Determine any additional arguments used to substantiate the Reason.
4. Analyze the argument for Defective Argument types:
   - Check for Generalization (\<G>)
   - Check for Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE>)
   - Check for Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>)
   - Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB>)
   - Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR>)
   - Check for Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU>)
   - Check for Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP>)
5. Categorize the argument as the defective argument type that best fits.

**Application (IDAA):**

1. **Identify the Proposition (\<P>):**
   - The main claim is: "Pirates cool the world and global warming is a hoax."

2. **Identify the Reason (\<R>):**
   - The reasoning is: "Temperatures have been rising over the past few centuries, while the number of pirates has been decreasing."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\<PR>):**
   - The chart is pointed to as evidence to substantiate the Reason.

4. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (\<G>):** Not applicable, as the argument does not make a broad claim based on a limited sample.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE>):** Not applicable, as the argument does not make a claim of completeness regarding possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>):** Potentially applicable but we need further analysis.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB>):** The causal basis provided (correlation between pirate numbers and temperature) is weak and does not logically support the claim.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR>):** Not applicable, as the Reason is different from the Proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU>):** Not applicable, as there is no claim based on universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP>):** Not applicable, as there is no evident ambiguity in language usage.

Based on the analysis, the most fitting category for the argument type is \[(<WCB>)\] Insufficient Causal Basis because the reasoning provided (a correlation between pirate numbers and temperature changes) does not compellingly establish the truth of the Proposition that "pirates cool the world and global warming is a hoax."

Therefore, the argument "Pointing to a fancy chart, Roger shows how temperatures have been rising over the past few centuries, whilst at the same time the numbers of pirates have been decreasing; thus pirates cool the world and global warming is a hoax." is classified as having a defective argument type \[(\ WCB \)] Insufficient Causal Basis.
