For 
Let's apply the process of IDAA (the decomposition and application to the task of identifying defective arguments) to the given statement: "The Senator must be wrong on the issue of taxes because he's such a jerk to the people who work for him."

### Decomposition of the IDA Task (D):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine what is being asserted.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Identify the causal basis for the proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Reason for defects**: Check if the reason has any of the defective argument properties.
4. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (if any)**: Check if there is further corroboration and if that corroboration holds any defects.

### Application of IDA to the Statement

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: "The Senator must be wrong on the issue of taxes."
   - Here, the assertion is that "The Senator must be wrong on the issue of taxes."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: "because he's such a jerk to the people who work for him."
   - The reason given for why the senator is wrong on the issue of taxes is that "he's such a jerk to the people who work for him."

3. **Evaluate the Reason for defects**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: This does not seem to be a case of generalization.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: There is no claim of complete enumeration of possibilities here.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason given (the senator being a jerk) does not logically or conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition about taxes.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reason provided, even if considered, does not provide a compelling causal basis for the proposition.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This is not simply a repetition of the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: There is no claim of universal agreement in dispute here.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The language is not ambiguous but irrelevant to the tax issue.

4. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (if any)**: There does not appear to be any additional argument or proof provided beyond the reason already given.

### Conclusion
The main defect in the argument is that the reason provided is unrelated and inconclusive with respect to the proposition. It commits a logical fallacy known as **ad hominem**, where the argument attacks the character of the person rather than addressing the issue itself.

Therefore, the defective argument type can be classified as **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**, because the reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
