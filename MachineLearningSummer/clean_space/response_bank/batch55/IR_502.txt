To apply the process of decomposing and analyzing the task of identifying defective arguments (IDAA) to the given statement, "Because doctors smoke it must be a healthy choice," we'll follow specific steps to determine which type of defective argument it represents.

### Step 1: Understand the Proposition (<P>)
First, identify the proposition being set forth in the statement.

- Proposition (<P>): "It must be a healthy choice."

### Step 2: Understand the Reason (<R>)
Next, identify the reason given to support the proposition.

- Reason (<R>): "Because doctors smoke."

### Step 3: Check the Validity of the Reason (<R>) and Proof of Reason (<PR>)
In this step, determine if the reason conclusively supports the proposition and matches one of the defective argument types defined.

- ➔ Does <R> conclusively demonstrate the correctness of <P>? (Inconclusive Reason - IR)
- ➔ Is <R> based on a sample not representative of the whole population? (Generalization - G)
- ➔ Is <R> a repetition of <P> in different words? (Faulty Repetition of Proposition - RR)
- ➔ Is the claimed causal basis weak or insufficient? (Insufficient Causal Basis - WCB)
- ➔ Is the proof based on an assumed consensus which is not certain? (Presumptuous Consensus - FU)
- ➔ Does the reason include ambiguous language? (Ambiguous Language Use - DEP)
- ➔ Does the argument claim a complete enumeration but miss out critical possibilities? (Incomplete Enumeration - FE)

### Step 4: Match to Defective Argument Type
Analyzing the reason "Because doctors smoke" and the proposition "It must be a healthy choice," we can then determine the type of defective argument:

1. **Generalization (G)**: The argument makes a generalized claim that because doctors smoke, it therefore applies universally as a "healthy choice." This is problematic because doctors are a specific subset of the population, and their choices or behaviors should not be generalized to determine healthiness universally.
  
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis that "doctors smoke" is weak and does not provide compelling evidence that smoking is a healthy choice. Smoking is widely known to have adverse health effects, and the fact that some doctors smoke doesn't change this reality.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate that smoking is a healthy choice. Simply stating that doctors smoke does not provide a sufficient or compelling link to the proposition.

### Step 5: Conclusion
Based on the analysis above, we can conclude that the statement "Because doctors smoke it must be a healthy choice" primarily fits the following defective argument types:

- **Generalization (G)**: The argument overgeneralizes from a specific subset of people (doctors) to make a broad claim about what is healthy.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal link between doctors smoking and smoking being healthy is insufficient and not compelling.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided does not conclusively support the proposition.

Thus, the statement "Because doctors smoke it must be a healthy choice" can be classified as a defective argument of types <G>, <WCB>, and <IR>.
