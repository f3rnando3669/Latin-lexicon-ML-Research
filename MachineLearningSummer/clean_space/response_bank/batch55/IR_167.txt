For 
Sure, let's apply the process of IDAA (decomposing the task of classifying the defective argument) step by step to classify the provided argument:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition <D> of <IDA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: What is the argument attempting to prove or assert?
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: What is the causal basis given to support the Proposition?
3. **Examine Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Are there additional arguments corroborating the Reason?
4. **Match Defective Argument Type**: Compare the identified <P>, <R>, and <PR> with each defective argument type definitions (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) to classify the argument.

With the decomposition established, let's apply it to the given argument:

### Applying <IDAA>:

**Argument**: "I think that we should reject what Father Jones has to say about the ethical issues of abortion because he is a Catholic priest. After all, Father Jones is required to hold such views."

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - **<P>**: "We should reject what Father Jones has to say about the ethical issues of abortion."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - **<R>**: "Because he is a Catholic priest."

3. **Examine Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - **<PR>**: "After all, Father Jones is required to hold such views."

4. **Match Defective Argument Type**:

- **Generalization (G)**: The argument does not generalize from a part to the whole but instead targets a specific individual.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not claim a complete enumeration of possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason given (being a Catholic priest) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition that his views should be rejected.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis (being a Catholic priest) is weak for rejecting his views outrightly, suggesting a form of ad hominem attack.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason provided is not a repetition of the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There is no claim of a universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: No ambiguous language is present.

### Conclusion:
Based on the definitions provided, the most appropriate classification for the argument seems to be **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**, because the reason provided (Father Jones being a Catholic priest) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition that his views should be rejected.

Thus, we classify the argument as:

- **Type**: <IR>

The argument relies on Father Jones's religious position to dismiss his views, but this reason does not logically or conclusively undermine the ethical validity of his arguments.
