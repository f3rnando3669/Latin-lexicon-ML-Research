For 
To apply IDAA to the given dialogue between Jack and Nick, we need to decompose the task of classifying the defective argument (IDA) into specific steps (D). Let's go step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
Identify the assertion or claim made in the dialogue.
- **Jack's Proposition (P):** "I have tiny, invisible unicorns living in my anus."

### Step 2: Identify the Reasons (R)
Identify the reasons or evidence provided to support the Proposition.
- **Jack's Reason (R):** "Can you prove that I don't?" (This is implied to be the reason supporting P)

### Step 3: Identify Proof of Reason (PR)
Identify if there are any additional arguments or evidence provided to support the Reason.
- **Jack's Proof of Reason (PR):** There is no additional argument provided by Jack to support the Reason "Can you prove that I don't?"

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type
Match the identified Proposition (P), Reason (R), and Proof of Reason (PR), if any, to the definitions of defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

1. **Generalization (G):** Not applicable here, as the claim is not a generalization based on limited instances.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable, as no enumeration of possibilities is made.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The Reason provided ("Can you prove that I don't?") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition ("I have tiny, invisible unicorns living in my anus"). Therefore, this could be an Inconclusive Reason.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis here is not compelling or sufficient, but this seems more like a flawed argumentative structure rather than an insufficient causal basis.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Not applicable, as the Reason given is not merely a repetition of the Proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Not applicable, as there is no assumption of universal agreement.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Not applicable, as there is no ambiguous language that can be taken in another sense.

Given the nature of the Reason ("Can you prove that I don't?"), the argument type is best classified as:

### Conclusion
- The argument presented by Jack can be classified as **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because Jack's Reason ("Can you prove that I don't?") does not conclusively demonstrate or establish the correctness of the Proposition ("I have tiny, invisible unicorns living in my anus").
