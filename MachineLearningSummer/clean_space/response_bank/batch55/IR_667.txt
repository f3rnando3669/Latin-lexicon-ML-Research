For 
To perform IDAA (the application of the decomposition of the task into specific steps) on the task of classifying the logical fallacy in the statement "If someone said, 'all kids love Cinnamon Toast Crunch, but you don't love it so you must not be a real kid,'" we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Proposition (P):**
   - Here, the statement "all kids love Cinnamon Toast Crunch" serves as the Proposition. 

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - The Reason provided is: "you don't love it," which is related to the Proposition.

3. **Identify any Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - The statement doesn't appear to provide a distinct Proof of Reason besides the Reason itself.

4. **Evaluate the Argument Structure:**
   - Assess if there is a faulty use of reasoning in connecting the Proposition to the Reason.

5. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:**
    - Review if this fits any of the defective argument types:
        - **Generalization (G):** An assertion based on one or a majority, but not all.
        - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Missing out on some important possibilities in the enumeration.
        - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The Reason does not conclusively establish the Proposition.
        - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis is not compelling.
        - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The Reason repeats the Proposition.
        - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Assuming universal agreement.
        - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The Proof of Reason can be taken in another sense than intended.

6. **Determine the Specific Fallacy:**
   - The assertion "all kids love Cinnamon Toast Crunch" attempts to make a general statement.
   - By stating that someone who does not love Cinnamon Toast Crunch is not a real kid, it improperly applies this generalization to an individual case.

Based on these steps, it becomes clear that the fallacy used in the statement is **Generalization (G)**. This is because the argument takes a general assertion about "all kids" and incorrectly applies it to an individual based on their personal preference, which amounts to asserting that all instances (or this specific instance) must follow the general rule.
