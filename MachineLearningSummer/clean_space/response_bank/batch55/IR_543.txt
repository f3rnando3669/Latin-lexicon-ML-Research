For 
To apply the decomposition of the advanced task (IDAA) to the task of identifying defective arguments (IDA) in the given statement, we shall follow a step-by-step process. 

Given string:
"You call the Marcoses murderers and plunderers yet you cannot lend me money for my school project, murdering my chance for a higher grade. You are just like them."

### Step 1: Identify Propositions (<P>) and Reasons (<R>)

1. **Proposition Identification (P):**
   - The speaker asserts that the listener is "just like them" (the Marcoses).

2. **Reason Identification (R):**
   - The reason provided is that the listener won't lend money for the speaker's school project, which the speaker equates with "murdering" their chance for a higher grade.

### Step 2: Check for Proof of Reason (<PR>)

3. **Proof of Reason Identification (PR):**
   - There is no additional argument provided to corroborate the reason aside from the assertion about the behavior of not lending money.

### Step 3: Evaluate for Defective Argument Types

4. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - Evaluate if the assertion is an unjustified extrapolation: The speakerâ€™s assertion that not lending money makes the listener "just like the Marcoses" is an overgeneralization. The actions of the Marcoses are extreme alleged crimes, while the listener's refusal to lend money for a specific purpose does not equate to these.

5. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Evaluate if the argument presents all possibilities: The proposition isn't claiming a complete enumeration, so this isn't applicable.

6. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Evaluate if the reason conclusively supports the proposition: The reason given (not lending money) does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition that the listener is as morally culpable as the Marcoses.

7. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Check the causal link between reason and proposition: The causal basis is weak. Refusal to lend money does not compellingly equate to the extreme acts attributed to the Marcoses.

8. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - Check if the reason merely restates the proposition: The reason provided is different from the proposition. 

9. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - Evaluate assumption of universal agreement: The argument does not appeal to universal consensus.

10. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
    - Check for ambiguity in language: The metaphorical language "murdering my chance for a higher grade" could be seen as hyperbolic, but not necessarily ambiguous in a way that changes the meaning from what the speaker intended.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument

Based on the evaluations, the string "You call the Marcoses murderers and plunderers yet you cannot lend me money for my school project, murdering my chance for a higher grade. You are just like them." exhibits characteristics of two defective argument types:

- **<G> Generalization**: Equating the listener's refusal to lend money with the extreme actions of murder and plunder attributed to the Marcoses is an unwarranted generalization.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The reason given doesn't conclusively support the proposition that the listener is morally equivalent to the Marcoses.

Therefore, the string primarily contains defective argument elements such as Generalization (<G>) and Inconclusive Reason (<IR>).
