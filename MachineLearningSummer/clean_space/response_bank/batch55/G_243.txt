For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the IDA task of classifying defective arguments into specific steps) to the given argument "The first time I went to Six Flags was great, so every time I go there will be great," we will follow a structured approach. Here are the steps to decompose the task:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - We need to determine the main claim or assertion that is being made in the argument.

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - Determine the causal basis or reason that is being provided to support the Proposition.

3. **Check for Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   - Look for any additional arguments that corroborate the Reason provided.

4. **Evaluate Defective Argument Types**:
   - Compare the argument against the definitions of defective argument types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), and Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

### Step-by-Step Application (IDAA):

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
- The main assertion in the given argument is: "Every time I go to Six Flags will be great."
  - This is what the speaker intends to prove.

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
- The causal basis or reason provided is: "The first time I went to Six Flags was great."
  - This is the basis upon which the speaker is supporting their Proposition.

#### Step 3: Check for Proof of Reason (PR)
- In this argument, there are no additional arguments presented to corroborate the Reason. The argument is straightforward and doesn't include any additional corroborative reasoning.

#### Step 4: Evaluate Defective Argument Types

- **Generalization (G)**:
  - Definition: When an assertion based on one example or a majority is applied to all cases.
  - Application: The argument takes one positive experience ("the first time I went to Six Flags") and generalizes it to all future experiences ("every time I go there will be great").
  - **Conclusion**: This argument is a case of Generalization.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
  - Definition: When a complete enumeration of possibilities is claimed but misses pertinent ones.
  - Application: Not relevant here as the argument does not involve listing possibilities.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
  - Definition: When the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
  - Application: This could be relevant as the single past experience does not conclusively prove that all future experiences will be the same. However, this overlaps strongly with Generalization.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
  - Definition: When the causal basis for the proposition is not compelling.
  - Application: The causal basis (a single good experience) is quite weak to conclude all future experiences will be great. Yet, this seems to again overlap with Generalization.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
  - Definition: When the reason repeats the proposition.
  - Application: The reason does not simply repeat the proposition but offers a single past experience as justification.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
  - Definition: When a proof is assumed accurate because it is universally agreed upon.
  - Application: Not relevant here.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
  - Definition: When the proof can be taken in another sense than intended.
  - Application: Not relevant here.

### Conclusion
The argument has been decomposed, and the identified defective argument type most fitting is **Generalization (G)**. The argument makes a generalization based on a single positive experience at Six Flags, claiming that all future visits will be equally great. This is a clear case of Generalization.
