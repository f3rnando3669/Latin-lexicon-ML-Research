For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "Shamus pointed a drunken finger at Sean and asked him to explain how so many people could believe in leprechauns if they're only a silly old superstition. Sean, however, had had a few too many Guinness himself and fell off his chair," we will follow these specific steps:

1. **Break down the argument components in the string**: 
   - Identify the Proposition (\<P\>), Reason (\<R\>), and Proof of Reason (\<PR\>), if any.
   - Examine the statements for any defective argument types (\<G\>, \<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<RR\>, \<WCB\>, \<FU\>, \<DEP\>).

2. **Analyze the Proposition (\<P\>)**:
   - Determine what is being intended to prove or assert.

3. **Analyze the Reason (\<R\>)**:
   - Determine the causal basis given for the Proposition (\<P\>).

4. **Analyze the Proof of Reason (\<PR\>)**:
   - Examine the additional corroborating arguments provided for the Reason (\<R\>), if any.

5. **Identify defective argument types**:
   - Classify the argument as one of the defective argument types (\<G\>, \<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<WCB\>, \<RR\>, \<FU\>, and \<DEP\>).

Letâ€™s apply these steps to the string provided:

### Step 1: Break down the argument components

- **Proposition (\<P\>)**: "So many people could believe in leprechauns."
- **Reason (\<R\>)**: "If they're only a silly old superstition."
- **Proof of Reason (\<PR\>)**: The string does not provide an explicit additional corroborating argument for the Reason (\<R\>).

### Step 2: Analyze the Proposition (\<P\>)

The Proposition suggests that it's improbable for many people to believe in something that is supposedly "only a silly old superstition."

### Step 3: Analyze the Reason (\<R\>)

The Reason seems to be questioning the believability of leprechauns given their classification as a superstition.

### Step 4: Analyze the Proof of Reason (\<PR\>)

There is no additional proof presented in the statement that further supports the Reason. 

### Step 5: Identify defective argument types

- The argument could be \[<FU>\] Presumptuous Consensus:
  The Reason implies that the belief in leprechauns must have some merit simply because "so many people" believe it. This can be interpreted as assuming a consensus when the belief is still in dispute.

### Conclusion

The given string "Shamus pointed a drunken finger at Sean and asked him to explain how so many people could believe in leprechauns if they're only a silly old superstition. Sean, however, had had a few too many Guinness himself and fell off his chair," when decomposed and analyzed, seems to classify as type \[<FU>\], Presumptuous Consensus.

This conclusion is based on the observation that Shamus's question presumes that the widespread belief in leprechauns must validate their existence or counter the label of superstition.
