For 
Sure, let's break down the task \( <IDA> \) step by step as defined by \( <D> \) in the context of the argument provided: "A car makes less pollution than a bus. Therefore, cars are less of a pollution problem than buses."

**Step 1**: Identify the Proposition \( <P> \).

In this argument, the proposition \( <P> \) is "cars are less of a pollution problem than buses."

**Step 2**: Identify the Reason \( <R> \).

The reason \( <R> \) given for this proposition is "A car makes less pollution than a bus."

**Step 3**: Check for defective argument types and classify \( <s> \).

We'll evaluate the argument against each of the defective argument types:

- \( <G> \) Generalization: This doesn’t seem to be a generalization since it doesn’t apply an attribute from a sample to a whole population.
- \( <FE> \) Incomplete Enumeration: This could be a possibility. It assumes the complete list of factors affecting pollution between cars and buses is limited to the pollution generated by each vehicle, omitting factors like the number of passengers each can carry.
- \( <IR> \) Inconclusive Reason: This could also be applicable. The reason given ("A car makes less pollution than a bus") does not conclusively support the proposition that "cars are less of a pollution problem than buses." There are many factors contributing to the pollution problem, such as the number of cars versus the number of buses and the total emission per passenger.
- \( <WCB> \) Insufficient Causal Basis: This is possible. While the causal basis provided is that a single car emits less pollution than a single bus, it doesn't account for aggregate emissions or other pollution-related factors.
- \( <RR> \) Faulty Repetition of Proposition: This isn’t applicable here because the reason \( <R> \) is not a mere repetition of the proposition \( <P> \).
- \( <FU> \) Presumptuous Consensus: This is not applicable as the argument does not suggest consensus.
- \( <DEP> \) Ambiguous Language Use: This doesn’t seem to apply as there is no ambiguity in the language used in the proposition or reason.

**Conclusion**:
The defective argument types that most closely describe the argument are \( <FE> \) (Incomplete Enumeration) and \( <IR> \) (Inconclusive Reason).

**Step 4**: Final Classification

Based on the analysis, we will classify the argument:

- **Primary classification**: \( <IR> \) Inconclusive Reason because the reason does not sufficiently support the proposition.
- **Secondary classification**: \( <FE> \) Incomplete Enumeration because it fails to consider all relevant factors in determining overall pollution.

Therefore, applying \( <IDAA> \) to "A car makes less pollution than a bus. Therefore, cars are less of a pollution problem than buses," we classify \( <s> \) primarily as \( <IR> \) due to inconclusive reasoning, and secondarily as \( <FE> \) due to incomplete enumeration.
