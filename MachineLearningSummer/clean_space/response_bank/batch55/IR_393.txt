For 
To apply IDAA (the process of decomposing and then applying the task of classifying a defective argument to a given string), we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Decompose IDA into Specific Steps (D)
1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine what is being asserted or proposed in the string.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Find the causal basis that supports the Proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**: Check for additional arguments corroborating the Reason or see if there are assumptions made.
4. **Classify Defective Arguments**: Using the definitions provided, determine if the string falls into any of the defective argument types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

### Step 2: Apply D to the Given String
Let's apply these steps to "We, the people, are going to work together to achieve justice, unity, and integrity."

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
- **Proposition (P)**: "We, the people, are going to work together to achieve justice, unity, and integrity."
  Here, the proposition is that "we (the people) will achieve justice, unity, and integrity by working together."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
- **Reason (R)**: Note that the string does not explicitly provide a reason for why working together will achieve these goals. It simply asserts it.

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
- **Proof of Reason (PR)**: There is no additional argument or evidence provided in the string itself. The assertion stands alone without further proof.

#### Step 4: Classify Defective Arguments
- **Generalization (G)**: The statement may seem like a generalization, but it does not explicitly refer to an insufficiently broad category to generalize from. It assumes that all people will work together but doesn't generalize from a subset.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This does not seem to claim complete enumeration of possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: There isn't a reason provided that could be inconclusive; the proposition itself lacks reasoning.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: There is no repetition in the given statement.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Yes, there is an implication that simply working together will achieve these goals, which lacks a compelling causal basis. (Possible classification)
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The string does not rest on an assumed consensus.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The terms "justice," "unity," and "integrity" can be interpreted in various ways but are mostly commonly understood; there is no ambiguity in a way that misleads the argumentâ€™s intent.

Based on the analysis:
- The assertion is making a causal leap without providing a robust reasoning. Therefore, **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** seems the closest classification for this defective argument.

### Conclusion
Applying IDAA to "We, the people, are going to work together to achieve justice, unity, and integrity." classifies it primarily as a defective argument of type **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because it lacks a compelling reason for how working together directly achieves those goals.
