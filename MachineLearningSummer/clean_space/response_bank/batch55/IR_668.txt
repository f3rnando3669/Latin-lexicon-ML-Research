For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task IDA into specific steps and then performing the task) to the string "A real estate ad shows a happy family moving in to the home of their dreams," we need to break down the process step by step:

1. **Identify and Understand the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The proposition embedded in the given string could be: "Buying this home will make your family happy."
   
2. **Determine the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason implied by the ad might be: "Because the family depicted is happy moving into the home of their dreams."

3. **Examine the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - The proof of reason could be: "The advertisement visually corroborates the idea by showing a happy family."

Now, we'll classify the string by examining whether any defective arguments are present:

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - Does the <P> rely on applying a trait from a part or majority to the whole? 
   - Yes, it generalizes the happiness of one family to the happiness of any family that buys the home, making it a type <G> argument.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - Does the <P> claim to have covered all possibilities but actually doesn't?
   - No, the given string is not making a claim of complete enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - Is the <R> failing to conclusively prove the <P>?
   - Yes, the happiness of one family in the ad does not conclusively prove that everyone will be happy in the same way.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - Is the causal basis (reason) for <P> not compelling?
   - Yes, the visual happiness of one family in an ad is not a strong causal basis for the assertion.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - Is the <R> merely repeating the <P>?
   - No, the ad's reason is not just a repetition of the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - Is a disputed idea presented as universally agreed upon?
   - No, the ad does not present the idea as universally agreed upon.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - Could the language in the <PR> be taken in another sense than intended?
   - No, the language in the ad is quite direct and not ambiguous.

Based on this examination, the main defective arguments identified are:
   
- **Generalization (G)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

Thus, "A real estate ad shows a happy family moving in to the home of their dreams" can be classified under defective arguments <G>, <IR>, and <WCB>.
