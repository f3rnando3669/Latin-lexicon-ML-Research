For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to the given string "My father told me that the sky is green. So it must be the truth.", we need to decompose \( \text{IDA} \) into specific steps and then perform each step to classify the string correctly.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of \( \text{IDA} \):

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( P \))**: Determine the main assertion or statement intended to be proved.
2. **Identify the Reason (\( R \))**: Examine the causal basis or reason given for the proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Reason (\( R \))**: Check if the reason is valid, conclusive, and compelling.
4. **Classify the Argument**: Based on the analysis, classify the argument as one of the defective argument types (\( G \), \( FE \), \( IR \), \( RR \), \( WCB \), \( FU \), or \( DEP \)).

### Applying \( \text{IDAA} \):

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( P \))**:
   - The proposition in the string is: "the sky is green."

2. **Identify the Reason (\( R \))**:
   - The reason provided is: "My father told me that."

3. **Evaluate the Reason (\( R \))**:
   - We need to assess if the reason "My father told me that" is a valid, conclusive, and compelling reason to assert that "the sky is green."

4. **Classify the Argument**:
   
   Here are the possible classifications:
   
   - **Generalization (\( G \))**: This does not involve generalizing from specific instances to a broad conclusion.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (\( FE \))**: There is no enumeration of possibilities here.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \))**: It needs to be checked if the reason provided (father's assertion) conclusively supports the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \))**: The causal basis appears weak since it relies solely on the father's statement.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( RR \))**: The reason isn't just a repetition of the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (\( FU \))**: No claim of universal agreement is made.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (\( DEP \))**: There isn't any ambiguous language in how the proposition is stated.

Given these considerations, the most fitting classification for the argument is **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \))**.

### Conclusion:
The string "My father told me that the sky is green. So it must be the truth." is classified under Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \)). This is because the reason provided (father's statement) does not serve as a compelling or sufficient causal basis to assert the proposition that "the sky is green."
