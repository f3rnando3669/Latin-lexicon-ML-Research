Certainly. To apply IDAA to the task of classifying the argument "The bigger a child's shoe size, the better the child's handwriting," we need to decompose <IDA> into specific steps <D>, and then execute these steps.

### Decomposition of <IDA> into Specific Steps (D)
1. **Identify the components of the argument:**
   - Proposition (<P>).
   - Reason (<R>).
   - Proof of Reason (<PR>).

2. **Evaluate the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Is it a generalization?
   - Is it an incomplete enumeration?

3. **Evaluate the Reason (<R>):**
   - Does <R> conclusively demonstrate the correctness of <P> (<IR>)?
   - Does <R> provide a compelling causal basis (<WCB>)?
   - Does <R> merely repeat <P> (<RR>)?

4. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Is <PR> assumed to be certain based on "universal agreement" (<FU>)?
   - Is the language used in <PR> ambiguous, leading to misunderstandings (<DEP>)?

### Applying Steps to "The bigger a child's shoe size, the better the child's handwriting"

#### Step 1: Identify the components of the argument
- **Proposition (<P>):** "The bigger a child's shoe size, the better the child's handwriting."
- **Reason (<R>):** Implicitly, the underlying causal link is assumed between shoe size and handwriting skill.
- **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** There is no explicit proof provided in the statement, making this part of analysis inferred or missing.

#### Step 2: Evaluate the Proposition (<P>)
- **Generalization (<G>):** The proposition seems to be a generalization. It takes a specific observation (potentially correlated, but not necessarily causative) and applies it broadly to all children.
  
  Classification: **<G>**

#### Step 3: Evaluate the Reason (<R>)
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason assumed in the proposition (bigger shoe size leads to better handwriting) does not provide a conclusive causal link. Shoe size is not a logical or scientifically validated cause of better handwriting.
  
  Classification: **<IR>**

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal link submitted is not compelling; shoe size's relation to handwriting quality is not convincing without further evidence connecting shoe size directly to the improvement of motor skills or other relevant factors.
  
  Classification: **<WCB>**

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** There is no direct repetition in the given statement; thus, this classification does not apply.
  
  Classification: **<RR>** does not apply.

#### Step 4: Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The argument does not assume universal agreement, but rather an implicit correlation.
  
  Classification: **<FU>** does not apply.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** There is no apparent ambiguous language use; words are used in their conventional meanings.
  
  Classification: **<DEP>** does not apply.

### Conclusion
The argument "The bigger a child's shoe size, the better the child's handwriting" is primarily classified as <G> (Generalization) due to the broad application of the proposition and as <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) due to the weak, non-compelling causal link proposed.

Thus, the argument is defective based on the following classifications: **<G>, <IR>, and <WCB>**.
