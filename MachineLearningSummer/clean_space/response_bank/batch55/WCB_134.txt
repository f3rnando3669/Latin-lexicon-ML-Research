For 
To apply the process of <IDAA> to the given string "Yesterday, I walked under a ladder with an open umbrella indoors while spilling salt in front of a black cat. And I forgot to knock on wood with my lucky dice. That must be why I’m having such a bad day today. It’s bad luck.", we will decompose the task of classifying the defective argument into specific steps. Here is the step-by-step decomposition and application:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
Identify the main assertion or claim that the argument is making.
- **Proposition (<P>)**: "That must be why I’m having such a bad day today. It’s bad luck."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Identify the causal basis provided to establish the truth of the Proposition.
- **Reason (<R>)**: "Yesterday, I walked under a ladder with an open umbrella indoors while spilling salt in front of a black cat. And I forgot to knock on wood with my lucky dice."

### Step 3: Consider the Types of Defective Arguments
Analyze the identified Proposition and Reason to determine if they fit into any of the specified defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>):

#### Step 3.1: Check for <G> (Generalization)
- A <P> that refers to a generalization not universally applicable.
- **Assessment**: The proposition is not a generalization but a specific claim about the speaker's bad day being caused by actions considered to give bad luck.

#### Step 3.2: Check for <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)
- A <P> that claims complete enumeration but misses some pertinent possibilities.
- **Assessment**: The proposition does not claim complete enumeration of all possible reasons for a bad day; it merely mentions some superstitious acts.

#### Step 3.3: Check for <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)
- An <R> that does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the <P>.
- **Assessment**: The Reason (superstitious activities) does not conclusively demonstrate that these actions are the cause of having a bad day—it is based on superstition, not conclusive evidence.

#### Step 3.4: Check for <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)
- A <R> where the causal basis is not compelling.
- **Assessment**: The Reason is based on superstitions (non-scientific beliefs), which are not a compelling causal basis.

#### Step 3.5: Check for <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)
- A <R> that restates the <P> in different wording.
- **Assessment**: The Reason is not simply a repetition of the Proposition; it lists specific actions.

#### Step 3.6: Check for <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)
- A <PR> assumed certain because it is universally agreed upon while still in dispute.
- **Assessment**: There is no proof relied on the consensus here.

#### Step 3.7: Check for <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)
- A <PR> that can be taken in another sense than intended.
- **Assessment**: The language does not appear ambiguous.

### Step 4: Conclude Classification
Determine which defective argument type best fits based on the analysis.

Given the detailed analysis of the Reason not providing conclusive proof and being based on non-compelling superstitious beliefs, the defective argument types that best fit are:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**

### Conclusion:
The string "Yesterday, I walked under a ladder with an open umbrella indoors while spilling salt in front of a black cat. And I forgot to knock on wood with my lucky dice. That must be why I’m having such a bad day today. It’s bad luck." is classified as a defective argument of type <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
