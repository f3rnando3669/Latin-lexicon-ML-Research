For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a string as a defective argument type) to the string "The two courses I took at UWI were not very interesting. I don't think it's a good university," we will break down the advanced task (IDA) step by step.

Step-by-step decomposition:

1. **Identify Proposition (<P>):**
   - The proposition is the claim being made.
   - "<P>: I don't think [UWI] is a good university."

2. **Identify Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason is the causal basis presented for the proposition.
   - "<R>: The two courses I took at UWI were not very interesting."

3. **Determine if the Argument is Defective:**
   - We need to evaluate whether the argument type falls into any of the defective categories: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:**
   - Analyze the connection between the proposition and the reason to identify the specific defect.
   
   - Let's evaluate each type:
   
     **Generalization (<G>):**
     - Is the <P> based on a limited part and applied to the whole?
     - Yes, the proposition is based on the author's experience with just two courses and generalized to the entire university.

     **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
     - Does the <P> claim to enumerate all possibilities but miss some important ones?
     - Not applicable here as the proposition does not enumerate multiple reasons.

     **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
     - Does the <R> fail to conclusively demonstrate the <P>?
     - Yes, the experiences from just two courses may not conclusively prove the quality of the entire university.

     **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
     - Is the causal basis weak or non-compelling for the <P>?
     - Yes, experiencing two uninteresting courses out of potentially hundreds does not strongly substantiate the proposition about the entire university.

     **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
     - Does the <R> merely repeat the <P> without adding new information?
     - Not applicable here as the reason is not a repetition.

     **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
     - Does the <PR> rely on assumed universal agreement?
     - Not applicable here as there's no claim of universal agreement in the argument.

     **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
     - Can the language of the <PR> be taken differently than intended?
     - Not applicable here as the ambiguity of language is not a factor.

5. **Choose the Most Relevant Classification:**
   - Each defective type might seem to apply, but we must choose the most fitting primary fault.

Conclusions:
- The primary defects in this argument are Generalization (<G>) and Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).
- Both <G> and <WCB> are closely connected because generalizations often come from an insufficient causal basis; however, since Generalization is more specific to the argument's nature (making a sweeping statement about the university based on two courses), we classify it as follows:

Final classification:
- **Generalization (<G>)**

Thus, according to IDAA, the string "The two courses I took at UWI were not very interesting. I don't think it's a good university," is classified primarily as a defective argument of type Generalization (<G>).
