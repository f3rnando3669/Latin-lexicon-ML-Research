For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying the string as a type of defective argument step by step) to the given passage, we need to break down the task of identifying the specific type of defective argument in the passage. Here’s the step-by-step decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Examine the statement to identify the main assertion or claim that is being made.
   - In this case, "Laura is the class president" and "the class should plan a race instead" are key propositions.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Look for reasons provided to support the Propositions (P(s)).
   - Here, the reason given for changing the proposition to "plan a race instead" is that "a group of girls that she doesn't like also support the idea of a dance as a fundraiser."

3. **Identify the Proof(s) of Reason (PR):**
   - Check for any proofs or additional arguments that corroborate the Reason (R).
   - In this passage, no additional arguments or proofs are provided for why not liking the girls influences the decision.

4. **Analyze the Argument for Defective Types:**
   - Compare the identified parts with the known defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).
   - Determine which type(s) of defective arguments the passage contains.

Let's go through this step-by-step for the given passage:

**Step 1: Identify the Propositions (P):**
- P1: "Laura is the class president."
- P2: "The class should sponsor a dance as a fundraiser."
- P3: "The class should plan a race instead."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R):**
- R1: "A group of girls that she doesn’t like also support the idea of a dance as a fundraiser."

**Step 3: Identify the Proof(s) of Reason (PR):**
- No additional arguments or evidence are provided to substantiate why not liking the girls should affect the decision on the fundraiser.

**Step 4: Analyze the Argument for Defective Types:**
- G (Generalization): Not applicable here as it doesn’t generalize based on some part or majority to all.
- FE (Incomplete Enumeration): Not applicable since there’s no claim to have listed all possibilities.
- IR (Inconclusive Reason): The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate why the class should plan a race instead of a dance. It is based on a personal dislike, which is insufficient to justify the decision.
- WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis): The causal basis here is indeed weak. The reason "Laura doesn’t like the group of girls" is not compelling enough to motivate the change from a dance to a race.
- RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition): Not applicable as the reason and the proposition are not identical.
- FU (Presumptuous Consensus): Not applicable because there is no assertion that it is universally agreed upon.
- DEP (Ambiguous Language Use): Not applicable here as there is no use of ambiguous terms.

Upon analyzing with the steps provided, the defective argument types present in the passage are **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The given reasoning does not sufficiently support the proposed change in activity.

Thus, "Laura is the class president. She believes that the class should sponsor a dance as a fundraiser. Then she learns that a group of girls that she doesn't like also support the idea of a dance as a fundraiser. So, Laura changes her mind and decides that the class should plan a race instead." is an instance of both **IR (Inconclusive Reason)** and **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
