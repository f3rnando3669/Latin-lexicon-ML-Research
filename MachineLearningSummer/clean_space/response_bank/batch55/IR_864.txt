For 
Let's apply the decomposition of the task <IDA> to classify the given argument string step by step.

Here’s the given string:  
"A father tells his son not to start smoking as he will regret it when he is older, and the son points out that his father is a smoker. This does not alter the fact that his son may regret smoking when he is older."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition <D> of <IDA>:
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - What is the main claim or assertion in the argument?  
     **Proposition (<P>)**: "The son should not start smoking as he will regret it when he is older."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - What is the causal basis offered to support the proposition?  
     **Reason (<R>)**: "He will regret it when he is older."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - What additional argument(s) or evidence is provided to corroborate the reason?  
     There doesn’t seem to be a clear <PR> in the given string, meaning there is no additional argument to corroborate the reason explicitly stated.

4. **Evaluate for Defective Argument Types**:
   - Look for any signs of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP> in the argument:

     - **Generalization (<G>)**: Not directly applicable here as there is no generalizing statement.
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not applicable because no enumeration of possibilities is attempted.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Potentially relevant because the reason "he will regret it when he is older" might not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition without further evidence.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This might be relevant since "he will regret it" lacks a compelling causal basis without further evidence or elaboration.
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Not applicable because the reason is not a repetition of the proposition.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Not directly applicable as it doesn't assume something is universally agreed upon.
     - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: There doesn’t seem to be any significant ambiguity in the language used.

5. **Classify the Argument Defect**:
   - Considering the evaluations, the most fitting classifications are:
     - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This is because the reason given ("he will regret it when he is older") is not conclusively proven just by the assertion.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This is because the causal basis ("he will regret it when he is older") provided for the proposition is weak without further explanation or evidence.

### Conclusion:
The given string can be classified as containing **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and potentially **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
