For 
To apply **IDAA** (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types into specific steps) to the given example, we will decompose the task into clear steps and then carry out the classification.

### Steps for IDAA:
1. **Identify the Proposition \([P]\)**: Determine what the main assertion (Proposition) is in the string.
2. **Identify the Reason \([R]\)**: Determine the Reason given to support the Proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason \([PR]\)**: Determine any Proof of the Reason given.
4. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types**:
   - Determine if the argument fits any of the defective argument types (\([G], [FE], [IR], [RR], [WCB], [FU], [DEP]\)).
5. **Classify the Argument**: Based on the identification and analysis, classify the string as one of the defective argument types if applicable.

### Given String:
"Katie likes to read and would rather do that than play sports. Her friends make fun of her and tell her that reading is for nerds. Katie stops reading so much and starts to play sports more."

### Step-by-Step Application:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition \([P]\)
The main assertion is: "Katie stops reading so much and starts to play sports more."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason \([R]\)
The Reason given for this change is: "Her friends make fun of her and tell her that reading is for nerds."

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason \([PR]\)
There isn't an explicit Proof of Reason provided in this example beyond the peer pressure argument.

#### Step 4: Analyze for Defective Argument Types
   - **[G] Generalization**: Not applicable. The argument does not make a broad generalization.
   - **[FE] Incomplete Enumeration**: Not applicable. The argument does not attempt an enumeration of possibilities.
   - **[IR] Inconclusive Reason**: Potentially applicable. The reason ("friends make fun of her and say reading is for nerds") does not conclusively demonstrate why Katie should stop reading and start playing sports more; it implies social pressure rather than a compelling reason.
   - **[RR] Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: Not applicable. The Reason and the Proposition are not repetitions of each other.
   - **[WCB] Insufficient Causal Basis**: Applicable. The causal basis ("friends make fun of her") is weak and not compelling enough to justify the change in behavior.
   - **[FU] Presumptuous Consensus**: Not applicable. The argument does not assume universality or a consensus.
   - **[DEP] Ambiguous Language Use**: Not applicable. The language used does not seem ambiguous and is relatively straightforward.

#### Step 5: Classify the Argument
Given the analysis, the most fitting defective argument types are [IR] - Inconclusive Reason and [WCB] - Insufficient Causal Basis:
- **Inconclusive Reason \([IR]\)**: The reason given (peer pressure) does not fully justify the change in behavior.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis \([WCB]\)**: The reason (peer pressure) is weak and not a compelling argument for why Katie should stop reading and start playing sports.

Thus, "Katie stops reading so much and starts to play sports more" due to her friends making fun of her can be classified as both an **Inconclusive Reason \([IR]\)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis \([WCB]\)** defective argument.
