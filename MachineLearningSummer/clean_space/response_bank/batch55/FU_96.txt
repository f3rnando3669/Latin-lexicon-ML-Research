For 
To apply \( IDAA \) (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as a defective argument type) to the statement "Over 99 billion people served…", we can follow these specific steps:

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Identify the Proposition (\(P\)):**
    - The proposition in the statement "Over 99 billion people served…" is that a substantial number of people, specifically over 99 billion, have been served.

2. **Determine the Reason (\(R\)):**
    - The reason, if implied, might be that serving over 99 billion people indicates widespread success or approval of the service/product.

3. **Assess Proof of Reason (\(PR\)):**
    - Check for supporting evidence or arguments that corroborate the reason. In this case, the statement doesn't provide additional proof of the claim.

4. **Classify the Argument Using Defective Argument Types:**
    - **Generalization (\(G\)):** The statement is not basing itself on a representative sample but on a very large number.
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (\(FE\)):** The statement doesn't enumerate possibilities, so this type doesn't apply.
    - **Inconclusive Reason (\(IR\)):** The statement doesn’t present a reason; it merely makes an assertion.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(WCB\)):** This could be applicable if "served" is assumed to imply satisfaction or approval without a strong basis.
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(RR\)):** There is no repetition; it’s a simple assertion.
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (\(FU\)):** It doesn’t claim universal agreement but rather states a statistical figure.
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (\(DEP\)):** The term "served" could have different interpretations (e.g., served once or multiple servings).

### Conclusion:

- **Ambiguous Language Use (\(DEP\))** seems the most fitting category. The phrase "Over 99 billion people served…" can be taken in another sense than the speaker might intend. For example, it might mean individual servings rather than unique individuals served.

### Final Classification:

The statement "Over 99 billion people served…" should be classified as \( DEP \) (Ambiguous Language Use) because the term "served" is ambiguous and can be interpreted in different ways.
