For 
To apply the task IDAA (decomposition of the classification task IDA into steps) to the given sentence "Our garage sale made lots of money before Joan showed up. Obviously, she scared off all the customers," we'll break it down into specific steps to classify the type of defective argument.

Step 1: **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition (<P>): "Joan scared off all the customers."

Step 2: **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason (<R>): "Our garage sale made lots of money before Joan showed up."

Step 3: **Analyze the Reason (<R>):**
   - Check if the Reason (<R>) provides conclusive support for the Proposition (<P>).
   - Evaluate whether the causal basis for <P> is sufficiently compelling.
   - Examine if there is any ambiguity or repetition in the Reason (<R>).

Step 4: **Classify the type of defective argument:**
   - Generalization (<G>): Checking if the proposition is based on insufficient or non-representative sampling.
   - Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>): Checking if all pertinent possibilities are considered.
   - Inconclusive Reason (<IR>): Checking if the Reason <R> inconclusively demonstrates <P>.
   - Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>): Checking if the causal basis is weak.
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>): Checking if the Reason <R> repeats <P>.
   - Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>): Checking if the proof assumes universal agreement.
   - Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>): Checking for ambiguous language.

Proceeding step by step:

**Step 1 - Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The proposition is: "Joan scared off all the customers."

**Step 2 - Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason given is: "Our garage sale made lots of money before Joan showed up."

**Step 3 - Analyze the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine if the Reason (<R>) conclusively supports the Proposition (<P>).
   - The Reason (<R>) suggests a correlation but does not provide a concrete causal relationship.
   - Possible ambiguities: "scared off all the customers" and "made lots of money before Joan showed up" do not causally connect in a clear manner.

**Step 4 - Classify the type of defective argument:**
   - Generalization (<G>): Not applicable here, as the proposition isnâ€™t based on insufficient sampling but rather a specific individual.
   - Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>): Not applicable since all possible reasons for the effect are not listed nor discussed.
   - Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), and Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>): We need to focus on these. We observe that the reason does not strongly support the proposition causally.
   
   By process of elimination and examination:

**Conclusion:** The Reason (<R>) provided is weak and fails to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition (<P>). Thus, this argument is best classified as either an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** or **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. To be precise:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The Reason <R> ("Our garage sale made lots of money before Joan showed up") is not a compelling basis to assert that Joan scared off all the customers.

Therefore, the argument demonstrates a defective argument type of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
