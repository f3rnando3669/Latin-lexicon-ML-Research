To apply the task of decomposing the classification of the string "Which fallacy is used to attack a person's character" into specific steps, we need to first identify what this task entails in the context of classifying defective arguments. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDAA> (Decomposition of Advanced Task into Specific Steps for the Task of Identifying Defective Argument):

#### Step 1: Understand the String <s>
- Here, the string <s> is: "Which fallacy is used to attack a person's character?"

#### Step 2: Determine Relevance to Defective Argument Types 
- We need to consider how this question relates to the defective argument types defined (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP).

#### Step 3: Identify the Nature of the Question
- The question pertains to a specific type of fallacy used in argumentation.
- More specifically, the question is asking about a fallacy that attacks a person's character, which is not directly one of the defective argument types defined (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP).

#### Step 4: Cross-Reference with Known Fallacies 
- Recall that an "argument ad hominem" is a fallacy where an argument attacks the character of a person instead of addressing the actual topic.
- This fallacy is well known but is not strictly one of the defective argument types listed in the definitions provided.

#### Step 5: Consider Potential Classification
- None of the defective arguments defined (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP) explicitly mention attacking a person's character.
- Therefore, it is likely that "argument ad hominem" falls outside the spectrum of defective arguments defined above.

#### Step 6: Conclude Appropriate Classification
- Based on the specific nature of the question, it suggests a fallacy type that is traditionally known but not listed. Therefore, the string does not neatly fit into the existing categories of defective arguments (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP).

#### Step 7: Communicate Conclusions
- The question "Which fallacy is used to attack a person's character?" refers to a fallacy traditionally known as "argument ad hominem," which is not among our previously defined defective argument types. 

### Summary 
The decomposition of the task shows that the fallacy in question here is "argument ad hominem" and not "G", "FE", "IR", "WCB", "RR", "FU", or "DEP". The classification of the string falls under an external category of argument-based fallacies and not under the internal categories provided by the given defective argument types.
