Certainly! To apply \(<IDAA>\) to the statement "I didn’t steal your pen—I borrowed it," we will decompose the task of classifying the argument defect into specific steps. Assuming an advanced classification task \(<IDA>\), let's break it into steps essentially representing the decomposition \(<D>\).

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of \(<IDA>\):

1. **Identify the Proposition (\(<P>\))**:
   - Define the statement or assertion that is being made.

2. **Identify the Reason (\(<R>\))**:
   - Look for the causal basis or justification given for the proposition.

3. **Determine the Type of Defective Argument (\(<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>)**:
   - Evaluate whether the identified proposition and reason fit any of the known defective argument types.

### Applying Steps to the Given Statement:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\(<P>\))**:
   - The proposition \(<P>\) in the statement is: "I didn’t steal your pen."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (\(<R>\))**:
   - The reason \(<R>\) provided is: "I borrowed it."

**Step 3: Determine the Type of Defective Argument**:
   - Now we will evaluate whether the argument fits into any of the defective argument types.

### Evaluations:

1. **Generalization (\(<G>\))**: 
   - This does not seem to be a generalization type as the argument is related to a specific incident rather than making a broad claim about many cases.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\(<FE>\))**: 
   - This argument does not list possibilities or claim a complete enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (\(<IR>\))**: 
   - The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition that there was no theft. Borrowing, unless agreed upon or understood within a shared context, might still be considered theft by the owner.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(<WCB>\))**: 
   - The reason "I borrowed it" might not be compelling enough as a casual basis without context or agreement, making it possibly an insufficient causal basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(<RR>\))**: 
   - The reason does not merely echo the proposition but provides an additional claim ("borrowed" versus "stole").

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\(<FU>\))**: 
   - The argument doesn't assume consensus but rather makes a direct claim about the nature of the action.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\(<DEP>\))**: 
   - The terms "steal" and "borrow" can be considered to have an ambiguous context here. "Borrow" implies returning, but without immediate context or consent from the other party, it might still be interpreted as an involuntary action akin to "stealing."

### Conclusion:
- After evaluation, the defective argument type that most closely fits is **Ambiguous Language Use (\(<DEP>\))**.

Therefore, applying \(<IDAA>\) to the statement "I didn’t steal your pen—I borrowed it" classifies it as \(<DEP>\), indicating that the proof of reason involves ambiguous language, potentially creating misunderstanding about the nature and intent of the action described (borrowing vs. stealing).
