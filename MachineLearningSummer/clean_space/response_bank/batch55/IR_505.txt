For 
To apply the task of classifying the given argument (IDA) to the string provided using the method of decomposition (IDAA), we need to take the following steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D)

1. **Identify Proposition (<P>):** Determine the assertion being made.
2. **Identify Reason (<R>):** Identify the causal basis or reasons given for the proposition.
3. **Identify Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Determine if there are any additional arguments or corroborations presented.
4. **Evaluate Defective Argument Types:** Assess if the argument fits any of the defective argument categories <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.
5. **Classify the Argument (IDA):** Based on the evaluation, classify the argument into one of the defective types.

### Application to the Given String

#### Step 1: Identify Proposition (<P>)

The proposition is:
- "A politician arguing that his opponent cannot possibly be a good choice for women."

#### Step 2: Identify Reason (<R>)

The reason provided is:
- "Because he has been married and divorced five times."

#### Step 3: Identify Proof of Reason (<PR>)

In this argument, there isn't an explicit proof of reason provided beyond the stated reason. 

#### Step 4: Evaluate Defective Argument Types

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: 
   - Not applicable. The argument doesn't rely on a generalization from a part to the whole.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: 
   - Not applicable. The argument isn't making a complete enumeration of possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - This seems applicable. The reason given (divorced five times) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (opponent is not a good choice for women), because multiple factors determine one's suitability for women voters, and being divorced is not necessarily indicative of one's policies or capabilities.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - This also seems applicable. The causal basis given (divorce history) is weak and not compelling as evidence of the opponent's ability to serve the interests of women.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - Not applicable. The reason is not a repetition of the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - Not applicable. The argument does not assume consensus as a basis for the reason.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
   - Not applicable. The argument is not based on ambiguous language usage.

#### Step 5: Classify the Argument (IDA)

Based on the evaluation, the argument fits the categories of **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.

### Conclusion

The classification of the string "A politician arguing that his opponent cannot possibly be a good choice for women because he has been married and divorced five times." fits the defective argument types of **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** and **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
