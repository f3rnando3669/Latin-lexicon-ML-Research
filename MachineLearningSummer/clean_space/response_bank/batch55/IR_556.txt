For 
To apply **IDAA** (which is the decomposition of **IDA** into specific steps) to the given statement ("Do not listen to Luisa, she will only tell you lies about the recent activities given in our EAPP class."), we need to identify the steps involved in decomposing the task of classifying the statement as one of the defective argument types.

Here are the steps we will take:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):** Determine the main claim or assertion made in the statement.
2. **Identify the Reason (R):** Identify the causal basis or supporting reason given in the statement for the Proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):** Determine if there is additional corroborative evidence or argument provided to strengthen the Reason.
4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:** Based on the definitions of defective argument types, classify the statement into one of the predefined defective types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

Let's apply these steps to the given statement:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P).**
The main claim in the statement is:
- "Do not listen to Luisa."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R).**
The causal basis or supporting reason given for the Proposition is:
- "she will only tell you lies about the recent activities given in our EAPP class."

**Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR).**
There is no additional corroborative evidence or argument provided to strengthen the Reason in this statement.

**Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type.**
We now classify the statement based on the nature of its Proposition, Reason, and lack of Proof of Reason:

- **Generalization (G):** The statement does not make a broad generalization based on insufficient data.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The statement does not make a complete enumeration claim and miss out pertinent ones.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason given ("she will only tell you lies") does not conclusively demonstrate that Luisa should not be listened to. It is an assertion without evidence.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The statement cites a reason (Luisa telling lies) but does not provide compelling evidence.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The Reason does not merely repeat the Proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The Reason does not rely on a presumed consensus.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The Reason ("she will only tell you lies") is clear in its intent and not ambiguous.

Given the analysis, the most fitting classification, based on the definitions provided, is:

**Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The Reason given ("she will only tell you lies") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition ("Do not listen to Luisa"). The statement lacks evidence to prove the assertion that Luisa will lie about recent activities in the EAPP class.

### Conclusion:
The statement "Do not listen to Luisa, she will only tell you lies about the recent activities given in our EAPP class." is classified as having an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, according to the framework provided.
