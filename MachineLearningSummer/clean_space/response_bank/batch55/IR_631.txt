For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string, which involves classifying it as one of the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>, we need to break the task down into specific steps. Here is the decomposition of <D> for this task:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):** Determine the main claim or assertion being made.
   
2. **Identify the Reason (R):** Identify the causal basis or reasoning provided to support the Proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):** Detect any further arguments that corroborate the Reason.

4. **Classify the Argument:**
    - Analyze the identified Proposition (P), Reason (R), and Proof of Reason (PR) to determine if they fall under any defective argument types.
    - Compare these components against definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

Let's apply these steps to the given string:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The main claim seems to be: 
"Jeannette knows that her memory is great, and she will remember the terms just from having heard them mentioned in class."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reasoning provided is:
"Because of her excellent memory, she got through high school without studying."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
There may be no explicit further proof provided beyond the reasoning that she got through high school without studying due to her memory.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
Now we classify according to defective types:

- **Generalization (G):** Is Jeannette’s assertion based on some parts or a majority but not necessarily applicable to all?
  - Jeannette got through high school with her memory without studying, but this does not necessarily apply to college-level exams. This might imply Generalization, but let's see if it fits better with another category.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Is there an incomplete enumeration of possibilities?
  - No, this doesn't seem to fit here.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does the Reason conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition?
  - The Reason ("she got through high school due to her memory") does not conclusively demonstrate that she will remember over 200 terms just from hearing them mentioned in class. Real-life scenarios like increased difficulty of college, different subject matter, etc., are not accounted for.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the Reason weak because the causal basis is not compelling?
  - Yes, her performance in high school does not provide a compelling causal basis for her success in college exams without studying.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Is the Reason just a repetition of the Proposition?
  - No, the Reason provides additional information.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Is there an assumption of universal agreement?
  - No evidence of this.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Can the Proof of Reason be taken in another sense?
  - No, the language is quite clear.

### Conclusion:
The argument at hand is primarily displaying characteristics of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. However, the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness and lacks a compelling causal basis more strongly aligns it with <WCB>. Therefore, the more fitting classification is:
   
**<WCB> – Insufficient Causal Basis**

Jeannette’s reliance on her memory from high school as a causal basis for believing she can succeed in her college exam without studying is not compelling. Thus, the argument is classified as <WCB>.
