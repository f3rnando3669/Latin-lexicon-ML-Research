For 
To apply the task of <IDAA> to "Moving the goalposts or making up exceptions when a claim is shown to be false," we need to systematically decompose the advanced task of identifying the defective argument <IDA> into specific steps. Here’s how we can approach this:

### Step 1: Understand the Advanced Task (<t>)
- Here, the advanced task <t> is "identifying the defective argument within the given string 'Moving the goalposts or making up exceptions when a claim is shown to be false.'"

### Step 2: Decomposition (<D>)
- Decompose <t> into specific steps:
  1. **Parse the string** to understand its meaning and context.
  2. **Identify key elements** of the defective argument as per the definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.
  3. **Match the string** to one of the defined defective argument types based on the key elements identified.

### Step 3: Application of Decomposition to Identification Task (<IDAA>)
- Apply the decomposition to the string:

#### Step 3.1: Parse the String
- **String**: "Moving the goalposts or making up exceptions when a claim is shown to be false."
- **Context**: This phrase describes a scenario where, upon the claim being demonstrated incorrect, the criteria for truth are altered or exceptions are added to avoid accepting the falsehood.

#### Step 3.2: Identify Key Elements
- **Key Elements**:
  - **Action described**: Modifying criteria or adding exceptions.
  - **Condition for action**: When a claim is demonstrated to be false.

#### Step 3.3: Match the String to Defective Argument Types
1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Not applicable as this involves applying a general statement to all cases.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not directly applicable, as this involves leaving out possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Not applicable, as this involves a failing reason to conclusively support a proposition.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Not applicable, as the original reason’s strength is not the focus here.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Not applicable, as this is not about repeating the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Not applicable, as this involves assuming universal agreement.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: While there can be ambiguity if definitions shift, the focus here is not primarily about language ambiguity.

After evaluating each, the concept most closely aligns with continuously altering criteria or exceptions to a claim in the face of falsification. This involves expanding limits or altering the basis for claiming correctness or truth. This scenario most directly fits the pattern of creating more exceptions deliberately to avoid accepting fault which resembles:

**Moving the goalposts**:

#### Conclusion:
The given string "Moving the goalposts or making up exceptions when a claim is shown to be false" could suggest a sort of ongoing re-tuning of criteria which aligns significantly with <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), as it describes avoiding a definitive resolution or conclusion by changing the goals or exceptions post-falsification of the claim.

Though <IR> doesn't encompass the whole detail, a closer categorization for the phrase:

**Updated Category**: It resembles a sort of informal fallacy, not exhaustively detailed in original set, but close to `Special Pleading` (under examined scenarios).

##### Final Output:
- **Defective Argument Type**: Closely aligning to **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** though more towards informal fallacy (Special Pleading) adjusting standards.
