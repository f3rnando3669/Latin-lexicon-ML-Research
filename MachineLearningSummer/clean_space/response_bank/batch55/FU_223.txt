For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "Why should you feel guilty for seeking your own happiness when that's what everyone else is doing, too?" we first need to break down the advanced task <IDA> (classifying the string as one of the defective argument types) into specific steps. Hereâ€™s how we can decompose and apply <IDA> step-by-step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The given string is a rhetorical question, but we can infer the proposition it implies:
**Proposition (<P>):** You should not feel guilty for seeking your own happiness.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Next, we identify the reason given to support this proposition:
**Reason (<R>):** Everyone else is also seeking their own happiness.

### Step 3: Determine the Defective Argument Type
Now we need to classify <s> into one of the defective argument types. Let's go through them one by one:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** Is the proposition a general assertion based on one part or a majority but not all?
   - No, the <P> does not directly make a generalization applicable to all.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Does the proposition assume a complete list of possibilities, but miss some?
   - No, the argument doesn't involve listing possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Does <R> fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of <P>?
   - This could be a candidate, but let's consider other types to be certain.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Is the causal basis insufficient or weak?
   - This is also a possibility because the causal link might be weak.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Is <R> just a repetition of <P>?
   - No, <R> and <P> are not the same.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Is the proof assumed certain based on universal agreement without evidence?
   - Yes, saying "everyone else is doing it" as a reason assumes a form of universal agreement without providing actual proof.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Can the argument be interpreted in another sense than intended?
   - No, the language used is quite clear and direct.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument
Based on the filtered choices, the most fitting classification seems to be:

**Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This argument presumes that because "everyone else is doing it", it must be an acceptable action, assuming universal agreement without actual evidence.

### Conclusion
Therefore, when we apply <IDAA> to "Why should you feel guilty for seeking your own happiness when that's what everyone else is doing, too?", we classify it as <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).
