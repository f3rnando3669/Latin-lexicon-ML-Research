For 
To apply \(\text{IDAA}\) to the argument given, "Every person is either my enemy or my friend. If they are my enemy I should hate them. If they are my friend I should love them. So I should either love them or hate them," we need to decompose the task of classifying the statement into specific steps and then apply each step systematically. Let's carry out this decomposition step-by-step:


**Step 1: Identify the Propositions (\(<P>\))**

The given argument contains several propositions:
1. Every person is either my enemy or my friend. (\(<P1>\))
2. If they are my enemy I should hate them. (\(<P2>\))
3. If they are my friend I should love them. (\(<P3>\))
4. So I should either love them or hate them. (\(<P4>\))

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (\(<R>\))**

The causal basis for the propositions can be outlined as follows:
1. If someone is my enemy, it justifies hatred. (\(<R2>\) corresponding to \((P2\)))
2. If someone is my friend, it justifies love. (\(<R3>\) corresponding to \((P3\)))

**Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (\(<PR>\))**

The argument attempts to use the propositions and their corresponding reasons to lead to the final conclusion (\(<P4>\)):
- \((PR1)\): Everyone can be classified into friend or enemy, based on \(P1\).
- \((PR2)\): If enemy then hate, if friend then love, hence each person is either someone to be loved or hated.

**Step 4: Evaluate Each Component for Defectiveness**

We will classify each component to check if it corresponds to any of the defective argument types (\(\text{G}\), \(\text{FE}\), \(\text{IR}\), \(\text{RR}\), \(\text{WCB}\), \(\text{FU}\), \(\text{DEP}\)).

1. **Examine Propositions**:
   - \((P1)\) may be evaluated for Generalization (\(\text{G}\)) because it asserts that every person is either a friend or enemy, potentially ignoring complexities of human relationships.
   - None of the propositions here seem to exhibit Incomplete Enumeration (\(\text{FE}\)), since the argument does not attempt to enumerate all possibilities exhaustively but simplifies it to friend/enemy.

2. **Examine Reason (\(R\)) and Proof of Reason (\(PR\))**:
   - \((R2)\) and \((R3)\): These reasons plausibly lead to \((P2)\) and \((P3)\) respectively, but doesn't fully demonstrate the correctness of \(P1\). Check for Inconclusive Reason (\(\text{IR}\)) and Insufficient Causal Basis (\(\text{WCB}\)).
   - \((PR1)\): This is a potentially Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(\text{RR}\)) because it essentially reasserts \(P1\) without additional justifying evidence.
   - \((PR2)\): This might appear sensible, but it presumes a binary classification that can be debated. Check for Presumptuous Consensus (\(\text{FU}\)), although not claiming universal agreement, it's dogmatically treating \(P1\) as logical truth.
 
3. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (\(\text{DEP}\))**:
   - The language of love/hate and friend/enemy may have nuanced interpretations, but the argument seems straightforward in the utilized context without involving ambiguity.
 
**Step 5: Conclude the Classification**

Based on this assessment:
- \((P1)\) successfully classifies the entire argument under Generalization (\(\text{G}\)): It oversimplifies human relationships into binary categories.
- \((PR1)\) could also be categorized under Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(\text{RR}\)): It restates the original proposition without further support.

Therefore, the overall argument could primarily be classified under \(\text{G}\) due to the generalized nature of the proposition, complemented by elements of \(\text{RR}\).

**Classification Outcome**
The argument "Every person is either my enemy or my friend. If they are my enemy I should hate them. If they are my friend I should love them. So I should either love them or hate them," can be classified as:

- \(\text{G}\) (Generalization)
- \(\text{RR}\) (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)
