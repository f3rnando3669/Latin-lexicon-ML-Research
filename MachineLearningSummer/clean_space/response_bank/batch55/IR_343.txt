For 
To apply the process of IDAA (which involves decomposing the task of IDA into specific steps) to classify the given string, we'll follow a structured approach.

**String to classify:**
"Because you found something difficult to understand, or are unaware of how it works, you made out like it is probably not true."

**Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of the Task (IDA):**

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**  
   The proposition is a statement set forth summarily what is intended to be proved.
   - In this string, the implied proposition is: "It is probably not true."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**  
   The reason provides the causal basis for the proposition.
   - The reason given is: "Because you found something difficult to understand, or are unaware of how it works."

3. **Determine if the Reason (R) is conclusive and provides sufficient causal basis for the Proposition (P):**
   - Here, the reason given suggests that the lack of understanding or awareness is enough to doubt the truth of the proposition.
   - Let's check if this reasoning addresses the inventory of potential flaws specified in IDA:

4. **Match the Reason (R) and Proposition (P) against Defective Argument Types:**
   
   - **Generalization (G):** Is the proposition based on limited evidence and applied broadly?
     - No. The issue is not about applying a limited observation to a broad context.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Does it claim to cover all possibilities but misses some?
     - No. The argument does not claim completeness.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does the Reason fail to convincingly establish the proposition?
     - There is a strong case here. Finding something difficult to understand or being unaware does not conclusively make it untrue. Hence, the Reason (R) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition (P).

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the causal basis weak?
     - Yes, being unaware or finding something difficult does not provide a strong causal basis to claim something is probably not true.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Does the Reason merely repeat the Proposition?
     - No. The reason does not repeat the proposition.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Is there an assumption of universal agreement?
     - No mention of universal agreement is made.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Could the Proof of Reason be understood differently than intended?
     - No specific ambiguity in the language of Reason or Proposition affecting understanding.

5. **Classify the String (s):**  
Upon careful consideration, the argument can be classified primarily under **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** and **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.

**Conclusion:**
The string "Because you found something difficult to understand, or are unaware of how it works, you made out like it is probably not true" is classified as **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** because the reason given does not conclusively prove the proposition. It also falls under **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)** because the causal basis (difficulty or lack of awareness) is weak and not compelling for the proposition that something is probably not true.
