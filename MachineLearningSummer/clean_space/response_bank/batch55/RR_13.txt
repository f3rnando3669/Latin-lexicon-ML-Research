For 
Applying <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying an argument) to the given string involves breaking down the process into specific steps that will determine which type of defective argument the string represents. Let's go step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Proposition (<P>)
Identify the main assertion or proposition set forth in the argument. In the given string:

"You would think that taxes should be lowered because you are a Republican [and therefore your argument about taxes should be rejected]."

Here, the proposition <P> can be interpreted as:
- "Taxes should be lowered."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Identify the reason given to establish the truth of the proposition.

In the string:

"You would think that taxes should be lowered because you are a Republican [and therefore your argument about taxes should be rejected]."

The reason <R> is:
- "Because you are a Republican."

### Step 3: Check for Proof of Reason (<PR>)
Determine if there is any proof or additional arguments provided to corroborate the reason.

In the string provided, there is no additional argument or proof provided to support the reason. The reason given relies entirely on the assumption about being a Republican.

### Step 4: Evaluate for Defective Argument Types

- **Generalization (<G>):** This would involve making a general assertion based on limited evidence. There is no indication that this is a generalization error.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This would involve claiming a complete enumeration of possibilities but missing some. This type doesn't seem relevant here.
  
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This applies if the reason does not support the proposition conclusively. The argument states that taxes should be lowered because the speaker is a Republican, but this reason alone does not demonstrate why taxes should be lowered.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This applies if the reason is weak or not compelling. The argument's reason (being a Republican) is not a compelling causal basis for the proposition.
  
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This involves the reason simply restating the proposition. The reason here is different from the proposition, so this type doesn't apply.
  
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This applies if the proof assumes consensus that does not exist. The string doesn't reference any consensus or presumed universal agreement.
  
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** This involves the proof being taken in another sense than intended. There doesn't appear to be any ambiguous language in terms of different possible meanings here.

### Step 5: Classify the Argument
Based on the evaluation, the string most closely matches with two defective argument types: Inconclusive Reason (<IR>) and Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).

### Final Step: Conclusion
To precisely classify <s>:

The argument "You would think that taxes should be lowered because you are a Republican [and therefore your argument about taxes should be rejected]." primarily suffers from an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the reason given does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. It could also be considered as having an **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because the reason provided is not a compelling basis for the proposition.

Therefore, the conclusion of applying <IDAA> is that the argument provided is classified under **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**.
