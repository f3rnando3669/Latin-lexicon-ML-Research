For 
Certainly! Let's apply **IDAA** to the statement:

**Statement:** "There aren’t any good restaurants in Sydney; I tried two and they were both horrible."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Classification

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- Proposition (<P>): "There aren’t any good restaurants in Sydney."

#### Step 2: Determine the Reason (<R>)
- Reason (<R>): "I tried two and they were both horrible."

#### Step 3: Evaluate the Reason (<R>)
By evaluating the Reason, we can look for defects:

- Does the <R> provide a sufficient causal basis for <P>?
- Is the <R> a generalization?
- Is the <R> an incomplete enumeration?
- Does the <R> clearly demonstrate the correctness of <P>?
- Is the <R> just repeating what is stated in <P>?

### Analysis:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - The Reason (<R>) is an observation based on only two restaurants.
   - It then generalizes that all restaurants in Sydney are the same.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - The Reason (<R>) claims to have evaluated the quality of all restaurants in Sydney by only trying two of them.
   - This misses out on the complete set of possibilities.

### Classification:

- **Generalization (G):**
  - The statement "I tried two and they were both horrible" attempts to generalize the experience with two restaurants to the entire city of Sydney.
  - This is a classic case of overgeneralizing from an insufficient sample size.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
  - The same Reason also shows an incomplete enumeration because it pretends to make a complete assessment of all restaurants while only having a limited sample of two.

### Conclusion:

The defective argument types for the statement are:

1. **Generalization (G)**
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**

---

### Summary:

By applying **IDAA** to the statement "There aren’t any good restaurants in Sydney; I tried two and they were both horrible," we decomposed the task into specific steps and identified the following defective argument types:
- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
