For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a defective argument) to the given string "My uncle eats pizza and cake and he is thin. Pizza and cake aren’t the cause of obesity.", we need to break down the task into specific steps and use those steps to determine the type of defective argument. Let's go step by step:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P) in the string.**
The Proposition (P) sets forth summarily what is intended to be proved. 

In this string, the proposition seems to be: "Pizza and cake aren’t the cause of obesity."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R) in the string.**
The Reason (R) establishes the causal basis for the Proposition (P) and aims to validate the truth of what is urged.

The Reason provided here is: "My uncle eats pizza and cake and he is thin."

**Step 3: Evaluate the Reason (R) with respect to the Proposition (P).**
We need to assess whether the Reason (R) conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the Proposition (P).

The Reason provided focuses on a single anecdotal example (the uncle) to argue a general proposition about pizza and cake not causing obesity.

**Step 4: Classify the type of defective argument.**
We need to match the identified issue in the Reasoning (R) and Proposition (P) to any of the known defective argument types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

**Analysis:**

- "My uncle eats pizza and cake and he is thin." attempts to generalize the particular case of one person (the uncle) to make a broad claim about causality.
- Relying solely on one person's instance (the uncle) to draw a general conclusion.

This fits the definition of Generalization (G):
**Generalization (G):** where the Proposition (P) is an assertion based on some single part or a majority of individuals but not necessarily applicable to all, is referred to all.

**Conclusion:**
The given string "My uncle eats pizza and cake and he is thin. Pizza and cake aren’t the cause of obesity." is an example of a defective argument type called **Generalization (G)**.
