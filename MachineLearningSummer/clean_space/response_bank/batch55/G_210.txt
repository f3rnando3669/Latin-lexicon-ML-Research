For 
Let's apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to classify the string "If you allow one student to take an online course, soon everyone will want to, and the schools will be empty":

### Step 1: Identify the proposition \( \langle P \rangle \)
The main proposition \( \langle P \rangle \) in the given string is: 
- "If you allow one student to take an online course."

### Step 2: Identify the reason \( \langle R \rangle \)
The reason \( \langle R \rangle \) given to support the proposition is:
- "Soon everyone will want to, and the schools will be empty."

### Step 3: Analyze the structure and content to classify the defect
Let's look at the given <P> and <R> to determine if there is a defective argument type.

- **Generalization \( \langle G \rangle \)**: The argument suggests that if one student is allowed to take an online course, then soon "everyone" will want to. This is a generalization since it assumes the behavior of one or a few individuals will necessarily apply to all students without sufficient evidence.

- **Incomplete Enumeration \( \langle FE \rangle \)**: The given argument does not claim to enumerate possibilities but makes a broad generalization.

- **Inconclusive Reason \( \langle IR \rangle \)**: The reason suggests a sequence of events without conclusive evidence to support the transition from one student taking an online course to schools being empty. This jumps to a conclusion without solid backing.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis \( \langle WCB \rangle \)**: The reason given does not provide a compelling or detailed causal link showing why one student's action will lead to all students wanting to follow suit and eventually schools being empty.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition \( \langle RR \rangle \)**: The reason appears to build on the proposition but does not merely repeat it; it develops an additional claim.

- **Presumptuous Consensus \( \langle FU \rangle \)**: The argument does not appeal to a universal agreement; it builds a speculative scenario.

- **Ambiguous Language Use \( \langle DEP \rangle \)**: The argument does not hinge on ambiguous language or multiple interpretations of key terms.

### Step 4: Make a determination on the primary defect
From the analysis above, the most fitting classification of the defective argument type for the given string is:
- Generalization \( \langle G \rangle \)

This is because the argument assumes that allowing one student to take an online course will inevitably lead to all students wanting to do so, resulting in empty schools, which is a sweeping generalization not supported by sufficient evidence.

So, when applying \( \text{IDAA} \) to "If you allow one student to take an online course, soon everyone will want to, and the schools will be empty," we classify it as type \( \langle G \rangle \) (Generalization).
