To apply the IDAA to the given statement and identify the type of defective argument, we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Analyze the given statement
The statement provided is:
"A major wrong has been committed by the local government and several people go to protest it, waving signs and blocking traffic. 'Both sides are just as bad,' rants your uncle. What fallacy has he committed?"

### Step 2: Determine the elements in the statement
- **Proposition (P)**: A major wrong has been committed by the local government.
- **Action/Reaction**: Several people protest it.
- **Conclusion by Uncle**: Both sides are just as bad.

### Step 3: Identify the Reason (R) within the context
- **Reason (R)**, as inferred from your uncle’s statement: Both sides exhibit bad behavior, hence they are equally bad.

### Step 4: Assess if additional proof of the reason (PR) exists
- There isn't a specific proof of the reason provided by the uncle. The conclusion that "both sides are just as bad" is presented without further supporting arguments.

### Step 5: Classify the given fallacy
Now, let's classify the statement into one of the defective argument types by considering each definition:

- **Generalization (G)**: The uncle's statement does not appear to generalize from specific instances to an entire category.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This doesn't fit because it's not about making a complete list of possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The uncle’s reasoning that both sides are equally bad could be inconclusive because it does not properly engage with the specific wrong committed by the local government.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: It could be argued that the reason given (both sides are bad) does not have a compelling causal basis since reacting to a wrongdoing does not inherently make the actions equivalent.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This fallacy is not applicable as the statement doesn’t simply repeat the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The statement doesn't claim any universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The uncle's statement isn’t particularly ambiguous.

### Step 6: Evaluate based on the context for the closest match
Given the context, the statements "Both sides are just as bad" likely suffer from either:
1. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Because the reasoning doesn't effectively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition that both sides can be equally bad given that only one side committed a specific wrong.
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: As it does not provide a compelling reason why the actions of protesting should be equated with committing a major wrong.

### Step 7: Final classification
Considering the analysis:
- Since the uncle’s conclusion doesn't conclusively address the specific wrongdoing that the proposition claims, it fits best as an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.

### Conclusion
Hence, "Both sides are just as bad," rants your uncle is classified under the defective argument type <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).

This complete step-by-step IDAA application identifies the fallacy as IR.
