For 
To apply IDAA to the string "You're a Westerner and you're an idiot.", we must first decompose the task of classifying the string into specific steps and then follow those steps to classify the given argument correctly.

Step-by-step decomposition (D) for <IDA> (Identification and Classification of Defective Arguments):

Step 1: Identify the proposition (P) in the string.
Step 2: Check if there's an explicit or implied Reason (R) for the proposition.
Step 3: Check for the Proof of Reason (PR), if any.
Step 4: Determine if the argument is defective based on predefined argument types.
 
   - Check if the proposition is a generalization (G).
   - Check if the proposition involves incomplete enumeration (FE).
   - Check if the reason is inconclusive (IR).
   - Check if the reason has an insufficient causal basis (WCB).
   - Check if the reason repeats the proposition (RR).
   - Check if the proof relies on a presumptuous consensus (FU).
   - Check if there is ambiguous language use (DEP).

Let's apply these steps to the given statement.

**Step 1: Identify the proposition (P) in the string.**

The proposition (P) is: "You're a Westerner and you're an idiot."

**Step 2: Check if there's an explicit or implied Reason (R) for the proposition.**

There is no explicit or clear implied Reason (R) given in the string. The statement simply asserts two things: that the person is a Westerner and an idiot, without providing a reason why these two characteristics are connected or justified.

**Step 3: Check for the Proof of Reason (PR), if any.**

Since there is no reason (R) provided, there also can't be any Proof of Reason (PR).

**Step 4: Determine if the argument is defective based on predefined argument types.**

- **Generalization (G):** The statement does not necessarily appear to generalize from one part or a majority to all; it's directed at a specific person.
   
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This does not apply here as the statement isn't listing possibilities.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** There isn't even a reason given, so this wouldn't apply directly here.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Since no causal basis is provided, this also doesn't specifically apply.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The statement does not try to restate "you're an idiot" as a reason. Both parts are assertions rather than a proposition with a reason.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The string does not invoke any so-called "universally agreed" proof.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language isnâ€™t ambiguous; it's clear but offensive without justification. 

Since the primary characteristic of the statement is that it makes an assertion without any supporting reason, it most directly fits under:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** While IR typically implies the presence of reason, the statement directly fails by not providing any supporting argument or causal link, rendering it inconclusive as an isolated assertion.

So the closest defective argument type for "You're a Westerner and you're an idiot" could be seen as:

**IR** - Inconclusive Reason, due to the complete lack of any supporting reason or causal link provided.

Therefore, the classification of the statement "You're a Westerner and you're an idiot." is of type **IR**.
