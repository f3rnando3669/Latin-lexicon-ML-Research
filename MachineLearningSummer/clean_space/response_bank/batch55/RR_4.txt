For 
To apply IDAA to the string "Why must you always take positions that are so unscientific?", we will decompose the task of classifying the string as a type of defective argument using specific steps.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
First, we locate the core assertion or proposition in the string, which lays out what is intended to be proven or addressed.

- Proposition <P>: "You always take positions that are so unscientific."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
Next, we seek the causal basis that is being used to establish the truth of the proposition. In this case, it's implied through a rhetorical question.

- Reason <R>: The implication that "taking unscientific positions is wrong or harmful."

### Step 3: Evaluate and Classify the Argument Type
We now consider whether the combination of the proposition and reason falls into one of the defective argument types defined earlier:

1. **Generalization (G)**: Does the proposition apply to all cases from just one or a few examples?
   - **Analysis**: The term "always" suggests a generalization, as it doesn't provide specific instances.
   - **Conclusion**: Possible <G>, but we should evaluate other types.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Does the proposition claim completeness but miss out on pertinent cases?
   - **Analysis**: The proposition doesn't enumerate possibilities; rather, it states an absolute.
   - **Conclusion**: Not <FE>.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
   - **Analysis**: The premise that "unscientific" is inherently negative is presumed rather than demonstrated.
   - **Conclusion**: Possible <IR>.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Is the causal basis weak or non-compelling?
   - **Analysis**: There is an assumption rather than an argument about why unscientific positions are problematic.
   - **Conclusion**: Possible <WCB>.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Does the reason simply repeat the proposition?
   - **Analysis**: The reason is different from the proposition.
   - **Conclusion**: Not <RR>.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Is the proof assumed based on a disputed universal agreement?
   - **Analysis**: The argument does not claim universal agreement directly.
   - **Conclusion**: Not <FU>.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Could the proof be taken in another unintended sense?
   - **Analysis**: The terminology is relatively clear and specific.
   - **Conclusion**: Not <DEP>.

### Step 4: Determine the Deficiency
After analyzing the argument using the defective types, the argument primarily fits the following defective types:

- **Generalization (G)**: The term "always" overgeneralizes from unspecified instances.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reasoning that unscientific positions are harmful is implied without clear proof.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The reason lacks a compelling argument linking unscientific positions to potential negative outcomes.

### Conclusion
The string "Why must you always take positions that are so unscientific?" primarily exhibits the defects of **Generalization (G)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

This completes the application of IDAA to the given string, successfully decomposing and classifying it into the corresponding defective argument types.
