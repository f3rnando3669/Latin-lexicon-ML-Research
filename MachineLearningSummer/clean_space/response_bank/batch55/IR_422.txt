To apply the Identification of Defective Arguments and Analytic Argument construction (IDAA) to the given text, we will follow the steps for decomposition (D) systematically.

1. **Extract Key Components:**
   - **Proposition (P)**: The assertion or statement intended to be proven.
   - **Reason (R)**: The causal basis supporting the Proposition.
   - **Proof of Reason (PR)**: Additional arguments corroborating the Reason.

2. **Analyze the Interaction:**
   - The interaction is between Helga and Hugh regarding the consumption of fat burgers and their health impacts.

3. **Break Down Each Participant's Argument:**
   - **Helga's Argument:**
     - **P**: "You should not be eating that."
     - **R**: "It has been scientifically proven that eating fat burgers are no good for your health."
   - **Hugh's Argument:**
     - **P**: "That [Helga's argument] can't be true."
     - **R**: "You [Helga] eat fat burgers all the time."

4. **Identify the Defective Argument Type (IDA):**
   - For Helga's Argument:
     - **P**: "You should not be eating that."
     - **R**: "It has been scientifically proven that eating fat burgers are no good for your health."
     - Since there is no apparent error with Helga’s Reason to her Proposition given the supposed scientific basis (though more information would help confirm this), we focus on Hugh's response.
   
   - For Hugh's Argument:
     - **P**: "That can’t be true."
     - **R**: "You eat fat burgers all the time."
     - Here, Hugh is countering the scientific claim with an ad hominem approach, focusing on Helga's behavior instead of addressing the validity of the scientific evidence.

5. **Classify the Defective Argument:**
   - Hugh's Argument type:
     - The Reason (R) does not pertain directly to the Proposition (P). Thus, it fails to conclusively demonstrate the correctness or incorrectness of Helga's statement about the health impact of eating fat burgers. This is a classic case of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because Hugh is using Helga's personal behavior as a basis to discredit the scientific claim rather than providing evidence against the scientific reasoning itself.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The classification of Hugh's argument is **<IR> Inconclusive Reason** because the provided Reason (R) does not directly address the truth of the scientific claim made by Helga.

Thus, applying IDAA to the given interaction between Helga and Hugh results in identifying Hugh's argument as falling into the defective argument type **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
