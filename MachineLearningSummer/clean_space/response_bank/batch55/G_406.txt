Sure, let's apply the process of decomposing the task of classifying the defective argument step by step to the statement: "Flight attendants are the nicest people. I should know—I’ve taken two flights."

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- **Proposition (<P>)**: "Flight attendants are the nicest people."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- **Reason (<R>)**: "I should know—I’ve taken two flights."

### Step 3: Evaluate Whether the Argument is Defective
- In this case, we need to classify the given statement <s> into one of the defective argument types (Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Presumptuous Consensus, Ambiguous Language Use).

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
To classify the argument, let’s break down the possible defective types:

#### Generalization (<G>):
- **Definition**: The proposition is an assertion based on some one part or on a majority of individuals, but not necessarily applicable to all, is referred to all.
- **Evaluation**: The proposition "Flight attendants are the nicest people" is a broad statement about all flight attendants based on a limited experience.

#### Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):
- **Definition**: The proposition is defective when we claim to have made a complete enumeration of the possibilities but actually miss out on some pertinent ones.
- **Evaluation**: The argument does not claim to have enumerated all experiences with flight attendants, so this does not apply.

#### Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):
- **Definition**: The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **Evaluation**: The reason "I’ve taken two flights” does not conclusively demonstrate that all flight attendants are the nicest people.

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):
- **Definition**: The reason is weak if the causal basis which it submits for the proposition is not a compelling one.
- **Evaluation**: The causal basis provided (having taken two flights) is very weak and not compelling to establish that flight attendants are the nicest people.

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):
- **Definition**: The reason is weak when it appears to be presented as the reason, but says precisely the same as was said in the proposition.
- **Evaluation**: The reason does not repeat the proposition.

#### Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):
- **Definition**: The proof of reason is assumed as certain, on the ground that "it is universally agreed upon," a thing which is still in dispute.
- **Evaluation**: This argument does not use universal agreement as its basis.

#### Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):
- **Definition**: The proof of reason can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended.
- **Evaluation**: There is no ambiguous language in this particular argument.

### Step 5: Conclusion
Given the evaluation of each potential defective argument type, the statement "Flight attendants are the nicest people. I should know—I’ve taken two flights." primarily falls under:
- **Generalization (<G>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**

Since Generalization and Insufficient Causal Basis are the most fitting types, we can conclude it is closer to a **Generalization (<G>)** because it makes a broad assertion based on limited experience, supported by a weak causal basis.

### Final Classification
- The argument: **<G>: Generalization**

Thus, by applying the task decomposition method, we’ve classified the argument as a Generalization.
