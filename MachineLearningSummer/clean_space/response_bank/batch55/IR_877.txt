To apply the IDAA process to the statement "People who don't like K-pop are racist," we need to decompose the task of identifying the defective argument type into specific steps and then classify the statement accordingly. Here is the decomposition and application step-by-step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
First, we need to identify the central claim or assertion being made.

**Proposition <P>:** "People who don't like K-pop are racist."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
Next, we attempt to find the causal basis or reasoning that supports the proposition. However, in this statement, the reason is implied rather than explicitly stated.

**Reason <R>:** It is implied that disliking K-pop (a Korean pop music genre) suggests a bias or prejudice based on race.

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason <PR>
We look for any additional supporting arguments to corroborate the reason. This statement does not provide any additional arguments or evidence.

**Proof of Reason <PR>:** No explicit proof is given.

### Step 4: Analyze the Defective Argument Types
Now we analyze the statement against the defined defective argument types:

#### Analysis of <G> (Generalization)
The statement makes a generalization by asserting that disliking K-pop (a single instance or specific genre of music) applies universally to being racist. This is a characteristic of generalization.

**Classification as <G>:** Yes, the statement generalizes the dislike of a genre to a broad and serious prejudice, which may not necessarily apply to all individuals.

#### Analysis of <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)
This type wouldn't apply as the statement does not claim to enumerate possibilities.

**Classification as <FE>:** No, this does not fit the incomplete enumeration type.

#### Analysis of <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)
The statement doesn’t explicitly provide a reason that directly links disliking K-pop to racism, making the reasoning inconclusive.

**Classification as <IR>:** Yes, the reasoning provided is weak and inconclusive.

#### Analysis of <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)
There’s no repetition of the proposition as a reason.

**Classification as <RR>:** No, this doesn't fit faulty repetition.

#### Analysis of <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)
Although the statement implies a causal basis, it doesn’t sufficiently establish why disliking K-pop necessitates racism.

**Classification as <WCB>:** Yes, the causal basis for connecting disliking K-pop with racism is insufficient.

#### Analysis of <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)
The statement does not appeal to any universal agreement.

**Classification as <FU>:** No, this doesn’t claim universal consensus.

#### Analysis of <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)
There’s no ambiguity in language within the statement regarding the terms used.

**Classification as <DEP>:** No, it doesn't fit ambiguous language use.

### Step 5: Final Classification
Considering our analysis, we identify multiple defective argument types that apply to the statement:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement generalizes from disliking a music genre to having a racial prejudice.
2. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided doesn’t conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis is not compelling.

**Final Classification:** The statement "People who don't like K-pop are racist," can be classified as a mix of <G>, <IR>, and <WCB> defective argument types.

By applying IDAA, we've broken down and classified the defects in the argument systematically.
