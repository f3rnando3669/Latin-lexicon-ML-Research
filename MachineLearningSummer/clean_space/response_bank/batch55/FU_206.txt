For 
To apply the decomposition of <IDA> into specific steps (<IDAA>) on the given string ("Trump cites (biased) poll results showing that people think he’s a strong leader to prove a point that he is a strong leader. ABC News/Washington Post Poll (wrong big on election) said almost all stand by their vote on me & 53% said strong leader.") we will break down the process as follows:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA> into Specific Steps (`<D>`) and Its Application

1. **Identify the components of the argument:**
   - Proposition (`<P>`)
   - Reason (`<R>`)
   - Proof of Reason (`<PR>`)

2. **Analyze for defective argument types:**
   - Determine if the argument is a `Generalization (<G>)`
   - Check for `Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)`
   - Look for `Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)`
   - Examine if there is `Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)`
   - Detect `Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)`
   - Consider `Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)`
   - Check for `Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)`

### Step-by-Step Application

#### Step 1: Identify the Components of the Argument
- **Proposition (`<P>`)**: "Trump is a strong leader."
  
- **Reason (`<R>`)**: "According to a poll, people think he’s a strong leader."
  
- **Proof of Reason (`<PR>`)**: "ABC News/Washington Post Poll said almost all stand by their vote on Trump & 53% said strong leader."

#### Step 2: Analyze for Defective Argument Types

- **Generalization (`<G>`)**:
  - Assessment: This doesn't necessarily fit a generalization since the argument refers to specific poll results.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (`<FE>)**:
  - Assessment: There's no claim of having considered all possibilities, just results from a specific poll.

- **Inconclusive Reason (`<IR>)**:
  - Assessment: The fact that 53% of people in a specific poll consider Trump a strong leader doesn't conclusively prove he is a strong leader universally. Opinion polls can be reflective of subjective beliefs rather than objective truths.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (`<WCB>)**:
  - Assessment: The Reason given (poll results) may not be a sufficient causal basis for the Proposition that Trump is a strong leader. Poll results are not an inherently strong measure of leadership strength.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (`<RR>)**:
  - Assessment: The Reason is not a repetition of the Proposition. The Reason involves a poll result which is different from the Proposition itself.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (`<FU>)**:
  - Assessment: This could apply since it's implying that because a certain group of people (53%) in a specific poll think Trump is a strong leader, this is being taken as a widely accepted fact, which is presumptuous.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (`<DEP>)**:
  - Assessment: Specific poll results might be taken in different senses, especially referring to biased polls or past polling inaccuracies. 

### Conclusion:
The argument primarily fits the defective argument type of `Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)` and potentially `Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)`.

**Classification Result:**
- The given string falls under the defective argument type: **`<FU>` - Presumptuous Consensus** and could also be considered as **`<IR>` - Inconclusive Reason** due to the reliance on poll results that do not conclusively prove the Proposition.
