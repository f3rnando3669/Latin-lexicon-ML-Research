For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to the string "taps into people's desire to belong to a group. 'Everyone else is doing it!'" we follow a step-by-step decomposition process (\( \text{D} \)) to classify the string as one of the defective argument types defined above.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (\( \text{D} \)):

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( P \)):**
   - The proposition in this string is implicit but can be interpreted as "People should or will do X."

2. **Identify the Reason (\( R \)):**
   - The reason provided here is "Everyone else is doing it."

3. **Evaluate the Type of Defective Argument:**
   - Check if there is a basis for Generalization (\( G \)).
   - Check if it fits Incomplete Enumeration (\( FE \)).
   - Check if the Reason is Inconclusive (\( IR \)).
   - Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \)).
   - Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( RR \)).
   - Check for Presumptuous Consensus (\( FU \)).
   - Check for Ambiguous Language Use (\( DEP \)).

### Applying \( \text{D} \) (Step-by-Step Evaluation):

1. **Generalization (\( G \)):**
   - The statement does not generalize from a part to a whole. It appeals implicitly to peopleâ€™s behavior rather than generalizing a property or action from individuals to everyone.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\( FE \)):**
   - The statement does not enumerate possibilities, so \( FE \) does not apply.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \)):**
   - The reason "Everyone else is doing it" does not conclusively demonstrate why someone should do X. It relies on popularity rather than a logical reason.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \)):**
   - While the causal basis (desire to belong) is addressed, it is not compelling or logically sufficient to support the proposition.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( RR \)):**
   - "Everyone else is doing it" does not repeat the proposition; instead, it provides an external reason.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\( FU \)):**
   - This is a strong candidate. The Reason assumes a conclusion based on the presumed unanimity of behavior which is still in dispute. It appeals to a consensus that is presumed rather than proven.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\( DEP \)):**
   - The language does not appear to be ambiguous; the intention is clear.

### Conclusion:

The string "taps into people's desire to belong to a group. 'Everyone else is doing it!'" is best classified as:

\[ \text{FU (Presumptuous Consensus)} \]

This evaluation shows that the argument relies on the presumed universal behavior ("everyone else is doing it") to support the proposition without valid reasoning, which aligns with the definition of Presumptuous Consensus.
