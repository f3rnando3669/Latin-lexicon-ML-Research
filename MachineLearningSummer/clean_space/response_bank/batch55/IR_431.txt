Sure, let's apply the decomposition of the advanced task (D) to the task of classifying the given string (IDA). We will follow the steps to analyze the argument and identify any defective argument types.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition is what the argument intends to prove. In the given string, the proposition can be summarized as:
**<P>**: "It is all right to execute insane people who have committed murder."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason is the causal basis for the proposition. In the given string, the reason might be interpreted as:
**<R>**: "If we ban executions of insane people, then everybody on death row will suddenly decide they are insane and purposely fail sanity tests, resulting in chaos."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
The proof of the reason is additional support for the briefly presented reason. The argument provides a scenario to support the reason:
**<PR>**: "It would result in chaos."

### Step 4: Evaluate for Defective Arguments
We need to classify whether the argument falls into any defective argument types:

#### Evaluate for Generalization (<G>)
- Is there an assertion based on some individuals that are applied to all?
  - No, the argument does not make a generalization about all insane people or all those on death row.

#### Evaluate for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- Is there a claim of complete enumeration of possibilities that miss out pertinent ones?
  - Yes, the string seems to suggest only one possible outcome (chaos on death row) without considering other possibilities (e.g., proper psychological assessment processes). This could be an instance of Incomplete Enumeration. **<FE>**

#### Evaluate for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- Does the reason conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
  - The reason given (fear of chaos) does not conclusively prove that executing insane people is morally or legally correct. This is more about potential consequences, not the core ethical question. **<IR>**

#### Evaluate for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
 - Is the causal basis compelling?
   - The causal basis provided for the proposition ("result in chaos") assumes inmates would manipulate sanity tests without providing evidence or a strong link between this outcome and the ethical justification for execution. **<WCB>**

#### Evaluate for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
- Is the reason just a repeat of the proposition?
  - No, the reason given in this case is different from the initial proposition.

#### Evaluate for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
- Is the proof assumed certain on the ground that it is universally agreed upon?
  - No, the proof here is not based on any universal agreement.

#### Evaluate for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)
- Can the proof be taken differently than intended?
  - No, the language used does not appear ambiguous in this context.

### Step 5: Classify the String
Given the evaluation above, we identify the following defective argument types:
1. **<FE>** - Incomplete Enumeration
2. **<IR>** - Inconclusive Reason
3. **<WCB>** - Insufficient Causal Basis
  
### Conclusion
The argument "The Supreme Court right now is deciding whether it is right to execute insane people who have committed murder. I think it is all right to execute insane people. If we ban executions of insane people, then everybody on death row will suddenly decide they are insane and purposely fail sanity tests. It would result in chaos." contains instances of **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
