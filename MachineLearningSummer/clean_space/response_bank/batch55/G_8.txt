For 
Applying **IDAA** (the decomposition of the classification task) to the given statement involves breaking down the task into specific steps. We need to classify the argument presented in the statement into one of the defective argument types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

Let's begin step-by-step:

### Step 1: Identify the Argument Parts
1. **Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition (<P>) is generally what we intend to prove. In this case, the proposition appears to be implicit but can be summarized as: "We should not allow Susan to leave early."
   
2. **Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason provided for the proposition is: "If we allow Susan to leave early, soon we'll be giving everyone Friday afternoon off."

### Step 2: Assess the Reasoning
We need to consider if the Reason (<R>) appropriately supports the Proposition (<P>) or if it falls into one of the defective categories.

### Step 3: Match with Defective Argument Types
1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - Is the argument making a broad assertion based on a limited example? Yes, it generalizes that allowing one individual to leave early will lead to everyone leaving early in a similar fashion.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Is the argument missing out on enumerating other possibilities? This doesn't seem applicable here, as it's not an enumeration argument.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Does the Reason conclusively support the Proposition? The Reason does not conclusively demonstrate that allowing Susan to leave early necessarily results in everyone getting Friday afternoons off. This is a matter of assumption, not a definitive cause-effect.
   
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Is the causal basis weak for establishing the Proposition? Yes, the causal relationship between allowing Susan to leave early and everyone getting Friday afternoons off is tenuous and not compelling.
   
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - Is the Reason just a repetition of the Proposition? No, the Reason presents a different point from the Proposition.
   
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - Is it assumed as certain what is still in dispute? This doesn't apply here, as nothing is referenced as "universally agreed upon." 
   
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - Is the language ambiguous in supporting the Reason? This is not an issue here, as language ambiguity doesn't affect the reasoning directly.

### Step 4: Select the Most Appropriate Type
Given the analysis, we have identified that:
- Generalization (<G>) applies because it makes a broad assertion from a single example.
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>) applies because the Reason doesn't conclusively support the Proposition.
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>) applies because the causal link is not compelling.

### Step 5: Final Classification
To conclude, while all three identified defective argument types can be applicable, the most prominent classification for the argument is:

**<G>: Generalization**

The primary issue with the argument is that it generalizes the specific instance of allowing Susan to leave early to the broader consequence of everyone getting Friday afternoons off, without sufficient justification.
