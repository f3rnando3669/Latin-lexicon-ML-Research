Certainly! Applying <IDAA> to the string "I would never buy a Buick. My father owned two of them and both of them had frequent transmission problems. Buicks obviously break down all the time." involves decomposing the task of identifying the defective argument type into specific steps.

Here's the step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>:
   - The proposition (what is intended to be proved) in the string is: "Buicks obviously break down all the time."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>:
   - The reason provided for the proposition is: "My father owned two of them and both of them had frequent transmission problems."

### Step 3: Analyze whether the Reason <R> sufficiently supports the Proposition <P>:
   - Here, the Reason is based on the experience of just two Buick cars owned by one individual. The proposition makes a sweeping claim about all Buicks based on this limited experience.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument Type:
   - Given the information, we need to determine which defective argument type this falls under:
     - **Generalization (G)**: This type involves making a general assertion based on a limited number of cases or a majority. 
     - The string implies that all Buicks have frequent transmission problems because two Buicks owned by one individual had this issue.

### Step 5: Verify classification:
   - No other defective argument type fits as well as Generalization:
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This is not about listing all possibilities, so it does not fit here.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason does support the claim to some extent but is too limited to be conclusive.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This suggests a weak causal basis, but the string does give specific experiences as causal.
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: There is no repetition.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Universal agreement is not claimed here.
     - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: There is no ambiguity in the language.

### Conclusion:
   - The argument is a type <G> Generalization: the assertion that "Buicks break down all the time" is based on limited experience with just two cars and is incorrectly generalized to all Buicks.

Thus, the string "I would never buy a Buick. My father owned two of them and both of them had frequent transmission problems. Buicks obviously break down all the time." should be classified as <G>, a Generalization.
