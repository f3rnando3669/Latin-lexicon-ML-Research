To apply IDAA (the application of task decomposition to the process of identifying a defective argument), we will break down the IDA task into specific steps and then analyze the given string step-by-step.

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**
- We need to find the statement or assertion that indicates what is intended to be proven.
  - In this case, the main proposition could be implied from the overall message, which seems to be about redirecting focus from the issue of going over the cell limit to the achievement of getting an A on the algebra exam.

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)**
- Find the causal basis for the Proposition.
  - The Reason here is the statement, "The important issue here, though, is that I got an A on my algebra exam."

**Step 3: Check for a Proof of Reason (PR)**
- Determine if there is any additional argument used to support the Reason.
  - There does not appear to be any further supporting argument presented.

**Step 4: Analyze the Argument for Defects**
  - **Generalization (G)**: Determine if the argument erroneously applies a statement about some to all.
    - No generalization issue here.
  - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Check if the argument falsely claims a complete enumeration of possibilities.
    - Not applicable, as no enumeration of possibilities is made.
  - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: See if the Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.
    - The main issue seems to be the shift in focus, which might indicate an inconclusive reason, but let's continue analyzing to confirm.
  - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Analyze whether the Reason's causal basis is weak.
    - The reason for getting an A on the algebra exam does not directly address the issue of going over the cell limit, indicating a weak causal connection.
  - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Check if the Reason merely repeats the Proposition.
    - The Reason and Proposition are different, so this doesn't apply.
  - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Determine if the argument presumes universal agreement without proving it.
    - No mention of universal agreement is made, so not applicable.
  - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Check for ambiguous language that could be interpreted differently.
    - There is no ambiguous language affecting the interpretation significantly.

**Step 5: Determine the Defective Argument Type**
- Based on the analysis, the string likely falls under both <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):
  - As an **Inconclusive Reason**, the asserting of an A on the algebra exam does not directly address or resolve the issue regarding the cell phone limit.
  - As an **Insufficient Causal Basis**, the important issue of getting an A on the exam does not strongly connect as a causal basis for the argument about the cell phone limit.

Thus, the string "Mom, I know you're upset that I went over my cell limit this month. The important issue here, though, is that I got an A on my algebra exam." is classified as having an <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
