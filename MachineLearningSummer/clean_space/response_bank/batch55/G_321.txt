### Decomposition of the Task \(<t>\)

We are tasked with classifying the given argument \(<s>\). Let's break this down into specific steps in order to approach this systematically.

1. **Identify the Proposition (\(P\))**: Determine what is being asserted in the argument.
2. **Identify the Reason (\(R\))**: Determine the cause or basis behind the assertion.
3. **Evaluate the Proposition**: Assess whether \(P\) falls into any defective argument categories.
4. **Evaluate the Reason**: Assess whether \(R\) falls into any defective argument categories.
5. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (PR)**: Assess whether any supporting evidence for \(R\) is being used correctly or falls into defective categories.
6. **Compare with Defective Argument Types**: Match detected issues with the predefined defective argument types (\(G\), \(FE\), \(IR\), \(RR\), \(WCB\), \(FU\), \(DEP\)).

### Step-by-Step Application on the Given String 

The given string: "Teachers don't have lives. My best friend said her English class was hard, and the one I'm in is hard too. All English classes must be hard."

1. **Identify the Proposition (\(P\))**:
   - "Teachers don't have lives."
   - "All English classes must be hard."

2. **Identify the Reason (\(R\))**:
   - Reasoning behind "Teachers don't have lives" is implied but not clearly stated; it can be inferred that someone might think this due to the perceived commitment teachers have to their jobs.
   - Reason for "All English classes must be hard" is: "My best friend said her English class was hard, and the one I'm in is hard too."

3. **Evaluate the Proposition (\(P\))**:
   - Evaluate Proposition 1: "Teachers don't have lives." This statement is a generalization based on an implied observation. Teachers are seen as very dedicated to their work, but this does not apply to all teachers universally.
   - Evaluate Proposition 2: "All English classes must be hard." This statement is a generalization based on experiences from two people.

4. **Evaluate the Reason (\(R\))**:
   - Evaluate Reason for Proposition 1: There is no explicit reason provided, but we assume it to be a general observation. 
   - Evaluate Reason for Proposition 2: "My best friend said her English class was hard, and the one I'm in is hard too." This reasoning is based on limited anecdotal evidence from only two experiences.

5. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (\(PR\))**:
   - There is no additional proof of reason provided for either proposition that extends beyond the anecdotal observations.

6. **Compare with Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: Both propositions generalize from limited experience to a universal claim.
     - Proposition 1: "Teachers don't have lives" is based on the perceived behavior of some teachers.
     - Proposition 2: "All English classes must be hard" generalizes from the experiences of only two people.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not consider all possible variations in the difficulty of English classes; it makes a sweeping generalization based on incomplete evidence.

### Conclusion
Based on the steps outlined, the argument "Teachers don't have lives. My best friend said her English class was hard, and the one I'm in is hard too. All English classes must be hard." exhibits defects primarily of the type:

- **Generalization (\(G\))** for both propositions.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\(FE\))** for the second proposition.

So, the correct classification of the given string \(<s>\) is as type \(<G>\) and \(<FE>\).
