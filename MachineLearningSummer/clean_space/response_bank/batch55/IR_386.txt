For 
To apply **IDAA** (the decomposition of the task into specific steps) to the task of classifying the given string under defective argument types, we'll follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)

The proposition is the statement or claim that is being set forth to be proven. In the given string:

"By rejecting God, you are rejecting goodness, kindness, and love itself."

The proposition (<P>) appears to be:
- **P:** "By rejecting God, you are rejecting goodness, kindness, and love itself."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)

The reason is the causal basis provided for the proposition. In this case, the reason is implied rather than explicitly stated. However, the proposition itself suggests a causal link between rejecting God and rejecting goodness, kindness, and love.

- **R:** Rejection of God leads to the rejection of goodness, kindness, and love.

### Step 3: Analyze for Defective Arguments

Now we'll examine the proposition and reason to classify the argument into one of the defective types:

1. **Generalization (G):** Assumes something about all individuals based on a part or majority.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Claims complete enumeration but misses possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reason provides a weak causal basis for the proposition.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason restates the proposition without adding new information.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Assumes universal agreement on a still disputed issue.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The reason can be interpreted differently than intended.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument

Given the steps above, let's consider each defective argument type one by one for the given string:

#### Generalization (G)
- This argument is not making a generalization about a group based on limited observation. Rather, it implies a universal connection.

#### Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
- The argument isn't listing all possibilities and missing some. It's making an assertion about a single consequence.

#### Inconclusive Reason (IR)
- The reason provided ("Rejection of God leads to the rejection of goodness, kindness, and love") does not sufficiently demonstrate that rejecting God necessarily means rejecting these virtues. The connection is assumed rather than conclusively demonstrated.

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
- Similarly, the causal basis provided for the proposition may be seen as weak because it assumes a strong inherent link between belief in God and the virtues mentioned without sufficient evidence.

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
- The reason isn’t just repeating the proposition. It does add the idea of rejection leading to the rejection of virtues.

#### Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
- The argument does not claim universal agreement about the rejection of God leading to the rejection of virtues. It’s presented more as a logical consequence.

#### Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)
- While “goodness, kindness, and love” and their connection to “God” can be subjective and interpreted differently, the main defect seems to lie in the assumption of a necessary connection rather than ambiguity of terms.

### Step 5: Determine the Primary Defective Argument Type

Given the analysis, the primary defective argument types that the statement fits best are:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis provided is weak and not compelling.

Thus, we classify the argument as:

- **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**
- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**

In summary, the provided argument can mainly be classified as **IR** and **WCB**, with **IR** being the primary defective argument type.
