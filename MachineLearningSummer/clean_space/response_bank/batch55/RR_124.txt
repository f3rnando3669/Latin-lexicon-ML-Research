For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "the reason why more people are leaving this country is because of economic problems, therefore because there is an economic problem is that people are leaving this country," we will first decompose the classification task <IDA> into specific steps, and then apply each step to the string.

**Step-by-Step Process (<IDAA>):**

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>):**
   - **<P>:** "More people are leaving this country."
   - **<R>:** "Because of economic problems."

2. **Determine if there is a Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - There is no additional argument provided to corroborate the reason. Hence, no explicit <PR>.

3. **Examine the relationship between <P> and <R>:**
   - <R> is provided to support <P>.

4. **Check for defective argument types by analyzing both <P> and <R>:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** The proposition isn't making a broad claim based on a part or majority; it asserts a specific trend.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument does not claim to enumerate all possibilities leading to people leaving the country; it mentions a specific reason.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** We need to check if <R> conclusively demonstrates the correctness of <P>.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Examine if the <R> basically repeats <P>.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Determine if the causal basis for <P> is weak.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** We do not see the argument assuming consensus.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The language does not seem particularly ambiguous.

5. **Apply the criteria to classify <s> as one of the defective argument types:**
   - The string "the reason why more people are leaving this country is because of economic problems, therefore because there is an economic problem is that people are leaving this country." contains a repetition of the proposition within the reason.
   - The assertion "therefore because there is an economic problem is that people are leaving this country" essentially restates the proposition "more people are leaving this country because of economic problems."

Considering these steps, the argument type falls under **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**, as it reiterates the proposition in the guise of providing a reason.

**Classification:** <RR>
