For 
To apply the task of <IDAA> (decomposition of <IDA>) to classify the given string "Now you tell me she looks presidential, folks. I look presidential," we need to break it down step by step into specific actions for better clarity and accurate classification. 

Hereâ€™s a structured approach for <IDAA>:

### Step 1: Understand the String
Examine the given string: "Now you tell me she looks presidential, folks. I look presidential."

### Step 2: Identify Components of the String
The string appears to make two propositions:
1. "She looks presidential."
2. "I look presidential."

### Step 3: Determine Overall Structure
Determine the intention behind the propositions. The statement seems to imply a comparison between two subjects concerning their "presidential" appearance.

### Step 4: Analyze for Defective Argument Types
Check the statement against the definitions of defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>):

- **Generalization (<G>)**: Is the assertion based on a part observed applied to all? 
  - No evident generalization of individual observation to a general rule.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Has there been a claimed exhaustive list of possibilities that is incomplete? 
  - No enumeration is presented.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Does the reason provided fail to conclusively support the proposition?
  - The assertion "I look presidential" follows from the suggestion framework rather than a conclusive reason. This might be construed as <IR> if it were arguing a point.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Is the reason given a compelling one?
  - There is no explicit causal basis given for why looking presidential is relevant or significant.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Is the reason the same as the proposition?
  - "I look presidential" appears to stand simply as a repeated assertion without an additional reason.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Is there an assumption of universal agreement?
  - There is no reference to universal agreement.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Could the statement be interpreted differently than intended by the speaker?
  - Terms like "presidential" might vary in interpretation, but this seems less relevant here.

### Step 5: Conclusion and Classification
Based on the analysis, the string "Now you tell me she looks presidential, folks. I look presidential" seems to fall under the category of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**, because the main proposition that "I look presidential" is simply stated without providing independent reasoning or evidence, essentially repeating the same idea.

### Final Classification
The string "Now you tell me she looks presidential, folks. I look presidential" is classified as type **RR** (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
