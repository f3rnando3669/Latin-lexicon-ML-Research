For 
To apply the decomposition of the task \( <IDA> \) to classify the given string "If I made a reference to a monk I would most likely be utilizing..." into specific steps, we follow the structure defined by \( <IDAA> \).

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Application:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>) in the String (<s>)**

The string provided is: "If I made a reference to a monk I would most likely be utilizing..."

Let's identify the intended proposition:
- The speaker hints that they would use a specific reference when talking about a monk but does not directly state what that reference would be.

**Step 2: Analyze if there is an Explicit or Implicit Reason (<R>)**

Next, identify if there is a reason provided for the proposition:
- The string does not explicitly provide a reason or causal basis. 

**Step 3: Check for Proof of Reason (<PR>)**

Analyze if there is any proof or supportive argument presented:
- No proof or additional arguments are given in the string.

**Step 4: Assess for Defective Argument Types**

We'll decomposing to identify if the string falls into one of the defective argument types \( <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, \) or \( <DEP> \):

- **Generalization (<G>):** The string doesn't generalize from a part to a whole.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The statement doesn't claim a complete list or options; it indicates a possibility.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** No reason is provided, so inconclusiveness cannot be determined.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** No causal basis is given to be deemed insufficient.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Thereâ€™s no repetition of the proposition disguised as a reason.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The string does not appeal to a universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
  - The phrase "most likely be utilizing" hints at an ambiguous expectation or outcome.
  - The lack of specificity on what the reference would be introduces a level of ambiguity.

Given the details in the string, it particularly aligns with **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**. The intended meaning ("most likely be utilizing...") leaves room for interpretation in another sense than what might be intended by the speaker.

### Conclusion:
Based on the structured decomposition and analysis \( <IDAA> \), the string "If I made a reference to a monk I would most likely be utilizing..." is classified as type \( <DEP> \).
