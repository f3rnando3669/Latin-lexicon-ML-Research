For 
To apply **IDAA** (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a string into defective argument types) to the given string "Of course we should buy an Apple computer whenever we need a new computer. We have been buying Apple as far back as anyone can remember!", we will break down the task into specific steps to identify the argument type.

### Step 1: Parse and Understand the Argument
Identify the components of the argument:
- **Proposition (\<P\>)**: "Of course we should buy an Apple computer whenever we need a new computer."
- **Reason (\<R\>)**: "We have been buying Apple as far back as anyone can remember!"

### Step 2: Map the Argument to the Definitions
Compare the identified components against the definitions of defective argument types.

### Step 3: Identify Potential Defective Argument Types
- **Generalization (\<G\>)**: No explicit generalization from a part to a whole is apparent.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)**: Not applicable as there's no attempt to enumerate possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**: The reason provided may not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**: The historical purchase of Apple computers ("we have been buying Apple as far back as anyone can remember") may not be a compelling reason for future purchases; thus, causally weak.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)**: The reason doesn't simply restate the proposition; thus, not applicable.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)**: No mention of universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)**: No ambiguous language present.

### Step 4: Determine the Closest Match
Evaluate the argument to find the best fit for the defective argument type.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)** seems most relevant: The reason given ("we have been buying Apple as far back as anyone can remember") isn't a strong causal basis for the proposition that we should continue to buy Apple computers whenever we need a new one.

### Conclusion:
The argument "Of course we should buy an Apple computer whenever we need a new computer. We have been buying Apple as far back as anyone can remember!" is best classified as defective argument type **\<WCB\> Insufficient Causal Basis**. The history of past purchases is presented as the reason for future purchases, but this does not provide a strong causal basis for the proposition.
