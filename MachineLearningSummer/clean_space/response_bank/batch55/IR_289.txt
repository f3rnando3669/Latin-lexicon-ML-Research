For 
To apply the task of decomposing the classification process (<IDAA>) to the given argument, we'll break down each step needed to identify the defective argument type:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) in the argument:**
   - Examine the statements to determine what is being put forward as a proposition.
   - **Person 1's statement**: "I am for raising the minimum wage in our state."
   - Here, Person 1 is proposing the idea of raising the minimum wage as their <P>.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>) provided for the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Look for the causal basis or reason supporting the proposition.
   - In this argument, Person 2 makes a statement, but it does not provide a direct reason supporting or refuting the proposition from Person 1. Instead, Person 2 makes an ad hominem attack on Person 1's intelligence and capability.

3. **Analyze if there is a Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Look for additional arguments or evidence that support or refute the reason provided.
   - There is no additional argument or evidence (no <PR>) provided by Person 2 to substantiate their claim.

4. **Examine for any defective argument types:** 
   - Check if any part of the argument matches the characteristics of the defective arguments outlined (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>).

Now that we know the steps, we will apply them:

### Decompose and Analyze the Argument:

1. **Proposition Identification:**
   - **Person 1's <P>:** "I am for raising the minimum wage in our state."

2. **Reason Identification:**
   - **Person 2's <R>:** "She is for raising the minimum wage, but she is not smart enough to even run a business."
   - Person 2's statement does not provide a valid reason or causal basis related to the proposition. Instead, it shifts the focus to an unrelated personal attack.

3. **Proof of Reason Identification:**
   - No proof of reason (<PR>) is provided by Person 2 to support their claim about the lack of intelligence and business acumen of Person 1.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument:**

   - **Generalization (<G>):** Not applicable, as there is no generalization based on the majority or a single individual to a whole population.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Not applicable, as there is no claim of complete enumeration of possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Potentially applicable, as the reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate any connection to the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Not directly applicable, as there's no causal basis provided.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Not applicable, as there is no repetition of the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Not applicable, as there is no claim to universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Not directly applicable, no ambiguity identified.

**Determination:**

The defective argument presented by Person 2 fits the category of **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, as the reason provided ("she is not smart enough to even run a business") does not directly address or conclusively demonstrate anything about the proposition ("raising the minimum wage in our state").

### Conclusion:

The string "Person 1: 'I am for raising the minimum wage in our state.' Person 2: 'She is for raising the minimum wage, but she is not smart enough to even run a business.'" is classified as being of type **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason).
