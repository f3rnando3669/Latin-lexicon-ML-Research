To apply the process of decomposing the task <IDA> (the classification of the defective argument) into specific steps, we will create a structured method to analyze the given argument and identify its exact type of defect. Here's the decomposition process for identifying defective arguments (IDAA):

1. **Break Down the Argument**:
   - Identify the Proposition (<P>).
   - Determine the Reason (<R>).
   - Analyze for Proof of Reason (<PR>), if any.

2. **Identify Defects**:
   - Check if the argument generalizes (Generalization <G>).
   - Check for incomplete enumeration (Incomplete Enumeration <FE>).
   - Examine if the Reason is inconclusive (Inconclusive Reason <IR>).
   - Evaluate if the Reason presents a weak causal basis (Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>).
   - See if there's faulty repetition of the Proposition (Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>).
   - Determine if there's a presumptuous consensus presented as Proof (<FU>).
   - Check for ambiguous language use in the Proof (<DEP>).

Now we apply this systematic approach to the given argument:

**Argument**: "Jimmy has a fever, sinus congestion, a cough, and can’t come to school, so he probably has a test later today."

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Break Down the Argument

- **Proposition (<P>)**:
  - "Jimmy probably has a test later today."
  
- **Reason (<R>)**:
  - "Jimmy has a fever, sinus congestion, a cough, and can’t come to school."

#### 2. Identify Defects

- **Generalization (<G>)**: Does the argument make a broad statement based on limited instances?
  - No, the argument does not generalize from a small sample to a larger population.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Does the argument miss out on pertinent alternatives?
  - No enumeration is evident; the argument doesn't list possibilities.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Does the Reason (<R>) fail to conclusively support the Proposition (<P>)?
  - Yes, the symptoms (fever, sinus congestion, cough) and inability to come to school do not logically support the conclusion that "Jimmy probably has a test later today." This Reason does not have a logical connection to the Proposition.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Is the causal basis weak?
  - Yes, there is no clear causal link between having illness symptoms and having a test. This weakens the argument's causal basis.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Is the Proposition simply repeated in the Reason?
  - No, the Reason and Proposition are different statements.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Is a consensus assumed without evidence?
  - No presumptive consensus is invoked.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Is the language used potentially ambiguous?
  - No evident ambiguity in the language that would change the interpretation of the argument.

### Conclusion
The argument "Jimmy has a fever, sinus congestion, a cough, and can’t come to school, so he probably has a test later today" primarily fits the type:

- Inconclusive Reason (IR): The Reason presented does not logically lead to the conclusion (Proposition). The physical symptoms Jimmy exhibits cannot substantiate the assertion that he has a test later today.

- Additionally, there is also an aspect of Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), as the Reason does not establish a compelling causal link to the Proposition. 

Therefore, based on our decomposition and analysis, the defective argument types identified for the argument are <IR> and <WCB>.
