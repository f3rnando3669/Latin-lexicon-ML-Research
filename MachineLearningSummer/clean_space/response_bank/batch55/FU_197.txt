For 
Certainly! Let's apply the decomposition task \(<D>\) to the classification task \(<IDA>\) step by step for the given string \(<s>\): "Come on! Everyone else thinks the movie is great - you should too!"

### Decomposition Task \(<D>\) Applied to \(<IDA>\):

#### Step 1: Identify the components of the argument in \(<s>\)

- **Proposition \(\<P>\)**: The main claim we intend to prove.
- **Reason \(\<R>\)**: The causal basis used to support the proposition.
- **Proof of Reason \(\<PR>\)**: Additional arguments or evidence that corroborates the reason.

#### Step 2: Parse the given argument to extract \(\<P>, \<R>, \) and \(\<PR>\)
- **Proposition \(\<P>\)**: "You should think the movie is great."
- **Reason \(\<R>\)**: "Everyone else thinks the movie is great."
- **Proof of Reason \(\<PR>\)**: This part isn’t explicitly provided in the string, relying instead on the general claim of consensus.

#### Step 3: Determine if the argument is defective by matching it to known types (\<G>, \<FE>, \<IR>, \<RR>, \<WCB>, \<FU>, \<DEP>)

Let's evaluate it against the definitions:
- **Generalization \(\<G>\)**: This involves basing the proposition on an assertion applicable to some or a majority, but not all. This does not seem to fit the nature of the given argument.
- **Incomplete Enumeration \(\<FE>\)**: This argument doesn’t claim to enumerate all possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason \(\<IR>\)**: The reason provided could be seen as insufficient but let’s evaluate other types first.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis \(\<WCB>\)**: The causal basis here is weak but let’s see if it specifically matches other types.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition \(\<RR>\)**: The reason is different from the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus \(\<FU>\)**: The argument relies heavily on claiming a universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use \(\<DEP>\)**: The language is not ambiguous but please note this for a full evaluation.

#### Step 4: Classify the argument specifically based on the matches above
- The most fitting defective argument type for this scenario is:
  **Presumptuous Consensus \(\<FU>\)**: The argument assumes the movie is great simply because "everyone else" agrees, without providing evidence beyond the claimed consensus.

### Conclusion
Applying \(<IDAA>\) to the given string:

"Come on! Everyone else thinks the movie is great - you should too!"

- **Classification**: The argument is of type **\<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**.
