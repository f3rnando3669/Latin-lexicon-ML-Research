For 
To apply the process of IDAA (the decomposition of IDA into specific steps for the task of identifying the type of defective argument) to the string "The claim that because somebody famous supports an idea, the idea must be right. This fallacy is often used in advertising," we will proceed step by step as follows:

### Step 1: Understand and Parse the String
First, we need to understand the exact claim being made in the string. The string asserts a fallacy where the support of a famous person for an idea is taken as proof that the idea is right.

**Parsed Claim:** The idea must be right because somebody famous supports it.

### Step 2: Identify Potential Components
Given the structure of the argument, identify the parts as follows:
- **Proposition (P):** The idea must be right.
- **Reason (R):** Somebody famous supports the idea.

### Step 3: Determine If any Proofs of Reason (PR) are Given
In this particular claim, there is no additional argumentation or proof provided to support the reason. It relies solely on the authority of the famous person.

### Step 4: Compare Against Definitions of Defective Arguments
Now, we need to check the claim against the definitions of the defective argument types.

- **Generalization (G):** The argument does not generalize a proposition based on a subset of data.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument does not claim a complete list of possibilities but misses some.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason provided does not conclusively support the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis (support by a famous person) is weak for establishing the proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason is not a repetition of the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument does not assume a consensus to establish the proof.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language used in the argument is not ambiguous.

### Step 5: Conclusion Based on Definitions
- The argument essentially claims that the support of a famous person (R) leads to the truth of the proposition (P). This can be seen as an insufficient causal basis because the fame or authority of a person does not logically establish the truth of an idea.

#### Classification:
The presented defective argument type is **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because the reason provided (the support of a famous person) is weak and does not compellingly establish the truth of the proposition (the idea must be right).

### Final Answer:
The string "The claim that because somebody famous supports an idea, the idea must be right. This fallacy is often used in advertising." is of type **<WCB>**.
