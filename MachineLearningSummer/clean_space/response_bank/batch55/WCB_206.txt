For 
To apply \( IDAA \) (the application of decomposition to the classification task \( IDA \)) to the statement "Every time that rooster crows, the sun comes up. The rooster must control the sun," we will follow specific steps to decompose the task and identify the type of defective argument present.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( P \))**:
   - The proposition is: "The rooster must control the sun."

2. **Identify the Reason (\( R \))**:
   - The reason provided is: "Every time that rooster crows, the sun comes up."

3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (\( PR \))**:
   - In this case, there is no additional argument provided to corroborate the reason. 

4. **Classify the Defective Argument**:
   - Examine if the statement fits definitions of defective arguments \( <G> \), \( <FE> \), \( <IR> \), \( <RR> \), \( <WCB> \), \( <FU> \), or \( <DEP> \).

### Analysis:

#### 1. **Generalization (\( G \))**:
   - Not applicable. The statement does not generalize from a specific instance to a universal conclusion about all instances.

#### 2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\( FE \))**:
   - Not applicable. The statement does not enumerate possibilities exhaustively.

#### 3. **Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \))**:
   - Possibly applicable. The reason given does not conclusively prove the proposition. Just because two events are correlated (rooster crowing and sun rising), it does not establish causation.

#### 4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \))**:
   - Possibly applicable. The causal connection submitted (rooster crowing causing the sun to rise) is not compelling and lacks a logical basis.

#### 5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( RR \))**:
   - Not applicable. The reason is not just repeating the proposition.

#### 6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\( FU \))**:
   - Not applicable. The statement does not rely on the assumption that what is universally agreed upon must be true.

#### 7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\( DEP \))**:
   - Not applicable. The statement does not rely on ambiguous language that can be taken in another sense.

### Conclusion:

The defective argument types that seem applicable here are:

- **Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \))**: The reason provided (correlation between the rooster crowing and the sun rising) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (that the rooster controls the sun).
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \))**: The reason fails to establish a compelling causal basis for the proposition.

Given this analysis, the most fitting classification for "Every time that rooster crows, the sun comes up. The rooster must control the sun." would primarily be:

- **\( WCB \) (Insufficient Causal Basis)**

Moreover, it could also be categorized under **\( IR \) (Inconclusive Reason)** as a secondary classification. However, since \( WCB \) is more specific and directly addresses the weak causal link, it is the most suitable classification.
