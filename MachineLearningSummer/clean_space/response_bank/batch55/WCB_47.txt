For 
To apply <IDAA> to the argument provided, we need to decompose the task of classifying the argument as having one of the defective types into specific steps and then classify the actual argument accordingly. Let's proceed step by step.

### Step 1: Break down the argument into its components
1. **Proposition (P):** This is the main claim or conclusion of the argument.
   - In this case, the proposition is: "Chocolate helps keep your weight down."

2. **Reason (R):** This is the causal basis or justification for the proposition.
   - Here, the reason is: "Global chocolate consumption is highest in Switzerland, yet people there are among the trimmest in the industrialized world."

### Step 2: Evaluate the Reason's Causal Basis and Completeness
3. **Proof of Reason (PR):** Additional arguments or evidence supporting the reason could be considered, but in this case, there is none provided explicitly.
   - Therefore, we need to work with the existing reason provided.

### Step 3: Classify the Argument Using the Defective Types
Let's analyze the argument in the context of each defective argument type:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - Does the proposition make a general assumption about a specific case?
   - Although the statement about Switzerland is specific, the claim "chocolate helps keep your weight down" generalizes this relationship. This generalization doesn’t necessarily apply to everyone or consider all factors.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - Does the argument skip over some possible causes or considerations?
   - The argument focuses on one factor (chocolate consumption) and ignores other factors (such as overall diet, lifestyle, genetics, etc.) that can affect weight.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - Does the reason provided conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
   - The argument fails here because the correlation between chocolate consumption and trimness in Switzerland doesn’t necessarily imply causation. Other factors could be at play.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - Is the causal basis weak or not compelling?
   - The basis provided (high chocolate consumption and low average weight in Switzerland) is a weak causal basis since it does not establish a direct causal link between chocolate consumption and lower weight.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - Does the reason merely repeat the proposition?
   - The reason and proposition are not literal repetitions; therefore, this does not apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - Is there an assumed consensus that is still in dispute?
   - There is no mention of any universal agreement in this argument.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
   - Is the language used ambiguous or could the proof be taken in another sense?
   - The language is relatively clear in its intended meaning. Therefore, ambiguity does not seem to be an issue here.

### Step 4: Synthesize and Final Classification
Considering the analysis:

- **G (Generalization):** The argument generalizes from a specific case in Switzerland to a universal claim about chocolate and weight management.
- **IR (Inconclusive Reason):** The reason provided does not conclusively establish the correctness of the proposition.
- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The causal basis given is weak and not convincing.

Among these, the most fitting classification is **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason), since the primary flaw is that the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.

Therefore, the argument "Global chocolate consumption is highest in Switzerland, yet people there are among the trimmest in the industrialized world. Therefore, it’s reasonable to conclude that chocolate helps keep your weight down." is classified as having a defective argument type **<IR>**.
