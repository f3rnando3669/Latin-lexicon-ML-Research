For 
To apply **IDAA** (the decomposition of the task IDA into specific steps) to the string "Well, every one else jumped off the roof, why can't I?" we need to classify it as one of the defective argument types defined earlier: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>). Here's how to decompose and apply IDA step-by-step:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D):
1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - What is the central claim or assertion being made in the argument?

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - What is the causal basis or rationale given for believing the Proposition?

3. **Evaluate the Reason (R):**
   - Determine if the Reason conclusively supports the Proposition.
   - Check for any logical flaws or defects.

4. **Identify Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - Identify any additional arguments or evidence presented to corroborate the Reason.

5. **Classify the Defective Argument:**
   - Match any identified defects with the defined defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Application of IDAA to the String:
1. **Proposition (P):** 
   - "Why can't I jump off the roof?"
   - This is implied in the second part: "Why can't I?"

2. **Reason (R):**
   - "Everyone else jumped off the roof."
   - The Reason given is the behavior of others; it doesn’t directly support the safety or wisdom of the action, but rather assumes it based on others’ actions.

3. **Evaluate the Reason (R):**
   - The Reason does not provide a valid causal basis for the Proposition.
   - This suggests that the argument relies on the assumption that because others have done something, it must be permissible or correct.

4. **Identify Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - There is no additional evidence or argument provided to corroborate the Reason; the argument relies solely on the behavior of others.

5. **Classify the Defective Argument:**
   - The defect in this argument falls under **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**, which assumes something is correct because it is universally agreed upon or done by many, even though it is in dispute.

### Conclusion:
The string "Well, every one else jumped off the roof, why can't I?" can be classified as a **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** defective argument because it bases its Reason on the assumption that the action is permissible solely because others have done it, without providing a valid causal basis for making the action itself reasonable or safe.
