For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition process) to the task of classifying the argument presented in the conversation between Dustin and Ann, we need to follow a specific set of steps. Here is the step-by-step application:

### Step 1: Understanding the Argument Structure
- First, identify the key components of the argument.
  - Dustin's statement: "Why do you always deflect the argument by insulting me?"
  - Ann's response: "You're ugly and poor!"

### Step 2: Evaluating the Statements
- Determine the type of statements made by each participant.
  - Dustin is making an implicit claim (Proposition - \( P \)) that Ann is deflecting the argument by insulting him.
  - Ann's response is an ad hominem attack (a personal insult) and does not address Dustin's question or the initial argument.

### Step 3: Matching Against Defective Argument Types
- Verify if Ann's statement matches any defective argument types (\( G \), \( FE \), \( IR \), \( RR \), \( WCB \), \( FU \), \( DEP \)):
  - Identify if the response fits:
    - **Generalization (\( G \))**: Would involve an unwarranted general statement. This is not the case here.
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (\( FE \))**: Would involve listing possibilities incompletely. This is not the case here.
    - **Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \))**: Would involve an insufficient reason for the proposition. This is not the case either.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \))**: A weak causal basis for the proposition. Not relevant here.
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( RR \))**: Would involve repeating the same thing as the proposition. Not applicable.
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (\( FU \))**: Involves assuming a general consensus which is still in dispute. Not relevant.
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (\( DEP \))**: Involves ambiguous language. Not the issue here.

### Step 4: Identifying Ad Hominem Attack
- Recognize that Ann's response directly characterizes an ad hominem attack, which is a type of defective argument but isn’t distinctly defined in our list.

### Step 5: Concluding the Classification
- While Ann's response doesn't neatly fit into the defective argument types provided (\( G \), \( FE \), \( IR \), \( RR \), \( WCB \), \( FU \), \( DEP \)), it clearly demonstrates another common logical fallacy: **Ad Hominem**—attacking the person instead of addressing the argument.

### Step 6: Final Classification
- Given the options provided, and taking into consideration the nature of the discussion:
  - The best classification within the constraints given might be \( IR \) (Inconclusive Reason), as Ann's response does not demonstrate the correctness of Dustin's original proposition and instead resorts to personal attacks.

Therefore, applying IDAA, Ann's response "You're ugly and poor!" can be classified as:
**Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, since her insult does not address the argument made by Dustin, thus failing to provide a conclusive reason to rebut the proposition effectively.
