For 
To apply the IDAA process to the argument "Ross Geller, an evolutionary biologist and perhaps the foremost expert in the field, says that evolution is true. Therefore, it's true.", we need to decompose the task IDA (Identifying Defective Arguments) into specific steps.

Here’s how we can decompose and apply those steps:

### Decomposition of Task <IDA> into Specific Steps
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine what is being asserted or intended to be proven.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the causal basis for the Proposition.
3. **Identify Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Check for any additional arguments or evidence supporting the Reason.
4. **Determine the Type of Defective Argument**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: See if the assertion is based on an incomplete part or majority but claimed to apply universally.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Assess if the Proposition mistakenly claims to have considered all possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Check if the Reason fails to conclusively demonstrate the Proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: See if the Reason submits a weak causal basis for the Proposition.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Determine if the Reason merely repeats the Proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Identify if the Proof of Reason is claimed on the ground of universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Check if the language used in the Proof of Reason can be taken in another sense.

### Application of Decomposed Steps to the Given Argument
Let's apply these steps to identify the type of defective argument.

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Proposition: "Evolution is true."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Reason: "Ross Geller, an evolutionary biologist and perhaps the foremost expert in the field, says that evolution is true."

3. **Identify Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - There is no further proof of reason provided in the argument beyond the appeal to authority.

4. **Determine the Type of Defective Argument**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: This doesn’t involve an assertion based on an incomplete part or majority, so it’s not a generalization.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: There is no enumeration of possibilities, so it’s not an incomplete enumeration.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided (an expert's assertion) does not directly demonstrate the truth of evolution conclusively.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis - an expert's authority - is weak in compellingly proving the proposition.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The reason does not merely repeat the proposition; it adds the expert’s opinion.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: There is no consensus assumed or claimed, just the authority of one expert.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The language in the proof of reason is clear and not ambiguous.

Upon evaluation, the argument seems to fall into two potential defective argument types:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The expert’s opinion does not conclusively demonstrate the truth of the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reliance on expert opinion is not a compelling enough causal basis to establish the proposition’s truth.

Given these possible classifications, the more appropriate classification for the argument "Ross Geller, an evolutionary biologist and perhaps the foremost expert in the field, says that evolution is true. Therefore, it’s true." is:

**Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**

Thus, we can conclude that the argument suffers from having an insufficient causal basis.
