For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "To my knowledge, there are no studies supporting this approach. Therefore, I see no reason to change our routine," we will decompose the task of classifying the string as either type <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP> into specific steps. Here is the step-by-step decomposition and classification:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>) and the Reason (<R>)

- **Proposition (<P>)**: "I see no reason to change our routine."
- **Reason (<R>)**: "To my knowledge, there are no studies supporting this approach."

### Step 2: Determine if there is any supporting Proof of Reason (<PR>)

- There is no additional supporting argument presented; the statement directly ties the Reason to the Proposition without further corroboration.

### Step 3: Evaluate the Reason (<R>)

- **Reason Analysis**: "To my knowledge, there are no studies supporting this approach."

### Step 4: Classify the detected defective argument type by examining <R> and <P>

- **Generalization (<G>)**: Is <P> an assertion based on one part or majority, but not applicable to all? 
  - No, it doesn't generalize from a sample to a whole.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Does the statement claim to have made a complete enumeration of possibilities but miss some pertinent ones? 
  - Yes, it seems to suggest that the absence of studies (as known to the speaker) is conclusive, missing out potential studies that the speaker is unaware of.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Does <R> not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of <P>?
  - Yes, the lack of knowledge about studies does not conclusively demonstrate that no good reason exists for changing the routine.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Is the causal basis (knowledge of studies) not compelling enough?
  - Yes, the causal basis provided is weak because the speaker's lack of knowledge about studies doesn’t necessarily mean there are no valid reasons for a change.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Does <R> just repeat what <P> said?
  - No, <R> provides different information than <P>.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Is <R> assumed on the ground of "universal agreement" still in dispute?
  - No, the argument doesn't appeal to universal consensus.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Can <PR> be taken in another sense than intended?
  - No noticeable ambiguity is apparent in the usage.

### Step 5: Final Classification

The statement involves reasoning from an incomplete enumeration and inconclusive reason, possibly with an insufficient causal basis:
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Because the speaker’s knowledge is incomplete and doesn’t account for all possible studies.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Because the statement doesn’t conclusively prove the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Because the causal link between the lack of known studies and the decision not to change is weak.

Given these points, the primary defective argument types in this statement appear to be **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**, **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.

In conclusion, the string "To my knowledge, there are no studies supporting this approach. Therefore, I see no reason to change our routine." can primarily be classified as defective argument types <FE>, <IR>, and <WCB>.
