For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of IDA into specific steps) to the statement "Two words: New Coke," we need to break down the task into a series of steps to classify this string as one of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>). Here's the detailed step-by-step decomposition and classification process:

**Step 1: Identify the components in the statement.**
- "Two words: New Coke" is a very brief statement that refers to the product "New Coke."

**Step 2: Determine if the statement includes a Proposition (<P>).**
- This statement appears to make an implied proposition or assertion. The implied <P> might be: "New Coke is a bad product," based on context and common understanding.

**Step 3: Look for an explicit or implicit Reason (<R>).**
- The statement does not provide an explicit reason. The brevity suggests that the statement relies on the audience's prior knowledge of the negative reception of "New Coke."

**Step 4: Examine if there is any Proof of Reason (<PR>).**
- There is no explicit proof or detailed reasoning offered in the statement.

**Step 5: Classify the type of defective argument.**
Now we examine how the statement fits into the defective argument types:

- **<G> (Generalization):**
   - There is no explicit generalization in the statement, but it may imply one if the failure of "New Coke" is taken to represent the failure of all such marketing changes.

- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):**
   - The statement does not try to enumerate possibilities, so <FE> does not apply.

- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):**
   - Since no reason is given, it cannot be classified as <IR>.

- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):**
   - No causal basis is provided, so this type does not apply either.

- **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):**
   - The statement does not repeat the proposition, so it cannot be <RR>.

- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):**
   - The statement "Two words: New Coke" assumes that the audience already agrees with the implied negative assessment, using a form of implied universal consensus. Hence, it leans towards <FU>.

- **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):**
   - The statement does not present ambiguity in language; "New Coke" is specifically referring to the product, so <DEP> does not apply.

**Final Classification:**
The statement "Two words: New Coke" seems to leverage the audience's shared knowledge and understanding of "New Coke's" historical reception, assuming universal agreement on the negative implication without providing reasoning or evidence.

Therefore, the defective argument type best fitting "Two words: New Coke" is **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**.
