For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying defective arguments) to the given string "Primitive people believed in gods to explain natural phenomena. We have science, and are not primitive anymore. Therefore, there is no God.", we need to break down the task into specific steps and then follow those steps to classify the argument as one of the defective argument types.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for IDA Classification (IDAA):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine what is being asserted or intended to be proven.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Determine the causal basis provided for the Proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**: Determine any supporting arguments or evidence provided for the Reason.
4. **Evaluate for Defective Argument Types**:
   - Check for Generalization (G)
   - Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
   - Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR)
   - Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
   - Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
   - Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
   - Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)
5. **Classify the Argument**: Assign the appropriate defective argument type.

### Applying IDAA:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)

The proposition here is: "**Therefore, there is no God.**"

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)

The reason provided is: "**Primitive people believed in gods to explain natural phenomena. We have science, and are not primitive anymore.**"

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)

The string does not provide any additional supporting argument to corroborate the Reason, beyond the assertion itself.

#### Step 4: Evaluate for Defective Argument Types

- **Generalization (G)**: Not applicable here. The argument does not generalize a property observed in some individuals to all.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable here. The argument does not attempt to enumerate possibilities.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The Reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition. The fact that primitive people had certain beliefs and that we now have science does not logically conclude that there are no gods.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Not applicable here. The Reason provided does not simply repeat the Proposition.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis (i.e., the transition from primitive belief to modern science) is weak and not compelling. The argument lacks sufficient proof that scientific progress negates the existence of gods.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Not applicable here. The Reason does not rely on the assumption that something is universally agreed upon.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Not applicable here. The language used is not ambiguous in a way that affects the argument.

#### Step 5: Classify the Argument

Based on the evaluation, the argument falls under **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the Reason provided does not conclusively establish the truth of the Proposition. Additionally, it falls under **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because the causal basis offered is not compelling enough to support the conclusion drawn.

### Conclusion

The string "Primitive people believed in gods to explain natural phenomena. We have science, and are not primitive anymore. Therefore, there is no God." is classified as containing defective arguments of type **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
