For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given argument between Martin and Charlie, we need to decompose the argument classification task <IDA> into specific steps (this is the application of <D> to <IDA>). Here’s how we can approach it step by step:

### Step 1: Identify and Extract Propositions
First, we identify and extract the key propositions (<P>) within the discussion.

**Martin’s Proposition:**
"P: All white people are not racists."

**Charlie’s Proposition:**
"P: All white people are racists."

### Step 2: Extract the Reasons (<R>) Provided to Support the Propositions

**Martin’s Reason:**
Since Martin’s statement is a proposition and no explicit reason is given, there is no reason directly associated with Martin's statement in the provided dialogue.

**Charlie’s Reason:**
Charlie provides a reason attacking Martin’s motive rather than his claim.
"R: You just believe that because you are white."

### Step 3: Identify Proof of Reasons (<PR>)

There are no additional proofs of reason provided. Therefore, we consider the dialogue based on what exists (propositions and reasons).

### Step 4: Classification of Defective Arguments

Now let’s classify each part of the argument into one of the defective argument types:

#### Martin’s Argument
- Proposition (P): "All white people are not racists."

Upon review, Martin's argument falls under:
- **<G> (Generalization):** Martin’s statement is a generalization about all white people, based on an unspecified subset of the group.

#### Charlie’s Argument
- Proposition (P): "All white people are racists."
- Reason (R): "You just believe that because you are white."

Charlie’s argument includes:
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** The reason provided by Charlie does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. Instead, it is an ad hominem attack (attacking the individual instead of addressing the argument's merit).
- **<G> (Generalization):** Similar to Martin’s proposition, Charlie’s statement is also a broad generalization about all white people.

### Step 5: Montaigne Connect (likely another advanced reasoning connection in recognizing <Dab> for higher reasoning defined by IDEA), exemplified.

However, we are tasked mainly to classify Martins and Charlies discussion into recognized defective categories.

### Final Classification:
- **Martin’s Argument Classification:** <G> (Generalization)
- **Charlie’s Argument Classification:** <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <G> (Generalization)

Thus, applying <IDAA> to this argument, we identify and classify defective argument types for Martin and Charlie's discussion based on the steps outlined.
