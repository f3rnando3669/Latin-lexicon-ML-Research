Sure, let's apply the decomposition of the task of classifying the defective argument type to the given statement. Here are the steps involved in decomposing and classifying the argument:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
The Proposition <P> in the argument is:
- "Drinking water causes death."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
The Reason <R> in the argument is:
- "Every person who has ever drunk water has died."

### Step 3: Determine the Type of Defective Argument

Now we need to analyze the Reason <R> and see how it relates to the Proposition <P>. We'll do this by checking if it matches any of the defined defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**
   - This is when an assertion based on a part or a majority is applied to all.
   - Here, the assertion is about "every person who has ever drunk water," which seems to encompass all individuals, so it doesn't fit the definition of <G>.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
   - This is when a supposedly complete enumeration misses some pertinent possibilities.
   - The enumeration (everyone who drank water) seems exhaustive, so it doesn't fit <FE>.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
   - This is when the Reason <R> does not conclusively demonstrate the Proposition <P>.
   - The Reason provided (“Every person who has ever drunk water has died.”) is meant to imply causation but doesn’t establish it conclusively. It shows correlation, not causation.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
   - This is when the Reason <R> is not compelling as a causal basis for the Proposition <P>.
   - The Reason provided might suggest a correlation but doesn’t provide a compelling causal link. Therefore, the idea that drinking water causes death is not sufficiently established just by stating that everyone who drank water has died. There could be other factors involved.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**
   - This is when the Reason <R> merely repeats the Proposition <P>.
   - The argument does not merely repeat the same thing in different wording.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
   - This is when the Proof of Reason <PR> is taken as certain because it is "universally agreed upon".
   - This argument does not rely on consensus or universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**
   - This is when the Proof of Reason <PR> can be taken in another sense than intended.
   - The language is clear and not ambiguous.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument
Based on the analysis above, the argument fits two defect categories:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the Proposition because correlation (everyone who drank water has died) does not equal causation.

2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The Reason is weak because simply noting that everyone who has drunk water has died does not sufficiently establish that drinking water causes death; there could be many other factors leading to death.

### Conclusion
The defective argument type is primarily classified as:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**

Both defects apply to this argument because it fails to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition and lacks a compelling causal explanation.
