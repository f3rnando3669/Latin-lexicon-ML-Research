For 
To apply IDAA to "Most people believe in ghosts, so ghosts are real," we need to decompose the task of classifying this argument's type into specific steps. Here are the steps and the application:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine what the argument is asserting or what we intend to prove.
   - In this case: "\<P> is 'ghosts are real.'"

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine the causal basis or reason presented in support of the Proposition.
   - In this case: "\<R> is 'Most people believe in ghosts.'"

3. **Examine the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - If there is any corroboration, additional evidence, or argument corroborating the Reason, identify it.
   - In this case, there isn't an explicit \<PR>; the assertion relies entirely on the reason provided.

4. **Evaluate for Defective Argument Types:**
   - Assess whether the Reason (\<R>) or Proposition (\<P>) fits any of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>).

   Let's go through each defective argument type:

   - **Generalization (<G>):** Is the argument generalizing from a non-representative sample?
     - Not applicable here since the argument isn't generalizing from a sample.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Is the argument assuming a complete enumeration of possibilities but missing some?
     - Not applicable here as the argument isn't enumerating possibilities.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Is the reason provided not conclusively demonstrating the correctness of the Proposition?
     - This may apply because the belief of most people does not logically demonstrate the reality of ghosts.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Is the causal basis presented weak or not compelling?
     - This may also apply because "belief" is weak evidence for the existence of something.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Does the reason simply restate the proposition in different words?
     - Not applicable here as the reason is not a repetition of the proposition.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Is the argument assuming universal agreement as proof?
     - This is applicable as the argument assumes that because most people believe in ghosts, it should be accepted as true, a form of appeal to popular opinion.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Is there ambiguous language causing misunderstanding?
     - Not applicable here, as the language is quite straightforward.

5. **Classify the Defective Argument:**
   - Based on the analysis, the strongest classifications of the defective argument type for "Most people believe in ghosts, so ghosts are real" are:
     - **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason): The reason does not conclusively demonstrate ghosts' reality.
     - **<WCB>** (Insufficient Causal Basis): The causal basis (belief) is weak evidence for the existence of ghosts.
     - **<FU>** (Presumptuous Consensus): The argument presumes that a commonly held belief can stand in for actual evidence.

Conclusion:

The argument "Most people believe in ghosts, so ghosts are real" most appropriately fits the defective argument types <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis), and <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).
