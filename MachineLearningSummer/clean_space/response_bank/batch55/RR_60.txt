For 
To apply IDAA to the statement "Sandra tells her mom, 'I deserve to have a later curfew, so you should let me stay out until 10pm!'", we need to follow a step-by-step process to classify the argument using the defective argument types defined earlier. 

### Step 1: Identify the Components
First, identify the components of the argument as per Proposition, Reason, and Proof of Reason definitions:
- **Proposition (P)**: "I deserve to have a later curfew."
- **Reason (R)**: "You should let me stay out until 10pm."

### Step 2: Analyze for Defective Argument Types
Check each defective argument type against the given argument.

#### Generalization (G)
- **Definition**: When the Proposition is an assertion based on one part or a majority of individuals, but not necessarily applicable to all.
- **Analysis**: Sandra's argument does not involve generalizing a part to a whole group.

#### Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
- **Definition**: When claiming a complete enumeration of possibilities, but actually missing pertinent ones.
- **Analysis**: Sandra's argument does not involve incomplete enumeration of possibilities.

#### Inconclusive Reason (IR)
- **Definition**: When the Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.
- **Analysis**: The reason "you should let me stay out until 10pm" is not conclusively justifying why Sandra deserves a later curfew. It assumes that staying out until 10pm proves her deserving the curfew without providing logical reasoning or evidence.

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
- **Definition**: When the causal basis submitted for the Proposition is not compelling.
- **Analysis**: The causal link ("you should let me stay out until 10pm" as a basis for "I deserve to have a later curfew") is weak and not compelling.

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
- **Definition**: When the Reason says precisely the same as was said in the Proposition.
- **Analysis**: The Reason "you should let me stay out until 10pm" is not exactly a repetition of "I deserve to have a later curfew." 

#### Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
- **Definition**: Assuming the Proof of Reason is certain because "it is universally agreed upon," even though it is still in dispute.
- **Analysis**: Sandra's argument does not assume consensus or appeal to a universally agreed idea.

#### Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)
- **Definition**: When the Proof of Reason can be taken in a different sense than the speaker intended.
- **Analysis**: There's no ambiguous language usage that changes the intended meaning in Sandra's argument.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Based on the analysis, Sandra's argument most closely matches the defective argument type of:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

The statement "I deserve to have a later curfew" is not conclusively supported by the reason "so you should let me stay out until 10pm", and the causal basis provided does not compellingly support the proposition.
