For 
To apply IDAA (the application of the decomposition of a task into specific steps) to the classification task IDA (classifying the argument as one of the defective argument types), let's break it down:

### Step 1: Identify the Argument and Its Components
First, we need to properly understand and identify the components of the argument "Either we go to war, or we appear weak".

### Step 2: Analyze the Structure and Content
Examine the structure and content to identify the Proposition (P), Reason (R), and Proof of Reason (PR) if present.

### Step 3: Compare Against Defective Argument Types
Compare the identified components against the definitions of defective argument types to classify the argument appropriately.

### Step 4: Conclude the Classification
Based on the analysis and comparison, determine which defective argument type best fits the given argument.

### Step-by-Step Application

**Step 1: Identify the Argument and Its Components**

The argument "Either we go to war, or we appear weak" is a type of disjunctive statement, presenting two alternatives. 

**Step 2: Analyze the Structure and Content**

- **Proposition (P):** "We should go to war."
- **Reason (R):** "Because if we don't, we will appear weak."
  
This argument is suggesting a forced choice between two outcomes.

**Step 3: Compare Against Defective Argument Types**

- **Generalization (G):** This doesn't seem to apply, as the argument isn’t generalizing a specific case to all cases.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This seems more likely because the argument presents only two options (going to war or appearing weak). It does not consider other possibilities such as diplomatic actions, sanctions, or negotiations.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason doesn’t conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. The argument doesn't necessarily prove that the only alternatives are going to war or appearing weak.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal link between not going to war and appearing weak is assumed but not substantiated in the argument.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This doesn't apply here, as the reason isn't just a repetition of the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** No consensus is assumed in this argument.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The terms in the argument aren’t particularly ambiguous; they are straightforward.

**Step 4: Conclude the Classification**

Given the analysis, the most fitting classification would be:

**Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**

This is because the argument presents a false dichotomy by only acknowledging two possibilities and neglecting to consider other relevant and possible options.

So, according to the IDAA (application of D to IDA) process, the argument "Either we go to war, or we appear weak" is classified as:
**Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
