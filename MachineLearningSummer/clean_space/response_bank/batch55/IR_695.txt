For 
To apply the decomposition of the task of classifying the defective argument type (IDA) to the given argument ("This theory originally occurred to a scientist in the form of a dream; therefore it cannot be valid."), we'll follow these steps. Here's the step-by-step process (D):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P) and the Reason (R)**:
   - **Proposition (P)**: This theory cannot be valid.
   - **Reason (R)**: This theory originally occurred to a scientist in the form of a dream.

2. **Determine if there's any Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   - **Proof of Reason (PR)**: There is no additional proof provided for the reason.

3. **Evaluate if the Reason (R) supports the Proposition (P)**:
   - We need to evaluate if "This theory originally occurred to a scientist in the form of a dream" conclusively supports "This theory cannot be valid."

4. **Classify the defective argument type** based on the definitions given:
   - **Generalization (G)**: This type does not fit since the argument is not making a broad claim based on some individuals.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This type does not fit as there is no mention of missing out on all possible options or variables.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Evaluate if the reason provided is inconclusive in demonstrating the correctness of the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Evaluate if the reason lacks a compelling causal basis for the proposition.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This does not fit since the reason is not a mere restatement of the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This does not fit since there is no appeal to consensus.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: This does not fit as the language used is not ambiguous.

Given these steps, let's narrow down the possibilities:

- The reason "This theory originally occurred to a scientist in the form of a dream" does not conclusively support the proposition "This theory cannot be valid." There is an assumed correlation between the origin of the theory and its validity, but this assumption does not provide a conclusive reason.
- Additionally, the reason does not present a strong, compelling causal basis to discredit the theory merely because of its origin in a dream.

Therefore, the defective argument type for this example can be identified primarily as:

**Inconclusive Reason (IR)**

Another possible classification, though secondary, could be:

**Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

However, between these two, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** is the more strongly applicable classification.
