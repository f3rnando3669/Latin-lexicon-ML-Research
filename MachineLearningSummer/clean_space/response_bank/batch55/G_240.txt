Sure, let's use the defined terms and steps to classify the given string "Avoid Latam Airlines. Their planes are always late" as a specific type of defective argument.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (Applying \( \text{IDAA} \) to \( \text{IDA} \)):

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( \text{P} \)):**
   - The proposition (\( \text{P} \)) sets forth what we intend to prove.
   - In this case, \( \text{P} \) is: "Avoid Latam Airlines."

2. **Identify the Reason (\( \text{R} \)):**
   - The reason (\( \text{R} \)) sets forth the causal basis for \( \text{P} \), establishing the truth of what we are urging.
   - In this case, \( \text{R} \) is: "Their planes are always late."

3. **Classify the Defective Argument Type (Identify \( \text{G} \), \( \text{FE} \), \( \text{IR} \), \( \text{RR} \), \( \text{WCB} \), \( \text{FU} \), or \( \text{DEP} \)):**
   - Let's review each defective argument type and see which one fits the given case:

   - **\( \text{G} \) (Generalization):** The argument is based on an assertion from one or a majority of individuals but not necessarily applicable to all.
     - "Their planes are always late" is a generalization because it suggests that all planes of Latam Airlines are always late based on possibly limited or anecdotal evidence.
   - **\( \text{FE} \) (Incomplete Enumeration):** The argument claims to have considered all possibilities but misses out on some.
     - This does not apply as there is no claim of having considered all factors.
   - **\( \text{IR} \) (Inconclusive Reason):** The reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
     - The reason provided is specific enough to be considered conclusive in the given context.
   - **\( \text{RR} \) (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** The reason is simply restating the proposition.
     - This does not apply here because the reason and the proposition are different.
   - **\( \text{WCB} \) (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The causal basis is not compelling.
     - The reason might lack data but is based on a causal assertion.
   - **\( \text{FU} \) (Presumptuous Consensus):** The proof is assumed as certain based on universal agreement, which is still in dispute.
     - No claim of universal agreement is made here.
   - **\( \text{DEP} \) (Ambiguous Language Use):** The proof can be understood in different ways.
     - There seems to be no ambiguity in the statement.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The defect in the argument is due to its nature of making a sweeping generalization about all planes of Latam Airlines being always late.
   - Therefore, the given string "Avoid Latam Airlines. Their planes are always late" can be classified as a **Generalization (G)**.

So, the fallacy in the given argument is a **Generalization (G)**.
