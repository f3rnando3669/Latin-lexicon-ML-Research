For 
To apply the IDAA (decomposition and classification) process to the given argument "Yes, I do think that all drunk drivers should go to prison, but your honor, he is my son! He is a good boy who just made a mistake!" we need to break down the task into specific steps. Letâ€™s proceed step-by-step:

### Step 1: Decompose <IDA> into Specific Steps (<D> of <t>)

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Determine what the argument is intending to prove.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Determine the causal basis (reason) given to support the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - Identify if there are any additional arguments or proofs corroborating the reason.

4. **Classify the Argument Type**:
   - Analyze the argument to determine if it falls into one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step 2: Apply These Steps to Given Argument

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - In the statement: "Yes, I do think that all drunk drivers should go to prison, but your honor, he is my son! He is a good boy who just made a mistake!"
   - Proposition (<P>): "All drunk drivers should go to prison."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Reason (<R>): "He is my son! He is a good boy who just made a mistake!"

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - There is no specific additional argument or proof provided; the reason stands alone in support of the proposition.

4. **Classify the Argument Type**:
   - Evaluate the relationship between the (<P>) and the (<R>):
     - <P>: All drunk drivers should go to prison.
     - <R>: He is my son! He is a good boy who just made a mistake!

   The Reason (<R>) provided ("He is my son! He is a good boy who just made a mistake!") does not conclusively demonstrate why the proposition ("All drunk drivers should go to prison") should be invalid for this particular case. It appears to be an emotional appeal rather than a rational rebuttal to the proposition.

### Conclusion from Analysis:
- This argument seems to be an example of **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**:
   - The reason given does not logically or conclusively support a deviation from the general proposition. The fact that the defendant is the speaker's son and perceived as a good boy does not provide a causally sufficient basis to challenge the overarching principle that all drunk drivers should go to prison.

Therefore, the classification of the argument "Yes, I do think that all drunk drivers should go to prison, but your honor, he is my son! He is a good boy who just made a mistake!" is of type **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**.
