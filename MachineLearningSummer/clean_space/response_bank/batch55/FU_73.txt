For 
To apply **IDAA** to the statement "Trying the latest social media challenge is a good example of what logical fallacy?", we need to decompose the task of classifying the string into specific steps. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Task (IDA - Classification)

The goal is to classify the argument presented in the statement as one of the defectives types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step 2: Analyze the Statement

We need to identify the structure of the argument within the statement.

### Step 3: Identify the Proposition <P>

The proposition in this context is the implicit claim being made about the social media challenge:
- Proposition (<P>): "Trying the latest social media challenge is a good example of what logical fallacy?"

### Step 4: Determine if a Reason <R> is Provided

Next, we need to determine if the reason or causal basis (<R>) for the proposition is provided or implied in the statement:
- The statement doesn't explicitly provide a reason. It implies the general behavior associated with social media challenges without elaborating.

### Step 5: Evaluate if the Argument Fits Defective Types

Now, let's see if the argument in the statement fits any of the defective argument types:
1. **<G> Generalization**: The statement doesn't explicitly base an assertion on a small sample.
2. **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: No enumeration of possibilities is presented.
3. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: No conclusive reason is provided; it’s more of an implied general behavior.
4. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: There isn’t an explicit weak causal basis as one is not provided.
5. **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: The statement doesn’t repeat itself.
6. **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: The statement seems to imply that trying social media challenges is universally seen as a fallacy without actually having a consensus.
7. **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: The language does not appear ambiguous.

### Step 6: Decompose the Faulty Type

From the analysis, it seems that the argument best fits the defective argument type **FU (Presumptuous Consensus)** because it assumes a universal agreement about social media challenges being fallacies without providing evidence or defining the fallacy.

### Step 7: Complete the Classification

Based on the analysis, we classify the statement as type **<FU>**.

### Summary of Decomposition and Result

- **Decomposition Steps:**
  1. Understand the task.
  2. Analyze the statement.
  3. Identify the proposition (<P>).
  4. Determine if a reason (<R>) is provided.
  5. Evaluate the argument against defective types.
  6. Decompose and identify the fitting faulty type.
  7. Complete the classification.

- **Result:**
  The statement "Trying the latest social media challenge is a good example of what logical fallacy?" is classified as **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**.
