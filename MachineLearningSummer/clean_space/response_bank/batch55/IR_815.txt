For 
To apply IDAA to the string "You are not a credible resource person. You haven't finished college," we need to go through the specific steps of decomposing the task of classifying this argument into one of our defective argument types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine what is being asserted or claimed.
   
   - Proposition (<P>): "You are not a credible resource person."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the causal basis or reason provided for the proposition.
   
   - Reason (<R>): "You haven't finished college."

3. **Analyze the relationship between <P> and <R>**: Determine which defective argument type, if any, describes the relationship between the proposition and the reason. Hereâ€™s our decomposition:

   - **Generalization (<G>)**: Check if the proposition is a broad assertion based on insufficient or overly broad evidence.
     - In this case, the assertion about credibility is based on a single factor (not finishing college), but it does not necessarily generalize beyond this individual example.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Examine if the reason implicitly claims to consider all possibilities, but clearly misses some.
     - The reason here does not enumerate multiple possibilities, so this does not apply.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Assess if the reason provided fails to conclusively support the proposition.
     - Not finishing college does not conclusively demonstrate that someone cannot be a credible resource person. There are many credible persons who may not have finished college.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Determine if the reason provided is not a compelling causal basis for the proposition.
     - The reason, "You haven't finished college," is weak and insufficient as a causal basis to claim someone is not credible, as credibility can be established through various other factors besides formal education.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Check if the reason just repeats the proposition in other words.
     - The reason does not repeat the proposition; it presents a different statement about educational attainment.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Look for an assumption that something is universally agreed upon without it actually being undisputed.
     - There is no claim of universal agreement here.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Examine if the reason uses ambiguous language that can be interpreted differently than intended.
     - The language is fairly straightforward, not ambiguous.

4. **Classify the Argument**: Based on the analysis, classify the argument into one of the defective types.
   
   - The most fitting classification for "You are not a credible resource person. You haven't finished college." is **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The reason given does not provide a compelling or sufficient causal basis to support the assertion that not finishing college renders someone not credible.

Therefore, the classification of the string as per IDAA is: **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
