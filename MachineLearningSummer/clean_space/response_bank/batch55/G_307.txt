For 
To apply the process of <IDAA> (the application of the decomposition of tasks to the classification of defective arguments) to the string "All robins have red breasts," we will break down this task step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P> in the String
The string "All robins have red breasts" itself is the proposition we are examining. 

### Step 2: Analyze the Nature of the Proposition <P>
Examine the content of the proposition to identify if it is making a general or specific claim:
- "All robins have red breasts" seems to be making a general claim about all robins.

### Step 3: Classify the Argument Type
Given the definitions provided for defective arguments, we need to check which type of defective argument this string corresponds to. We will compare it against each type:

- **Generalization (G):** 
  - Here, the proposition claims that a characteristic observed in some or most robins (having red breasts) applies to all robins.
  - This fits the definition of a Generalization, where an assertion based on some or a majority of individuals is applied to all.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
  - The proposition does not attempt to enumerate possibilities, but rather makes a blanket statement about a trait of robins.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
  - There is no explicit reasoning provided in the string, so this type is not applicable here.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
  - Again, causal basis is not provided in the string, excluding this type as well.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
  - The proposition does not include a Reason that repeats the Proposition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
  - There is no presumption of universal agreement stated in the proposition.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
  - The language in the proposition does not appear to be ambiguous or open to multiple interpretations without further context.

### Step 4: Final Classification
Based on the analysis, we classify "All robins have red breasts" as a Generalization (<G>), since it takes an observed trait (having red breasts) and asserts that it applies to all members of the group (all robins).

### Summary
Applying <IDAA> to the string "All robins have red breasts" shows that it is best classified as a Generalization (<G>).
