To apply the process of IDAA (which involves decomposing the task of classifying a string as a defective argument and then performing that classification), we will follow a series of steps:

### Step 1: Decomposing the Task (D)
Let's break down the task of classifying the argument into specific steps:
1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Extract the assertion being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Extract the causal basis or reasoning presented to support the proposition.
3. **Corroborate with Proof of Reason (PR)**: Evaluate any additional arguments or evidence presented to support the reason.
4. **Identify Possible Defects**: Match the argument to one of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

### Step 2: Apply the Decomposition to the Given Argument
The argument provided is: "Every time I go to sleep, the sun goes down. Therefore, my going to sleep causes the sun to set."

#### Step 2.1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The proposition here is: "My going to sleep causes the sun to set."

#### Step 2.2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason given is: "Every time I go to sleep, the sun goes down."

#### Step 2.3: Evaluate for Proof of Reason (PR)
There is no additional evidence or arguments provided to support the reason. It is stated as an observation.

#### Step 2.4: Identify Possible Defects
- **Generalization (G)**: The argument is not asserting something based on an incomplete sample. This is not applicable here.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument is not attempting to enumerate all possibilities. This is not applicable here.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This seems to be a key issue because the relationship between going to sleep and the sunset is coincidental rather than causal, and the reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason is not a mere repetition of the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The reason does not provide a compelling causal basis for the proposition; the correlation observed is spurious and does not justify causation.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There's no mention of universal agreement needed to support the proposition.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The terms used are clear and not ambiguous.

### Step 3: Classification
Based on the analysis, the defects that apply here are:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason ("Every time I go to sleep, the sun goes down") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition ("My going to sleep causes the sun to set").
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis submitted (the observed correlation) is not strong enough to establish a compelling cause-effect relationship.

### Conclusion
The argument "Every time I go to sleep, the sun goes down. Therefore, my going to sleep causes the sun to set." is classified as:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

These defects indicate that the reasoning provided in the argument does not conclusively support the proposition and lacks a compelling causal basis.
