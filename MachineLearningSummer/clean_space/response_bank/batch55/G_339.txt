For 
To apply the process of classification (IDA) to determine the type of defective argument in the statement "All four year olds talk too much," we need to decompose (D) the task step by step (IDAA). Here are the specific steps for decomposition and classification:

### Step 1: Understand the Structure and Components
- **Proposition (P):** This is the assertion we are examining.
  - **P:** "All four year olds talk too much."

### Step 2: Identify the Relevant Type of Defective Argument
- Examine the assertion for any characteristics that match those of the defective argument types defined.

### Step 3: Cross-Check with Definitions of Defective Arguments
1. **Generalization (G):** An assertion based on one or some individuals, but applied to all.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Claiming to have considered all possibilities, but missing out on some.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason provided does not conclusively support the proposition.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reason given for the proposition is not compelling.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason given is a mere repetition of the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Assuming something is universally agreed upon when it is still disputed.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Use of language that can be interpreted in another sense than intended.

### Step 4: Determine the Best Classification
- Assess "All four year olds talk too much" against the defective argument definitions.

#### Evaluation:
- **Generalization (G):** The assertion claims that "all" four-year-olds exhibit a behavior (talking too much) based on observations that may not hold true for every individual in that age group. This fits the pattern of a generalization.
- The other types of defective arguments (FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP) do not fit as well since they involve issues with reasoning, enumeration, or assumptions rather than the broad application of an attribute from some to all.

### Step 5: Conclude the Classification
- The defective argument type that best fits the statement "All four year olds talk too much" is:

\[
<s> \text{ = "All four year olds talk too much"} \rightarrow (G)
\]

### Final Classification

- The statement "All four year olds talk too much" is classified under **Generalization (G)**.
