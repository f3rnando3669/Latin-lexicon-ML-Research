For 
To apply the IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying the string into specific steps) to the sentence "My sister loves shopping, so all girls must love to shop too," we will follow a systematic process of breaking down the analysis:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition (<P>) is "all girls must love to shop."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason (<R>) given is "My sister loves shopping."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Argument Structure

Given the structure of the argument:
- Proposition (<P>): "all girls must love to shop"
- Reason (<R>): "My sister loves shopping"

### Step 4: Classify Potential Defective Argument Types

We will review the definitions of each defective argument type and see if they apply to this argument:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** This occurs when the proposition is an assertion based on some one part or on a majority of individuals, but not necessarily applicable to all.
   - **Application to String:** The argument is concluding that because "My sister loves shopping," therefore "all girls must love to shop." This is taking a specific instance and applying it to all.

Since the conclusion is based on a single instance (one sister) and extending it to all girls, this correctly fits the definition of a Generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This occurs when there's a claim to have made a complete enumeration of possibilities but misses some pertinent ones.
   - **Application to String:** There is no enumeration of possibilities being claimed in this argument, so it does not fit this defective type.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This occurs when the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
   - **Application to String:** While "My sister loves shopping" does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that "all girls must love to shop," this is more accurately a case of generalization rather than being inconclusive directly.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This occurs when the reason is weak because the causal basis for the proposition is not compelling.
   - **Application to String:** The causal basis (one sister) for the proposition (all girls) is indeed weak, however, this particular case is a particular sub-type of weak basis, specifically generalization.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This occurs when the reason is essentially a restatement of the proposition.
   - **Application to String:** The reason ("My sister loves shopping") does not repeat the proposition ("all girls must love to shop"), so it does not fit this category.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This occurs when the proof of reason is assumed as certain, under the belief that it is universally agreed upon.
   - **Application to String:** The argument does not invoke unanimity or consensus, so it does not fit this category.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** This occurs when the proof of reason can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended.
   - **Application to String:** There is no evidence of ambiguous language or double meaning.

### Step 5: Make a Final Classification

After evaluating the argument against the definitions of the defective argument types, we conclude that the string "My sister loves shopping, so all girls must love to shop too" is a **Generalization (<G>)**. 

Thus, the classification of the string <s> as per the IDAA process is: **<G> (Generalization).**
