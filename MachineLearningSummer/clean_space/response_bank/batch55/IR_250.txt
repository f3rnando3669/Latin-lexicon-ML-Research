To apply the process of IDAA to the statement "Since Dwayne Johnson (aka The Rock) endorsed this protein powder, it must work wonders," we need to decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps. Here is the breakdown of the process:

### Task Decomposition for IDAA (D):
1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine the main assertion that the argument is trying to prove.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Determine the causal basis provided for the Proposition.
3. **Classify the Argument Type**: Determine if the argument fits one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.
4. **Provide Justification**: Explain why the argument falls under the identified category.

### Step-by-Step Application:
1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - The main assertion in the given statement is: "this protein powder must work wonders."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - The causal basis provided for the proposition is: "Since Dwayne Johnson (aka The Rock) endorsed this protein powder."

3. **Classify the Argument Type**:
   - Examine how the Reason (R) attempts to support the Proposition (P).
   - The argument assumes that because a celebrity endorses a product, the product must be effective, ignoring the need for actual evidence of the product's efficacy.

4. **Provide Justification**:
   - The argument falls under the category of <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
   - **Explanation**: The Reason (Dwayne Johnson's endorsement) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition (that the protein powder works wonders). Celebrity endorsement does not inherently establish the truth of the product's effectiveness.

Based on this breakdown, we can classify the argument as an Inconclusive Reason (IR) because the reason provided does not conclusively prove the proposition.
