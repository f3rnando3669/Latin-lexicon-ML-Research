Applying <IDAA> involves decomposing the task of classifying a string (in this case, "That candidate wants to raise the minimum wage, but they aren't even smart enough to run a business.") as a defective argument into specific steps. Here is a structured approach to achieve this:

### Step 1: Identify the Components of the Argument
1. **Proposition (P)**: Determine the main assertion that is being made.
2. **Reason (R)**: Identify the causal basis or reasoning provided to support <P>.

### Step 2: Analyze the <P> and <R> for Defective Argument Types
- **Generalization (G)**: Look for broad assertions based on limited evidence.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Check if all relevant possibilities have been considered.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Determine if the reason convincingly supports the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Check if the reason provided is weak in establishing the proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: See if the reason merely restates the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Identify if the reason relies on assumed consensus.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Check if the language is ambiguous or can be interpreted differently than intended.

### Step 3: Application to the Given String
1. **Proposition <P>**: "That candidate wants to raise the minimum wage."
   - This states the intention or action attributed to the candidate.

2. **Reason <R>**: "But they aren't even smart enough to run a business."
   - This provides a justification or cause questioning the candidate's capability.

### Step 4: Evaluate for Defective Argument Types
- **Generalization (G)**: The reason does not directly generalize based on limited evidence, so <G> does not apply.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: There's no claim of complete enumeration of possibilities, so <FE> does not apply.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Consider if being "smart enough to run a business" conclusively demonstrates the ability to decide on raising the minimum wage.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The attribute of intelligence in running a business may not be a compelling reason against raising the minimum wage.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason provided is not just a repetition of the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There is no reliance on a supposed universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language does not present ambiguity that changes the meaning.

### Step 5: Conclusion
The key here is to identify which defective argument type best fits. Given the steps above:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** seems to apply since the reason ("they aren't even smart enough to run a business") does not directly or conclusively support the proposition ("That candidate wants to raise the minimum wage"). One's competence in running a business may not directly correlate with their policy decisions on wages.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** also applies because the causal basis (lacking business acumen) is weak and not compelling in establishing that the candidate's policy on raising the minimum wage is flawed.

Thus, the argument type could be classified as either **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** or **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.

By following this structured approach, we can clearly classify the defective argument in the given string.
