For 
Sure, let's apply the process of IDAA to classify the string "I thought you cared about other people, but I didn't see you at the fundraiser for the Children's Hospital ..." as one of the defective argument types:

1. **Understanding the string**:
   - Proposition <P>: "You don't care about other people."
   - Reason <R>: "I didn't see you at the fundraiser for the Children's Hospital."

2. **Identify the defective argument types in the string**:
   - **Generalization (G):** Is the assertion based on evidence from only a part but applied to the whole?
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Does the argument claim to have considered all possibilities but missed some?
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the causal basis weak?
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Is the reason merely a restatement of the proposition?
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Is the reason assumed to be certain because it is "universally agreed upon"?
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Could the argument be taken in another sense than intended?

3. **Evaluate the argument**:
   - The statement implies that if someone cares about other people, they would attend the fundraiser. 
   - The argument suggests that the lack of attendance at the fundraiser is evidence of not caring about other people.

4. **Match the characteristics with defective argument types**:
   - The argument seems to be making a broad generalization about caring for others based on a single instance (not attending the fundraiser).
   - It ignores other possible reasons for not attending the fundraiser (such as scheduling conflicts, personal responsibilities, etc.), indicating incomplete enumeration.
   - The reason provided ("I didn't see you at the fundraiser") does not conclusively demonstrate the broader claim ("you don't care about other people"), suggesting an inconclusive reason.
   - The argument does not seem to repeat the proposition, assume universal agreement, or use ambiguous language.

5. **Classify the string**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: The argument is a form of generalization because it draws a broad conclusion from a single instance.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: It is also an incomplete enumeration because it assumes attending the fundraiser as the only evidence of caring for other people, missing other possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Lastly, it is an inconclusive reason because the causal link between attendance at a single event and the overall disposition towards caring about others is not strong.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - **G**: Generalization
   - **FE**: Incomplete Enumeration
   - **IR**: Inconclusive Reason

Thus, the string "I thought you cared about other people, but I didn't see you at the fundraiser for the Children's Hospital ..." can be classified as exhibiting defective argument types **Generalization (G)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, and **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
