Sure, let's apply the decomposition of the advanced task (IDAA) to classify the given string "Children should not listen to rap music. Everyone knows that." according to the defective argument types defined.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (`D`):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The statement "Children should not listen to rap music" is the <P>. This is the assertion or claim being made.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The statement "Everyone knows that" is intended to serve as the <R>. This attempts to justify the <P> by appealing to a presumed consensus.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - There doesn't appear to be an additional argument provided to substantiate the reason here. The reason stands alone without further corroboration.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument type would apply if the proposition (P) was based on limited examples being generalized to all cases. This does not directly apply here.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This would apply if the argument was claiming to cover all possibilities but missed some. This does not directly apply here.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This would apply if the Reason (R) failed to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition (P). This could be argued, but it's not the most fitting.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This would apply if the Reason (R) provided weak causal support for the Proposition (P). This argument leans more towards lack of any substantive causal basis.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This would apply if the Reason (R) merely restates the Proposition (P) without adding a new justification. This does not directly apply here.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This occurs when the Reason (R) is assumed as certain because "it is universally agreed upon," which seems to be the main feature here.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: This would apply if the Proof of Reason (PR) could be interpreted differently than intended. This does not directly apply here.

### Conclusion (`IDA` Implementation):

Based on these steps, the defective argument type for the string "Children should not listen to rap music. Everyone knows that." is **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**. The Reason (R) "Everyone knows that" is assumed as a given fact to justify the Proposition (P) without providing substantive evidence. The appeal to a supposed universal agreement fits the criteria for <FU>.
