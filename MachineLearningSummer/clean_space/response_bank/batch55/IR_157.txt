For 
To apply IDAA (the application of task decomposition to the task of classifying a string as a defective argument type) to the given statement, we first need to decompose the task (D) of classifying it step by step. Here are the steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (\<P>):**  
   Determine what the statement is trying to assert.

2. **Identify the Reason (\<R>):**  
   Identify the causal basis given to establish the truth of the Proposition (\<P>).

3. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:**  
   Based on the identified \<P> and \<R>, classify which defect (if any) the statement falls into: \<G>, \<FE>, \<IR>, \<RR>, \<WCB>, \<FU>, or \<DEP>.

Now we apply these steps to the statement, "Yes, we have safety issues in our factory. But we work really hard to make a good product. They sell so well!"

### Step-by-Step Application of IDAA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (\<P>):**
   "Yes, we have safety issues in our factory."

   This is the main assertion about the existing safety issues in the factory.

2. **Identify the Reason (\<R>):**
   "But we work really hard to make a good product. They sell so well!"

   This part of the statement provides reasons or context related to product quality and sales performance.

3. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:**
   - First, notice that the Reason (\<R>) given ("we work really hard to make a good product. They sell so well!") does not directly address the Proposition (\<P>) that there are safety issues in the factory. There is no causal connection between the hard work and product quality/sales and the safety issues.
   - Since the Reason (\<R>) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition (\<P>) about safety issues, it falls into the defective argument type of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.

### Conclusion:
The given statement is an example of a defective argument type \(\<IR>\) (Inconclusive Reason) because the reasons provided (product quality and sales) do not address or demonstrate the resolution of safety issues in the factory.
