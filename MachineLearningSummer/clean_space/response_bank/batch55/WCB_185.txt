For 
To apply IDAA to the statement "Students are poor writers because they watch too much TV," we need to follow a structured approach to decompose the classification task into specific steps. Here, IDAA involves breaking down IDA into a set of clear steps for understanding and classifying the argument based on the given types of defective arguments.

### Step 1: Identifying the Components
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition (<P>): "Students are poor writers."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason (<R>): "because they watch too much TV."

### Step 2: Analyzing the Proposition (<P>)
- Evaluate the proposition to determine if it falls under any category of defective propositions (e.g., Generalization).

### Step 3: Analyzing the Reason (<R>)
- Check the reason provided for any type of defective reasoning (e.g., Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Faulty Repetition of Proposition).

### Step 4: Corroborating Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- Here we don't have an explicit Proof of Reason, but analyze if there are any implicit claims or assumptions that might be defective (e.g., Presumptuous Consensus, Ambiguous Language Use).

### Application of Steps:

1. **Identifying Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>):**
   - <P>: "Students are poor writers."
   - <R>: "because they watch too much TV."

2. **Analyzing Proposition (Generalization Check):**
   - The statement "Students are poor writers" is a broad claim involving all students.
   - This could be indicative of a **Generalization** (<G>) since it asserts about the writing skills of all students based on possibly limited observations.

3. **Analyzing Reason (Inconclusive Reason or Insufficient Causal Basis Check):**
   - The reason "because they watch too much TV" suggests a causal relationship between watching TV and poor writing skills.
   - The direct causation presented might be weak or insufficient, indicating the possibility of **Insufficient Causal Basis** (<WCB>).

4. **Corroborating Proof of Reason (Implicit Assumptions Check):**
   - There is no additional explicit proof provided to verify the causation between writing skills and TV watching.
   - This lack of corroborative evidence, along with the assumption that TV watching is the primary cause, could indicate an **Inconclusive Reason** (<IR>).

### Conclusion:

By applying IDAA to the given statement "Students are poor writers because they watch too much TV," the classification reveals potential defects as follows:
1. **Generalization** (<G>) - The Proposition makes a broad assertion about all students.
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis** (<WCB>) - The Reason provided may not be a compelling basis for the claim.
3. **Inconclusive Reason** (<IR>) - The Reason does not conclusively demonstrate or prove the correctness of the Proposition.

Hence, the argument is defective based on components <G>, <WCB>, and <IR>.
