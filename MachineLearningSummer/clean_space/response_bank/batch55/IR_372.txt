For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to the statement "We cannot approve of this recycling idea. It was thought of by a bunch of hippie communist weirdos." we need to break down the task of classifying the defective argument into specific steps. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step decomposition and classification:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\(P\))
First, identify the core proposition or assertion being made in the argument.
- \( P \): "We cannot approve of this recycling idea."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\(R\))
Next, identify the reason given to support the proposition.
- \( R \): "It was thought of by a bunch of hippie communist weirdos."

### Step 3: Analyze the Reason (\(R\))
Determine if the reason provided actually supports the proposition. Is it a valid causal basis? Does the reason conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?

In this case, the reason given is a personal attack (ad hominem) on the proponents of the recycling idea rather than a substantive critique of the idea itself. It fails to provide a compelling causal basis for the proposition.

### Step 4: Classification (\( IDA \))
Classify the argument type based on the identified reason and its nature.

- **Analysis**: The reason given is based on who proposed the idea rather than the merits of the idea itself. This is irrelevant to the actual argument about whether the recycling idea is good or not. 

Given our definitions:
- We are not generalizing based on one part or a majority (\( G \)).
- We are not claiming to have made a complete enumeration of the possibilities (\( FE \)).
- We are not dealing with an inconclusive reason that tries to demonstrate the correctness of \( P \) (\( IR \)).
- The reason is not a case of repeating the proposition (\( RR \)).
- The reason does not claim that a causal basis is weak by lack of compellingness (\( WCB \)).
- We are not dealing with a presumed universal agreement (\( FU \)).
- There is no ambiguous language use (\( DEP \)).
 
Since the reason provided does not engage with the recycling idea itself but discredits it based on the character of its proponents, it falls best under **Inconclusive Reason ( \( IR \) )** because the reason ( \( R \) ) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition ( \( P \) ).

### Conclusion
After applying \( \text{IDAA} \) to the given statement:
- The defective argument can be classified as: **\( IR \) - Inconclusive Reason**.

This process confirms that the argument's reason fails to substantiate the proposition due to its irrelevance and ad hominem nature.
