For 
To apply IDAA to the string "I have flipped heads five times in a row. As a result, the next flip will probably be tails," we will decompose the task of classifying the string as one of the defective argument types into specific steps and then carry out those steps.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):** Determine the main assertion or proposition in the given string.
2. **Identify the Reason (R):** Determine the causal basis or reason provided to support the proposition.
3. **Check for Defective Argument Types:**
    - **Generalization (G):** Check if the proposition is improperly generalized from a part to a whole.
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Check if the argument claims complete enumeration but actually misses some pertinent possibilities.
    - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Check if the reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Check if the reason is weak due to an insufficient causal basis.
    - **Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Check if the reason merely repeats the proposition in different words.
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Check if the proof of reason assumes an undeserved consensus.
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Check if ambiguous language is used.
4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:** Based on the defect identified, classify the given string as one of the defective argument types.

### Applying the Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - The proposition here is: "The next flip will probably be tails."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - The reason provided is: "I have flipped heads five times in a row."

3. **Check for Defective Argument Types:**

   - **Generalization (G):** 
     - The argument is not improper generalization from a part to a whole; it is specifically about the likelihood of the next flip.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
     - There is no claim of complete enumeration of possibilities here.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
     - The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. In fact, each flip of a fair coin is an independent event, and previous flips do not affect the outcome of the next flip. Hence, the reason does not logically support the proposition.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
     - The reason's causal basis is indeed weak. The occurrence of heads five times in a row does not causally imply that the next flip is more likely to be tails given that each flip is independent.

   - **Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
     - The reason provided is different from the proposition. Hence, this is not just a repetition of the proposition.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
     - There is no appeal to universal agreement or consensus in the reasoning.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
     - The language used is not ambiguous; the terms are straightforward.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:**
   - Based on these checks, the string "I have flipped heads five times in a row. As a result, the next flip will probably be tails." can most appropriately be classified as:
     - **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**: The reason given does not conclusively support the proposition because each coin flip is an independent event unaffected by previous outcomes.
     - **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The causal basis provided is weak because flipping heads five times in a row does not causally make the next flip more likely to be tails.

To summarize, the defective argument types applicable to the given string are **IR (Inconclusive Reason)** and **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
