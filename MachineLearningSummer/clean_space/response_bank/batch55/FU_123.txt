Applying **IDAA** to the task of identifying the defective argument type in the string "According to the university brochure, the majors with the most students are Economics and Computer Science. Therefore, you should declare one of these majors if you want to have a successful career." involves decomposing the identification task into logical steps.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDAA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
    - Proposition (<P>): "You should declare one of these majors if you want to have a successful career."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
    - Reason (<R>): "The majors with the most students are Economics and Computer Science (according to the university brochure)."

3. **Classify the Proposition as Well-Formed or Defective:**
    - To determine if the Proposition (<P>) is defective, we must assess whether it exhibits any of the known defective argument types.

4. **Check for Generalization (G):**
    - Evaluate if the statement is making a broad assertion based on limited evidence.
    - In this case, the argument implies that choosing Economics or Computer Science because they are popular majors will lead to a successful career for everyone, which is a broad generalization. 

5. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
    - Determine if a supposedly exhaustive list misses other important options.
    - The argument does not list all possible successful majors and overlooks that success can be achieved in many other fields.

6. **Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
    - Assess if the reason provided clearly supports the proposition.
    - The fact that certain majors have the most students does not necessarily conclude they lead to successful careers, so this reason is not conclusively supporting the conclusion.

7. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
    - Evaluate if the causal relationship is weak.
    - The popularity of majors does not constitute a strong causal basis for their ability to lead to a successful career.

8. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
    - Determine if the reason merely restates the proposition.
    - The argument does not simply restate the proposition but implies a causal link.

9. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
    - Examine if consensus is assumed without evidence.
    - No claim is made about universal agreement here.

10. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
    - Look for ambiguous terms or language.
    - The terms used are clear, assuming "successful career" is the standard interpretation.

### Conclusion:
The problematic aspects of the argument are mainly:
- **Generalization (G)**: The argument generalizes that choosing popular majors will lead to a successful career for all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument fails to consider other majors that could also lead to successful careers.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The popularity of a major does not conclusively lead to a successful career.

Given that the most fitting classification choice from this analysis is **Generalization (G)** due to the broad assumption made about the relationship between the popularity of a major and career success.

### Final Classification:
**The string "According to the university brochure, the majors with the most students are Economics and Computer Science. Therefore, you should declare one of these majors if you want to have a successful career." is best classified as a Generalization (G).**
