### Decomposition of the Task (D):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine the main assertion that is intended to be proven.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Determine the causal basis or justification provided for the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**: Determine any additional corroboration or arguments supporting the reason.
4. **Classify Defects in Arguments**:
   - Determine if the proposition (P) is a defective argument (G or FE).
   - Determine if the reason (R) is a defective argument (IR, WCB, or RR).
   - Determine if the proof of reason (PR) is a defective argument (FU or DEP).

### Application of Decomposition to IDA (IDAA):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - Proposition (P): "The ideas from that member of the club are wrong."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - Reason (R): "He isn’t actually a true member of the club so his ideas do not matter."

3. **Identify any Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   - In this case, no additional Proof of Reason is provided; the argument stands on R alone.

4. **Classify Defects in Arguments**:
   - **Classify P**:
     - The proposition does not inherently fall into the categories of Generalization (G) or Incomplete Enumeration (FE) directly based on the provided information.

   - **Classify R**:
     - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided (“he isn’t actually a true member of the club”) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition ("the ideas from that member of the club are wrong"). The membership status of the individual does not inherently affect the correctness of their ideas.
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Not applicable, as the reason does not restate the proposition.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There’s a weakness here in the logical connection between “membership status” and the “validity of ideas.” This could overlap with IR.

   - **Classify PR**:
     - No PR provided; therefore, FU and DEP classifications are not applicable.

### Conclusion:

The argument provided exemplifies a defective argument primarily of the type **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, as the reasoning does not logically support the proposition.
