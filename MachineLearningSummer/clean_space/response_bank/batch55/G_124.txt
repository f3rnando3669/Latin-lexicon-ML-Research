Alright, to apply the IDAA (decomposition of IDA into specific steps) to classify the given string, we will break it down as follows:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine what the main assertion or claim in the string is.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Identify the cause or basis provided to support the Proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**: Find any additional arguments that corroborate the Reason.
4. **Classify the Argument Type**: Based on common fallacies or defects in reasoning, classify the argument as one of the defective types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

Let's go through these steps for the provided string:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
- The main assertion is: "If I went to the mall and polled 3 people, those opinions would not represent the opinions of the city population."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
- The reason here is implied: "Polling just 3 people is not sufficient to represent the opinions of the entire city population."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
- There is no additional argument provided to support this reason in the string. The statement is making a claim based on a reasoning structure without further corroboration.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument Type
- To classify the argument, let's explore if it fits any of the defective argument types described:

1. **Generalization (G)**: It doesn't make a broad assertion based on one part or a majority, so it doesn't fit here.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: It does not claim to have enumerated all possibilities, so it doesn't fit here either.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided does suggest that polling just 3 people is not adequate, and intuitively it makes sense because a sample size of 3 is too small. This is not conclusively incorrect reasoning.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The reasoning about polling 3 people lacking representation might be seen as insufficient causal if it doesn’t offer statistical backing; however, it's still quite believable and common knowledge without needing deeper proof here.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason doesn’t just repeat the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There is no reference to universal agreement in the statement.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: There is no ambiguous language use in this argument.

Considering the classifications:

The argument itself does not fit neatly into any of the defective categories provided (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP). The reason presented, even if implicit, is generally sound in everyday reasoning and does not directly demonstrate a common fallacy with the given classifications.

However, if we had to make a potential case, it might slightly hint towards **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** if we judge the reasoning potency because it simply states a logical implication without empirical or statistical backing beyond common sense. 

The most likely classification with these constraints would then be:

### Conclusion: Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
