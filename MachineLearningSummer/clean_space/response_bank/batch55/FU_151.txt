For 
To apply IDAA to the given string "AttP 3: Shirley MacLaine selling copies to many people makes her topic of choice true.", we need to decompose the task IDA into specific steps and then apply it accordingly. 

Let's break down IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of identifying defective arguments) step by step:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - Extract the main assertion that is intended to be proven.

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - Look for the causal basis that is presented to support the Proposition (P).

3. **Identify the type of defective argument**:
   - Determine if the argument fits any of the defective types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

### Applying these steps to the string:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - The main assertion here is: "her topic of choice [is] true."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - The causal basis provided is: "Shirley MacLaine selling copies to many people."

3. **Identify the type of defective argument**:
   - Now, we analyze to see which defective argument this falls into. 

   - Let's go through each type:
     - **Generalization (G)**: This is not a generalization based on a sample extending to all.
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This is not about missing out possibilities.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: There is an inconclusive reason if the reason does not adequately support the proposition.
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason is not repeating the proposition.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: If the reason provided is weak or not compelling, it falls here. Selling copies doesn't logically establish the truth of the topic.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Nothing suggests it is claiming universal agreement.
     - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language is not ambiguous but weak in establishing causal relation.

Based on these steps, the argument seems to be of the type **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The reason that "selling copies to many people" does not compellingly establish that "her topic of choice is true."

### Conclusion:
The given argument "AttP 3: Shirley MacLaine selling copies to many people makes her topic of choice true." falls under the defective argument type **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because the causal basis provided (selling copies) is not compelling in establishing the truth of the topic.
