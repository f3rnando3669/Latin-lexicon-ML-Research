For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "Someone really should move this ‘deer crossing’ sign. This is a dangerous stretch of highway and the deer really should be crossing somewhere else.", we need to systematically break down the string and classify it according to the types of defective arguments (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) specified.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), and Proof of Reason (<PR>)
First, let's extract the components of the complete argument:

- **Proposition (<P>):**
  "Someone really should move this ‘deer crossing’ sign."

- **Reason (<R>):**
  "This is a dangerous stretch of highway."

- **Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
  "The deer really should be crossing somewhere else."

### Step 2: Analyze the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition states that the deer crossing sign should be moved because it is a dangerous stretch of highway.

### Step 3: Analyze the Reason (<R>)
The reason provided is that the current location of the sign is dangerous.

### Step 4: Analyze the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
The proof of reason asserts that the deer should cross in an area that is presumably less dangerous.

### Step 5: Classify the Argument
Now, compare the extracted components with the types of defective arguments to determine the classification:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - Is <P> an assertion not necessarily applicable to all?
   - Not applicable here.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Does <P> claim something is complete but leave out possibilities?
   - Not applicable here.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Does <R> fail to demonstrate the correctness of <P> conclusively?
   - Yes, the reason that the highway is dangerous does not logically conclude that moving the sign will result in the deer crossing somewhere safer. It assumes that deer will follow the sign and not simply cross the highway at another point, which is not supported, hence making <R> inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Is the provided causal basis weak?
   - Closely related to <IR>, as the causal relation between moving the sign and reducing danger for deer is weak.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - Does <R> just restate <P> without adding anything new?
   - Not applicable here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - Is the <PR> assumed universally agreed upon?
   - Not applicable here.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - Can <PR> be taken differently than intended?
   - There is no indication of ambiguous language.

### Conclusion
The most fitting classification for this argument is **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** since the reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate that moving the sign would address the problem effectively. There is an assumption that deer will follow the relocated sign, which lacks support and evidence. Additionally, **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** is closely related, as the reasoning provided is not strong enough to justify the proposition.
