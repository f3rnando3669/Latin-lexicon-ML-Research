For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition and application of the task of classifying a defective argument) to the sentence "We should give the other applicant the job because he has a poor family and he needs to provide for them. It looks like he suffers a lot!", we need to go through the procedure step by step.

### Step-by-Step Procedure:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Proposition: "We should give the other applicant the job."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Reason: "Because he has a poor family and he needs to provide for them. It looks like he suffers a lot!"

3. **Analyze the Reason (R) against Defective Argument Types:**

   - **Generalization (G):** Check if the reason is asserting something that is only true for a part or majority but applied to all.
     - Not applicable: The reason doesn't appear to be a general statement about all applicants but is specific to one applicant.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Check if the proposition claims a complete enumeration of possibilities but actually misses some pertinent ones.
     - Not applicable: There is no enumeration of possibilities presented.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Check if the reason conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the proposition.
     - Applicable: The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate why the applicant should get the job (the needs of the poor family do not address qualifications for the job).

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Check if the causal basis is weak.
     - Applicable: The causal basis is more about the personal situation of the applicant rather than professional qualifications, making it a weak basis for hiring.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Check if the reason is essentially repeating the proposition.
     - Not applicable: The reason is not merely a repetition of the proposition but provides additional (though weak) information.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Check if the proof of the reason assumes consensus on something still in dispute.
     - Not applicable: There is no presumption of universal agreement in the reason itself.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Check if the proof can be taken in another sense than intended.
     - Not applicable: The language used in the reason seems clear and specific to the applicant's situation.

### Conclusion:

The defective argument types that apply to the statement are **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The reason given (the applicant's poor family and suffering) does not provide a conclusive and strong causal basis for the proposition that he should be given the job.
