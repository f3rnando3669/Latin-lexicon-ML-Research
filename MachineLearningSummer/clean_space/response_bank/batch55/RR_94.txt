For 
Let's begin by applying <IDAA> to the given argument: "You should always do what you are being told because following the rules is important."

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The proposition (P) in this argument is:
"You should always do what you are being told."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason (R) provided in support of the proposition is:
"because following the rules is important."

### Step 3: Analyze the Structure 
Now we need to analyze whether the proposition (P) and the reason (R) fit together properly and avoid faults such as making unwarranted generalizations or failing to provide sufficient causal basis.

### Step 4: Check for Defective Argument Types
We examine if any of the defective argument types apply to this structure.

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - This does not specifically involve making a generalization based on some one part or majority versus all.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - This does not involve incorrectly claiming a complete enumeration of possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - We need to evaluate if the reason conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the proposition.
   - "Following the rules is important" does not specifically or conclusively support "You should always do what you are being told," as it makes an assumption.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - We need to see if the causal basis is compelling.
   - The reason more generally stating that following rules is important is not necessarily a compelling or sufficient reason for the absolute statement that "You should always do what you are being told."

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - Check if the reason merely restates the proposition.
   - The reason is not an exact repetition but is somewhat closely related. However, they are not identical.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - This deals with assuming consensus on a proof.
   - There is no mention of universal agreement as the basis.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
   - We see if the reason could be taken in a different sense than intended.
   - While "important" can have subjective value, it doesn't substantially alter the understanding here.

### Conclusion
Based on the steps above, the argument "You should always do what you are being told because following the rules is important" is primarily defective on the grounds of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The provided reason does not present a sufficiently compelling causal basis for the proposition.

Thus, by applying `IDAA` step by step, we classify the argument as **<WCB>**.
