For 
Let's apply the process of breaking down the task of classifying the given statement "White men can't jump. No, really, they can't!" into specific steps. This process is defined as <IDAA>.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition (P): "White men can't jump."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason (R): In this statement, no explicit reason is provided.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Proof of Reason (PR): "No, really, they can't!" This is intended to strengthen the proposition but still does not provide additional evidence or reason.

4. **Classify the Given Statement:**
   - Analyze the given statement based on the definitions of defective argument types and determine which one applies:

     - **Generalization (G):** This type applies if the proposition is an assertion about some individuals extended to all individuals within a group.
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This type applies if the proposition claims a complete enumeration of possibilities but misses out on relevant ones.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This type applies if the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This type applies if the provided reason offers a weak causal link to the proposition.
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This type applies if the reason merely repeats the proposition without adding valid arguments.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This type applies if proof is assumed certain on the ground that it is universally agreed upon something still in dispute.
     - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** This type applies if the proof of reason can be understood differently than intended by the speaker.

Now, applying these to "White men can't jump. No, really, they can't!":

- **Part (P):** "White men can't jump." This is a broad assertion about a specific group of people.
- **Part (PR):** The follow-up statement "No, really, they can't!" essentially repeats the proposition and does not provide additional arguments or reasons to support the claim.

Given this structure, we can conclude that the given statement fits the definition of:

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Because the statement "No, really, they can't!" reiterates the initial assertion without offering additional evidence or reasoning.

### Final Classification:
The given string "White men can't jump. No, really, they can't!" is classified as type <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition) because it repeats the proposition without substantiating it with additional arguments or reasoning.
