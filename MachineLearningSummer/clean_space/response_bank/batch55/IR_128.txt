To classify the statement "We will not rest until we reach a day when not one single veteran falls into homelessness," using the task of identifying defective argument types (IDA), we can follow a systematic decomposition approach (D). Here’s a step-by-step application of IDAA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (\<P\>) and Reason (\<R\>) in the Statement:**
   - Proposition (\<P\>): The statement asserts that "We will not rest until we reach a day when not one single veteran falls into homelessness."
   - Reason (\<R\>): The combined context and inherent presumption within the statement suggest a commitment to eliminating veteran homelessness entirely.

2. **Analyze the Completeness and Validity of the Argument:**
   - **Check for Generalization (\<G\>):**
     - The statement does not assert that the current situation for all veterans implies this future state for all. Therefore, \<G\> does not apply.
     
   - **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>):**
     - The statement does not list possibilities or enumerate cases. Thus, \<FE\> does not apply.
     
   - **Check for Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>):**
     - The statement makes a strong commitment but does not provide an underlying specific causal or reasoning structure. Hence, the reasoning behind why the stated goal is achievable is missing.
     
   - **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>):**
     - While the commitment is strong, there is a lack of compelling causal basis that explains how this goal will be achieved. This indicates a weak reason.
     
   - **Check for Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>):**
     - The statement does not repeat the same idea as a reason. So, \<RR\> does not apply.
     
   - **Check for Presumptive Consensus (\<FU\>):**
     - The statement does not rely on a claim of universal agreement; it’s an assertive future goal.
     
   - **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>):**
     - The language in the statement is not ambiguous; it directly states an assertion and goal without multiple interpretations.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The statement best fits the defective argument type **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because while it sets forth a strong proposition and declaration of intent, it lacks a compelling causal basis or supporting arguments that demonstrate how the goal will be achieved.

Thus, applying IDAA to the statement "We will not rest until we reach a day when not one single veteran falls into homelessness," the classification is *Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)*.
