To apply the IDAA process—i.e., decomposing the task of classifying a defective argument into specific steps—let's follow a structured approach:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The proposition (P) is the primary statement or claim being made. In this case, the initial proposition seems to be:

"Russia has a terrible human rights record."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason (R) sets forth the causal basis for the proposition. Here, the reason provided as a response is:

"Well, the United States has done plenty of bad things, but we aren't a bad country."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
The proof of reason (PR) would typically corroborate the reason with further evidence or backing. In this statement, the response doesn't include additional arguments or proofs explicitly, but rather, it implies the reason as sufficient proof.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument (Applying IDA)

Now, let's classify the argument into one of the defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: 
   - Does the argument make an assertion based on some but not all aspects applied universally?
   - No, this argument doesn't generalize based on limited perspectives.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: 
   - Does the argument claim to cover all possibilities but miss some pertinent ones?
   - No, this argument doesn't attempt to enumerate all possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - Does the reason not conclusively demonstrate the proposition's correctness?
   - The reason provided (i.e., comparison to the US) does not logically address whether Russia has a terrible human rights record. It sidesteps the issue by deflecting to another entity's actions, therefore not conclusively addressing the initial proposition.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - Is the reason weak due to a non-compelling causal basis submitted for the proposition?
   - The causal basis (comparison to the US) is weak because the fact that the US has done bad things does not logically justify or refute Russia's human rights record.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - Is the reason essentially a repetition of the proposition?
   - No, the reason given is not a restatement of the proposition but rather a comparison.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - Is the proof assumed as certain based on presumed universal agreement?
   - The argument does not rely on universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
   - Could the proof be misunderstood in another sense than intended?
   - There is no ambiguous language that changes the intended meaning.

Conclusively, the most fitting classification appears to be **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and possibly **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The argument provides a reason that does not address the initial claim directly and instead draws a weak comparison that fails to refute or validate the proposition.

### Step 5: Summarize the Classification

Applying the IDAA process, we summarize that the argument given about Russia’s human rights record when confronted by the President can be classified as **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and possibly as **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The response by the President sidesteps the specific issue of Russia's human rights abuses by drawing an unrelated comparison that does not substantiate nor oppose the proposition effectively.
