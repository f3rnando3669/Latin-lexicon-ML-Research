Sure, let's apply the decomposition approach, <IDAA>, to classify the string "It rained and we lost the game. Every time it rains, we are going to lose." step by step.

**Step 1: Identify the propositions and reasons within the statement.**
- Proposition (<P>): "Every time it rains, we are going to lose."
- Reason (<R>): "It rained and we lost the game."

**Step 2: Evaluate the correctness and completeness of the <P> and <R>.**
- The <P> is making a general statement about losing the game every time it rains.
- The <R> is providing an instance or singular event that it rained, and consequently, they lost the game.

**Step 3: Consider the potential defective arguments that the statements might fall under.**
- <G>: Generalization: Is the assertion based on a limited number of instances being referred to all instances?
- <FE>: Incomplete Enumeration: Does the proposition claim to cover all possibilities but miss some?
- <IR>: Inconclusive Reason: Does the reason provided fail to conclusively demonstrate the proposition?
- <RR>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition: Does the reason restate the proposition without adding new support?
- <WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis: Is the reason provided for the proposition weak and unconvincing?
- <FU>: Presumptuous Consensus: Does the proof assume universal agreement which is still in dispute?
- <DEP>: Ambiguous Language Use: Can the proof be taken in another sense other than what was intended?

**Step 4: Apply the classification criteria to identify which defective argument (if any) applies to the statement.**

Let's apply these classifications:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**
   - The proposition "Every time it rains, we are going to lose" is a broad, sweeping generalization based on a single instance (it rained and they lost).
   - Assertion based on one instance which may not be applicable to all cases of rain affecting game outcomes.
   - **Conclusion**: This falls under Generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
    - The statement doesn't claim to have covered all possibilities, it's asserting a general rule based on a single instance.
    - Doesn't seem to miss other pertinent possibilities outside the scope.
    - **Conclusion**: Not applicable.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
    - The reason "it rained and we lost" doesn't conclusively demonstrate the proposition "every time it rains, we are going to lose."
    - Single instance isn't sufficient as full proof.
    - **Conclusion**: This applies as well.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**
    - The reason isn't simply restating the proposition; it provides an instance supposedly supporting the proposition.
    - **Conclusion**: Not applicable.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
    - The reason is weak as a causal basis because one instance of correlation does not establish a necessary causation.
    - **Conclusion**: This applies too.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
    - There's no proof assuming universal agreement here; only the statement based on an instance.
    - **Conclusion**: Not applicable.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**
    - The language is straightforward and doesnâ€™t seem ambiguous.
    - **Conclusion**: Not applicable.

**Step 5: Conclusion**

The provided statement "It rained and we lost the game. Every time it rains, we are going to lose." fits multiple defective argument types:
- **Generalization (<G>)**: Making a generalized conclusion from a single instance.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The provided reason does not conclusively prove the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Weak causal relationship assumed from a single occurrence.

Thus, the string can be classified as a combination of <G>, <IR>, and <WCB>.
