For 
To apply the concept of IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of identifying defective argument types) to the statement "The new vice president has never gone to public school, so he can never connect to the middle and lower class," let's take it step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
First, we'll identify the main proposition (<P>) in the statement.

**Proposition (<P>):** "The new vice president can never connect to the middle and lower class."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Next, we'll identify the reason (<R>) given for the proposition.

**Reason (<R>):** "The new vice president has never gone to public school."

### Step 3: Assess the Causal Basis
We should now evaluate if the reason (<R>) provided establishes a causal basis for the proposition (<P>).

- Does the fact that the new vice president has never gone to public school conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition that he can never connect to the middle and lower class?

### Step 4: Look for Defective Argument Types
Next, we will classify the argument into one of the defective argument types.

- **Generalization (<G>):** This would be if the argument is making an unsupported generalization based on one part or majority, but not necessarily applicable to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This is when the argument claims a complete enumeration of possibilities but misses out pertinent ones.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This is when the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This is when the reason presents a weak causal basis for the proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This is when the reason repeats the proposition in a different form without providing new evidence.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This is when the proof of reason is assumed based on universal agreement for a disputed thing.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** This is when the proof can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended.

### Step 5: Evaluate the Defective Argument Type
Given the identified proposition (<P>) and reason (<R>), we need to evaluate which defect the argument exhibits.

- **Generalization (<G>)**: The proposition that the vice president can "never connect to the middle and lower class" is based on a single attributeâ€”never having gone to public school. This is not necessarily applicable to all people who have never gone to public school and is therefore a generalization.

### Conclusion
By following these steps, we can classify the given statement "The new vice president has never gone to public school, so he can never connect to the middle and lower class" as a **Generalization (<G>)**. 

The argument has generalized a specific condition (not having attended public school) to make a broader assertion (inability to connect with the middle and lower class) without sufficient justification.
