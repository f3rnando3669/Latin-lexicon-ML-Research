For 
To apply IDAA to the string "Every time Joe goes swimming he is wearing his Speedos. Something about wearing that Speedo must make him want to go swimming," we need to follow the process of decomposition and classification to identify any defective argument present in the statement. Here are the steps we might take:

1. **Decompose the Argument (D)**
    - Identify the Proposition (P).
    - Identify the Reason (R).
    - Identify the Proof of Reason (PR), if stated.

2. **Classify the Argument as a Defective Argument Type (IDA)**
    - Evaluate whether the argument fits one of the defective argument types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

### Step 1: Decompose the Argument (D)
1. Identify the Proposition (P): 
   - **P**: "Something about wearing that Speedo must make him want to go swimming."
   
2. Identify the Reason (R):
   - **R**: "Every time Joe goes swimming he is wearing his Speedos."
   
3. Identify the Proof of Reason (PR), if stated:
   - There is no additional argument provided to support the Reason, so there is no explicit Proof of Reason (PR) here.

### Step 2: Classify the Argument (IDA)
- **Evaluate for Generalization (G)**:
  - The statement does not appear to generalize from a sample to a population.

- **Evaluate for Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
  - The statement does not claim a complete enumeration of possibilities, so this does not apply.

- **Evaluate for Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
  - The Reason given ("Every time Joe goes swimming he is wearing his Speedos") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition ("Something about wearing that Speedo must make him want to go swimming"). Just because two events co-occur, it does not mean one causes the other.

- **Evaluate for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
  - The Reason provides a very weak causal basis (correlation without evidence of causation) for the Proposition.

- **Evaluate for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
  - The Reason does not restate the Proposition, so this is not applicable.

- **Evaluate for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
  - The statement does not rely on universal agreement.

- **Evaluate for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
  - The statement does not use terms with ambiguous meanings within the context; both phrases are clear.

Based on the evaluation, the statement is defective primarily because:
1. It provides **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The Reason provided (correlation between his wearing Speedos and his swimming) does not compel the conclusion (Speedos causing the desire to swim).

Secondary to that, the argument can also be seen as containing an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** due to the same reason: the correlation presented as a Reason does not conclusively support the Proposition.

So, the classification of the string "Every time Joe goes swimming he is wearing his Speedos. Something about wearing that Speedo must make him want to go swimming" is:
- **Primary Defect**: <WCB>
- **Secondary Defect** (if noted): <IR>
