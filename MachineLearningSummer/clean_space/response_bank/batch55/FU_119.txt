For 
To apply the process of IDAA to the given string "Makes people feel as though everyone is doing it, so they should too," we need to decompose the advanced task (IDA) into specific steps (D) and then apply these steps to the task of classifying the string. Here are the steps for D (decomposition) that will allow us to classify the argument:

**Step 1:** Identify the proposition (\<P\>) and other components of the argument if possible.

**Step 2:** Determine which defective argument type(s) might be relevant based on the definitions provided.

**Step 3:** Check the characteristics of the identified defective argument type(s) against the string to see if they match.

**Step 4:** Conclusively classify the string as one of the defective argument types (\<G\>, \<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<RR\>, \<WCB\>, \<FU\>, or \<DEP\>).

### Applying the Steps to the Given String:

#### Step 1: Identify the proposition (\<P\>) and other components of the argument.
- The proposition (\<P\>) is implicit here and can be interpreted as: "One should do it because everyone is doing it."
- There isn't a direct Reason (\<R\>) or Proof of Reason (\<PR\>) stated, but the implicit reason seems to be the conformity or peer pressure rationale.

#### Step 2: Determine which defective argument type(s) might be relevant.
- \<G\>: Generalization
- \<FE\>: Incomplete Enumeration
- \<IR\>: Inconclusive Reason
- \<RR\>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition
- \<WCB\>: Insufficient Causal Basis
- \<FU\>: Presumptuous Consensus
- \<DEP\>: Ambiguous Language Use

From the definitions, it appears that "Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)" could be the defective argument type since it implies doing something because "everyone is doing it," which presumes a universal agreement or action.

#### Step 3: Check the characteristics of the identified defective argument type against the string.
- \<FU\>: Presumptuous Consensus â€” assumed as certain, on the ground that "it is universally agreed upon," a thing which is still in dispute.
  
The string "Makes people feel as though everyone is doing it, so they should too" fits the \<FU\> type because it relies on an assumed universal consensus to make the case for why someone should do something, without providing any real evidence or argument for the action itself.

#### Step 4: Conclusively classify the string.
- The string should be classified as \<FU\>: Presumptuous Consensus.

### IDAA Output:
The string "Makes people feel as though everyone is doing it, so they should too" is classified as type **\<FU\>** (Presumptuous Consensus).
