To apply the process of classifying the argument in the string "Layla is a liar! She should not be trusted to be president for student council!" under the IDAA `process`, we'll break it down into specific steps. 

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
A Proposition sets forth what we intend to prove.

**Proposition in the string:** 
"She should not be trusted to be president for student council."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
A Reason sets forth the causal basis for the Proposition establishing the truth.

**Reason in the string:** 
"Layla is a liar!"

### Step 3: Check if the Argument is Defective
Now we classify the type of the defective argument by examining the given types:

- **Generalization (G):** This does not seem to be a Generalization since it isn't stating a general rule from specific instances.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This is not relevant here as we are not enumerating possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This might be applicable if the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. We need to determine if calling someone a liar conclusively shows they can't be a president.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This may also be relevant if the causal basis is not a compelling one.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason isn't merely repeating the proposition; it's providing reasoning albeit questionable.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument doesn't appeal to a universal belief or consensus.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** There isn’t any ambiguous language that might be taken in another sense.

### Step 4: Determine which Defective Type Applies Best
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** "Layla is a liar!" is not conclusively proving that "She should not be trusted to be president for student council!" It’s an ad hominem attack and does not sufficiently argue why she can't perform the role.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** Saying "Layla is a liar!" is not a compelling causal basis for proving she should not be president. There could be many other attributes and situations that are relevant for her capacity to serve as president.

### Step 5: Make a Final Classification
Considering both potential classifications:

- The argument suffers mainly from **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. The reason presented does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition; arguing from character flaws alone is not a definitive proof of untrustworthiness.

So, the classification of the argument "Layla is a liar! She should not be trusted to be president for student council!" under IDA is primarily of type <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
