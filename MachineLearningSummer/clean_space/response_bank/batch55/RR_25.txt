For 
To apply IDAA to the statement "All eighteen-year-olds have the right to vote because it's legal for them to vote," we need to decompose the task of identifying the type of defective argument into specific steps, and then apply those steps to this statement.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for IDA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The assertion or the main claim being made in the argument.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The causal basis or the reasoning provided to support the proposition.

3. **Evaluate the Proposition and Reason:**
   - Check for common defective argument types against the criteria for <PA> and <R>. This involves checking for Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Presumptuous Consensus, and Ambiguous Language Use.

4. **Classify the Argument Defect:**
   - Assign the argument to one of the predefined defective argument types based on the evaluation.

### Applying IDAA Step-by-Step:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - **Proposition:** "All eighteen-year-olds have the right to vote."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - **Reason:** "because it's legal for them to vote."

3. **Evaluate the Proposition and Reason:**
   - **Proposition Assessment:** The assertion is that all eighteen-year-olds have the right to vote.
   - **Reason Assessment:** The reasoning given is that it is legal for them to vote, which is supposed to support the assertion.

4. **Classify the Argument Defect:**

   - **Test for <G> (Generalization):** The statement doesn't seem to fit generalization, as it doesn't base the assertion on a limited part or majority and then incorrectly apply it to all.

   - **Test for <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):** The statement is not enumerating possibilities but making a single assertion backed by a reason.

   - **Test for <IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** Here the reason given ("it's legal for them to vote") seems to directly support the proposition ("All eighteen-year-olds have the right to vote"). Thus, it does not seem inconclusive.

   - **Test for <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The legality of voting is a strong causal basis for the claim that all eighteen-year-olds have the right to vote. Hence, the reason structure is not weak.

   - **Test for <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** The argument says, "All eighteen-year-olds have the right to vote because it's legal for them to vote." This is essentially repeating the proposition in the reason "it's legal for them to vote," making this an instance of faulty repetition.

   - **Test for <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):** The argument doesn't rely on universal agreement to support its claim.

   - **Test for <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):** The language used in the statement doesn't appear ambiguous or open to another intended meaning.

### Classification of the Defective Argument:
- The argument fits the description of a faulty repetition of the proposition. Thus, it falls under <RR>.

### Conclusion:
By applying IDAA, we classify the given statement "All eighteen-year-olds have the right to vote because it's legal for them to vote" as a defective argument type <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
