For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given argument "My opponent raises a good point, but can we really trust him? I mean, he moved to this town two years ago and everyone knows that his wife left him.", we first need to decompose the advanced task (classification of the argument) into specific steps. Here is the outlined decomposition of the task and the subsequent application to the argument:

### Decomposition (<D>) of <IDA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine what the speaker is attempting to prove.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the causal basis or reasoning used to support the proposition.
3. **Determine the type of defective argument**: Analyze the identified components to classify the type of defective argument based on the defined types.
4. **Validate steps with definitions**: Check if the identified argument components fit the specific defective argument types described.

### Application (<IDAA>) to the provided string:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - **Proposition (<P>)**: "Can we really trust him?"

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - **Reason (<R>)**: "He moved to this town two years ago and everyone knows that his wife left him."

3. **Determine the type of defective argument:**
   - We need to examine why the reasons provided fail to substantiate the proposition effectively. Let's look at each type of defective argument.

   - **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument does not make a generalization based on one or most individuals.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not purport to make an exhaustive list of possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason does not necessarily demonstrate the correctness of the proposition; moving to a town and having a spouse leave do not logically pertain to trustworthiness.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reason (moving to the town and spouse leaving) does not provide a compelling causal basis to challenge the opponent's trustworthiness.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The reason provided does not merely restate the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument does rely on an assumed consensus ("everyone knows").
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: There is no ambiguity in the terms used.

4. **Validate steps with definitions:**
   - The identified part:
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The given reasons are weak and not compelling to substantiate the proposition about trustworthiness.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The speaker appeals to what "everyone knows," relying on presumed consensus.

Out of these, both <WCB> and <FU> defects are present. The former indicates that the causal link between the reasons given and the proposition is weak, and the latter reveals an appeal to assumed consensus which could still be in dispute.

### Conclusion:
The classification of the argument "My opponent raises a good point, but can we really trust him? I mean, he moved to this town two years ago and everyone knows that his wife left him." falls under both **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** and **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**.
