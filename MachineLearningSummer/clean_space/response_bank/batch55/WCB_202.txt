Sure, let's perform the task of applying the decomposition methodology (\<D>) to the task of classifying the given string as one of the defective argument types (\<IDA>):

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (\<D>):

1. **Understand the provided string (<s>):**
   - The string is: "a connection between two ideas that doesn't always mean that one causes the other (correlation vs. causation)
     una conexión entre dos ideas que no siempre significa que una causa la otra (correlación vs. causación)"

2. **Identify the proposition (\<P>):**
   - The statement implies that a connection (or correlation) between two ideas does not always mean one causes the other.

3. **Determine the quality of the reason (\<R>):**
   - This can be broken down into ensuring that the reason supports the proposition:
     - The "connection between two ideas doesn't always mean one causes the other" implies discussion on causality vs. mere correlation.

4. **Assess if the reason (\<R>) is complete and conclusive:**
   - Verify whether the reason provided conclusive and sufficient evidence or basis to support the proposition.

5. **Identify if there's any proof of reason (\<PR>):**
   - Determine if there’s corroborative evidence given to strengthen the reason.

6. **Cross-check for defective argument types (\<IDA> categories):**
   - Inspect the string to classify it within the defective argument types:
   
### Applying each type to the string:

- **Generalization (\<G>):**
  - This doesn't fit as it isn’t claiming a generalization based on a few cases.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE>):**
  - Not applicable as it isn’t enumerating possibilities.

- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>):**
  - Since it suggests a common sentiment within correlation and causation, it lacks conclusive reason backing the proposition fully.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB>):**
  - The reason provided doesn’t give a substantial causal basis but only a surface-level connection. This falls under WCB because correlation doesn’t imply causation strongly, hence a weak argument.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR>):**
  - The statement isn’t repeating itself, so RR doesn’t fit.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU>):**
  - No presumption of consensus stated in the sentence.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP>):**
  - The language seems clear in distinguishing correlation from causation, so not ambiguous.

### Conclusion:

Based on the outlined criteria and decomposition steps (\<IDAA>), the classification of the given string \[\<s>] is:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB>):**
  - It presents a weak causal basis by stating a correlation which does not strongly back the proposition of actual causality.

Thus, "a connection between two ideas that doesn't always mean that one causes the other (correlation vs. causation) una conexión entre dos ideas que no siempre significa que una causa la otra (correlación vs. causación)" is best classified under Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB>).
