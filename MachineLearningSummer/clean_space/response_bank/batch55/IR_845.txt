For 
To apply the process of IDAA to classify the given string "This is usually used in a company's slogan, using words that are very vague and nonspecific, but sound really nice. ex: "Eat Fresh." "Expect More. Pay Less."", we'll decompose the task of classification (IDA) into specific steps (D). Here are the steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine the main claim or assertion within the given string.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Determine if the string provides any causal basis for the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**: Determine if there is additional argumentation that supports the reason.
4. **Check for Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (G)**
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**

### Step-by-Step Application:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**
- Proposition (P): "This is usually used in a company's slogan, using words that are very vague and nonspecific, but sound really nice."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)**
- Reason (R): The proposition provides the reason implicitly. It states that slogans use vague and nonspecific words because they sound nice.

**Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**
- Proof of Reason (PR): Examples like "Eat Fresh" and "Expect More. Pay Less" are given to illustrate the kind of slogans being referred to.

**Step 4: Check for Defective Argument Types**
Now, let's examine if the proposition (P), reason (R), or proof of reason (PR) match any of the defective argument types.

1. **Generalization (G)**
   - Does the proposition apply something to all based on one or some individuals? Yes, it seems to generalize that all company slogans use vague and nonspecific words that sound nice, based on a few examples.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
   - Does the proposition claim a complete enumeration of possibilities but miss some? No, it doesn't claim to cover all possibilities explicitly.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
   - Does the reason not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition? This could apply because saying slogans sound nice doesn't necessarily mean being vague is typical of all slogans.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
   - Is the reason weak because the causal basis is not compelling? The reason might be considered weak, as the claim that slogans are nice is subjective and does not strongly justify the generalization.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
   - Does the reason repeat the proposition without adding substance? No, it doesn't seem to be a mere repetition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
   - Is there an assumption of agreement on something still in dispute? No, it doesn't assume a universal consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**
   - Is there ambiguous language that could be interpreted differently? No, the language doesn't appear to be ambiguous in different contexts.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the given string most closely fits the definition of:

1. **Generalization (G)**: The string makes a general claim that companies usually use vague and nonspecific words in their slogans based on a few examples.
2. To a lesser extent, it can also be seen as containing **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the reasoning that slogans sound nice is subjective and doesn't conclusively support the proposition.

Therefore, the primary classification for the given string is: **Generalization (G)**.
