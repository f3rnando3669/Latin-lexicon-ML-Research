For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task IDA into specific steps) to the string provided, let's take it step by step:

### Step 1: Identify and Decompose the Argument
We need to break down the provided conversation into its argument components (Proposition, Reason, Proof of Reason).

#### Dialog Breakdown:
1. **Speaker 1:** “You should trust the Bible because it’s the Word of God.”
   - <P>: "You should trust the Bible" 
   - <R>: "because it’s the Word of God"

2. **Speaker 2:** “How do you know it’s the Word of God?”
   - Speaker 2 is asking for a <PR> (Proof of Reason) for the Reason presented by Speaker 1.

3. **Speaker 1:** “Because God tells us it is.”
   - <PR>: "Because God tells us it is."

4. **Speaker 2:** “Where does God tell us this?”
   - Speaker 2 is further challenging the <PR> and seeking concrete evidence.

5. **Speaker 1:** “Right here, in the Bible.”
   - <PR>: "Right here, in the Bible."

### Step 2: Classify the Argument as Defective Type
We now need to classify the argument presented in the breakdown according to the defective argument types.

Let's analyze each part:
- Initial Proposition (<P>): "You should trust the Bible"
- Reason given (<R>): "because it's the Word of God"
- Proof of Reason (<PR>): "Because God tells us it is" followed by "Right here, in the Bible"

#### Analyzing Defective Types:
Let's go through the defective argument types to find a fit:
  - **Generalization (G)**: Not applicable here as no generalization based on a part or majority is presented.
  - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable since no enumeration is presented.
  - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason "it’s the Word of God" may be seen as an inconclusive reason since it is not validated outside of the claim itself.
  - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The reason is a circular argument but does not strictly fall under a weak causal basis as framed.
  - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The <R> "because it’s the Word of God" and the <PR> "Right here, in the Bible" do indeed repeat the same claim without offering new information.
  - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: No universal agreement assumption made.
  - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Ambiguous language is not used here.

### Step 3: Classify the String
After reviewing, the argument best fits:
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The argument where the proof repeats the proposition without providing supporting evidence.

### Conclusion:
Applying IDAA to the provided string:

**Classified as: <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**

The argument presented by Speaker 1 effectively repeats the proposition in the guise of providing a reason and proof, thus falling under the category of Faulty Repetition of Proposition.
