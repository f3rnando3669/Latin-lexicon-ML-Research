For 
To apply IDAA to the given string, we need to decompose the task of classifying the argument defect and then apply this decomposition to the given statement. 

Here's how we can break down IDA (classifying the defective argument) into specific steps, which will constitute D:

1. **Identify the Proposition**: Determine what the main claim or assertion (P) is in the argument.
2. **Identify the Reason**: Determine what causal basis (R) is being used to support the Proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Reason's Support for the Proposition**: Determine whether the Reason (R) effectively supports the Proposition (P) or not.
4. **Check for Specific Defective Argument Types**:
    - Generalization (G)
    - Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
    - Inconclusive Reason (IR)
    - Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
    - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
    - Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
    - Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)

Now, applying these steps to the given string:

"Most of my testimony about the defendant was the opposite of what I actually believe but I'll bet there's no expert witness who has always told the truth from the time they were old enough to talk, so I'm no less honest than they are."

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - The proposition is: "I'm no less honest than [any expert witness]."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - The reason provided is: "There's no expert witness who has always told the truth from the time they were old enough to talk."

3. **Evaluate the Reason's Support for the Proposition (P)**:
   - The reason argues that because no expert witness has always been honest, the speaker's dishonesty in testimony doesn't make them less honest overall.

4. **Check for Specific Defective Argument Types**:

   - **Generalization (G)**:
     - This argument does not generalize a property based on one part or a majority to all others.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
     - The argument does not claim to have enumerated all possibilities; so this doesn't apply.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
     - The reason given does not conclusively support the idea that the speaker's honesty is comparable to others because it relies on a comparison that doesn't address the severity or context of the dishonesty.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
     - The reason provided lacks a compelling causal basis. Just because others have not been perfectly honest their entire lives does not suffice to claim that the speaker's recent dishonesty is acceptable or not indicative of a lack of honesty.
 
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
     - The reason does not merely repeat the proposition in other words, so this doesn't apply.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
     - The reason does not rely on a universal agreement that itself is in dispute.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
     - The argument does not rely on ambiguous language that can be interpreted in another sense than intended.

Based on the evaluation, **"Most of my testimony about the defendant was the opposite of what I actually believe but I'll bet there's no expert witness who has always told the truth from the time they were old enough to talk, so I'm no less honest than they are."** fits the defective argument type of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The reasoning provided is weak because it lacks a compelling basis to equate the speaker's dishonesty to that of expert witnesses, thereby failing to justify the proposition adequately.
