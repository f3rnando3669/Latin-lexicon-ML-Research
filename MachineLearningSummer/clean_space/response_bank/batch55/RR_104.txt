To apply the task of IDAA (the application of the decomposition of the task IDA into specific steps) to the given string "J.K Rowling is a wonderful writer because she writes so well," we need to follow a structured approach to classify the argument type. Here's the step-by-step decomposition:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
Identify the main assertion or statement that is being put forward. In this case:
- **Proposition (<P>):** "J.K Rowling is a wonderful writer."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Determine the causal basis or reason given for the Proposition. In this case:
- **Reason (<R>):** "because she writes so well."

### Step 3: Analyze the Reason in Relation to the Proposition
Check if the Reason genuinely supports the Proposition and if it introduces new information or if it merely repeats the Proposition in different words.

In this case, the Reason "because she writes so well" does not introduce any new information or causal basis beyond what is already asserted in the Proposition "J.K Rowling is a wonderful writer." It essentially repeats the same idea using slightly different wording.

### Classification
Based on the step-by-step analysis, we find that the Reason is weak because it merely repeats the Proposition without providing a distinct causal basis or additional supportive reasoning. This matches the definition of:

- **<RR>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition** where a Reason is weak when it appears to be presented as the Reason but says precisely the same as was said in the Proposition.

### Conclusion
The given string "J.K Rowling is a wonderful writer because she writes so well" is an example of the defective argument type:

- **<RR>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition**

This concludes the application of IDAA to classify the given string. The argument repeats the assertion without providing any substantive new reason, thus fitting the <RR> category.
