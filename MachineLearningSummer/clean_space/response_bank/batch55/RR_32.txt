For 
Sure, let's apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to evaluate the argument "Starbucks is the best because it's expensive" step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\( P \))
The \( P \) is the claim or assertion that we intend to prove.
- **Proposition (\( P \))**: "Starbucks is the best."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\( R \))
The \( R \) is the causal basis for the \( P \) establishing the truth of what we are urging.
- **Reason (\( R \))**: "Because it's expensive."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Reason (\( R \))
Determine if the Reason logically supports the \( P \), and identify if any defective argument types apply.
- **Analysis**:
  - The \( R \) ("because it's expensive") is supposed to support the \( P \) ("Starbucks is the best").
  - This argument assumes that the high cost implies high quality or that being "the best" is inherently linked to being expensive.
  
### Step 4: Check for Defective Argument Types
We evaluate if the argument fits any of the defective argument criteria:

1. **Generalization (\( G \))**:
   - This does not appear to be a generalization since it's not basing a conclusion on a part to the whole fallacy.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\( FE \))**:
   - This does not involve an incomplete list of possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \))**:
   - The reason that Starbucks is the best merely because it’s expensive is inconclusive. The cost does not conclusively prove that Starbucks is the best in terms of quality, taste, service, etc.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \))**:
   - The high cost is an insufficient causal basis for the assertion that Starbucks is the best. Expensive does not necessarily correlate with being the best.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( RR \))**:
   - The reason provided is not a repetition of the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\( FU \))**:
   - The argument does not rely on a presumed consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\( DEP \))**:
   - The language used is not ambiguous in the sense that it can’t be interpreted in multiple ways.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the argument, the improper reasoning falls into two categories:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \))**: The reason does not conclusively demonstrate that Starbucks is the best.
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \))**: The expense alone is not a compelling reason to establish that Starbucks is the best.

Thus, the argument "Starbucks is the best because it's expensive" should be classified as both an \( \text{IR} \) (Inconclusive Reason) and \( \text{WCB} \) (Insufficient Causal Basis).
