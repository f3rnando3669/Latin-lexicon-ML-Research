For 
Applying the process of <IDAA> to classify the argument "Fast food is bad for you because is junk," involves decomposing the argument into specific steps and analyzing it to classify it into one of the defined defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>. Here is the step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition and Reason
- **Proposition** (<P>): "Fast food is bad for you."
- **Reason** (<R>): "because is junk."

### Step 2: Assess the Reason
- The reason given ("because is junk") is vague and does not add any substantial information or causal basis as to why fast food is bad.

### Step 3: Evaluate the Defective Argument Criteria
- **Generalization** (<G>): Is <P> an assertion based on partial or incomplete information? 
  - No, the proposition is general but does not rely on a subset of individuals.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration** (<FE>): Does <P> claim completeness and miss out on possibilities?
  - No, there's no enumeration or claim of completeness here.
  
- **Inconclusive Reason** (<IR>): Does <R> fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of <P>?
  - Yes, the reason "because is junk" is vague and does not provide a conclusive basis.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis** (<WCB>): Is <R> weak because it doesn't provide a compelling causal basis?
  - Yes, the causal basis provided is weak and not compelling; "junk" is too vague to serve as a strong reason.
  
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition** (<RR>): Does <R> simply repeat <P> in different words?
  - Not exactly; "junk" is somewhat tautological but not an outright repetition.
  
- **Presumptuous Consensus** (<FU>): Does <PR> assume universal agreement on something in dispute?
  - No, there is no assumption of universal agreement in the argument.
  
- **Ambiguous Language Use** (<DEP>): Can <PR> be taken in another sense than intended by the speaker?
  - Partially, "junk" is ambiguous, but this doesnâ€™t fully capture the arguments' failings.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type
- Based on the analysis, the argument primarily suffers from **Inconclusive Reason** (<IR>) and **Insufficient Causal Basis** (<WCB>). If forced to choose the most representative type:

#### Conclusion:
- The argument "Fast food is bad for you because is junk" can be classified as **Insufficient Causal Basis** (<WCB>), because the reason provided ("is junk") does not offer a compelling or detailed causal explanation of why fast food is bad.

Therefore, <s> = "Fast food is bad for you because is junk." is of type <WCB>.
