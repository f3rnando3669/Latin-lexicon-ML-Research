Certainly! Let's apply the concept of decomposing the advanced task of identifying defective arguments (<IDAA>) to the statement "I cannot listen to anyone who does not share my social and political values."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>):
1. **Analyze the Proposition (<P>):** Identify what the statement sets forth as something to be proved or asserted.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Discern the causal basis or the reason provided to support the assertion.
3. **Examine for Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Check if there is any additional proof or argument that supports the given reason.
4. **Classify the Defective Argument:** Using the definitions of defective arguments, classify the given statement into one of the types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Applying Steps to the Given Statement:

#### 1. Analyze the Proposition (<P>):
The proposition in the statement is "I cannot listen to anyone who does not share my social and political values." The assertion here is essentially that one cannot or should not listen to others who have differing social and political values.

#### 2. Identify the Reason (<R>):
The statement does not explicitly provide a distinct reason backing the proposition. The implied reasoning might be that differing social and political values render others' opinions invalid or not worth listening to.

#### 3. Examine for Proof of Reason (<PR>):
There is no explicit proof or argument provided to further substantiate the implied reason. The statement stands alone without additional support.

#### 4. Classify the Defective Argument:
Given the lack of explicit reasoning and proof, the argument could be classified under several potential defective argument types:

1. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - If we consider the implied reasoning ("differing values render opinions invalid") as a reason, it merely repeats the proposition (that differing values prevent listening) without adding substance.

2. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - The statement assumes consensus on the idea that one should not listen to others with different values without any evidence of such consensus. This presumption is taken as certain but is inherently disputable.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the defective argument type that best applies to the statement "I cannot listen to anyone who does not share my social and political values" could be either:

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>),** because the reason, if implied, simply repeats the proposition without adding evidence or support.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>),** since it presumes an agreement or correctness that is not evidence-supported.

For the purpose of precise classification in <IDA>, **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)** seems most fitting given that the reason, if implied, merely restates the proposition.
