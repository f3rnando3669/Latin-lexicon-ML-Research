For 
To apply <IDAA> to classify the argument "I know for a fact that ghosts exist. My friend, who is a very reliable person, has seen ghosts on many occasions.", we'll need to decompose the task into specific steps and then execute each step methodically. Here’s how we can do it:

### Step 1: Decompose <IDA> into specific steps

1. **Identify Proposition (<P>):**
   - Locate the main assertion or claim in the argument.

2. **Identify Reason (<R>):**
   - Identify the causal basis given for the proposition.

3. **Evaluate the Completeness and Conclusiveness of <R>:**
   - Check whether the reason given conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the proposition.

4. **Identify Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Determine if there is any supporting argument that corroborates the reason.

5. **Check for Defect Types:**
   - Generalization (<G>)
   - Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
   - Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
   - Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
   - Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
   - Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)

### Step 2: Apply the steps to classify the argument

1. **Identify Proposition (<P>):**
   - The main assertion in the argument is: "I know for a fact that ghosts exist."

2. **Identify Reason (<R>):**
   - The causal basis given for the proposition is: "My friend, who is a very reliable person, has seen ghosts on many occasions."

3. **Evaluate the Completeness and Conclusiveness of <R>:**
   - We need to determine if the reason (a friend's reliable testimony) conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the proposition (existence of ghosts).

4. **Identify Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - There isn’t an additional argument provided that corroborates the reason other than the friend's reliability and multiple sightings.

5. **Check for Defect Types:**

   - **Generalization (<G>):**
     - The argument does not explicitly generalize from one part to the whole, so this defect does not seem to apply.
   
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
     - The argument does not claim to have made a complete enumeration of possibilities, so this defect does not seem to apply.
   
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
     - The reason given does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. A friend's testimony about seeing ghosts, regardless of how reliable the friend is, is not sufficient to conclusively prove the existence of ghosts. Therefore, this defect applies here.
     
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
     - The reason based on a friend's testimony is not compelling evidence for such a significant claim. This defect also applies here.
     
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
     - The reason does not merely restate the proposition, so this defect does not apply.
     
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
     - The argument does not assume a universally agreed-upon truth, so this defect does not apply.
     
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
     - The argument does not use ambiguous language that can be taken in another sense than intended. So this defect does not apply.

### Conclusion:
The argument "I know for a fact that ghosts exist. My friend, who is a very reliable person, has seen ghosts on many occasions." is best classified under the defect types <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).

Specifically:
- **<IR>**: The reliability of a single person, regardless of how trustworthy, does not conclusively prove the existence of ghosts.
- **<WCB>**: The causal basis (a friend's testimony) is weak for asserting a fact about the existence of ghosts.
