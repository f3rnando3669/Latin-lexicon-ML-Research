For 
Applying <IDAA> to the statement, "If you really loved me, you would buy me everything I ever wanted!" involves decomposing the task of classifying the defective argument into specific steps. Here are the steps we will follow:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine what the statement is trying to prove or assert.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the causal basis provided to support the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Check if there is additional argumentation corroborating the reason.
4. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types**: Consider the specific defective argument types defined (i.e., <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) to classify the statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- Proposition (P): "If you really loved me..."
  
The assertion being made here is that the love of the speaker by the subject will be demonstrated through certain actions.

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- Reason (R): "...you would buy me everything I ever wanted!"

The causal basis provided to support the proposition is that buying everything the speaker wants is an indication of love.

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- Proof of Reason (PR): None explicitly provided.

The statement does not offer additional argumentation to corroborate the reason. It rests on the initial assertion.

#### Step 4: Analyze for Defective Argument Types
Let's examine possible defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - This does not seem to be a case of generalization since it is not applying a property observed in some individuals to all.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The argument does not involve providing an incomplete set of possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The reason given ("you would buy me everything I ever wanted") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition ("if you really loved me"). Just because someone doesn't buy everything for another person doesn't mean they don't love them. This is inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - The causal basis (buying everything wanted) offered is weak because it does not necessarily compel the conclusion of what true love is. There are many other ways love could be demonstrated.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - The reason is not a mere repetition of the proposition; instead, it is providing a weak basis for the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - There is no assumption of universal agreement here.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
   - There doesnâ€™t appear to be ambiguous language that could be taken in another sense.

Given the analysis, the argument primarily falls under **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** since the reason provided does not compellingly establish the truth of the proposition. It might also be partially classified as an **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, but <WCB> is more fitting.

### Conclusion

The given statement "If you really loved me, you would buy me everything I ever wanted!" is best classified under the defective argument type **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** with potential elements of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
