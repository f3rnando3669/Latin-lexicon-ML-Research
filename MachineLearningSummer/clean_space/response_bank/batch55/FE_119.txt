For 
To apply the method of IDAA to the statement "To get better schools, we have to raise taxes. If we don't, we can't have better schools.", we need to decompose this task into specific steps and then classify the string as one of the defective argument types defined. Here are the steps for IDAA:

1. **Identify Elements of the Argument**:
   - **Proposition (<P>)**: "To get better schools, we have to raise taxes."
   - **Reason (<R>)**: "If we don't [raise taxes], we can't have better schools."

2. **Evaluate the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - The proposition asserts the necessity of raising taxes to improve schools.

3. **Evaluate the Reason (<R>)**:
   - The reason provides causation: without raising taxes, better schools cannot be achieved.

4. **Analyze the Relationship Between <P> and <R>**:
   - Examine whether the reason conclusively supports the proposition.
   - Check for completeness, sufficiency, and relevance.

5. **Classify Based on Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: Does the statement generalize from insufficient examples?
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Does it fail to consider all possible alternatives or causes?
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Does the reason fail to conclusively prove the proposition?
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Is the causal basis weak or unconvincing?
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Is the reason just a restatement of the proposition?
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Does it erroneously assume universal agreement?
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Is the language unclear or ambiguous?

6. **Determine the Defective Argument Type of <s>**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement doesn't seem to generalize from insufficient examples.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement doesn’t enumerate other possibilities for better schools like improved management, private investments, etc.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The statement does not conclusively establish that raising taxes is the only way to get better schools. There may be other ways to achieve the same goal that the argument does not consider or disprove.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal link is weak because it doesn't consider other methods or resources that could contribute to better schools.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: There is no faulty repetition as the reason is not just a restatement of the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: There is no universal agreement assumed in this argument.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The language is clear and not ambiguous.

Based on the above steps, the argument "To get better schools, we have to raise taxes. If we don't, we can't have better schools." falls under:
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** because it doesn’t consider all possible ways to improve schools.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** because the reason does not conclusively prove that raising taxes is the only or necessary way to achieve better schools.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** because the causal link provided in the reason is not compelling and overlooks other factors or methods that could lead to better schools.

Thus, we classify the argument <s> as <FE>, <IR>, and <WCB>.
