For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to the given string, we need to decompose the task \( \text{IDA} \) of classifying the string into specific steps. Here's a structured approach to \( \text{IDAA} \):

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\( \text{P} \))

The first task is to identify the main proposition in the argument. A proposition is a statement that expresses what the argument intends to prove.

**String:** "The police should stop environmental demonstrators from inconveniencing the general public. We pay our taxes. Surely global meltdown is infinitely worse than a little inconvenience?"

**Proposition (\( \text{P} \)):**
"The police should stop environmental demonstrators from inconveniencing the general public."

### Step 2: Identify the Reasons (\( \text{R} \))

Next, we identify the reasons given to support the proposition. Reasons provide the causal basis or justification for the proposition.

**Reason (\( \text{R} \)) 1:**
"We pay our taxes."

**Reason (\( \text{R} \)) 2:**
"Surely global meltdown is infinitely worse than a little inconvenience?"

### Step 3: Identify Proofs of Reason (\( \text{PR} \))

Determine if there are any proofs provided to support the reasons given.

In this case, there are no additional arguments provided as proofs for the reasons. The reasons themselves are followed by a counterargument, not further proof.

### Step 4: Evaluate the Type of Defective Argument (\( \text{IDA} \))

Now, we classify the argument based on the defect types defined. We need to closely examine the reasons (\( \text{R} \)) and proposition (\( \text{P} \)) for defects.

**Reason 1: "We pay our taxes."**
- This reason implies that paying taxes justifies preventing inconvenience, but it might not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.

**Reason 2: "Surely global meltdown is infinitely worse than a little inconvenience?"**
- This reasons argues that the bigger issue (global meltdown) is more important than the inconvenience, which could be seen as not directly addressing the proposition.

Let's see how they map to the defective argument types:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration (\( \text{FE} \)):**
    - Not applicable, as there is no claim of a complete enumeration of possibilities.

2. **Generalization (\( \text{G} \)):**
    - Not applicable, as there isn't an assertion about all members of a group based on a part.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (\( \text{IR} \)):**
    - \( \text{R} \) 1 ("We pay our taxes.") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition \( \text{P} \). It assumes tax payment inherently entails controlling public inconveniences, which is not necessarily conclusive.
    - \( \text{R} \) 2 ("Surely global meltdown is infinitely worse than a little inconvenience?") presents a bigger issue but sidesteps directly supporting the proposition about police action on demonstrators. Hence, it also could be seen as not conclusively relevant.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( \text{WCB} \)):**
    - \( \text{R} \) 1 may also fall into this category, as the causal connection between tax payment and stopping demonstrators is weak.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( \text{RR} \)):**
    - Not applicable.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\( \text{FU} \)):**
    - \( \text{R} \) 2 assumes that everyone agrees global meltdown is a critical issue but this doesn't serve as a proof for the initial proposition about policing demonstrators.
 
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\( \text{DEP} \)):**
    - Not directly applicable in this context.

### Conclusion

The argument in the string can be classified under multiple defective argument types, mainly \text{IR} (Inconclusive Reason) and \text{WCB} (Insufficient Causal Basis):

- \( \text{IR} \): The reasoning "We pay our taxes." and "Surely global meltdown is infinitely worse than a little inconvenience?" do not conclusively demonstrate or support the correctness of the proposition.
- \( \text{WCB} \): The causal connection presented in \( \text{R} \) 1 ("We pay our taxes.") is weak and not compelling in justifying the proposition \( \text{P} \).

Hence, using \( \text{IDAA} \):
**String:** "The police should stop environmental demonstrators from inconveniencing the general public. We pay our taxes. Surely global meltdown is infinitely worse than a little inconvenience?"
**Classification:** \(\text{IR}\), \(\text{WCB}\)
