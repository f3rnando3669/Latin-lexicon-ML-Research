To apply the process of IDAA (the application of D to IDA), we first need to break down the advanced task IDA (classification of a string as one of the specified defective argument types) into specific steps (D). Here’s a step-by-step decomposition:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDA (D)

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine the main assertion being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Determine the causal basis or reason providing support for the main assertion.
3. **Analyze the Components**:
   - Check if the Proposition (P) is a Generalization (G).
   - Check if the Proposition (P) or Reason (R) involves Incomplete Enumeration (FE).
   - Check if the Reason (R) is an Inconclusive Reason (IR).
   - Check if the Reason (R) is a Faulty Repetition of the Proposition (RR).
   - Check if the Reason (R) has an Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).
   - Check if the Proof of Reason (PR) involves Presumptuous Consensus (FU).
   - Check if the Proof of Reason (PR) involves Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).
4. **Classify the Defective Argument**: Based on the checks in step 3, classify the argument into one of the defective types.

Now let’s apply IDAA to the string "We know God exists because he made everything."

### Apply IDAA

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - Proposition (P): "We know God exists."
   
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - Reason (R): "because he made everything."
   
3. **Analyze the Components**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: The proposition does not appear to be a generalization based on a part or majority of individuals; it is a definitive statement.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This check isn’t applicable here as the assertion doesn’t involve enumeration of possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Evaluate if the reason conclusively supports the proposition. The reason "because he made everything" doesn't conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition "We know God exists"; it assumes part of what it should prove.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason here is not simply a repetition; it’s attempting to provide reasoning.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Determine if the causal basis is compelling. The causal basis "he made everything" is not a compelling argument without prior independent evidence that God made everything.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There is no claim based on universal agreement here.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: There doesn’t seem to be ambiguity in the terms used in the context provided.
   
4. **Classify the Defective Argument**:
   - The most fitting categorizations are **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, as the reason given does not conclusively establish the truth of the proposition and lacks a compelling causal basis.

Thus, "We know God exists because he made everything" classifies as both an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and having an **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
