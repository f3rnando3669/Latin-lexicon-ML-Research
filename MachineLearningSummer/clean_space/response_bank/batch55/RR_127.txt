For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of an advanced task into specific steps for classifying "something that kills is deadly") to the given string "something that kills is deadly," we'll break down the advanced task (IDA) into its constituent steps and systematically process the string.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine the assertion that is being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Determine the causal basis presented for the assertion.
3. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**: Using the definitions of G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, and DEP, classify which type of defective argument the string falls into.

### Applying the Steps to "something that kills is deadly":

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - The proposition here is "something that kills is deadly." This is a summary statement of what is intended to be proven or asserted.

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - The reason that might be implied here is that "because it kills, it is deadly." However, the string does not explicitly state a separate causal basis; the assertion seems self-evident.

3. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: This does not appear to be a generalization error because it does not involve an assertion based on a sample applied to all cases.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable, as this is not an enumerative argument.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The string does not provide a detailed reason to back the proposition; it assumes the proposition is self-evident.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is no separate cause provided for the proposition, so this is not directly applicable.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason is not explicitly stated but implied, and it essentially repeats the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: No consensus is referenced.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Language ambiguity here can be examined. However, "something that kills" and "deadly" are used without ambiguity in this context.

Given the analysis, the argument implicitly uses the proposition to restate itself without additional reasoning. Therefore, the defective argument type most fitting for "something that kills is deadly" is:

**Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The statement utilizes the repetition as it closely mirrors the proposition without adding any substantial reason.

### Conclusion:
By decomposing the task (D) of classifying the string (IDA), we have determined that the argument "something that kills is deadly" falls into the defective argument type **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**.
