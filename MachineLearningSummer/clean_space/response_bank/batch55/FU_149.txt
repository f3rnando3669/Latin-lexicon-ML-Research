For 
Let's apply <IDAA> to classify the provided string step by step. Here's the breakdown:

### Task Definition:
**<IDA>: Classification of a given string into one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.**

### Advanced Task:
**<t>: Classification of a defective argument.**

### Decomposition (D) of the Advanced Task (t):
To classify the string, we can follow these specific steps:

1. **Identify <P> (Proposition) in the given argument.**
2. **Identify <R> (Reason) in the given argument.**
3. **Assess the argument's logical structure and match it with the known defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.**
4. **Classify the given argument based on the identified characteristics.**

### Step-by-Step Application:

#### Step 1: Identify <P> (Proposition)
The proposition in the string is: 
“I know the professor said the Bridges of Madison County was smarmy trash and lacked any artistic worth. But I still think he's wrong.”

Here, the speaker is asserting that the professor's judgment about the book is incorrect.

#### Step 2: Identify <R> (Reason)
The reason provided in the argument is: 
“After all, it was on the best-seller list for over 100 weeks.”

The reason given is the book’s long presence on the best-seller list as a counterpoint to the professor’s negative assessment.

#### Step 3: Assess the Argument's Logical Structure
Now let's analyze the logical structure to classify it:

- **Generalization (<G>):** This doesn’t involve a generalization from a few instances to a broader conclusion.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This isn’t about missing out on possibilities; it's more about the reason provided for the proposition.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason might not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition about artistic worth.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The presence on the best-seller list might not be a compelling reason regarding the artistic worth, which seems likely.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason is not merely a repetition of the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This is not about universal agreement; it mentions a specific criterion (best-seller status).
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The language is quite clear and doesn’t involve ambiguity.

#### Step 4: Classify the Argument
Based on the reasoning above, the most fitting classification of the defective argument is:

**<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The reason provided (being on the best-seller list for over 100 weeks) is not a compelling causal basis for disproving the professor's critique regarding artistic worth.

### Summary
The argument: "I know the professor said the Bridges of Madison County was smarmy trash and lacked any artistic worth. But I still think he's wrong. After all, it was on the best-seller list for over 100 weeks," can be classified as a <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) type of defective argument.
