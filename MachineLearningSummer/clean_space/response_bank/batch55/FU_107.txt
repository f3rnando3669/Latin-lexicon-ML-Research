For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "Jose, join us because everybody will come to the party and only you will be left behind," we'll decompose the task of classifying the string into specific steps. Hereâ€™s how it would look:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition: "Jose, join us."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason: "because everybody will come to the party and only you will be left behind."

3. **Analyze the Reason (<R>):**
   To classify the reason as one of the defective argument types, we need to evaluate if it falls under any of the given categories: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

4. **Determine if the Reason involves Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - The statement "everybody will come to the party" suggests a universal agreement or action which is still in dispute. It does not provide concrete evidence but merely assumes that since "everybody will come," it is universally accepted.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The Reason (<R>) in this argument type listens nearest to "Presumptuous Consensus" (<FU>), because it relies on the assumption that the consensus (everyone coming to the party) is agreed upon without actual confirmation.

Therefore, the classification of the string "Jose, join us because everybody will come to the party and only you will be left behind" is of type <FU>.
