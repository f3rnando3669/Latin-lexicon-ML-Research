For 
To apply the process of IDAA to classify the fallacy in the given argument, we'll decompose the task into specific steps and address each step systematically.

### Step 1: Understand the Argument
Let's first understand the argument presented:
- **Proposition (P):** If James skipped one class, he will start skipping more frequently.
- **Reason (R):** If he starts skipping more frequently, he will drop out altogether, never graduate, not get into college, end up unemployed, and live at home for the rest of his life.
  
### Step 2: Identify the Type of Argument
Next, we need to check if this argument contains any of the specific defective argument types defined (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP).

### Step 3: Match the Argument with the Defective Argument Types
Let's evaluate each type to see which one (if any) matches the argument:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - This applies if a generalization is made from a small or non-representative sample.
   - Not applicable here.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - This applies if the argument claims to have considered all possibilities but has missed important ones.
   - Not applicable here.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - This applies if the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
   - James' mom's reasoning chain (skipping one class leading to skipping more, leading to dropping out, etc.) involves a series of highly speculative causal links, none of which conclusively demonstrates the truth of each subsequent step.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - This applies if the causal basis for the reason is not compelling.
   - The causal chain is speculative and not compellingly justified. The scenarios presented are possible but not probable based on the starting fact of skipping one class.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - This applies if the reason simply repeats the proposition without adding new information.
   - Not applicable here.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - This applies if it relies on presumed universal agreement.
   - Not applicable here.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
   - This applies if ambiguous language leads to misunderstandings.
   - Not applicable here.

### Step 4: Conclusion
Based on the above assessment, James's momâ€™s argument most closely fits the defective argument type **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. The argument involves speculative links that are not conclusively demonstrated.

### Final Answer
The type of fallacy committed by James' mom is **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
