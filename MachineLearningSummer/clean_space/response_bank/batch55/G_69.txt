For 
To apply the decomposition of the classification task (IDAA) to classify the argument "All chess players are geniuses." as one of the defective argument types (IDA), we need to break the process down into specific steps.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D)

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Analyze the string to identify the proposition or main assertion being made.

2. **Analyze the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Determine if there is a provided reason that supports the proposition.

3. **Examine the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - Check if there is any further proof or additional argument that corroborates the reason.

4. **Classify Type of Defective Argument**:
   - Compare the identified proposition, reason, and proof of reason against the defined defective argument types to classify the argument.

### Application of Decomposition to the String ("All chess players are geniuses.")

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - **Proposition (<P>):** "All chess players are geniuses."

2. **Analyze the Reason (<R>)**:
   - No explicit reason (<R>) is given in the statement itself. The statement stands as an assertion without further justification.

3. **Examine the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - Since no reason was provided, there is also no proof of reason (<PR>) given in the statement.

4. **Classify Type of Defective Argument**:
   - **G (Generalization):** Yes. This statement is a classic example of a generalization since it takes a characteristic that may apply to some or even many individuals in a category and asserts that it applies to all.
   - **FE (Incomplete Enumeration):** Not applicable as there is no claim of having enumerated possibilities.
   - **IR (Inconclusive Reason):** Not applicable since no reason is provided.
   - **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** Not applicable since no reason is provided.
   - **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis):** Not applicable since no causal basis is provided.
   - **FU (Presumptuous Consensus):** Not applicable since there is no assumption based on universal agreement.
   - **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use):** Not directly applicable since the statementâ€™s language is not ambiguous but definitive and clear in its generalization.

### Conclusion:
The argument "All chess players are geniuses." is best classified as a **Generalization (G)**. It asserts that a characteristic (being a genius) that may apply to some or many individuals within a group (chess players) applies to all individuals in that group, without providing evidence or justification for such a broad and absolute claim.
