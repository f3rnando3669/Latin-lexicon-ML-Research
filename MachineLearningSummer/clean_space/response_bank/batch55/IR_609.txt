For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task IDA, which is classifying a string as being one of the defective argument types G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, or DEP), we will break down the string "How many times per day do you beat your wife?" into steps and analyze it to determine the type of defective argument it represents.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Assess the central assertion in the string provided.
   - In this case, the implicit proposition is: "You beat your wife."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Identify any reasoning or assumptions that support the proposition.
   - Here, the question itself assumes as true the act of wife-beating.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Look for any presented proof that supports the reason given.
   - No explicit proof is provided in the string; the question is the proposition.

4. **Classify the Type of Defective Argument:**
   - Based on the defined defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP), determine which one applies to the string.

### Analysis:

- **Generalization (G):**
  - This does not fit this type, as it is not asserting a generalization of one part to all.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
  - This does not fit as itâ€™s not providing a list of possibilities.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
  - This does not fit, as there is no inconclusive reasoning being present explicitly.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
  - This doesn't fit as the reason is not simply repeating the proposition.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
  - This does not fit, as there is no causal basis being explicitly discussed.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
  - This does not fit, as the statement does not refer to a universal agreement to prove its point.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
  - This does not fit, as there is no multiple interpretive ambiguity in terms of language.

### Conclusion:

The string "How many times per day do you beat your wife?" is best classified as a **presumptive question**, which is a type of logical fallacy where the question presumes something that has not been established. In the context of the provided defective arguments:

- **Most Resonant Type:** **Irrelevant Reasoning (IR)** could potentially overlap, because the implied assumption (beating the wife) is not established.
- However, it most accurately resembles a **Loaded Question Fallacy**, directly linking to **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)** because it uses language in a way that inherently presumes guilt.

Thus, while no single defective argument type exactly matches this fallacy, **DEP** could be considered most applicable, implicating ambiguity through presumption.
