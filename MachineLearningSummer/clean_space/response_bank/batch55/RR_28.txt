For 
To apply the process of IDAA (the application of decomposition of the task into specific steps) to IDA (the task of classifying a defective argument) for the statement "I view any discussion concerning the limiting of therapy as morally wrong, that is why I do not accept it," we will break it down step by step into specific steps for analysis.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**

   In this statement, the Proposition (<P>) is: 
   - "I view any discussion concerning the limiting of therapy as morally wrong."

2. **Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**

   Here, the Reason (<R>) given is: 
   - "that is why I do not accept it."

3. **Step 3: Check for Defective Argument Types**

   We now need to classify if the argument fits one of the defective argument types: 

    - **Generalization (<G>):** Does it make a general statement based on limited data?
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Does it claim completeness but miss some possibilities?
    - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Does the Reason not conclusively justify the Proposition?
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Is the causal basis weak and not compelling?
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Does Reason merely repeat the Proposition?
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Does it assume something is universally agreed upon which is still in doubt?
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Can a proof be taken in another sense than intended?

### Analysis:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The statement does not make a generalization based on limited data; rather it is a personal viewpoint.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The statement does not enumerate possibilities but rather states a moral viewpoint.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The Reason "that is why I do not accept it" does not provide a logical connection or a convincing argument for why the discussion of limiting therapy should be viewed as morally wrong. It merely asserts a personal stance without a conclusive demonstration.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The Reason given does not present a compelling causal basis. The statement "that is why I do not accept it" is more of an assertion of belief rather than a compelling reason that establishes the truth of the Proposition.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - The Reason "that is why I do not accept it" essentially restates the Proposition. It does not add new information or a different perspective, thus it is a repetition that purports to be a reason but is not actually providing a separate rationale.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - The argument does not appear to assume a consensus that is in dispute.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - The language used is clear in its context and not ambiguous.

### Conclusion:

The statement "I view any discussion concerning the limiting of therapy as morally wrong, that is why I do not accept it" fits the defective argument type of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)** because the Reason provided essentially repeats the assertion made in the Proposition without adding a compelling or separate rationale.
