For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "It’s true that this company hasn’t given raises in the last 5 years, but we work really hard to ensure that we have a quality product and good customer service," we will decompose the task of classifying this defective argument into specific steps.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - This is the main claim or assertion.
   - In this string, the implicit <P> could be interpreted as: "The company’s lack of raises in the last 5 years is justified."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - This is the causal basis or justification for the <P>.
   - The given reason <R> is: "We work really hard to ensure that we have a quality product and good customer service."

3. **Classify the Defective Argument:**
   - Compare the structure and content of the argument to the definitions of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

Let’s analyze systematically to classify the defective argument:

- **Generalization (<G>):** 
  - The argument does not generalize an assertion based on one part to all parts. Hence, it is not <G>.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** 
  - The argument does not claim complete enumeration of possibilities. Hence, it is not <FE>.
  
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
  - The reason given ("we work really hard to ensure that we have a quality product and good customer service") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition ("The company’s lack of raises in the last 5 years is justified"). The quality of product and customer service is somewhat related but not conclusive evidence for not giving raises.
  
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
  - The reason does not say precisely the same as the proposition. Hence, it is not <RR>.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
  - The reason provided is an insufficient causal basis for the proposition, since working hard for quality and customer service doesn’t inherently justify the lack of raises. However, it is tied more closely to <IR> than <WCB>.
  
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
  - The argument does not rely on presumed universal agreement. Hence, it is not <FU>.
  
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
  - The argument does not seem to use ambiguous language. Hence, it is not <DEP>.

### Conclusion:
Given the above steps and analysis, the defective argument is best classified as **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. The reason provided does not conclusively justify the proposition about not giving raises.

Therefore, applying <IDAA> to the given string classifies it as:
**"Inconclusive Reason (IR)"**.
