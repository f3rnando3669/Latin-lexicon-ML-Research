For 
To classify the given string using the IDAA process, we'll decompose the task of identifying the defective argument type step by step. 

### Step 1: Understand the Given String
The string is: 
> "Although we have proven that the moon is not made of spare ribs, we have not proven that its core cannot be filled with them; therefore, the moon’s core is filled with spare ribs."

### Step 2: Break Down the Argument

1. **Proposition (P):** The moon’s core is filled with spare ribs.
2. **Reason (R):** We have not proven that its core cannot be filled with them.
3. **Proof of Reason (PR):** The previous part doesn't include additional arguments, but it relies on the assertion that the absence of disproof means the proposition is true.

### Step 3: Analyze the Argument Structure
To classify the argument type, we need to examine if each part fulfills its intended role and if there are any defects in the logic.
- Is the Reason (R) logically supporting the Proposition (P)?
- Is there a Proof of Reason that adds credibility to the Reason?

### Step 4: Identify the Logical Flaws
The argument asserts that because we have not proven the core isn't filled with spare ribs, the core must be filled with spare ribs. This is a logical flaw.

### Step 5: Classify According to Given Types
Let's match this logical flaw with the specified defective argument types:

#### Possible Matches:
1. **Generalization (G):** This doesn't fit, as there isn’t any assertion being generalized from a sample.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This doesn’t fit either; the argument isn’t about missing possibilities in enumeration.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This seems plausible because the reason doesn’t logically conclude that the core is filled with spare ribs. The argument assumes that the lack of proof against something is proof for it.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This also fits; the causal reason presented (lack of disproof) is not compelling enough to establish the proposition.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This doesn’t fit, as the Reason isn’t just a repetition of the Proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This doesn’t fit, as there’s no mention of universal agreement.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** This seems irrelevant because there is no ambiguous term that could be taken in another sense.

### Step 6: Final Classification
Given the analysis, the most fitting types are:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Because the Reason does not conclusively support the Proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Because the Reason provided is weak or not compelling.

We choose the one that fits best:
- The primary flaw here is that the argument’s Reason does not conclusively support the Proposition. So, **IR** (Inconclusive Reason) is the most fitting classification.

### Conclusion
The given string: 
> "Although we have proven that the moon is not made of spare ribs, we have not proven that its core cannot be filled with them; therefore, the moon’s core is filled with spare ribs."

**is classified as type <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).**
