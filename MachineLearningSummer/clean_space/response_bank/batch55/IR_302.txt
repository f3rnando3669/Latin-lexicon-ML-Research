For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "Have you stopped cheating on exams?", we need to decompose the task of identifying the defective argument into specific steps and then execute them one by one. Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the nature of the string <s>.**
   - "Have you stopped cheating on exams?" is a question.

2. **Determine if the question implies any assumptions.**
   - The question implies an assumption that the person being addressed has been cheating on exams.

3. **Check for specific argument types in the assumptions.**
   - Generalization (<G>): Is the string making a broad claim based on a limited sample? No, it makes an assumption about a specific instance.
   - Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>): Is the string omitting pertinent possibilities? No, it assumes cheating without addressing the possibility of never having cheated.
   - Inconclusive Reason (<IR>): Does the string provide insufficient or inconclusive evidence to support the assumption? No, it contains an implicit assumption rather than an explicit <R>.
   - Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>): Is the reason claimed weak or not compelling? The string contains an implicit assumption rather than an explicit <R>.
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>): Is <R> repeating <P>? No, the string does not present an <R> that repeats <P>.
   - Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>): Does the string assume something universally agreed upon which is still disputed? No.
   - Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>): Could the string be understood in more than one way due to ambiguous language? No, the language is clear in its assumption.

4. **Determine if the question itself is fallacious within its context.**
   - The question "Have you stopped cheating on exams?" is an example of a loaded question (a form of complex question). It assumes the truth of a premise contained within it.

Based on the analysis steps, the question "Have you stopped cheating on exams?" does not fit neatly into any of the predefined defective argument types of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP> given it is a classic example of a loaded question. A loaded question implicitly contains an unproven assumption.

However, if we were to select the closest predefined defective argument type, Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>) seems relevant because the implied assumption loaded into the question can be considered another form of ambiguity, namely presupposition that someone has been cheating.

Therefore, we can classify "Have you stopped cheating on exams?" loosely under <DEP> but with a specific note that it is actually an instance of a loaded question fallacy.
