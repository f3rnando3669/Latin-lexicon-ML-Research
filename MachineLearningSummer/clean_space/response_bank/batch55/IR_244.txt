For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of a task into specific steps) to classify the string "Why doesn't Tim get a real job like normal people instead of trying to launch that Internet business from home?" as one of the defective argument types, we need to break down the process into specific analytical steps. Here's a detailed step-by-step application of IDAA:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\<P>)
The first task is to identify what the main assertion or proposition is in the given string.

- Proposition (\<P>): "Tim should get a real job like normal people instead of trying to launch that Internet business from home."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\<R>)
Next, we need to identify the reasoning or basis supporting this proposition.

- Reason (\<R>): The reasoning implied is that "a real job" is what "normal people" do, suggesting that what Tim is doing (launching an Internet business from home) is not normal or acceptable.

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (\<PR>)
Further, check if there is any additional corroboration or evidence provided to support the Reason.

- Proof of Reason (\<PR>): There is no explicit further evidence to support this; the reasoning stands mainly on the implied social norm.

### Step 4: Match the Argument to the Defective Types
Now, proceed to classify the proposition, reason, and corroboration (or lack thereof) into one of the defective argument types (\<G>, \<FE>, \<IR>, \<RR>, \<WCB>, \<FU>, or \<DEP>).

- **Generalization (\<G>)**: This type involves extending an assertion applicable to a few to all. Not fitting here.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE>)**: This type involves missing out on some pertinent possibilities. Not directly fitting here.
- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>)**: This type involves a reason that does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. Possibly fitting.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB>)**: A reason that provides a weak causal basis for the proposition. Possibly fitting.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR>)**: This involves the reason saying exactly the same as the proposition. Not fitting here.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU>)**: This assumes a proof to be universally agreed upon when it is actually in dispute. Could fit, as it assumes "a real job" is universally agreed to be a better norm without substantiation.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP>)**: This involves ambiguous interpretation of terms. Not directly fitting here.

The most fitting types could be:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>)**: The reasoning does not conclusively demonstrate why Tim should not pursue his Internet business and instead get a "real job."
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB>)**: The causal basis that "normal people get real jobs" is weak and assumes societal norms without solid grounding.
3. **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU>)**: Assumes without proof that it is universally agreed upon that a "real job" is better than an Internet business.

### Step 5: Select the Most Appropriate Defective Argument Type
Select from the possible defective argument types identified.

- The most fitting defective argument type for the string is **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU>)**: The assertion relies on an unsubstantiated belief that societal consensus favors "real jobs" over Internet businesses.

### Conclusion
By applying IDAA, we classified the argument "Why doesn't Tim get a real job like normal people instead of trying to launch that Internet business from home?" as **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU>)**.
