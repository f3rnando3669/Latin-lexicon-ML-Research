For 
To apply <IDAA>—the decomposition of the task of classifying defective arguments (IDA) into specific steps—to the provided string, we can break down the process as follows:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P) and Reason (R)**: Review the argument to find what is being claimed and the causal basis provided for this claim.

2. **Analyze Potential Defective Argument Types**: Compare the detected Proposition (P) and Reason (R) with known defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) to determine which type is applicable.

3. **Determine the Defective Argument Type**: Identify which defective argument type(s), if any, best classify the argument.

Below, we will apply these steps to the given string:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P) and Reason (R)

The given string is:
"Everyone is selfish; everyone is doing what he believes will make himself happier. The recognition of that can take most of the sting out of accusations that you're being 'selfish.' Why should you feel guilty for seeking your own happiness when that's what everyone else is doing, too?"

- **Proposition (P)**: "Everyone is selfish."
- **Reason (R)**: "Everyone is doing what he believes will make himself happier."

(Note: Here, the argument extends to suggest this recognition should mitigate feelings of guilt about selfishness.)

### Step 2: Analyze Potential Defective Argument Types

**Comparing against defective argument types:**

- **Generalization (G)**: The Proposition (P) "Everyone is selfish" is a broad assertion based on the common behavior that people act in ways to make themselves happier. This may not necessarily apply to all people as there may be altruistic individuals who act for others' benefit. Thus, it could be a hasty generalization.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not particularly applicable here since the argument does not discuss a complete set of possibilities but a broad claim.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Whether "everyone is doing what he believes will make himself happier" conclusively proves "everyone is selfish" could be questioned. The motivation behind actions could be multifaceted, not limited to selfishness alone.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis, "acting to make oneself happier," may not be compelling as it overlooks various motivations and contexts where people may act selflessly.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The Reason (R) "everyone is doing what he believes will make himself happier" is essentially restating the Proposition (P) "Everyone is selfish" in another form.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Not applicable since it does not rely on a universal agreement claim.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Not applicable as the language here is not particularly ambiguous.

### Step 3: Determine the Defective Argument Type

Upon analysis:

- **Generalization (G)**: The argument generalizes all people as selfish based on observation without accounting for exceptions.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reasoning given ("everyone is doing what he believes will make himself happier") essentially repeats the assertion in different words.

**Conclusion**: The argument "Everyone is selfish; everyone is doing what he believes will make himself happier..." can be classified primarily as a **Generalization (G)** and potentially as **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**. These defective argument types suitably categorize the logical fallacies in the provided string.
