For 
To apply the process of IDAA to the statement "He’s just a psychology teacher at a community college," we need to decompose the task of identifying the type of defective argument being presented. 

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Understanding the Statement**: This step involves comprehending the proposition and the context.
   - The statement "He’s just a psychology teacher at a community college" suggests a potential judgment or minimization of the person's role or expertise.

2. **Identifying the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine what the statement is asserting implicitly or explicitly.
   - Implicit Proposition: The person's capability or expertise in psychology is being minimized because of their job position.

3. **Identifying the Reason (<R>)**: Look for the underlying reason or rationale provided to support the proposition.
   - Reason: The job position at a community college is being used to infer something about the person's capability.

4. **Analyzing the Type of Defective Argument**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: This type involves making a broad assertion based on limited information.
     - Is the statement making a broad assertion about the person’s competence based solely on their job title?
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This would require a claimed exhaustive list missing out on some possibilities.
     - Does the statement imply an exhaustive account that is missing alternatives?
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This involves a reason that doesn’t fully support the proposition.
     - Is the job position insufficient as a reason to conclude the person's competence?
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This requires the reason submitted to be not compelling.
     - Is the statement's causal link between job and competence weak or unconvincing?
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This involves restating the proposition as the reason.
     - Is the reason merely a restatement of the proposition about competence based on the job title?
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This assumes universal agreement on something still disputed.
     - Does the statement assume everyone agrees the job title defines competence, which may still be in dispute?
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: This involves confusion through ambiguous phrasing.
     - Is there an ambiguity in how the statement could be interpreted?

Let's evaluate each type in detail:

- **Generalization (<G>)**:
  - The implication here is that because he is "just" a psychology teacher at a community college, his skills or knowledge are being generalized as inferior.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
  - Does not apply, as the statement does not attempt to list different roles or positions comprehensively.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
  - The reasoning provided does not conclusively demonstrate why being a psychology teacher at a community college negates one's expertise.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
  - The causal link provided (job at community college) is not a compelling basis to conclude the person's expertise or lack thereof.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
  - Not applicable here, since the reason is different (albeit insufficient) from the proposition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
  - This does not apply directly, as there is no assumed consensus.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
  - Language isn't particularly ambiguous in this context.

From these observations, it seems like the statement "He’s just a psychology teacher at a community college" fits best with both **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**. However, **Insufficient Causal Basis** tends to be the more precise label because the assertion that his role as a psychology teacher at a community college diminishes his expertise is not a compelling reason logically.

Thus, the defective argument type for the given statement is **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
