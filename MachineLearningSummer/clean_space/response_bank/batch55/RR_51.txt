To apply the IDAA (the decomposition of the IDA task into specific steps) to the statement "All hunting is inhumane and should be outlawed," we need to follow a structured approach to classify the argument according to the types of defective arguments defined. Here are the steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition is the main claim or assertion set forth by the argument. In this case, the proposition is:
- **<P>**: "All hunting is inhumane and should be outlawed."

### Step 2: Break Down the Proposition
We need to understand the specific characteristics and structure of the proposition to see if it matches any type of defective argument.

### Step 3: Evaluate for Generalization (<G>)
Generalization occurs when an assertion is based on one part or a majority of individuals, but it is applied to all. 
- Examine if "All hunting is inhumane" is an assertion based on limited observations but generalized to all hunting activities.

### Step 4: Evaluate for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
Incomplete Enumeration happens when a complete list of possibilities is claimed, but some pertinent ones are missed.
- Assess if the claim "All hunting is inhumane" ignores scenarios where hunting might be considered humane under certain conditions (e.g., regulated and ethical hunting practices).

### Step 5: Evaluate for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
Inconclusive Reason points to situations where the provided reason does not conclusively establish the proposition.
- Since the task does not provide an explicit reasoning structure for its claim, we cannot explicitly evaluate this without additional context.

### Step 6: Evaluate for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
Insufficient Causal Basis indicates a weak causal link between the reasoning and the proposition. 
- Here, there is no explicit causal basis provided to link the assertion "all hunting is inhumane" to "should be outlawed."

### Step 7: Evaluate for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
Faulty Repetition of Proposition is when reasoning essentially restates the proposition. 
- The statement does not contain reasoning; it is purely propositional.

### Step 8: Evaluate for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
Presumptuous Consensus assumes something to be true based on universal agreement, which is still in dispute.
- The statement does not rely on consensus as its basis.

### Step 9: Evaluate for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)
Ambiguous Language Use occurs when the argument can be taken in a different sense than intended.
- Examine the terms "inhumane" and "outlawed" for potential ambiguity. 

### Conclusion: Classify the Argument
Based on the steps, we identify the predominant defective type(s):

- **Generalization** (<G>): The statement "All hunting is inhumane and should be outlawed" makes a sweeping claim that applies to all forms of hunting without acknowledging potentially humane practices.

- **Incomplete Enumeration** (<FE>): By stating "all," the argument disregards scenarios and contexts where some forms of hunting could be considered humane, indicating an incomplete enumeration of possibilities.

Thus, we classify the argument as both:
- **<G>** (Generalization)
- **<FE>** (Incomplete Enumeration)

By going through these detailed steps, we were able to clearly identify the specific defects in the argument presented.
