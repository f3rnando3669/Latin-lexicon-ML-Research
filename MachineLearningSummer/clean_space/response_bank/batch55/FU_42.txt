For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of IDA into specific steps) to classify the argument "Arguing based on whether something is popular," we need to decompose the advanced task of classification into more manageable steps. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P) and Reason (R)**:
    - The argument "Arguing based on whether something is popular" suggests that the popularity of something is used as a basis for its validity.

2. **Determine if the Proposition (P) fits any defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP)**:
    - Define what each defective argument type represents.
        - **G (Generalization)**: P is a general assertion based on a part, not applicable to all.
        - **FE (Incomplete Enumeration)**: P is claimed to be based on all possibilities but misses some.
        - **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**: R does not conclusively prove P.
        - **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: R merely restates P.
        - **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: R is weak and does not compellingly support P.
        - **FU (Presumptuous Consensus)**: PR is assumed to be true because "everyone agrees."
        - **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use)**: PR can be interpreted differently than intended.

3. **Analyze if the argument "Arguing based on whether something is popular" fits into any of these categories**:
    - **Proposition (P)**: Popularity suggests validity.
    - **Reason (R)**: Something is popular; therefore, it must be valid.

4. **Match the argument to the defective types**:
    - **Generalization (G)**: The argument does not rely on the generalization of a part to a whole.
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not explicitly claim to enumerate all possibilities.
    - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason that popularity indicates validity does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The argument does not simply restate the proposition as the reason.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The reason provided (popularity) is not a compelling causal basis to determine validity.
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument assumes validity based on presumed universal agreement (popularity often implies consensus).
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language is not inherently ambiguous.

5. **Classify the Argument**:
    - The argument "Arguing based on whether something is popular" aligns most closely with **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** because it assumes that popularity (universal agreement) means validity, while this validity might still be in dispute. It also could be seen as having an **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because popularity is a weak causal basis for establishing the truth or validity of the proposition. However, FU is a more direct match.

**Conclusion**:
The argument "Arguing based on whether something is popular" can be identified as primarily a case of:
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**. 

Applying IDAA successfully decomposed and classified the argument based on the steps laid out above.
