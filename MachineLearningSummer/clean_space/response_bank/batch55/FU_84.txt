To apply the advanced task of decomposing the classification task <IDA> (identifying the defective argument type) into specific steps, and then applying these steps to the given string, we'll proceed as follows:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**
- The Proposition is the main assertion or claim being made. 
- In this case, the Proposition is: "Dave wants you to break into the spooky cabin with him."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**
- The Reason is the justification given to support the Proposition.
- In this case, the Reason given by Dave is: “Everyone does it.”

**Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**
- The Proof of Reason may involve additional arguments or evidence supporting the Reason.
- In this specific string, there is no additional argument or evidence presented beyond the Reason itself.

**Step 4: Compare the Proposition and Reason to Defective Argument Types**
- Generalization (<G>): This involves asserting something true for all based on a majority or a single instance. This doesn't fit well here since the Reason is based on presumed universal behavior rather than a subset.
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>): This involves missing pertinent possibilities. This doesn’t apply as it is not about enumerating options.
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>): Here, the Reason does not conclusively support the Proposition. This could apply since just because “everyone does it,” doesn't necessarily justify breaking into the cabin.
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>): This involves a weak causal link between the Reason and the Proposition. "Everyone does it" doesn’t establish a strong causal basis for why you should break into a cabin.
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>): This involves repeating the Proposition as the Reason, which doesn’t fit our case as the Reason “everyone does it” isn’t the same as the Proposition.
- Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>): This involves assuming something is true because “everyone agrees.” This fits perfectly since Dave justifies the action based on the presumed consensus.
- Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>): This involves using ambiguous terms which can be interpreted in different ways. This isn’t relevant since the terms used are clear and unambiguous.

**Step 5: Conclusion - Classify the String**
- Based on the analysis, the defective argument type that best fits the given string is **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**.
- Dave is committing the fallacy of assuming that breaking into the cabin is acceptable just because "everyone does it."

So, the IDAA application concludes that the fallacy Dave committed is **<FU> - Presumptuous Consensus**.
