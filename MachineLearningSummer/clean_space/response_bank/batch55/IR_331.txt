For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "Saying that because one finds something difficult to understand, therefore it's not true," we need to decompose the advanced task of classifying the defective argument type into specific steps and then follow those steps to perform the classification.

Hereâ€™s how we can break down the task:

1. **Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**   
   Determine the main assertion or proposition being made in the string.

2. **Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**   
   Determine the causal basis provided for the <P> in the string.

3. **Step 3: Classify the Defect**   
   Compare the identified <P> and <R> against the known types of defective arguments (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>) and classify which type it matches.

Let's apply these steps to the given string.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
In the string provided, the main assertion is:
- Finding something difficult to understand means it is not true.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The causal basis that supports this assertion is:
- Because one finds something difficult to understand.

### Step 3: Classify the Defect
Compare the identified <P> and <R> against the types of defective arguments:

- **Generalization (<G>):** This argument type generalizes based on an insufficient sample size. However, this doesn't seem to fit here as it's not about generalizing from one or several instances to all cases.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This is when you claim to have listed all possibilities but missed some. This doesn't apply here as the argument doesn't involve listing possibilities.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This is when the reason does not conclusively support the proposition. In our case:
  - The reason: Finding something difficult to understand.
  - The proposition: Therefore, it's not true.
  - The provided reason does not logically establish the truth or falsity of the proposition. Difficulty in understanding something does not logically conclude that it's not true; it's an inconclusive reason.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal basis for <P> is weak. This could be considered as fitting because the difficulty in understanding almost never implies truth or falsehood definitively.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This occurs when the reason is just restating the proposition. This does not apply here; <P> is "it's not true" and <R> is "finding it difficult to understand."

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This applies when using "it is universally agreed upon" as a reason, which is not present here.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** This involves ambiguity in language, which is not evident here.

The best fit for our classification is **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** because the reason given (difficulty in understanding) does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition (truth of the statement).

### Conclusion:
The string "Saying that because one finds something difficult to understand, therefore it's not true" is classified as **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**.
