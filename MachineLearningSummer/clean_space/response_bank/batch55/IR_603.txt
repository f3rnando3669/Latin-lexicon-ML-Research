Sure, let's apply **IDAA** to the string "Dad drank at parties, too" by decomposing the task **IDA** into specific steps and classifying the string accordingly. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Understanding the String

First, we need to understand the statement "Dad drank at parties, too." This suggests that there is an assertion, potentially a proposition, indicating that like others (implicitly other people who attended parties), Dad also consumed alcohol at social gatherings.

### Step 2: Identifying the Type of Defective Argument

To classify this statement as one of the defective argument types, we need to scrutinize the nature of the assertion it makes and the way it is constructed.

### Step 3: Categorizing the Assertion

Let's examine if it fits any of the defective argument types:

- **Generalization (G):**
  The statement might not exactly fit this category as it doesn't assert something applicable to all but rather makes a specific observation about "Dad."

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
  The statement doesn't attempt to list possibilities or enumerate reasons, so it isn't an incomplete enumeration.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
  The statement implicitly suggests that "Dad drank at parties, too," may be seen as a piece of evidence for something broader (like normalcy of drinking), but it doesn't conclusively demonstrate the correctness of any wider proposition on its own. Thus, it may lack conclusiveness if used to generalize behavior.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
  The causal link here is weak if the proposition is to claim some behavior is acceptable or typical solely based on Dad drinking at parties. It is not providing a strong causal basis for a general statement.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
  This would apply if the statement repeated a proposition without adding new information. Here, it doesn’t repeat but rather makes a standalone observation.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
  This doesn’t fall under this category as it doesn’t claim something is universally agreed upon.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
  Not likely, unless there's a misunderstanding of what is meant by "drank" or "too," but it doesn’t seem ambiguous in the provided context.

### Step 4: Conclusion

Among the categories, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** seem plausible. 

- **IR** is compelling if the proposition being argued is assuming that "drinking at parties" by Dad justifies or normalizes drinking at parties in general, but it doesn’t conclusively demonstrate any broader behavior or norm.
  
- **WCB** is valid if the statement aims to establish a norm or behavior pattern based on the behavior of Dad with insufficient causal explanation.

### Step 5: Best Fit

Since we don't have a broader context to evaluate if this statement serves as part of a more general proposition, we rely on the observation that the statement itself poses some form of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** to infer wider implications.

### Final Classification

Therefore, "Dad drank at parties, too" should be classified under **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
