For 
Sure, let's apply IDAA to the given statement step by step:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>**
The Proposition in the given statement is:
"If I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful? That's our Syrian refugee problem."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>**
The Reason is:
"The danger posed by a few potentially harmful entities (e.g., three dangerous skittles) justifies a sweeping generalization to avoid all such entities (e.g., the Syrian refugees)."

**Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason <PR>**
The statement does not provide a Proof of Reason. It indirectly asserts that because a few Skittles could be lethal, the entire bowl should be avoided, implying the same logic should apply to Syrian refugees.

**Step 4: Check for Defective Argument Types:**

- **Generalization <G>**: This argument type is where an assertion about some part is generalized to all. Here, the few dangerous skittles are being used to represent all Syrian refugees as potentially dangerous.
  - Yes, this statement can be classified as <G> because it generalizes the potential risk posed by a very small number of individuals to the entire group.

- **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>**: This is where we claim to have considered all possibilities but miss some.
  - No, this doesn't fit <FE> because it doesn't claim to have considered all possible outcomes explicitly.

- **Inconclusive Reason <IR>**: This is where the Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.
  - Partially yes, because the danger presented by a few individuals doesn’t conclusively demonstrate a uniform threat from all individuals.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>**: This is where the causal basis for the Reason is weak or unconvincing.
  - Yes, this is WCB since the analogy of skittles does not provide a strong causal basis to equate the risk of skittles to the risk of refugees.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>**: This happens when the Reason says exactly what the Proposition says.
  - No, this argument does not suffer from <RR> because it’s not merely repeating the Proposition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>**: This applies when a Proof of Reason is assumed to be certain on questionable grounds.
  - No, <FU> does not apply because there is no insistence on a consensus.

- **Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>**: This is when a term in the Proposition can be interpreted in a different way than intended.
  - No, there doesn't appear to be ambiguous language in the phrasing.

**Step 5: Combine Classifications**
Given the above analysis:

- The statement is largely a **Generalization <G>**.
- It also exhibits an **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>**.
- There is partially an **Inconclusive Reason <IR>**.

**Conclusion:**
Out of the argument classifications available, "Donald Trump Jr. Tweeted: If I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful? That's our Syrian refugee problem." primarily falls under <G> (Generalization) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis), with elements of <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
