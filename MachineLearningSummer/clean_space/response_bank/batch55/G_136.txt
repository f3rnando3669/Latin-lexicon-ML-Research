For 
To apply \(IDAA\) to the statement "Everyone knows that teenagers are lazy," we will decompose the task of classifying the defective argument into specific steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (\(P\)):**
   - Find the main assertion intended to be proven.
   
2. **Determine the Reason (\(R\)):**
   - Identify the causal basis or reason given for the proposition.

3. **Find the Proof of Reason (\(PR\)):**
   - Look for additional arguments or evidence supporting the reason.

4. **Identify the type of defective argument:**
   - Compare the structure and content of the argument against known defective argument types (\(G\), \(FE\), \(IR\), \(RR\), \(WCB\), \(FU\), \(DEP\)).

Here is the step-by-step decomposition and application:

---

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\(P\))**

- In the statement "Everyone knows that teenagers are lazy," the proposition (\(P\)) is: "Teenagers are lazy."

**Step 2: Determine the Reason (\(R\))**

- The reason (\(R\)) given is implied as: "Everyone knows it."

**Step 3: Find the Proof of Reason (\(PR\))**

- There is no explicit additional argument or evidence provided to corroborate the reason. The statement stands on the assumption that a general consensus exists.

**Step 4: Identify the type of defective argument**

- **Generalization (\(G\))**: This argument does not explicitly generalize from specific instances but rather appeals to a supposed universal knowledge.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\(FE\))**: There is no enumeration of possibilities or instances provided.
  
- **Inconclusive Reason (\(IR\))**: The reason "everyone knows it" does not conclusively demonstrate the laziness of all teenagers.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(WCB\))**: The causal basis is not clearly provided or weak.
  
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(RR\))**: The reason does repeat the proposition indirectly but emphasizes a universal belief rather than substantiate (\(R\)) or (\(P\)) directly.
  
- **Presumptuous Consensus (\(FU\))**: The argument type is primarily assuming something as certain based on presumed universal agreement.
  
- **Ambiguous Language Use (\(DEP\))**: The statement does not demonstrate ambiguous language use.

**Conclusion:**

The defective argument most fitting this statement is **Presumptuous Consensus (\(FU\))**. The argument makes an assumption that "teenagers are lazy" based on the presumed universal agreement that "everyone knows it," which is still in dispute and thus not a reliable proof.

---

Therefore, applying \(IDAA\) to "Everyone knows that teenagers are lazy" identifies it as a defective argument type \(FU\) (Presumptuous Consensus).
