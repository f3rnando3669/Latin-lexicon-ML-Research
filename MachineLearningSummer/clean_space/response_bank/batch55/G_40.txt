For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given statement, we need to decompose the task of classifying the defective argument into specific steps. Here’s a step-by-step decomposition and application:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D)

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Determine what claim the argument is making.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Identify the causal basis or justification given for the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - Check if there are additional arguments or corroborations provided for the reason.

4. **Check for Defective Argument Types:**
   - Evaluate the argument against the defined defective argument types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), and Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

5. **Classify the Defective Argument:**
   - Based on the evaluation, classify the argument as one of the defective argument types.

### Application of Decomposition (IDAA) to the Given Statement

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - "The government is convinced that it was a bomb that brought down the aircraft."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - The justification appears in the statements given by the president: “Our countrymen believe it was a bomb,” and the survey result indicating that almost seventy percent of the people believe it was a terrorist’s bomb.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - The survey conducted a few days after the crash indicating that almost seventy percent of the people believe it was a terrorist’s bomb.

4. **Check for Defective Argument Types:**

   - **Generalization (G):**
     - Not applicable, as this argument is not trying to extend the belief of some individuals to all.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
     - Not applicable, no enumeration of possibilities is made.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
     - The reason ("Our countrymen believe it was a bomb") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (that it was scientifically or investigatively proven to be a bomb), but we need to check other defective types too.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
     - The causal basis (public belief) is not a compelling one for the conclusion that the crash was caused by a bomb.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
     - Not applicable, the reason is not just a repetition of the proposition but an appeal to public belief.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
     - The reason and proof of reason are based on the claim that a majority believe it was a bomb - “Our countrymen believe it was a bomb” and the survey result.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
     - Not applicable, no ambiguous language is identified in the argument.

5. **Classify the Defective Argument:**

The given statement seems to fall into <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus) because it uses the majority opinion ("Our countrymen believe it was a bomb" and "almost seventy percent of the people believe it was a terrorist’s bomb") as the proof to support the proposition without conclusive evidence. 

Thus, the argument "The government is convinced that it was a bomb that brought down the aircraft. “Our countrymen believe it was a bomb,” said the president. “A survey done a few days after the crash indicates that almost seventy percent of the people believe it was a terrorist’s bomb.”" is classified as <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).
