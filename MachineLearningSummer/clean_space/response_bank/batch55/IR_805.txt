For 
To apply the task of classifying the provided statement by Representative Gutierrez according to defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>), we will decompose the task step by step as follows:

### Steps for Decomposition (<D>):
1. **Understand the Context**: Review the statement to understand its context and intention.
2. **Identify Proposition (<P>)**: Determine what is being asserted or intended to be proven.
3. **Identify Reason (<R>)**: Identify the causal basis put forth to establish the proposition's truth.
4. **Evaluate the Supporting Reason (<PR>)**: Examine if additional arguments are provided to support the reason.
5. **Classify Defective Argument Type**: Based on the analysis, classify the argument as one or more of the defective argument types.
6. **Document the Classification**: Clearly explain why the specific classification(s) were chosen.

### Application of <D> to <IDA> (Applying the Steps):

1. **Understand the Context**:
   - **Statement**: Representative Gutierrez criticizes Republicans for their support of the "Defense of Marriage Act" while he perceives their stance as hypocritical in terms of non-interference, decentralization of power, and family values.

2. **Identify Proposition (<P>)**:
   - **Proposition**: The Republicans are not genuinely committed to the principles of non-interference by the federal government, decentralization of power, and family values.

3. **Identify Reason (<R>)**:
   - **Reason**: The reason given is implied to be the perceived inconsistency between Republican actions in supporting the "Defense of Marriage Act" and their previously stated principles.

4. **Evaluate the Supporting Reason (<PR>)**:
   - **Supporting Argument**: The supporting argument is Representative Gutierrezâ€™s implication that these actions are inconsistent ("just kidding", "biggest joke") and thus insincere.

5. **Classify Defective Argument Type**:
   - **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: The critique here heavily relies on the perception of inconsistency and hypocrisy, which, while impactful rhetorically, might not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition that Republicans are insincere in their earlier principles. The inference drawn (that they are 'kidding' and their 'biggest joke') may not be conclusively linked without stronger evidence or reasoning.
   - **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: The phrases "just kidding" and "biggest joke" are metaphorical, and their intended meaning might be taken differently by different audiences, leading to different interpretations of Gutierrez's intent.
   - **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: Gutierrez's rhetorical strategy might be interpreted as assuming that the audience agrees with his view of Republican inconsistency ("I now realize" suggests a shared revelation).

6. **Document the Classification**:
   - The statement by Representative Gutierrez could be classified under:
     - **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: Because the reasoning provided might not be sufficient to definitively prove that Republicans are insincere in their principles without additional evidence.
     - **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: Because of the metaphorical language that could be interpreted in multiple ways.
     - **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: Because it suggests an assumption of shared understanding or agreement with the audience about Republican insincerity.

### Conclusion:
The given statement is primarily characterized under **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**, **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**, and potentially **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)** based on the argument analysis above. These classifications highlight the rhetorical rather than logically rigorous nature of the argument presented.
