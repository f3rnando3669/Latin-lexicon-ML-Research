Sure, let's apply the IDAA method to classify the string "Once a year, a miracle causes this large rock to float about ten centimeters off the ground since supernatural powers want us to remember the martyrs who died in that spot." as per the given defective argument types:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
Extract the main assertion or proposition from the string.

**Proposition (<P>):** "Once a year, a miracle causes this large rock to float about ten centimeters off the ground."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Identify the causal basis or reason given for the proposition.

**Reason (<R>):** "since supernatural powers want us to remember the martyrs who died in that spot."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
Check if there is any corroboration or proof provided for the reason. In this case, there isn’t an explicitly stated proof in the string.

**Proof of Reason (<PR>):** (Not explicitly given)

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type

Now we'll classify the argument according to the specified defective argument types:

**1. Generalization (<G>):** This doesn't fit since it doesn’t base its assertion on a part of, or the majority of, individuals.

**2. Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This doesn't fit since it's not a claim of completeness of possibilities.

**3. Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This is a strong candidate since the reason stated ("supernatural powers want us to remember the martyrs who died in that spot") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition ("a miracle causes this large rock to float about ten centimeters off the ground"). The reason provided is based on a supernatural assumption which isn't a compelling or scientifically verifiable cause.

**4. Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This is another strong candidate since the causal basis (supernatural powers) is not compelling or based on evidence that can be scrutinized or verified.

**5. Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason presented is not merely a repetition of the proposition.

**6. Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The argument does not rely on a presumed consensus.

**7. Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** There isn’t any noticeable ambiguous language that takes the proof in a different sense than intended.

### Conclusion
After evaluating the defective argument types, this argument best fits the classification of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. 

Therefore, based on the steps of IDAA, the string "Once a year, a miracle causes this large rock to float about ten centimeters off the ground since supernatural powers want us to remember the martyrs who died in that spot." can be classified primarily as either:
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** or 
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
