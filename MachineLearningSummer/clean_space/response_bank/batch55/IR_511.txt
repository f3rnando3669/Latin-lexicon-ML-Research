For 
**Step 1: Identify the proposition (<P>) in the argument.**

Proposition (<P>): "The opinions of these 5 people represent the majority of people."

**Step 2: Identify the reason (<R>) provided for the proposition.**

Reason (<R>): The 5 people asked provided opinions about Christian Heritage.

**Step 3: Analyze the Proof of Reason (<PR>) if present.**

Proof of Reason (<PR>): In this case, no additional arguments or corroborations are mentioned beyond the 5 opinions.

**Step 4: Examine the argument against the defined defective argument types.**

**Type <G> Generalization:** This defective argument type applies when a proposition is generalized from a part to the whole.

- **Analysis:** 
  - These 5 opinions do not necessarily apply to all or even the majority of people. 
  - Therefore, claiming that the opinions of these 5 people represent the majority is a generalization from a small sample to a larger population.

**Type <FE> Incomplete Enumeration:** This implies the proposition arises from missing out on some possibilities during enumeration.

- **Analysis:** 
  - The argument does not claim to have covered all possibilities, but it does imply that it is comprehensiveâ€”a subtle form of incomplete enumeration.
- **Decision:** 
  - Partial consideration, but not the main flaw here.

**Type <IR> Inconclusive Reason:** This involves the reason not conclusively supporting the proposition.

- **Analysis:** 
  - The reason fails to conclusively demonstrate that 5 opinions can represent the majority's stance as it lacks statistical validation or comprehensive coverage.
- **Decision:** 
  - Relevant but secondary.

**Type <RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** This involves the reason repeating the proposition.

- **Analysis:** 
  - The reason provided is distinct from the proposition and does not merely repeat it.
- **Decision:** 
  - Not applicable here.

**Type <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** This involves the reason being weak in terms of its causal basis for the proposition.

- **Analysis:** 
  - Although the causal basis is weak (small sample size), the primary issue is the generalization, not so much causal analysis.
- **Decision:** 
  - Ancillary consideration.

**Type <FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** This involves assuming something is universally agreed upon when it is still in dispute.

- **Analysis:** 
  - The argument does not assume universal agreement but makes a hasty generalization.
- **Decision:** 
  - Not quite fitting.

**Type <DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:** This involves ambiguous language leading to misinterpretation.

- **Analysis:** 
  - The language in this argument is clear, not ambiguous.
- **Decision:** 
  - Not applicable here.

**Step 5: Conclusion - Classify the argument.**

Based on the analysis, the primary defective argument type is:

### **Generalization (<G>)**

The argument "Only asking 5 people their opinion about Christian Heritage and saying their opinions are the 'majority' of people" is primarily a **Generalization (<G>)**, as it extrapolates the opinions of a very small sample to a large population without sufficient basis.
