Let's apply IDAA to classify the argument inherent in the statement "Congressman Darell Issa calls White House Spokesperson Jay Carney a 'paid liar.'" Here, we will decompose the task of classification into specific steps.

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**
   - Proposition (P): "White House Spokesperson Jay Carney is a paid liar."
   
**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)**
   - Reason (R): Congressman Darell Issa's assertion serves as the reason. There is no further reasoning provided within this statement, so the reason here is essentially the authority or claim made by Issa.

**Step 3: Identify whether the given reason supports the proposition adequately**
   - Since the proposition is being supported solely by the claim made by Issa, we must evaluate whether this reason truly establishes the truth of the proposition.

**Step 4: Classify the Reason (R)**
   - The reason does not present any evidence or additional arguments to substantiate the claim that Carney is a paid liar. It relies entirely on Issa's authority and assertion.

**Step 5: Determine the Defective Argument Type**
   - Given that the reason does not substantiate the claim with evidence, it falls under the category of a defective argument. Specifically, the reason fails to conclusively establish the correctness of the proposition.

After evaluating these steps, we conclude that this argument is an example of:

- **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**: The given reason (Issa's assertion) does not conclusively demonstrate or provide sufficient evidence to establish the correctness of the proposition that "Jay Carney is a paid liar."

Thus, the statement by Congressman Darell Issa is classified as an **IR** type defective argument.
