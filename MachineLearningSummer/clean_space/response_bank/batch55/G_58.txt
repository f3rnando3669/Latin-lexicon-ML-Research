For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to the given string "We think this new MallTime game app will be a success because all girls like shopping.", we need to decompose the classification task \( \text{IDA} \) into specific steps, and then follow these steps to identify which type of defective argument the given string represents.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of this process:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition \((P)\)
   - **Proposition (\(P\))**: This is the assertion we intend to prove.
   - **In the given string**: "We think this new MallTime game app will be a success"

### Step 2: Identify the Reason \((R)\)
   - **Reason (\(R\))**: This is the causal basis for the Proposition.
   - **In the given string**: "because all girls like shopping"

### Step 3: Classify the type of defective argument
   - Given the identified parts, now determine which type of defective argument \( P \) and \( R \) fit into:

#### Examination of \(R\):
   - **Generalization (\(G\))**: If the \(P\) is an assertion based on some one part or on a majority of individuals, but not necessarily applicable to all.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (\(FE\))**: If we claim to have made a complete enumeration of the possibilities but miss out on some pertinent ones.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (\(IR\))**: If \(R\) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of \(P\).
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(WCB\))**: If the causal basis which \(R\) submits for \(P\) is not a compelling one.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(RR\))**: When \(R\) is weak because it says precisely the same as the \(P\).
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (\(FU\))**: If a \(PR\) is assumed as certain on the ground that it is universally agreed upon while still in dispute.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (\(DEP\))**: If \(PR\) can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended.

### Application:
   - The \(P\) "We think this new MallTime game app will be a success" is supported by \(R\) "because all girls like shopping".
   - The \(R\) is making a sweeping statement about all girls liking shopping. This is not necessarily true and is a generalization based on an unstated assumption that all or most girls have the same preferences.

### Conclusion:
   - The argument fits the definition of \(G\) (Generalization). The reasoning assumes that because all girls purportedly like shopping, the app will succeed. However, this ignores the possibility that not all girls may like shopping, or that liking shopping guarantees the appâ€™s success.

Therefore, applying \(\text{IDAA}\) to the string "We think this new MallTime game app will be a success because all girls like shopping," we classify it as of type \( G \) (Generalization).
