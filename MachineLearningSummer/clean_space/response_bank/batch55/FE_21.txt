For 
To apply the process of <IDAA> to the statement "I'm raising money to help cure XYZ disease. If you do not donate, you are part of the problem," we need to break down the task of classifying the defective argument step by step. Here is the step-by-step decomposition and classification of the task:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
First, identify the main proposition that is intended to be proven.

#### Proposition:
The main proposition (P) in the statement is:
"If you do not donate, you are part of the problem."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Next, identify the reason provided to support the proposition.

#### Reason:
The reason (R) implied here seems to be:
"Because we are raising money to help cure XYZ disease."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
Now, check if there is any additional argument or proof provided to support the reason.

#### Proof of Reason:
There is no additional argument or proof provided beyond the assertion of raising money for XYZ disease.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type
Identify which type of defective argument the statement fits into using the defined defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

#### Analysis and Classification:
- **Generalization (G)**: The statement does not appear to make a generalization applicable to all individuals.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The statement does not claim to enumerate all possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided does not sufficiently demonstrate why not donating makes someone "part of the problem." The reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The statement does not simply repeat the proposition in the guise of a reason.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The reason provided is not compelling enough to establish a causal link between not donating and being part of the problem.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The statement does not assume universal agreement on something still in dispute.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language does not appear ambiguous or open to multiple interpretations.

Given these considerations, the best classification for the defective argument type is:

### Conclusion:
The statement "I'm raising money to help cure XYZ disease. If you do not donate, you are part of the problem." fits into:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. The causal link between not donating and being part of the problem is weak and unsubstantiated.

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the given statement results in identifying the defective argument type as <IR>.
