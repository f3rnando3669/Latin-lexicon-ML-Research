Sure, let's apply the process of decomposing the advanced task of classifying the given argument according to the defective argument types step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P> and the Reason <R>

#### Proposition (<P>):
The central assertion or claim being made in the argument.
- In this case, the main claim seems to be: "You've got to teach the boys logic!"

#### Reason (<R>):
The causal basis setting forth why the proposition <P> is true.
- The reason given is: "If you don't teach them logic, they won't learn how to think! And they'll become hobos and die in prison! Don't you care about your sons?"

### Step 2: Analyze the Reason (<R>) and its supporting statements or premises

#### Reason Analysis:
- The primary logic given here can be broken down into a series of premises:
    1. If you don't teach the boys logic, they won't learn how to think.
    2. If they don't learn how to think, they'll become hobos.
    3. If they become hobos, they'll die in prison.

### Step 3: Look for specific defective argument types

#### Generalization (<G>):
Check if the proposition is an assertion based on a few instances or a majority but applied universally.
- Not evidently a generalization.

#### Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):
Check if the proposition claims a complete enumeration but misses pertinent possibilities.
- The argument doesn't enumerate possibilities but follows a chain of causation.

#### Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):
Check if the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- There are several causal claims here that are unproven and questionable. The logic moving from not learning to think to becoming hobos to eventually dying in prison is highly speculative and not sufficiently demonstrated.

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):
Check if the causal basis for the reason is not compelling.
- The causal links ("not learning logic" leading to "becoming hobos" and "dying in prison") are speculative and lack robust evidence. 

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):
Check if the reason merely restates the proposition.
- The reason extends the proposition but doesn't merely repeat it verbatim.

#### Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):
Check if the proof of reason is assumed as certain due to "universal agreement."
- There's no appeal to universal agreement here.

#### Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):
Check if the proof of reason can be taken in another sense.
- The language is not obviously ambiguous; it is hyperbolic and dramatic but not necessarily ambiguous.

### Step 4: Classify the argument

Considering the step-by-step analysis, the argument primarily fits the criteria for:

#### Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):
The causal reasons provided ("they won't learn how to think" leading to "becoming hobos and dying in prison") don't conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition that "You've got to teach the boys logic."

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):
The causal basis for the chain of events from not learning logic to dying in prison is weak and speculative.

### Conclusion
The argument "You've got to teach the boys logic! If you don't teach them logic, they won't learn how to think! And they'll become hobos and die in prison! Don't you care about your sons?" is classified as:
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>) and
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).
