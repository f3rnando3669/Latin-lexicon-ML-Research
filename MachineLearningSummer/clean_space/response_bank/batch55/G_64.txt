For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types) to the given statement "I can't trust the mayor or the governor. All politicians must be liars," we need to take it step by step. Hereâ€™s the process broken down:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
First, we need to identify what the proposition is in the given statement. The proposition is an assertion that summarizes what is intended to be proven.

**Proposition (P): "All politicians must be liars."**

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
Next, we need to identify the reason given to support or establish the truth of the proposition.

**Reason (R): "I can't trust the mayor or the governor."**

### Step 3: Classify the Argument Type
Now, we classify this argument type using the definitions provided. We have several types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>. We analyze the proposition and the reason for the qualities that match any of the defective argument types.

1. **Generalization (G):** 
   - Does the argument make an assertion based on one part or a majority and apply it to all?
   - Yes, it makes a broad assertion that all politicians are liars based on the distrust of the mayor and the governor.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - Does the argument miss out on pertinent possibilities?
   - This does not seem to fit, as the statement does not claim to have considered all possibilities, just the speaker's experience with two politicians.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - Does the reason not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
   - The distrust of two politicians does not conclusively demonstrate that all politicians are liars.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - Is the causal basis for the reason not compelling?
   - Yes, the causal link between distrusting two politicians and concluding that all are liars is weak.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - Does the reason simply restate the proposition?
   - No, the reason provides an example of the distrust of specific politicians rather than merely restating that all are liars.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - Is the proof of the reason presumed to be certain based on universal agreement?
   - This does not apply here as the argument does not claim universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - Can the proof of reason be taken in another sense than the speaker intended?
   - This does not fit because the phrase seems to be clear in its intended meaning.

### Step 4: Conclusion
Based on the above analysis, the defective argument types that best classify the given statement are:

- **Generalization (G)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

Given the need to choose the most fitting classification, **G** stands out as the best match, as the argument is making a sweeping generalization about all politicians based on a limited sample.

### Final Classification:
The given string "I can't trust the mayor or the governor. All politicians must be liars." is an example of a defective argument type **Generalization (G)**.
