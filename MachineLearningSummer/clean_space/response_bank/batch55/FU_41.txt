For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task IDA into specific steps) to classify the string "a persuasive technique used in media messages that appeals to the "everyone is doing it" mentality," we will follow a systematic approach:

### Step 1: Understand the Definition of IDA
IDA involves classifying a given string into one of the seven defective argument types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), and Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

### Step 2: Analyze the Given String
The string provided is: "a persuasive technique used in media messages that appeals to the "everyone is doing it" mentality."

### Step 3: Identify the Characteristics of the String
The string describes a persuasive technique that exploits the idea that something is widely accepted or practiced by many people, thereby implying that it must be correct or desirable.

### Step 4: Compare Against Definitions of Defective Argument Types
We need to compare the identified characteristics with each of the defective argument types to determine the best match:

- **Generalization (G)**: The assertion is based on some individuals but applied to all. 
  - This doesn't really fit, as the string doesn't generalize from a sample to all individuals explicitly.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Claims to have considered all possibilities but misses some pertinent ones.
  - This doesn't seem to apply, as the string doesn't suggest an incomplete list of possibilities.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
  - This also doesn't seem to apply directly to our string.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason is merely a repetition of the proposition.
  - This doesn't fit, as the string is describing a technique rather than just repeating itself.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis for the proposition is not compelling.
  - The string isn’t providing a weak causal basis directly.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assumes something is true because it is universally agreed upon.
  - The appeal to "everyone is doing it" very closely resembles an appeal to presumed universal agreement. This fits well here.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The string can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended.
  - This doesn’t seem to apply here either.

### Step 5: Determine the Classification
Based on our comparison, the string closely aligns with the definition of **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** because it appeals to a universal agreement ("everyone is doing it") to persuade.

### Conclusion
By applying the IDAA, we classify the string "a persuasive technique used in media messages that appeals to the "everyone is doing it" mentality" as of type **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.
