For 
To apply the method of IDAA to the given string "After years of ignoring God, people have a hard time realizing what is right and what is wrong, what is good and what is bad," we will perform the following steps:

### Step 1: Decompose the Task (D)

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Establish what the statement intends to prove or assert.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Determine the causal basis presented to support the Proposition.
3. **Evaluate each Potential Defective Argument Type (IDA)**:
    - **Generalization (G)**
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
    - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**

### Step 2: Apply the Steps to the Given String

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
    - **P**: "People have a hard time realizing what is right and what is wrong, what is good and what is bad."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
    - **R**: "After years of ignoring God."

3. **Evaluate each Potential Defective Argument Type (IDA)**:
    - **Generalization (G)**: This string does not seem to be making a generalization based on a specific part or majority but rather provides a causal explanation for a broad assertion about all people.
    
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: There is no enumeration of possibilities in this argument, so this defective argument type is not applicable.
    
    - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason given, "After years of ignoring God," may not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the assertion that people have a hard time realizing moral and ethical distinctions. The causal link is not necessarily compelling or universally accepted.
    
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis, "ignoring God," is weak as it does not provide a compelling or detailed causal mechanism linking ignoring God with confusion about morality.
    
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason here is not simply a repetition of the proposition; it attempts to provide a causal basis.
    
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument does not rely on a presumed universal consensus, so this defective argument type is not applicable.
    
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The term "ignoring God" and its implications may be interpreted differently by different people, leading to potential ambiguity regarding the argument's basis.

### Step 3: Classify the String

Based on the analysis, the string most closely aligns with the following defective argument types:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The causality between "ignoring God" and difficulty in realizing morality is not conclusively demonstrated.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis provided is not compelling and lacks detailed evidence.
- **Potential Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The terms used could be interpreted in various ways, introducing ambiguity.

### Conclusion

The string "After years of ignoring God, people have a hard time realizing what is right and what is wrong, what is good and what is bad," is classified primarily as **IR** and **WCB**, with potential elements of **DEP**.
