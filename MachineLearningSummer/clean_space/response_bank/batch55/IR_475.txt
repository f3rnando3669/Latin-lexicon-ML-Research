For 
To apply the decomposition of the advanced task <IDAA> to the classification task <IDA> for the given argument "Animals tread softly upon the earth without shoes, so all other living beings should follow suit," let's break down the steps and analyze the argument step by step:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: This is the part of the argument where the author sets forth what they intend to prove.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: This is the part of the argument that provides a causal basis for the Proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Examine any additional arguments that support the Reason.
4. **Identify any Defective Argument Types**: Determine if the argument falls into any of the defective argument categories defined as <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Application to "Animals tread softly upon the earth without shoes, so all other living beings should follow suit."

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- **Proposition (<P>)**: "All other living beings should follow suit."
  - This is the conclusion or the main statement that the argument aims to prove.

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- **Reason (<R>)**: "Animals tread softly upon the earth without shoes."
  - This is the causal basis provided to support the Proposition. It suggests that because animals tread softly without shoes, other living beings should do the same.

#### Step 3: Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- In this argument, there is no additional argument provided to support the Reason. The Reason stands alone without further elaboration or evidence.

#### Step 4: Identify any Defective Argument Types
- **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument makes a broad assertion that may not apply to all living beings. It assumes that because some animals tread softly without shoes, all living beings should do the same.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This argument assumes that the behavior of animals encompasses the complete range of possibilities for living beings without considering exceptions or other pertinent cases.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The causal link provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition. Treading softly might not be a reason to remove shoes for all living beings.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The Reason provided ("Animals tread softly upon the earth without shoes") is not compelling enough to justify why all living beings should follow suit. It lacks a strong causal basis.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This is not applicable as the Reason is not just a repetition of the Proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument doesn't claim that the Proposition is universally agreed upon, so this type is not applicable here.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The term "living beings" can be taken ambiguously to mean different things, leading to potential misinterpretation, though this is not the most apparent defect.

### Conclusion
Based on the above analysis, the argument "Animals tread softly upon the earth without shoes, so all other living beings should follow suit" primarily falls under the following defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Asserts that because some animals act a certain way, all living beings should do the same.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Ignores other relevant cases or possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The Reason provided doesn't conclusively support the Proposition.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The Reason lacks a compelling causal basis to support the Proposition.
5. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: "Living beings" can be ambiguous, though this is a secondary concern.

The primary defective argument types identified here are <G>, <FE>, <IR>, and <WCB>.
