For 
To apply the decomposition of the task (IDAA) to the classification task (IDA), we need to break down the process into specific steps. Let's proceed step-by-step in identifying which defective argument type the given string "I saw that dog eat chicken so all dogs must only eat chicken." belongs to:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   This is the part where we set forth summarily what we intend to prove.
   - In the given string: "all dogs must only eat chicken."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   This sets forth the causal basis for P, establishing the truth of what we are urging.
   - In the given string: "I saw that dog eat chicken."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   This corroborates the briefly presented Reason by means of additional arguments. In this case, the string does not provide any additional arguments.
   - In the given string: Not explicitly present.

4. **Classify Defective Argument Type:**
   Now, classify the argument based on the definitions provided for defective argument types:
   - **Generalization (G):** An assertion based on some one part or on a majority of individuals, but not necessarily applicable to all, is referred to all.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Claiming a complete enumeration of possibilities but missing out on pertinent ones.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The Reason is just a repetition of the Proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The Reason is weak and not compelling enough.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Assumes consensus on something still in dispute.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The Proof of Reason can be taken in another sense than intended.

Based on our analysis:
- The Proposition ("all dogs must only eat chicken") is derived from a single observation of a dog eating chicken.
- The Reason ("I saw that dog eat chicken") does not provide sufficient causal basis; it is a form of inferring from one instance to a generalization.

This matches the definition of **Generalization (G)**, where an assertion based on one part or individual is erroneously applied to all instances.

Thus, the classification (IDA) of the given string "I saw that dog eat chicken so all dogs must only eat chicken." is **Generalization (G)**.

By breaking it down and following the steps, we've applied IDAA to classify the given string as of type **G**.
