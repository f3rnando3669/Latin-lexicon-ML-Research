For 
To apply IDAA to the given string "This is a fallacy of irrelevance that is based solely on someone's or something's history, origin, or source rather than its current meaning," we need to decompose the task of classifying the argument into the various defective argument types. Below are the steps involved:

### Step 1: Understand and Interpret the Given String
The string given is a description of a fallacy. Let's interpret it:
- "This is a fallacy of irrelevance" indicates that the argument is irrelevant to the point being discussed.
- "based solely on someone's or something's history, origin, or source" indicates that the argument's basis is not the present facts but rather the historical or origin context.

### Step 2: Identify Key Characteristics of Each Defective Argument Type
We need to recall the characteristics of each defective argument type to match them against the string interpretation.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Assertion based on some or a majority of cases but applied to all.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Claim of complete listing of possibilities but missing pertinent ones.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the Proposition.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Causal basis for Reason is not compelling.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Reason repeats the Proposition without adding new information.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Proof of Reason is assumed to be universally agreed upon, but itâ€™s actually in dispute.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Use of ambiguous language in Proof of Reason.

### Step 3: Compare the Definition with the Given String
- The given string mentions "irrelevance" and historical or origin-based reasoning. It does not address completeness of enumeration, general assertion to all individuals, conclusiveness, compelling causal basis, repetition, consensus, or ambiguous language directly.
- The phrase indicates that the argument's basis is the history or source, which may not be relevant to the current meaning or context.

### Step 4: Identify the Defective Argument Type
Among the defective argument types, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** is most fitting because the reason (someone's or something's history, origin, or source) does not directly and conclusively support or demonstrate the truth of the proposition (current meaning or context).

### Step 5: Classify the Argument
We classify the given string as follows:
- "This is a fallacy of irrelevance that is based solely on someone's or something's history, origin, or source rather than its current meaning" corresponds to an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.

Thus, applying IDAA to the given string classifies it as:

**<IR>**
