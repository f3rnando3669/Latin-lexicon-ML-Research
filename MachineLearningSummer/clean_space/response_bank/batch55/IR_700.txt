### Decomposition into Specific Steps (<D>)
To apply the advanced task of classifying a string into defective argument types, we can decompose <IDAA> into the following steps:
1. **Identify and Define the Statements**: Break down the given string into statements and assign who said what. 
2. **Analyze the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine the main proposition (if any) conveyed in each statement.
3. **Analyze the Reason (<R>)**: Identify the reason, if any, that supports the proposition.
4. **Analyze the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Look for additional arguments that serve as proof of the established reason.
5. **Classify Defective Argument Types (IDA)**: Determine if the argument falls into any of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>).

### Application of Decomposition (<IDAA>) to the String
Let's break down the conversation between Steve and Ed step-by-step:

#### Step 1: Identify and Define the Statements
- **Steve's Statement**: "In Sweden, college is free for citizens. How come we can't do that here?"
- **Ed's Statement**: "If you like Sweden so much, move there. The USA would be glad to be rid of your liberal ass!"

#### Step 2: Analyze the Proposition (<P>)
- **Steve's Proposition (<P>)**: "We should consider making college free for citizens, like in Sweden."
  - Note: This proposition is implied through the question asked ("How come we can't do that here?").
- **Ed's Proposition (<P>)**: "If you like Sweden so much, move there."

#### Step 3: Analyze the Reason (<R>)
- **Steve's Reason (<R>)**: The reason is implied rather than explicitly stated. Steve suggests that since Sweden can make college free, the USA could potentially do the same.
- **Ed's Reason (<R>)**: "The USA would be glad to be rid of your liberal ass."
  - This is not a direct reason supporting Ed's proposition but an attack on Steve's character.

#### Step 4: Analyze the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- **Steve's Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Not explicitly stated, but the example of Sweden is used to suggest it is feasible.
- **Ed's Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Ed does not provide a proof but instead engages in an ad hominem attack.

#### Step 5: Classify Defective Argument Types (IDA)
- **Steve's Argument**
  - **Possible Defective Types**: None conclusively identified. Steve's argument does not fit neatly into any of the defective argument types provided.
  
- **Ed's Argument**
  - **Type Identified**: Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
    - Ed's response does not address the feasibility or reasoning behind the proposition of making college free but instead attacks Steve’s character. This fails to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition that moving to Sweden is a valid solution.
  - **Type Identified**: Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)
    - Ed’s statement "The USA would be glad to be rid of your liberal ass" uses ambiguous language that may not be taken as intended but as an insult.

### Conclusion
Applying <IDAA> to the string, we can classify Ed's statements as follows:
- **Ed's Argument**: Mainly identified as containing the defective argument types <IR> and <DEP>.
