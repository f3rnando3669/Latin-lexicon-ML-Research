For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!", we need to classify this argument as one of the defective types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

Let's decompose the task into specific steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition, Reason, and Proof of Reason
- **Proposition (<P>)**: This is the statement being asserted. In this case, it is "my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well."
- **Reason (<R>)**: This is the causal basis for the Proposition. Here, the Reason seems to be "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up."
- **Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: This would be additional arguments or evidence that support the Reason, but in this argument, a separate <PR> is not explicitly provided.

### Step 2: Assess if the Argument Fits Any of the Defective Types
- **Generalization (<G>)**: This occurs when an assertion based on some individuals or parts is wrongly applied to all. 
    - The argument concerns an event associated with the Catholic Church and generalizes it to an individual member.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This occurs when a complete set of possibilities is claimed, but pertinent ones are missed. 
    - This doesn't seem to be about listing possibilities, so <FE> is unlikely.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This involves the Reason not conclusively demonstrating the truth of the Proposition.
    - The scandal does not logically necessitate that any individual Catholic must be guilty, making <IR> a possibility.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This is when the causal basis provided isn't compelling enough to establish the Proposition.
    - The involvement of the Catholic Church as an institution doesn't necessarily implicate individual members.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This occurs when the Reason merely repeats the Proposition in different words.
    - The Reason and Proposition here are different, so <RR> doesn't apply.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This is when the Proof of Reason assumes universal agreement on a disputed matter.
    - There's no universal consensus claimed here, so <FU> is not fitting.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: This happens when the Proof of Reason can be interpreted differently than intended.
    - The argument doesn’t hinge on ambiguous language, so <DEP> isn’t relevant.

### Step 3: Match the Argument to the Most Appropriate Defective Type.
- The argument "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!" is best classified as:
  - **Generalization (<G>)**: It generalizes the actions of some members of the Catholic Church to all members, including an elderly neighbor.
  - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The Reason doesn't conclusively demonstrate the truth of the Proposition, as it doesn't provide direct evidence connecting the neighbor to the scandal.
  - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: There is no compelling causal basis provided that directly links the involvement of the Catholic Church as an institution to individual members.

### Final Classification
The primary defective argument type here is **Generalization (<G>)**, as it takes the actions or reputation of the Catholic Church as a whole and incorrectly applies it to an individual member without specific evidence.
