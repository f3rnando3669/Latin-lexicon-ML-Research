For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task into specific steps) to IDA (the task of classifying the argument as one of the defective argument types), we need to break down the process systematically. Let’s proceed with the given statement: "Why worry about pandas going extinct, when we have the homeless in our country to worry about?"

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
In this statement, the proposition can be identified as the implicit suggestion or claim being made.
- Proposition (<P>): "We should not worry about pandas going extinct."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Next, let’s determine the reason given for this proposition.
- Reason (<R>): "Because we have the homeless in our country to worry about."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Reason with Respect to Possible Defective Argument Types
With the proposition and reason identified, we now classify the reason as one of the defective argument types. Here are the steps for evaluating it:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** Does the argument incorrectly generalize from a part to the whole?
   - No, the argument does not involve generalizing from a part to all.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Does it claim completeness while missing pertinent possibilities?
   - No, the argument does not enumerate possibilities incompletely.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (<P>)?
   - Yes, the reason given (homelessness) does not logically or causally address why panda extinction should not be a concern. These are disparate issues; homelessness does not render the concern for panda extinction invalid.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Is the causal basis weak or unconvincing?
   - Yes, similarly, the causal link presented is weak; the existence of homelessness does not causally compel us to ignore panda extinction.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Does the reason merely restate the proposition?
   - No, the reason given is not simply a restatement of the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Is it assumed to be true based on a supposed universal consensus still in dispute?
   - No, the argument does not suggest this reason is universally agreed upon.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Is ambiguous language used in a way that could be misunderstood?
   - No, the language used is not ambiguous; its intent is clear but unconvincing.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
Based on the breakdown and assessment of the reason:
- The argument can be classified as <IR> Inconclusive Reason and <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis.

### Conclusion
By decomposing the task into specific steps, we've determined that the string "Why worry about pandas going extinct, when we have the homeless in our country to worry about?" can be classified under the defective argument types:
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**

Both classifications apply because the reason given does not logically address the concern about pandas and the causal link presented is weak.
