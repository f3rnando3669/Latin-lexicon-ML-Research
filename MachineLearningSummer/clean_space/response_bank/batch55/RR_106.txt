For 
To apply IDAA (the application of the decomposition of an advanced task to the task of classifying a string as one of the given defective argument types), we need to break down the task of identifying the defective argument type step-by-step.

Let's begin:

### Step 1: Identify the proposition (P)
In the given statement, the main proposition is:
"God did not create the world six thousand years ago."

### Step 2: Identify the reason (R)
The reason provided for this proposition is:
"Because matter has always existed, and therefore the world has always existed."

### Step 3: Evaluate the reason (R) with respect to the proposition (P)
We need to assess whether the reason conclusively supports the proposition and if any of the defective argument types apply.

### Step 4: Check for Generalization (G)
- Is the proposition an assertion based on a part or majority but not necessarily applicable to all?
  - No, this does not appear to be based on generalization.

### Step 5: Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
- Does the proposition claim a complete enumeration of possibilities but omit pertinent ones?
  - No, there is no enumeration of possibilities in the argument.

### Step 6: Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR)
- Does the reason (R) conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (P)?
  - The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. "Matter has always existed" does not inherently mean that "God did not create the world six thousand years ago." There is a jump in logic without solid proof of causality between these statements.

### Step 7: Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
- Is the causal basis for the reason weak or not compelling?
  - The causal basis is definitely weak. The existence of matter does not directly imply anything about whether God created the world six thousand years ago.

### Step 8: Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
- Does the reason merely repeat the proposition in different words?
  - The reason does not repeat the proposition. It provides a separate claim about the existence of matter.

### Step 9: Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
- Does the proof of reason assume certainty based on claims of universal agreement?
  - There is no mention of universal agreement in the reason or proof.

### Step 10: Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)
- Can the proof of the reason be taken in another sense than intended?
  - The language does not seem particularly ambiguous.

### Conclusion
After examining all steps, the defective argument type that best fits the given string is **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, because the provided reason does not conclusively and validly demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. There is a significant logical gap between "matter has always existed" and "God did not create the world six thousand years ago." Thus, the argument is not compelling or logically sound.

Therefore, the classification of the string "God did not create the world six thousand years ago because matter has always existed, and therefore the world has always existed" is:

**<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**.
