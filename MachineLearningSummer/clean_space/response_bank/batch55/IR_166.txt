For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the advanced task IDA) to the given string "Maria has been working at her current job for more than 30 years at the same wage. She desperately wants a raise so she approaches her boss to ask for one. She says, 'You are one of the kindest people I know. You are smart and good-looking and I really love your shoes.'", we'll go through the following steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
The Proposition <P> is what Maria intends to proveâ€”she wants to get a raise.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
The Reason <R> is why Maria thinks she deserves the raise. However, in the given statement, Maria doesn't provide a clear, causal basis or justified reason. Instead, she offers compliments to her boss: 
- "You are one of the kindest people I know."
- "You are smart and good-looking."
- "I really love your shoes."

### Step 3: Identify any Proofs of Reason <PR>
There are no additional arguments or proofs given that would substantiate the Reason <R> for the Proposition <P>. Instead, the statements given are flattering comments about the boss.

### Step 4: Classify any Potential Defective Arguments
Let's investigate if the argument falls into any of the defective argument types.

#### Generalization <G>
There is no generalization being made about a subset applied to a whole set.

#### Incomplete Enumeration <FE>
There are no claims of complete enumeration of possibilities in the argument.

#### Inconclusive Reason <IR>
The Reason <R> provided does not conclusively demonstrate why Maria should get a raise. Rather, the reasons given are irrelevant to her job performance or a justification for the raise.

#### Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>
The Reason <R> fails to provide a compelling causal basis for the Proposition <P>. Compliments about her boss's kindness, intelligence, appearance, and taste in shoes do not sufficiently justify why Maria should receive a raise.

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>
The Reason <R> does not repeat the Proposition <P>. There is no repetition observed.

#### Presumptuous Consensus <FU>
There is no appeal to a presumed universal agreement to support her claim.

#### Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>
The language used in Maria's statement, while complimentary, is not necessarily ambiguous but rather irrelevant to achieving the objective.

### Step 5: Conclusion on Defective Argument Classification
Based on the analysis, the best classification for the defective argument is:
- **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>** 

The Reason <R> Maria offers is not compelling or directly relevant to substantiating the Proposition <P> that she should get a raise. Complimenting her boss does not establish a strong, causal basis for her request for a raise.
