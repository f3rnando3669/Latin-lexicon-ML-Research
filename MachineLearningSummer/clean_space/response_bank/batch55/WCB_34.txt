For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types) to the string "Every time I wash my car, it rains," we need to break down the process into specific steps and then apply those steps to the string. Let's proceed with the decomposition:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of Task <IDA> into <D>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Determine the main claim or assertion being made in the string.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Determine the causal basis or reasoning provided to support the Proposition.

3. **Analyze the Proposition and Reason for Defects:**
   - Determine if the Proposition (P) is a defective argument type such as Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), etc.
   - Determine if the Reason (R) is defective, such as Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), etc.
   - Determine if any Proof of Reason (PR) is defective, such as Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>) or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

### Applying to "Every time I wash my car, it rains":

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Proposition (P): "Every time I wash my car, it rains."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Reason (R): The sentence implicitly suggests a causal relationship between washing the car and it raining. However, there isn't an explicit Reason (R) provided in the sentence.

3. **Analyze the Proposition and Reason for Defects**:

   - **Generalization (<G>):**
     - "Every time I wash my car, it rains" suggests a universal claim based on personal observation. It generalizes a specific personal experience to a universal outcome without sufficient evidence.
     - This fits the definition of Generalization: an assertion based on some one part (the individual's personal experience) is referred to all situations of washing a car.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
     - The statement doesn't attempt to enumerate all possible reasons or factors contributing to rain beyond the act of washing the car.
     - There's no clear enumeration here, and it's not claiming to be a complete enumeration, so this doesn’t fit Incomplete Enumeration.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
     - The sentence doesn’t provide a concrete reason (R) to demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition (P).
     - Since no explicit Reason is provided, we can't evaluate this type of defect directly.

   - **Weak Causal Basis (WCB):**
     - Though a causal basis is implied, it is not compelling because correlation doesn’t imply causation. However, since no explicit Reason is provided, this doesn’t directly qualify under Weak Causal Basis based on the provided definitions.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
     - There doesn't appear to be repetition in the statement; it is a singular assertion.
     - This doesn't fit under Faulty Repetition of Proposition.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
     - The statement doesn't appeal to a universal agreement. Therefore, it doesn’t fit Presumptuous Consensus.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
     - The language of the statement is straightforward and doesn’t appear ambiguous.
     - This does not fit under Ambiguous Language Use.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the defective argument type that most appropriately fits the string "Every time I wash my car, it rains" is **Generalization (<G>)**. This is because the speaker is making a universal claim based on their limited personal experience without substantiating it with broader evidence.

Thus, the classification of the string "Every time I wash my car, it rains" as a defective argument type is **<G> (Generalization)**.
