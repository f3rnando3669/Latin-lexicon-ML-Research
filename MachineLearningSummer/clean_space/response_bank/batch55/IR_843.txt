To apply the process of decomposing the task of classifying a defective argument (IDAA) to the given statement "You think labor unions are good? You know who else liked labor unions? Karl Marx, that’s who.", we'll follow these steps systematically:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
First, identify the core proposition or assertion being made.

- **Proposition (<P>)**: The implicit assertion here is that **labor unions are bad** because Karl Marx liked them.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Determine the reason provided to support the proposition.

- **Reason (<R>)**: The reason given is that **Karl Marx liked labor unions**.

### Step 3: Analyze the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
Examine any additional arguments or proof meant to corroborate the given reason.

- There is no direct additional argument or proof presented. The statement relies on the association with Karl Marx to make its point.

### Step 4: Evaluate for Defective Argument Types
Now classify the argument based on the defective argument types defined.

Let's go through each defective argument type to see if it fits the given statement:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This doesn’t appear to be an overgeneralization based on a part to the whole.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: There’s no enumeration of possibilities that’s supposedly comprehensive.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: It doesn't conclusively demonstrate that liking labor unions is inherently bad based on the fact that Karl Marx liked them.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal link between Marx liking labor unions and labor unions being bad is weak, as it’s based on guilt by association rather than a logical cause-effect relationship.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The reason is not merely a repetition of the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument doesn’t claim universal agreement on the proposition.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The language used doesn’t carry ambiguous meaning that can be taken otherwise.

Upon analyzing the defective argument types, the statement best fits **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**, as the reason provided — that Karl Marx liked labor unions — is not a compelling or logically sufficient reason to conclude that labor unions are bad.

### Step 5: Classification
Finally, classify the argument as of the identified defective type.

- **Classification**: The given argument is of type **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
