For 
To apply <IDAA> to the sentence "Don’t believe what Alex says about global warming. Alex dropped out of college!", we need to decompose the task of classifying the string into specific steps. Let's begin by identifying and defining these steps, and then applying them to the given sentence.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>), the Reason (<R>), and the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
    - Proposition (<P>): What is the main claim or assertion made?
    - Reason (<R>): What is the causal basis provided for this claim?
    - Proof of Reason (<PR>): What additional arguments corroborate the Reason?

2. **Analyze the Argument Structure:**
    - Determine whether the argument fits any of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>).

3. **Classify the Argument:**
    - Based on the analysis, classify the given string as one of the defective argument types.

### Applying the Steps

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition, Reason, and Proof of Reason

Let's break down the sentence into its components:

- **Proposition (<P>):** "Don’t believe what Alex says about global warming."
- **Reason (<R>):** "Alex dropped out of college!"
- **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Not explicitly provided in the string. Often, for this type of argument, it's implied rather than explicitly stated.

#### Step 2: Analyze the Argument Structure

Now, we'll evaluate whether this argument fits any of the defective argument types.

- **Generalization (<G>):** This does not seem to generalize from a part to a whole.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This does not deal with listing possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason provided ("Alex dropped out of college!") does not have a direct causal basis for the proposition about global warming knowledge (the conclusion). This makes the reason inconclusive for the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The reason is weak because the connection between college dropout status and knowledge about global warming is not compelling.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason is not a repetition of the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** It is not relying on an assumed universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The language does not appear to be ambiguous in meaning.

#### Step 3: Classify the Argument

Based on the analysis, the sentence appears to fit both <IR> and <WCB> categories, but <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis) seems to be the most fitting because the reason provided ("Alex dropped out of college!") does not adequately support the proposition about global warming knowledge. 

### Conclusion

The given string "Don’t believe what Alex says about global warming. Alex dropped out of college!" is classified as <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
