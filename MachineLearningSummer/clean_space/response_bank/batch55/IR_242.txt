For 
To classify the string "Keeping a dog as a pet is every bit as evil as human slavery." using the process of IDAA (which is the application of decomposition to classify the argument as one of the defective types), we will break this down step by step. Here is the decomposition of this task:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition and Reason
- **Proposition (P)**: "Keeping a dog as a pet is every bit as evil as human slavery."
- **Reason (R)**: Typically implicit; here the implied reason might be ethical or moral equivalence between keeping pets and human slavery.

### Step 2: Examine for General Defects
- We need to scrutinize any reasoning/argument structures to identify defects.

### Step 3: Classify Using Definitions
- <G>: Generalization
- <FE>: Incomplete Enumeration
- <IR>: Inconclusive Reason
- <RR>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition
- <WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis
- <FU>: Presumptuous Consensus
- <DEP>: Ambiguous Language Use

### Step 4: Apply Defects Dictionary

1. **Generalization (G)**: Is the proposition a generalization based on insufficient evidence?
- The claim "Keeping a dog as a pet is every bit as evil as human slavery" doesn't appear to be focusing on a generalization about individual instances but rather making a global moral comparison.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Is there an omission of pertinent possibilities?
- This argument does not seem to be about enumerating possibilities but making a direct moral comparison.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Does the reason fail to conclusively establish the claim?
- The comparison between keeping pets and human slavery lacks depth and context. It doesn't furnish a definitive set of ethical or logical arguments that conclusively demonstrate the equivalence. It makes a strong assertion without thoroughly proven reasoning, making this <IR>.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Is the reason a repeat of the proposition?
- The argument does not simply repeat itself in different words but makes a comparison.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Is the causal basis for the proposition weak or unconvincing?
- The implied causal reasoning (ethical equivalence) is quite weak in its appeal without significant supportive evidence, making it a candidate for <WCB>.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Does it assume consensus on a disputed fact?
- It doesnâ€™t present itself as relying on a presumed consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Could the proposition be taken in another sense?
- The term "evil" may be subjective, but that by itself is not the core defect here.

### Step 5: Final Classification
Given our analysis, the argument primarily suffers from:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The implicit reason fails to conclusively support the equivalence claim.

Additionally, **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** can be considered due to the weak underpinning of the asserted ethical equivalence.

### Conclusion
The classification of the argument "Keeping a dog as a pet is every bit as evil as human slavery" according to IDAA is:
- **<IR>**: Inconclusive Reason
- **<WCB>**: Insufficient Causal Basis (as a secondary classification)
