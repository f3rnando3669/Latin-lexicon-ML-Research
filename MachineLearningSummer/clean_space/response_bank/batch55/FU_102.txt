For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to the string "Gay marriages are just immoral. 70% of Americans think so!" we will decompose the task of \( \text{IDA} \) into specific steps and then follow those steps to classify the given string.

### Step 1: Identify the Propositions and Reasons
- **Proposition (\( \text{P} \))**: This is the main assertion or claim being made.
  - In this case: "Gay marriages are just immoral."
- **Reason (\( \text{R} \))**: This is the causal basis provided to support the proposition.
  - In this case: "70% of Americans think so!"

### Step 2: Evaluate the Reason for Defective Argument Types
We need to determine if \( \text{R} \) exhibits any characteristics of the defined defective arguments: \( \text{G} \), \( \text{FE} \), \( \text{IR} \), \( \text{WCB} \), \( \text{RR} \), \( \text{FU} \), or \( \text{DEP} \).

- **Generalization (\( \text{G} \))**: The proposition assumes something is true for all based on some or the majority.
  - Not applicable here since \( \text{P} \) is not a generalization based on a part or majority.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\( \text{FE} \))**: Claiming complete enumeration of possibilities, but missing pertinent ones.
  - Not applicable as there is no enumeration involved in the argument.
  
- **Inconclusive Reason (\( \text{IR} \))**: \( \text{R} \) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of \( \text{P} \).
  - Seems applicable because the opinion of 70% of Americans does not conclusively demonstrate the morality of gay marriages.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( \text{WCB} \))**: The causal basis submitted for \( \text{P} \) is not compelling.
  - Also applicable because public opinion (70% of Americans) is not a strong enough basis to judge morality, which typically requires ethical reasoning.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( \text{RR} \))**: \( \text{R} \) repeats \( \text{P} \) in another form.
  - Not applicable here since the reason given is not a repetition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (\( \text{FU} \))**: \( \text{PR} \) assumed as certain because “it is universally agreed upon.”
  - Applicable because the argument assumes that the proposition ("Gay marriages are just immoral") is true based on a presumed consensus ("70% of Americans think so").

- **Ambiguous Language Use (\( \text{DEP} \))**: \( \text{PR} \) can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended.
  - Not directly applicable here as there is no significant ambiguity in how the language is used.

### Step 3: Classify the String
Based on the evaluation:
- The argument is \( \text{IR} \) because the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- The argument is \( \text{WCB} \) due to an insufficient causal basis for the proposition.
- The argument is \( \text{FU} \) because it relies on a presumptuous consensus.

Thus, the string "Gay marriages are just immoral. 70% of Americans think so!" can be classified as exhibiting characteristics of \( \text{IR} \), \( \text{WCB} \), and \( \text{FU} \).
