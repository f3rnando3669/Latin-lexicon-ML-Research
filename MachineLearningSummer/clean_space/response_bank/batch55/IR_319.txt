For 
To apply the decomposition approach (IDAA) to the task of classifying the string "I don't know how Professor Resnick can be such a hard grader. He's always late for class," we can break down the task step by step as follows:

### Step 1: Understand the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>)
- **Proposition (<P>):** The main assertion or claim that the argument is trying to prove.
- **Reason (<R>):** The basis or evidence given for the proposition.

In the given string:
- **Proposition (<P>):** "Professor Resnick can be such a hard grader."
- **Reason (<R>):** "He's always late for class."

### Step 2: Determine the Defective Argument Type by Classification (IDA)

Next we need to classify it into one of the defective argument types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

Let's go through each type to see which best fits the argument:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** 
   - This does not seem to fit as the argument is not making a general statement applied to all based on a specific part or majority.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - This does not seem to fit as the argument is not claiming to provide a complete list of possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - This *could* fit. The reason provided ("He's always late for class") does not logically or conclusively support the proposition ("Professor Resnick can be such a hard grader"). Being late for class does not directly affect the grading difficulty.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - This also *could* fit as the causal relationship between being late and being a hard grader is weak and unconvincing.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - This does not fit as the reason provided is different from the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - This does not fit as thereâ€™s no claim of universal agreement being used as proof.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - This does not fit because the terms used are not ambiguous in a way that affects the argument.

### Step 3: Select the Best Fit
Upon close examination, the best fits are Inconclusive Reason (<IR>) and Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).

### Step 4: Make the Final Classification
- Although both <IR> and <WCB> could potentially classify the argument, <IR> is a more precise classification because it directly addresses the issue that the reason given does not logically follow to the conclusion.

Therefore, the defective argument type for the string "I don't know how Professor Resnick can be such a hard grader. He's always late for class." is **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**.
