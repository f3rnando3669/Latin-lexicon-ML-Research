To apply the process of IDAA (decomposition of IDA into specific steps) to the task of classifying the argument "I know you don’t like the kitty-cat sweater that Grandma knitted for you, but she worked so hard on it and it will make her happy to see you wear it in the family holiday photo.", we will follow these steps step-by-step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
A proposition is what the argument is attempting to prove.

In this argument, the proposition appears to be:
- **P**: "You should wear the kitty-cat sweater in the family holiday photo."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
A reason is the causal basis provided to support the proposition.

The reason provided in this argument is:
- **R**: "Grandma worked hard on it and it will make her happy."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
A proof of reason is any additional argument that corroborates the reason.

In this argument:
- **PR**: The implicit social expectation that wearing a gift pleases the giver, which is presumed to be universally agreed upon.

### Step 4: Determine if the Argument is Defective
Next, we need to classify the argument into one of the defective types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>. We will consider each type:

- **G (Generalization)**: No generalization is made about a group.
- **FE (Incomplete Enumeration)**: Not applicable as it is not an enumeration argument.
- **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**: This needs to be decided if the reason doesn't conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: Check if the reason repeats the proposition.
- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: Assess if the reason provided is insufficient or not compelling.
- **FU (Presumptuous Consensus)**: The argument possibly grounds itself on a widely accepted social expectation to support the PR.
- **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use)**: Check if any ambiguity exists in the argument language.

### Step 5: Apply Specific Conditions to Every Defective Argument Type
- **IR**: Is the reason (R) provided adequate? The reason "Grandma worked hard on it and it will make her happy" introduces an emotional appeal but is not directly addressing the validity of wearing the sweater as a 'should do' action beyond social courtesy.
- **RR**: The provided (R) is not a mere repetition of (P).
- **WCB**: The causal basis, while emotional, could perhaps be seen as insufficient if not compelling enough as logic to wear the sweater.
- **FU**: This argument appears to assume a social norm ("it is universally agreed upon," though it may be in dispute), thus it leans towards **Presumptuous Consensus**.
- **DEP**: No ambiguous language use appears to be present.

By breaking down each part systematically, we identify that this argument is likely an example of **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**. This is because it relies heavily on the socially presumed but potentially contested notion that one should wear a gift item to make the gifter happy. 

### Final Diagnosis
**The argument "I know you don’t like the kitty-cat sweater that Grandma knitted for you, but she worked so hard on it and it will make her happy to see you wear it in the family holiday photo" can be classified as Presumptuous Consensus (FU).**
