For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "If someone told you, 'Why should we be worrying about how the government treats Native people, when people in our city can't get a job?' what logical fallacy are they using?", we need to implement a step-by-step process of decomposition to classify this string as one of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

**Step 1: Identify the statement and its components.**

The given statement is:
"Why should we be worrying about how the government treats Native people, when people in our city can't get a job?"

**Step 2: Recognize the components of this argument.**

- Proposition (<P>): "We should not be worrying about how the government treats Native people."
- Reason (<R>): "People in our city can't get a job."

**Step 3: Analyze the relationship between the Proposition and the Reason.**

- Is the Reason provided supportive and compelling to establish the truth of the Proposition?
- Does the Reason conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition?

**Step 4: Compare with defective argument types.**

Consider each defective argument type to see which best matches the identified relationship between the Proposition and Reason.

- **Generalization (<G>):** No generalization is being applied based on some part or majority here.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** There's no enumeration of possibilities being claimed here.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The Reason here does not logically support the Proposition. The statement dismisses one concern by pointing to another unrelated concern. This is an argument fallacy often known as a "red herring" or "irrelevant conclusion."
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The Reason does not merely repeat the Proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This does not seem to be the exact fit, as the Reason does not provide a weak causal basis but rather a distraction.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** There's no assumption of universal agreement involved.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The language used is clear and not ambiguous.

**Step 5: Classify the defective argument type.**

Based on the analysis, the defective argument type that best matches the given string is **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**.

The Reason provided ("people in our city can't get a job") does not logically conclude that we should not be worrying about how the government treats Native people. It is an irrelevant response to the issue at hand.

Therefore, the logical fallacy being used in the given string is classified as **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason).
