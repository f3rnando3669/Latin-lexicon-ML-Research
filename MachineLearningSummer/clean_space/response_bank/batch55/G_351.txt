For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task IDA into specific steps), we need to classify the given string as one of the defective argument types. Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine the main assertion or proposition of the argument. 
   - In the given string: "Christine has a terrible experience with a boyfriend. She decides that all boys are mean."
   - The main proposition (<P>) is: "All boys are mean."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Identify the reason given to support the proposition. 
   - In the given string, the reason (<R>) given is: "Christine has a terrible experience with a boyfriend."

3. **Examine the Reason and the Proposition**: Evaluate how the reason supports or fails to support the proposition.
   - The reason given is a single instance (Christineâ€™s experience with one boyfriend) being used to generalize about all boys.

4. **Check for Defective Argument Types**: Compare the argument against the definitions of defective argument types.
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: This occurs when the <P> is based on some part or a majority of individuals but is applied to all.
     - Here, Christine's conclusion that "all boys are mean" is based on her experience with one boyfriend, not on a comprehensive assessment of all boys.

By following the steps in the decomposition:
- **Step 1**: Identify the proposition: "All boys are mean."
- **Step 2**: Identify the reason: "Christine has a terrible experience with a boyfriend."
- **Step 3**: Analyze the reason and proposition: The proposition is a broad generalization based on a single case.
- **Step 4**: Compare with defective argument types: This matches the definition of Generalization (<G>).

Conclusion: The given string "Christine has a terrible experience with a boyfriend. She decides that all boys are mean." is classified as a Generalization (<G>).
