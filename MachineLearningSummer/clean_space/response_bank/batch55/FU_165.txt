For 
To apply **IDAA** to the given argument, we need to break the task of classifying it into specific steps. The goal is to identify if the argument fits one of the defective argument types: **Generalization (G)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**, **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**, or **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>)

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
    - **Examine the statement to determine what is being asserted or proposed.**

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
    - **Look for the causal basis or the justification provided for the proposition.**

3. **Check the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
    - **Identify any additional arguments that support the reason given.**

4. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types**:
    - **Compare the identified <P>, <R>, and <PR> with the definitions of defective argument types to classify the argument correctly.**

### Applying <IDAA> to the Provided Argument:

**Argument:** "How could you not believe in ghosts? Roughly two billion people believe in them, so don't you think you should reconsider your opinion?"

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
    - **<P>: "You should believe in ghosts."**

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
    - **<R>: "Roughly two billion people believe in them."**

3. **Check the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
    - **There is no additional argument supporting the reason; the argument relies solely on the presented reason.**

4. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types**:

    - **Generalization (G)**: Not applicable. This argument doesn't generalize based on a part or majority to all.
    
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable. This argument doesn't claim to enumerate all possibilities.
    
    - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Consider if the reason provided conclusively proves the proposition. The belief of two billion people in ghosts does not conclusively demonstrate that ghosts exist or that one should believe in them.
    
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This may be somewhat related, as the sheer number of believers isn't a compelling causal reason for the truth of the proposition.
    
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Not applicable. The reason does not simply repeat the proposition.
    
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This is closely fitting. The argument assumes that because a large number of people believe in ghosts, it should be accepted as truthâ€”implicitly suggesting that consensus equates to correctness.
    
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Not applicable. The language in the argument is clear in its intended meaning.

**Conclusion**: The most fitting defective argument type here is **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**, as the argument relies on the large number of believers to pressure reconsideration, assuming consensus as a basis for truth. 

**Final Classification**: The argument "**How could you not believe in ghosts? Roughly two billion people believe in them, so don't you think you should reconsider your opinion?**" is of type **<FU>**.
