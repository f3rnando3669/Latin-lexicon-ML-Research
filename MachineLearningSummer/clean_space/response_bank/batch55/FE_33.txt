For 
To apply the IDAA (Decomposition of the task of classifying a string into specific steps) to the string "It is an example of," we first need to decompose the task in a structured manner. The goal is to identify which defective argument type the string "It is an example of" falls into: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (IDAA)

1. **Identification of Task (IDA)**:
   - Task: Classify the string "It is an example of" into one of the defective argument types.

2. **Understand the Statement**:
   - Analyze the content and nature of the string "It is an example of".

3. **Evaluate each Defective Argument Type**:
   - Determine if the string "It is an example of" fits the criteria of any defective argument types.

**Step 1: Generalization (<G>)**:
   - **Definition**: Assertion based on one or majority but not applicable to all.
   - **Evaluation**: The phrase "It is an example of" does not inherently imply a generalization unless it is part of a larger context. As it stands alone, it does not assert a general rule based on a part.

**Step 2: Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - **Definition**: Claiming comprehensive listing but missing pertinent items.
   - **Evaluation**: The phrase alone does not attempt to list possibilities or claim completeness. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for <FE>.

**Step 3: Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - **Definition**: Reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
   - **Evaluation**: "It is an example of" does not provide a reason or insight into why something is as stated. Therefore, it cannot be evaluated as <IR> without more context.

**Step 4: Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - **Definition**: Weak causal basis for the proposition.
   - **Evaluation**: This phrase does not present a causal basis. It's incomplete for a causal analysis context. It can't be classified as <WCB>.

**Step 5: Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - **Definition**: Reason that repeats the proposition without adding new information.
   - **Evaluation**: The phrase "It is an example of" does not offer a repetitive assertion. No reiteration occurs, so itâ€™s not <RR>.

**Step 6: Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - **Definition**: Assuming universal agreement on something still in dispute.
   - **Evaluation**: The phrase does not indicate any presumptive consensus or suggest universal agreement. It is not <FU>.

**Step 7: Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
   - **Definition**: Statement that can be interpreted in another sense than intended.
   - **Evaluation**: "It is an example of" can be ambiguous with no specific context as it leaves the example undefined. However, there isn't sufficient context to discern a true <DEP> classification based solely on the phrase.

### Conclusion:
Based on the decomposition and evaluation of each defective argument type:

- The phrase "It is an example of" most likely fits into the category of **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)** due to its potential for various interpretations in different contexts. However, without further context, it remains essentially undeterminable among more intricate defective argument types.

Thus, from the IDAA analysis, "It is an example of" could reasonably be classified under <DEP> but is generally context-dependent for a definitive classification.
