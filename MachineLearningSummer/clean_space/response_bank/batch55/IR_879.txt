To apply the decomposition of the task of classifying the argument into specific steps (IDAA) to the provided string "Charlie: Fast food is filled with salt, fat, and added sugars. We need better regulation of the industry." and "Bob: That may be, but you’re such a hypocrite! I saw you devour a Triple-Baconator, super-sized fries, and 64 ounces of soda yesterday," we will follow a step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Identify the Argument Type
- Charlie's proposition (\<P>): "We need better regulation of the industry."
- Charlie's reason (\<R>): "Fast food is filled with salt, fat, and added sugars."
- Bob's response: "That may be, but you’re such a hypocrite! I saw you devour a Triple-Baconator, super-sized fries, and 64 ounces of soda yesterday."

### Step 2: Examine the Components of Charlie's Argument
- (\<P>): "We need better regulation of the industry."
- (\<R>): "Fast food is filled with salt, fat, and added sugars."

### Step 3: Analyze Bob's Response
Bob introduces a rebuttal, which includes a personal attack on Charlie rather than directly addressing the argument. This is recognized as a form of ad hominem fallacy. However, in the context of the defective argument classifications, we evaluate if it fits any of the provided types.

### Step 4: Classify Bob's Argument as One of the Defective Types
Assess which defective argument type applies to Bob's response:
- **Generalization (\<G>)**: Not applicable, as this involves asserting something erroneously across all cases.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE>)**: Not applicable, as this involves missing out on possibilities while claiming completeness.
- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>)**: Not directly applicable, since Bob isn't providing a reason to counter Charlie's argument about fast food regulation.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB>)**: Not applicable, as Bob hasn't presented a causal basis.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR>)**: Not applicable, as there is no repetition of Charlie's proposition in Bob's response.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU>)**: Not applicable, as there's no assumption of universal agreement in Bob's response.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP>)**: Not directly applicable, since the language isn't ambiguous here.

However, Bob's response is a form of **ad hominem**, which falls outside of the provided categories directly but closely aligns with the reasoning error of failing to address the argument due to personal attacks. 

### Step 5: Determine if a New Category is Needed
While none of the defective argument types (\<G>, \<FE>, \<IR>, \<WCB>, \<RR>, \<FU>, \<DEP>) fit perfectly, we recognize that Bob's response represents a fallacious argumentative strategy, known as an ad hominem attack.

### Conclusion
- Charlie's original argument seems structured correctly with a clear (\<P>) and (\<R>).
- Bob's rebuttal does not address the proposition or the reason directly but instead attacks Charlie's character, making it a fallacious argument, specifically an **ad hominem**.

In summary, while Bob's response can be identified as a fallacious argument (specifically an ad hominem attack), it does not neatly fit into one of the pre-defined defective argument types provided (\<G>, \<FE>, \<IR>, \<WCB>, \<RR>, \<FU>, \<DEP>). Recognizing new or additional fallacy types is important in comprehensive argument analysis.
