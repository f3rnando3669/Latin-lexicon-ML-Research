### Decomposition of Task (**<D>**):

1. **Step 1: Identify Components** - Break down the statement into its argument components: Proposition (**<P>**) and Reason (**<R>**).
2. **Step 2: Assess Argument Type** - Analyze the identified components to classify the type of defective argument based on the provided definitions: Generalization (**<G>**), Incomplete Enumeration (**<FE>**), Inconclusive Reason (**<IR>**), Insufficient Causal Basis (**<WCB>**), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (**<RR>**), Presumptuous Consensus (**<FU>**), or Ambiguous Language Use (**<DEP**).
3. **Step 3: Justify Classification** - Provide reasoning for the classification of the defective argument.

### Application of Decomposition to Task (**IDAA**):

**Step 1: Identify Components**

- **Proposition (<P>):** "All cats are evil."
- **Reason (<R>):** "My neighbor's cat attacked me."

**Step 2: Assess Argument Type**

**Type <G> (Generalization):** The Proposition (**<P>**) "All cats are evil" is an assertion that is based on a single experience (one instance of a cat attack). It generalizes this specific instance to apply to all cats.

**Step 3: Justify Classification**

- **Classification: <G> (Generalization)**

    The argument takes one instance (an attack by the neighbor's cat) and generalizes it to make a broad assertion about all cats. This is a textbook example of **Generalization**, where the argument fails because it extrapolates a universal conclusion from a single or limited set of observations.

**Conclusion**

The argument "My neighbor's cat attacked me, therefore all cats are evil." is classified as **<G> (Generalization)**.
