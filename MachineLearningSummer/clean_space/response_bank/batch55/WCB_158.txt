For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to the given string "I broke a mirror earlier in the day, and then I received an F on my history final. Therefore, I received the F because I broke the mirror.", we need to decompose the classification task (\( \text{IDA} \)) into specific steps (\( \text{D} \)). Hereâ€™s the step-by-step decomposition:

1. **Identify the parts of the argument**.
    - **Proposition (\( P \))**: The conclusion or what is being proved.
    - **Reason (\( R \))**: The causal basis for \( P \).
    - **Proof of Reason (\( PR \))**: Additional arguments supporting \( R \).

2. **Parse the given string to extract \( P \), \( R \), and \( PR \)**.
    - \( P \): "I received the F because I broke the mirror."
    - \( R \): The causal link implied is that breaking the mirror caused the bad grade.
    - \( PR \): There isn't any explicit additional evidence provided to support \( R \).

3. **Examine \( P \), \( R \), and \( PR \) for potential defects**:
    - Since \( PR \) is not explicitly provided, we focus on the potential defects in \( P \) and \( R \).

4. **Match the identified potential defects with the defective argument types**:
    - **\( G \) (Generalization)**: The argument does not generalize from any instances; it is a specific instance.
    - **\( FE \) (Incomplete Enumeration)**: There is no enumeration of possibilities involved.
    - **\( IR \) (Inconclusive Reason)**: The reason (breaking the mirror) lacks a clear logical connection to the conclusion (receiving the F).
    - **\( WCB \) (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The causal relationship proposed (between breaking the mirror and receiving the F) is not compelling or supported by evidence.
    - **\( RR \) (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: The reason and proposition are not repetitively the same.
    - **\( FU \) (Presumptuous Consensus)**: No claim of universal agreement is made.
    - **\( DEP \) (Ambiguous Language Use)**: There is no ambiguous language causing misinterpretation.

5. **Determine the most fitting defective argument type**:
    - **\( WCB \)**: This fits best because the reason submitted for the proposition is not compelling. The causal basis (breaking a mirror results in receiving an F) is weak and not substantiated by any rational or empirical evidence.

Therefore, the application of \( \text{IDAA} \) to the given string "I broke a mirror earlier in the day, and then I received an F on my history final. Therefore, I received the F because I broke the mirror." classifies it as a defective argument type **\( WCB \)** (Insufficient Causal Basis).
