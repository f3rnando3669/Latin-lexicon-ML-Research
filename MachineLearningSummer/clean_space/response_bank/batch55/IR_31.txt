For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the classification task, IDA) to the statement "Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist and perhaps the foremost expert in the field, says that evolution is true. Therefore, it's true," let's break it down into specific steps:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**
The statement essentially makes the claim: "Evolution is true."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)**
The reason provided is: "Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist and perhaps the foremost expert in the field, says that evolution is true."

**Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**
In this case, the Proof of Reason is implied rather than explicitly stated. It suggests that Dawkins' authority and expertise serve as proof for the truth of the proposition.

**Step 4: Evaluate the Reason (R) for possible defects**
By examining the reason, we need to classify whether it falls into any of the defective argument types defined (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP).

- **Generalization (G)**: Not applicable here, as the argument does not generalize from a small sample to a whole.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable, there is no enumeration of possibilities in the argument.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: We can consider whether Richard Dawkins’ authority alone is conclusive for the proposition: "Evolution is true."
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: We must check if the causal basis (Dawkins’ expertise) is compelling enough to assert the truth.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason does not merely restate the proposition; hence, this does not apply.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The reason does not cite a universal agreement but relies on an authoritative opinion.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language used does not seem ambiguous in this context.

Since the reason heavily relies on Dawkins' authority rather than direct evidence or a conclusive demonstration, it fits the category of "Inconclusive Reason (IR)."

**Step 5: Classify the Statement (s)**
Based on our evaluation, "Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist and perhaps the foremost expert in the field, says that evolution is true. Therefore, it's true" should be classified as an instance of <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).

Therefore, applying <IDAA> to the given statement, we classify it as:
**<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
