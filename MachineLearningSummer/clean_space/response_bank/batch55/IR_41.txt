For 
To apply IDAA to the given argument "“I admire the president for being a good role model.” REPLY: “But the New York Times says he’s a lousy role model, so you’re wrong.”", we will perform a task decomposition (D) to classify the argument into one of the defective argument types (IDA). Here are the steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P) and Reason (R):**
   - Proposition (P): "I admire the president for being a good role model."
   - Reason (R): "The New York Times says he’s a lousy role model."

2. **Classify the Type of Reason (R):**
   Check the reason for any defects by comparing it with the defective argument types.

3. **Examine Defective Argument Types:**

   - **Generalization (G):** Examine if the proposition is an assertion based on a part or the majority and not necessarily applicable to all but referred to all.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Check if the proposition suggests a complete enumeration but misses possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Determine if the reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Determine if the reason's causal basis for the proposition is not compelling.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Check if the reason says the same as the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Examine if the proof of the reason is assumed certain because it is "universally agreed upon."
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Determine if the proof of reason can be taken in another sense than intended.

4. **Analysis:** 
   
   Let's analyze:
   - The reason given ("The New York Times says he’s a lousy role model") does not explicitly establish a causal relationship. Instead, it merely presents an opposing authoritative opinion.
   - This can be considered **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the reason (opinion of a single news outlet) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness or incorrectness of the proposition that the president is a good role model. The New York Times’ statement does not directly refute the assessment of the president being a good role model, as personal admiration can be subjective and based on different criteria.

So, classifying the argument:
- The defective argument type is: **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**

Thus, the classified type of the given argument based on the decomposition of IDAA is **<IR>**.
