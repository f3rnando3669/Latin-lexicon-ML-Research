For 
To apply IDAA (decomposition of IDA into specific steps) to the classification task of identifying the defective argument type for the string "The economy grows as the number of likes on my Instagram account continue to increase. Clearly, the two are linked," we'll break down the task into specific steps and then execute them.

### Decomposition of IDA into Specific Steps (IDAA)

1. **Identify Proposition (<P>):**
   - **Task:** Extract the Proposition statement from the argument.
   - **For this string:** "The economy grows."

2. **Identify Reason (<R>):**
   - **Task:** Identify the Reason provided for the Proposition.
   - **For this string:** "The number of likes on my Instagram account continue to increase."

3. **Identify Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - **Task:** Identify any Proof of Reason that supports the Reason.
   - **For this string:** There is no explicit additional Proof of Reason beyond the Reason itself.

4. **Classify the Argument Type:**
   - **Task:** Determine if the argument is defective and, if so, classify it based on the pre-defined defective argument types.

### Step-by-Step Execution

#### Step 1: Identify Proposition (<P>)
- **Proposition:** "The economy grows."
  - This part of the statement sets forth what the speaker intends to prove.

#### Step 2: Identify Reason (<R>)
- **Reason:** "The number of likes on my Instagram account continue to increase."
  - This part provides the causal basis for the Proposition.

#### Step 3: Identify Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- **Proof of Reason:** Not explicitly provided.
  - There's no further argument presented that supports the Reason beyond the statement itself.

#### Step 4: Classify the Argument Type
- **Classifying the Defective Argument:**
  - **Generalization (<G>):** Not applicable here, as it doesn't involve an unwarranted generalization based on a part to a whole.
  - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Not applicable, as it doesn't involve a presumed complete list missing some possibilities.
  - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition. Correlation does not imply causation, so likes on Instagram do not conclusively cause economic growth.
  - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The Reason given (increase in Instagram likes) does not provide a strong or logical basis for the Proposition (economic growth).
  - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Not applicable here since the Reason and Proposition arenâ€™t the same statement.
  - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Not applicable as there is no mention of universal agreement.
  - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Not applicable since there is no ambiguity in the terms used.

- **Most fitting defective argument type:**
  - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The Reason provided does not sufficiently demonstrate or establish the correctness of the Proposition.

### Conclusion

The argument "The economy grows as the number of likes on my Instagram account continue to increase. Clearly, the two are linked." can be classified as **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**. The Reason given does not conclusively prove the Proposition, making the argument unsound.
