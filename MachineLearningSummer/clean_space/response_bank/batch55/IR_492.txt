Sure, let's apply the steps of the decomposition task \(<D>\) to classify the given argument according to the \(<IDA>\) task.

Argument provided: "Bernie Sanders wouldn't make a good president because he looks like a sad muppet."

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The first step is to identify the Proposition \(<P>\), which is the claim or assertion that is set forth.

**Proposition (<P>):** "Bernie Sanders wouldn't make a good president."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The second step is to identify the Reason \(<R>\), which sets forth the causal basis for <P>.

**Reason (<R>):** "because he looks like a sad muppet."

### Step 3: Determine the Type of Defective Argument
Now we need to classify the defective argument type based on the given definitions.

1. **Generalization (G):** Not applicable, as the argument is not generalizing from a part to the whole.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable, as the argument does not involve a defective enumeration of possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Potentially applicable, as the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Potentially applicable, as the reason "looks like a sad muppet" is not a compelling causal basis for the proposition "wouldn't make a good president."
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Not applicable, as the reason is not just a repetition of the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Not applicable, as there is no ground assumed as universally agreed upon.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Not directly applicable, as "looks like a sad muppet" is clear in its intended sense, albeit irrelevant.

### Step 4: Classification of Argument
Given that the reason \(<R>\) "because he looks like a sad muppet" does not provide a valid causal basis for the proposition \(<P>\) "Bernie Sanders wouldn't make a good president," we classify the argument as:

**Defective Argument Type:** **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

### Final Classification
Thus, we have classified the argument string "Bernie Sanders wouldn't make a good president because he looks like a sad muppet" as an example of a defective argument type **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

By decomposing the task \(<IDA>\) into specific steps (\(D\)), we've applied it systematically to arrive at the defective argument classification.
