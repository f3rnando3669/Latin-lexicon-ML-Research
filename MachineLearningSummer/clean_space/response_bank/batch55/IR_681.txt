For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU> or <DEP>), we'll approach it step by step. Here’s a breakdown of the process on the given statement: "What’s the point of making drinking illegal under the age of 21? Kids still manage to get alcohol."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

#### Step 1: Analyze the Proposition <P>
Identify the core assertion or proposition of the argument.
- Proposition in this case: "What’s the point of making drinking illegal under the age of 21?"

#### Step 2: Analyze the Reason <R>
Identify the causal basis or reasoning that supports the proposition.
- Reason provided: "Kids still manage to get alcohol."

#### Step 3: Identify Potential Defects in the Argument
We will now match the elements above with possible defects.

#### <G> Generalization
- Does the proposition generalize from a specific instance or a majority to all instances? 
- Not quite. The argument doesn't generalize; it specifically targets the efficacy of the law given the stated reasoning.

#### <FE> Incomplete Enumeration
- Are there other pertinent possibilities or aspects that are not considered in the argument?
- This doesn't seem applicable. The issue here is not about an incomplete list of factors, but rather the efficacy of one specific law.

#### <IR> Inconclusive Reason
- Does the Reason conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition?
- This seems possible. The fact that "Kids still manage to get alcohol" does not conclusively prove that drinking laws for those under 21 are pointless. There could be other reasons for such laws beyond preventing all minors from obtaining alcohol.

#### <RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition
- Does the Reason repeat the Proposition in different words?
- No. The Reason here is distinct from the Proposition.

#### <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis
- Is the causal basis provided weak or not compelling?
- Yes, this could also apply. The Reason ("Kids still manage to get alcohol") is an insufficient causal basis for the Proposition ("What’s the point of making drinking illegal under the age of 21?"). It shows some instances of the law being evaded, but it doesn’t address the overall efficacy or rationale behind the law.

#### <FU> Presumptuous Consensus
- Is a Proof of Reason assumed as certain based on supposed universal agreement on a disputed matter?
- No, there's no presumption of universal agreement mentioned.

#### <DEP> Ambiguous Language Use
- Can the language in the Proof of Reason be taken in another sense than intended?
- No, the language here is relatively clear and doesn't seem to have ambiguities.

### Conclusion

Given our step-by-step analysis, the statement "What’s the point of making drinking illegal under the age of 21? Kids still manage to get alcohol." could primarily be classified under two defective argument types:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided ("Kids still manage to get alcohol") does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition ("What’s the point of making drinking illegal under the age of 21?").
   
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reason provided is weak as a causal basis for dismissing the law entirely.

To encapsulate, the given string most closely aligns with defective argument types **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** and **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
