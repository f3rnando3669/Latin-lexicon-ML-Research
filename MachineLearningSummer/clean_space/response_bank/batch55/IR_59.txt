For 
Let's apply the decomposition approach, <D>, to the classification task, <IDA>, for the string "What drugs were you on?"

Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>):
1. **Understand the Context**: Identify the context in which the string "What drugs were you on?" is used. Is it part of an argument or discourse?
2. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine if there is a proposition being stated. This could be explicit or implicit.
3. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine if there is a reason given to support the proposition. Again, this could be explicit or implicit.
4. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Determine if there is proof provided to support the reason. This could be explicit or implicit.
5. **Classify the Defective Argument**: Based on the identified proposition, reason, and proof of reason, classify the string as one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step 1: Understand the Context
The string "What drugs were you on?" appears to be a question. It is important to consider if it has an underlying argumentative context.

### Step 2: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition in this case seems to be implied rather than explicitly stated. It might be suggesting something like "You were on drugs."

### Step 3: Identify the Reason (<R>)
There is no explicit reason given to support the proposition. The question itself does not provide a causal basis for the implied proposition.

### Step 4: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
There is no explicit proof or additional argument provided to support any reason.

### Step 5: Classify the Defective Argument
Based on the analysis:
- There is no explicit proposition, reason, or proof, so we need to infer the defective argument type based on the nature of the question itself.
- The question "What drugs were you on?" presupposes that the person was on drugs and might be suggesting this without any evidence or reasoning, relying on an implicit assumption.

Given these points, it is reasonable to classify this as:

#### <DEP> Ambiguous Language Use
The question can be interpreted differently depending on the context. It could imply multiple things, for example:
- Inquiry into past drug use (literal interpretation)
- An accusation or presumption without evidence (implied accusation)

The ambiguity and leading nature of the question can mislead or bias the response. The statement relies on presumptions and does not provide a clear, unambiguous basis for the implied argument.

### Conclusion
By applying the decomposition <D> to the task <IDA>, we classified the string "What drugs were you on?" as a type <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use) defective argument due to its potential to be interpreted differently and its reliance on presumptuous implications without clear reasoning or proof.
