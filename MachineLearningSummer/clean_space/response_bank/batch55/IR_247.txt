For 
To apply **IDAA** to the given argument string, we will decompose the task of classification into specific steps and then proceed step by step to classify the argument. Here is the provided string once again:

"Lily says the sun is fully risen at 5:00am, but how would she know she sleeps in until noon.

(love you lily all jokes all jokes)"

Steps for **D** (Decomposition):

1. **Identify the Proposition <P>:** Determine what is being asserted or stated as the main claim.
2. **Identify the Reason <R>:** Determine the causal basis or rationale provided for the Proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Argument:** Assess the argument to check for any of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>.

Now, let's apply these steps to classify the given string.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>

**Proposition <P>:** 
"Lily says the sun is fully risen at 5:00am."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>

**Reason <R>:** 
"How would she know she sleeps in until noon."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Argument for Defective Types

- **Generalization (<G>):** This argument is not a generalization based on a part or majority applied to the whole. So, it is not of type <G>.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** There is no enumeration of possibilities or claims of completeness. Hence, it is not of type <FE>.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason given does provide some skepticism about Lily's statement, but it does not directly attack the validity of the proposition itself based on conclusive evidence or counter-arguments.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal basis provided ("she sleeps in until noon") may be seen as weak because it doesn't definitively rule out the possibility that Lily might have other sources of knowledge about when the sun rises. 

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason provided is not a mere repetition of the proposition. The reason questions the means of knowing, not the statement itself. So, it is not of type <RR>.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** There is no implied or assumed consensus in the argument.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** There is no ambiguous language that suggests multiple interpretations.

### Conclusion

Based on the evaluation, the argument primarily falls under **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**. The reason given to cast doubt on Lilyâ€™s claim ("she sleeps in until noon") is not compelling enough to invalidate the original assertion definitively.

So, our final classification for the given string is <WCB>.
