For 
To classify the defective argument type of the given string "If we allow gay people to get married, then the next thing you know people will be wanting to marry their pets!" using the method of decomposition, we follow these steps:

### Decompose the Task (<D>)
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) in the string:**
   - Determine what the argument is trying to assert or prove.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>) in the string:**
   - Determine what causal basis or reasoning is being used to support the proposition.

3. **Classify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>) among the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>), if applicable:**
   - Compare the structural and logical aspects of <P> and <R> to the definitions of each defective argument type.

### Step-by-Step Application (<IDAA>)

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) in the string:**
   - The proposition is: "If we allow gay people to get married, then people will want to marry their pets."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>) in the string:**
   - The reason given is: "People will want to marry their pets."

3. **Classify the Proposition and Reason among the defective argument types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** The claim is making a broad assertion about future behavior based on a specific change in policy. However, it is not simply an assertion based on some one part or on a majority of individuals, so this type does not quite fit.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument does not claim to have enumerated all possibilities, so this type does not apply here.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The statement "people will want to marry their pets" does not logically or conclusively follow from "allow gay people to get married." There's no clear causal link established by because it jumps to an unrelated conclusion.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The given reason lacks a compelling causal basis, as it fails to justifiably relate the act of allowing gay marriage to the act of marrying pets.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason is not a simple repetition of the proposition, so this does not apply.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The argument does not rely on assumed consensus or universal agreement.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The language used isn't ambiguous; it is a clear (though logically flawed) prediction.

Based on this evaluation, the argument primarily fits the type of **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**. It fails to demonstrate a logical and conclusive connection between allowing gay marriage and people wanting to marry their pets. Additionally, the causal basis implied by the reasoning is extremely weak and not compelling.

Thus, the defective argument types for this string are **<IR>** and **<WCB>**.
