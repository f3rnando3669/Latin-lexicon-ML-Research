To apply the application of decomposition to the task of classifying the defective argument type (IDAA), let's decompose the process step by step:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D):
1. **Identify the Proposition (P):** Extract the main statement or question that is being asserted or inquired about.
2. **Identify the Reason (R):** Look for the causal basis or the reasoning given for the Proposition.
3. **Examine the Proof of Reason (PR):** Check if there are any additional arguments that support the Reason.
4. **Check for Defective Argument Type:** Analyze for any specific signs of the defective argument types defined: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), and Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

### Applying IDAA to "Did John ever give up his bad habits?":

#### Analysis:
1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Proposition (P): "John ever gave up his bad habits."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - In this case, there isn't an explicit reason provided in the statement. The question is open-ended and does not present any reasoning.

3. **Examine the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - Since there's no reason (R) given, there can be no proof (PR) of it either.

4. **Check for Defective Argument Type:**
   - **Generalization (G):** The statement isn't generalizing anything.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The statement does not involve an enumeration of possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** No reasoning is provided to be inconclusive.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** No causal basis is provided.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** No reasoning is provided to be repeated.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** No assumed consensus is presented.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The term "bad habits" can be considered vague, but the statement does not provide additional meanings that can be taken in another sense than intended.

Since the statement "Did John ever give up his bad habits?" contains no explicit reason (R) or proof (PR), it is not an argument per se. Therefore, it doesn't neatly fit into any of the typical defective argument categories (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP). However, because the term "bad habits" is open to interpretation and can mean different things to different people, it may hint toward DEP (Ambiguous Language Use).

Thus, if we were to force a classification, **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use)** would be the closest match due to the potential ambiguity of "bad habits." However, strictly speaking, it is more of an open-ended question than an argument.
