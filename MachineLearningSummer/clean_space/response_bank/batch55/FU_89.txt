For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) (the application of the decomposition of a task into specific steps) to the task of classifying the argument "You appealed to popularity or the fact that many people do something as an attempted form of validation," we will follow a methodical approach to analyze and decompose the task in logical steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify and Understand the Argument:**
   - **Proposition (\( \text{P} \))**: The statement or the assertion being made. In this case, the proposition is that the appeal to popularity is being used as validation.
   - **Reason (\( \text{R} \))**: The causal basis for \( \text{P} \). Here, the reason seems to be that because many people do it, it is considered valid.
   - **Proof of Reason (\( \text{PR} \))**: Additional arguments corroborating \( \text{R} \). Not explicitly provided in the statement.

2. **Determine the Framework of Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (\( \text{G} \))**: Applying a statement about some individuals to everyone.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (\( \text{FE} \))**: Claiming a complete list of possibilities when the list is incomplete.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (\( \text{IR} \))**: The reason provided does not sufficiently support the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( \text{WCB} \))**: The causal basis for the proposition is weak.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( \text{RR} \))**: The reason merely repeats the proposition without adding new support.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (\( \text{FU} \))**: Assuming something is true because it is universally agreed upon, even though it is in dispute.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (\( \text{DEP} \))**: The language in the proof of reason is ambiguous or can be taken in another sense.

3. **Analyze the Argument with Respect to Defective Types:**
   - Examine if the statement fits any of the defective argument descriptions provided.

### Analysis of the Argument:

- **Argument Statement**: "You appealed to popularity or the fact that many people do something as an attempted form of validation."
- **Proposition (\( \text{P} \))**: The appeal to popularity as validation.
- **Reason (\( \text{R} \))**: Many people do it, therefore it is valid.
- **Proof of Reason (\( \text{PR} \))**: Not explicitly provided, but inferred that popularity/confidence in numbers is used as support.

Upon analyzing the argument, it seems to rely on the idea that because many people accept or practice something, it is validated or considered true. This fits the classification of \( \text{Presumptuous Consensus (FU)} \) which involves assuming something is true on the grounds that it is universally agreed upon, which is a common fallacy in argumentation.

### Conclusion:
The argument "You appealed to popularity or the fact that many people do something as an attempted form of validation" is of type \( \text{Presumptuous Consensus (FU)} \).

Therefore, the correct classification for the argument based on our defective argument types is \( \text{FU} \).
