For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a given string as a specific type of defective argument) to the provided statement "Saying that you support a specific candidate for class president, only because he has recently been diagnosed with cancer is an example of which fallacy?", we will break down the steps as defined in the task decomposition.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D)

1. **Identify the Core Proposition (P) in the String (s)**:
    - Proposition (P): "You support a specific candidate for class president."
  
2. **Identify the Reason (R) Given for the Proposition (P)**:
    - Reason (R): "Only because he has recently been diagnosed with cancer."
  
3. **Evaluate the Quality of the Reason (R) in Relation to the Proposition (P)**:
    - Examine if the reason (cancer diagnosis) has a direct causal relationship to the proposition (worthiness to be class president).
  
4. **Classify the Defective Argument Based on Observations**:
    - Match the observed issue with one of the predefined defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Core Proposition (P)**:
    - The core proposition (P) is that one supports a specific candidate for class president. 

2. **Identify the Reason (R) Given for the Proposition (P)**:
    - The reason (R) provided is the candidate's recent diagnosis with cancer. 

3. **Evaluate the Quality of the Reason (R) in Relation to the Proposition (P)**:
    - The reason provided (candidate's cancer diagnosis) does not logically support the proposition (candidate's qualification or capability to be class president).
    - The diagnosis of cancer does not provide a valid causal basis for why someone should be elected class president, as it does not relate to the candidate’s skills, plans, or capabilities for the position.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Based on Observations**:
    - The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness or validity of the proposition. Instead, it invokes a reason that is not relevant to the candidate's ability to be class president. 

### Conclusion:
The provided statement appears to best fit the defective argument type <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), where the provided reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. The reason given (candidate’s cancer diagnosis) does not offer a valid link to the candidate’s qualifications or ability to perform as class president.

### Final Classification:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The provided statement is an example of the Inconclusive Reason fallacy.
