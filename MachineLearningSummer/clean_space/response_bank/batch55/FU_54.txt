For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposing IDA into specific steps) to classify the string ", that it must be true" as one of the defective argument types, we need to follow a systematic approach. Below are the steps for breaking down and solving this task:

### Step 1: Interpretation of the String
First, we analyze the string ", that it must be true," to understand its context and meaning. This string appears to be part of a larger argument and likely serves as a conclusion or a supporting statement.

### Step 2: Identify the Defective Argument Types
Recall the definitions of each defective argument type:

1. **Generalization (G):** Proposition based on a part/majority, not applicable to all.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Claiming complete enumeration but missing possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Reason that does not conclusively support Proposition.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Weak causal basis for Proposition.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Reason that repeats the Proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Proposition assumed certain due to presumed universal agreement.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Use of language that can be misunderstood.

### Step 3: Compare String Against Defective Argument Types
Now, we compare the string, ", that it must be true," against these defective argument types to identify which type it aligns with:

#### Generalization (G)
- The string does not suggest a generalization based on a part or majority being applied to all.

#### Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
- The string does not indicate a failure in listing possibilities.

#### Inconclusive Reason (IR)
- The string seems more like a conclusion assertion but does not by itself show an inconclusive reason.

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
- The string could be part of a statement that repeats the earlier proposition. For example, "The sky is blue, that it must be true."

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
- The phrase lacks any causal basis for the Proposition.

#### Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
- The string can indeed imply that something is true because it is supposedly universally accepted without proof, but without more context, this cannot be definitively determined.

#### Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)
- The language in the string is not particularly ambiguous.

### Step 4: Conclusion
Given the analysis above, the defective argument type that fits ", that it must be true," most closely is:
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** â€” Because the phrase ", that it must be true" appears as a reiteration of what has likely already been stated.

However, without additional context, "**Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**" could also potentially apply. Since the string can imply accepting something as true based on a presumed universal acknowledgment, this needs contextual confirmation.

### Final Decision
Thus, based on available information:
- The classification of the string ", that it must be true," is most appropriately **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**.

If indeed the statement is meant to imply accepted truth without evidence, it can also be flagged as **FU (Presumptuous Consensus)**. But the primary reasoning directs more solidly towards **RR**.
