For 
To apply IDAA to the task of classifying the string "That song is stupid because I don't know that musician," we will follow a step-by-step decomposition of the classification task (IDA) to determine which type of defective argument it represents.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P) and Reason (R) in the Argument
Firstly, we need to identify the Proposition (P) and the Reason (R) in the given argument.

- **Proposition (P):** "That song is stupid."
- **Reason (R):** "because I don't know that musician."

### Step 2: Analyze the Reason (R) for the Defective Argument Type
Next, we need to analyze the Reason and determine why it is defective by examining the nature of the argument using the defective argument types defined.

1. **Generalization (G):** This is not a generalization because it does not extend the assertion about a part to the whole.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This does not pertain to incomplete enumeration because there's no claim of having listed all possible reasons.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** While the reason might be unconvincing, it needs finer analysis if it is merely inconclusive.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reasoning presented seems to fit under this category because knowing or not knowing the musician doesn't provide a strong causal basis for judging the song as "stupid."
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The Reason does not merely repeat the Proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The Reason doesn't rely on assumed consensus.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** There is no ambiguous language evident in the use of "I don't know that musician."

### Step 3: Determine the Strongest Match for the Defective Argument Type
After reviewing the types of defective arguments, **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** fits best because the Reason given does not provide a compelling causal link to the Proposition.

### Conclusion
The classification of the argument "That song is stupid because I don't know that musician" is of type **<WCB>** (Insufficient Causal Basis).

Thus, the steps of IDAA applied to the given string have highlighted that the argument is defective due to an insufficient causal basis.
