For 
To apply \( <IDAA> \) to the statement "President Obama’s decision to arm Syrian rebels, however meagerly, has all but doomed us to an Iraq-style debacle," we will decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( <P> \)):**
   - The proposition here is the assertion or main claim of the argument.
   - Proposition: "President Obama’s decision to arm Syrian rebels, however meagerly, has all but doomed us to an Iraq-style debacle."

2. **Identify the Reason (\( <R> \)):**
   - The reason is the causal basis provided for the proposition.
   - Reason: "The decision to arm Syrian rebels."

3. **Evaluate the argument for potential Defective Argument Types:**

    - **Generalization (\( <G> \)):**
      - Does the proposition make a general assertion based on insufficient evidence about all instances?
      - No, the proposition is specific to Obama’s decision and does not broadly generalize about similar situations.

    - **Incomplete Enumeration (\( <FE> \)):**
      - Does the argument claim to have considered all possibilities but misses some?
      - This doesn't seem to be the case; there is no claim of complete enumeration of all possible outcomes or decisions.

    - **Inconclusive Reason (\( <IR> \)):**
      - Does \( <R> \) provide inconclusive evidence in support of \( <P> \)?
      - Arguably, the reason “arming Syrian rebels” does not conclusively support the assertion that it will lead to an Iraq-style debacle without further evidence or context.

    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( <WCB> \)):**
      - Is the reason weak and not compelling enough to substantiate the proposition?
      - Yes, the causal basis that merely arming rebels will lead to a specific type of failure (an Iraq-style debacle) is not sufficiently compelling without additional evidence or argumentation.

    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( <RR> \)):**
      - Does the reason merely restate the proposition without adding new information?
      - No, the reason is not a mere repetition of the proposition; it provides an action (arming rebels) as the basis.

    - **Presumptuous Consensus (\( <FU> \)):**
      - Is the proof of reason assumed as certain based on universal agreement without proper support?
      - There is no explicit appeal to universal agreement in the argument.

    - **Ambiguous Language Use (\( <DEP> \)):**
      - Could the proof of reason be understood in another sense than intended by the speaker?
      - The language used in the argument does not appear ambiguous or open to multiple interpretations pertinent to the claim.

### Classification:

Based on the analysis above, the argument appears to fit primarily within two defective types:

- **Inconclusive Reason (\( <IR> \))**: The reason given does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition that "arming Syrian rebels will lead to an Iraq-style debacle."
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( <WCB> \))**: The causal basis, i.e., arming rebels, is a weak support for the claim that it dooms us to a specific type of disaster without additional rationale or evidence.

### Conclusion:
The statement "President Obama’s decision to arm Syrian rebels, however meagerly, has all but doomed us to an Iraq-style debacle" can be classified as containing elements of both \( <IR> \) (Inconclusive Reason) and \( <WCB> \) (Insufficient Causal Basis).
