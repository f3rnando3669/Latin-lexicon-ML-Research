For 
To perform the task \( <IDAA> \) on the given argument, we need to apply \( <D> \), which is the decomposition of \( <IDA> \) into specific steps. Hereâ€™s a detailed step-by-step approach to classify the given argument string as one of the defective argument types:

1. **Identify the Argument Parts:**
   - Proposition (\(<P>\)): "The Cardinals are the best football team."
   - Reason (\(<R>\)): "They're better than all the other teams."
   - Proof of Reason (\(<PR>\)): "They're better than all the other teams because they're the best."

2. **Match Argument Parts to Definitions:**
   - Check if \( <P> \) is a Generalization (\(<G>\)): The proposition does not generalize from a part to a whole.
   - Check if \( <P> \) involves Incomplete Enumeration (\(<FE>\)): The proposition does not claim completeness improperly.
   - Check if \( <R> \) is an Inconclusive Reason (\(<IR>\)): The reason given is supposed to substantiate the \( <P> \), but its conclusive strength needs examination.
   - Check if \( <R> \) involves Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(<RR>\)): Determine if the reason just restates the proposition.
   - Check if \( <R> \) is due to Insufficient Causal Basis (\(<WCB>\)): The causal basis's strength needs evaluation.
   - Check if \( <PR> \) involves Presumptuous Consensus (\(<FU>\)): Look for assumptions made based on universal agreement.
   - Check if \( <PR> \) involves Ambiguous Language Use (\(<DEP>\)): Ensure the proof does not rely on ambiguous terms.

3. **Analyze the Reason (\(<R>\)):**
   - The Reason (\(<R>\)) is: "They're better than all the other teams."
   - This appears to be a restatement or repetition of the Proposition (\(<P>\)): "The Cardinals are the best football team."

4. **Analyze Proof of Reason (\(<PR>\)):**
   - The Proof (\(<PR>\)) is: "They're better than all the other teams because they're the best."
   - This statement is essentially repeating the Proposition (\(<P>\)) rather than providing independent corroborative evidence.

5. **Classify the Defective Argument:**
   - Given that the Reason (\(<R>\)) and Proof of Reason (\(<PR>\)) essentially repeat the Proposition (\(<P>\)) without providing independent evidence, the argument falls into the category of Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(<RR>\)).

So the classification according to \( <IDA> \) for the argument "The Cardinals are the best football team because they're better than all the other teams. They're better than all the other teams because they're the best." is:

\[ \boxed{<RR>} \]
