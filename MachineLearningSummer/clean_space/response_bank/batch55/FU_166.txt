To apply the task of IDAA (decomposition of the advanced task IDA into specific steps) to the given string and classify it as one of the defective argument types, we will systematically break down the process into clear steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition in the given string is:
- "This many friends are eating this way that this must be the healthy way to eat."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason provided for the proposition is:
- "Many of her friends have started eating a low-carb diet and drinking protein shakes."

### Step 3: Corroboration of Reason (<PR>)
- There is no additional corroboration of the reason provided. The decision is based solely on the observed behavior of her friends.

### Step 4: Determine if the Argument Fits Any Defective Argument Types
Now, we will evaluate the argument against the defective argument types:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: The proposition is based on the observation of Marie's friends' behavior and is applied universally as the healthy way to eat. This fits because the proposition is an assertion extended to an entire category (healthy eating) based on a limited observation (her friends).
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not applicable, as there is no claim of a complete enumeration of possibilities.
  
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This could be somewhat applicable, as the reason does not conclusively demonstrate that low-carb dieting and drinking protein shakes is the healthy way to eat for everyone.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The rationale provided (many friends eating this way) is a weak causal basis to establish the general healthiness of the diet.
  
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Not applicable, as the reason is not a repeated proposition.
  
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument implies a sort of consensus among Marie's friends but doesn't universally claim it, so this is not directly applicable.
  
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: There is no ambiguous language use evident in the given argument.

### Step 5: Classify the Argument
Based on the analysis:
- The argument is best classified as a **Generalization (<G>)** mainly because it is deriving a general rule for healthy eating based on the behavior of a limited group (her friends).

### Conclusion
The given string exemplifies the defective argument type of **Generalization (<G>)**.
