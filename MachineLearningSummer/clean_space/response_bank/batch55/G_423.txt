For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given scenario, we need to break down <IDA> (classifying the string as one of the defective argument types) into specific steps. Here are the steps we can follow:

1. **Parse the Argument**: Identify the Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), and Proof of Reason (<PR>) within the given string.
2. **Identify Potential Defects**: Compare these parts to the definitions of the various defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).
3. **Classify the Defect**: Determine which defective argument type best matches the argument.

### Step-by-step breakdown:

**Step 1: Parse the Argument**

- **Proposition (<P>)**: Sara claims that "all high schools should wear school uniforms".
- **Reason (<R>)**: The evidence used to support this claim is that "a local elementary school survey indicated that 72% of its 1st graders wanted uniforms".
- **Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: This is implied by the survey data indicating the preference of the 1st graders for uniforms.

**Step 2: Identify Potential Defects**

- **Generalization (<G>)**: An assertion based on some part or a majority of individuals but not necessarily applicable to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Claim of complete enumeration of possibilities, but missing out on some.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: A weak causal basis for the proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: When the reason simply repeats the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Assuming proof of reason as certain based on presumed universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Use of language that can be taken in a different sense than intended.

**Step 3: Classify the Defect**

Let's analyze Sara's reasoning in detail:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: The evidence — a survey of 1st graders’ preferences — is being used to make an assertion about all high school students. 
   - The survey covers a specific subset (1st graders in a local elementary school) and uses this to make a general claim about a completely different group (all high school students). This inference lacks sufficient validity because preferences of 1st graders might not reflect the preferences of high school students.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not relevant here since the issue isn't about missing out on possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The survey of 1st graders doesn't provide a conclusive reason to assert the claim for all high school students.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Related to <IR>, but specifically the causal link between 1st graders' opinion and high school students' situation is weak.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Not applicable as <P> and <R> are different in content.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: No universal agreement is presumed here.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: No ambiguity in language noted.

The most fitting classification here is **<G> Generalization**, since the argument generalizes the preferences of a specific subset of 1st graders to all high school students without sufficient basis.

### Conclusion
Sara used the fallacy of **Generalization (<G>)** in her argument. The evidence she provided does not sufficiently justify the broader claim she is making about all high school students.

Thus, the appropriate defective argument type applied to Sara's reasoning is <G> Generalization.
