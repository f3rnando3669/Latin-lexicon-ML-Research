For 
To apply the IDAA (the decomposition of IDA into specific steps) to classify the string "If you don't start recycling now, our entire planet will be destroyed in ten years," let's break down the task step by step.

### Step 1: Understand and Analyze the Proposition
**Proposition (P):** "Our entire planet will be destroyed in ten years."

### Step 2: Understand and Analyze the Reason
**Reason (R):** "If you don't start recycling now."

### Step 3: Check for Defective Argument Types
Now, we need to determine which, if any, of the defective argument types apply to this argument. Let's examine each.

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - **Definition:** An assertion based on some one part or on a majority of individuals, but not necessarily applicable to all, is referred to all.
   - **Assessment:** The statement doesn’t generalize from a part to the whole; it makes a direct assertion.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - **Definition:** Claiming a complete enumeration of possibilities but missing some pertinent ones.
   - **Assessment:** The statement does not attempt to enumerate possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - **Definition:** The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.
   - **Assessment:** The reason ("If you don't start recycling now") does not conclusively demonstrate that "our entire planet will be destroyed in ten years." While recycling is important, it is unlikely that it alone would prevent planetary destruction, indicating the reasoning is not conclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - **Definition:** The causal basis for the Proposition is not compelling.
   - **Assessment:** The reason provided (need for recycling) is not compelling enough to establish that the entire planet's fate rests solely on this factor, which seems exaggerated. The statement lacks a more robust causal basis.
   
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - **Definition:** The reason is essentially the same as the Proposition.
   - **Assessment:** The reason ("If you don't start recycling") is not a repetition of the Proposition, but rather a conditional statement.
   
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - **Definition:** Assuming a proof of reason is certain because "it is universally agreed upon."
   - **Assessment:** The argument does not assume consensus as its proof; it doesn’t use the phrase “it is universally agreed upon.”
   
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - **Definition:** The proof of reason can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended.
   - **Assessment:** The language "our entire planet will be destroyed" is quite clear and does not have much room for different interpretations.

### Step 4: Final Classification of Defective Argument
Based on the assessment, the defective argument here is best classified as a combination of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. However, as  **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** directly addresses the weakness of the causal link in the statement:

**Classification:** **WCB** (Insufficient Causal Basis)

### Conclusion
By applying IDAA, we have classified the string "If you don't start recycling now, our entire planet will be destroyed in ten years" as exhibiting an Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).
