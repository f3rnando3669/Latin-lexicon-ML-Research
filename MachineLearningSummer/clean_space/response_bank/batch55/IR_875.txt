For 
To apply IDAA to the statement "The Tooth Fairy is real because nobody has proven she doesn't exist," we will go through a process of breaking down the advanced task (IDA) into specific steps and then applying these steps to classify the statement.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDA into Specific Steps (D)

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - What is the main proposition being asserted?
   
2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - What is the causal basis or reason given for the proposition?
   
3. **Evaluate the Reason (R):**
   - Determine if the reason is conclusively demonstrating the correctness of the proposition.
   - Check for any weaknesses or fallacies in the reason.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:**
   - Compare the identified reason (R) to the known defective argument types to classify it.

### Apply Decomposition to Classify the Statement

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
- Proposition (P): "The Tooth Fairy is real."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
- Reason (R): "Nobody has proven she doesn't exist."

#### Step 3: Evaluate the Reason (R)
- The reason given does not provide evidence for the existence of the Tooth Fairy, rather it shifts the burden of proof to negate the existence of the Tooth Fairy. 

#### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type
- The reason (R) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (P) since the absence of disproof is not evidence of existence. This aligns with the argument type where the reason (R) is inconclusive or not sufficiently compelling, indicating a logically flawed reasoning process.

### Conclusion
The statement "The Tooth Fairy is real because nobody has proven she doesn't exist" is an example of a fallacy. Specifically, it fits into the category of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** since the reason provided does not conclusively establish the truth of the proposition.
