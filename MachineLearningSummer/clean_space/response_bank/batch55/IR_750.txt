To apply IDAA to the task of classifying the given string "We believe on what we believe in." as one of the defective argument types, we need to decompose the task into specific steps and then execute them. Here are the steps for addressing the classification:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) for IDA:
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine the main assertion or claim being made in the string.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine the causal basis or reasoning provided, if any, for the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Look for any corroborating evidence or additional arguments that support the reason.

4. **Analyze and Compare with Defective Argument Types:**
   - Compare the structure of the argument against the defined defects (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Apply IDAA to the Given String:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The string "We believe on what we believe in" can be broken down to:
- Proposition (<P>): "We believe on what we believe in."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- Reason (<R>): In this case, the string does not provide a clear reason beyond the proposition itself. The reason appears to be a repetition of the proposition.

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- Proof of Reason (<PR>): There is no additional corroborating evidence or argument supporting the reason. The statement is simply repetitive.

#### Step 4: Analyze and Compare with Defective Argument Types

- **Generalization (<G>):** The statement does not seem to generalize from some parts or individuals to all; it is more of a tautology.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The statement does not try to enumerate possibilities or miss out on any.
  
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Though the reason is not identified distinctly, the statement does not attempt to give an inconclusive reason. It's rather a repetitive assertion.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal basis is absent here rather than weak, so this might not be the most fitting category.
  
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason provided is essentially the same as the proposition. "We believe on what we believe in" is repetitive and does not present any new information or justification for the belief.
  
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** There is no claim that something is universally agreed upon in the statement.
  
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The language in the statement is not ambiguous; it's just repetitive.

Based on the steps and analysis, the most fitting classification for the string "We believe on what we believe in." is:
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**

This statement can be classified under <RR> as it shows a repetition of the proposition without providing any new reason or justification.
