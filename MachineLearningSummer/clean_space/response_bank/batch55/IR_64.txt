To apply the process IDAA to the string "My wife wants to talk about cleaning out the garage, so I asked her what she wants to do with our patio furniture. Now she’s shopping for new patio furniture and not asking me about the garage," we will follow the steps needed for decomposing IDA and then carry out its specific task step by step.

### Decomposition of Task (D):
1. **Step 1:** Identify the Proposition (<P>).
2. **Step 2:** Identify the Reason (<R>).
3. **Step 3:** Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>), if present.
4. **Step 4:** Determine if there is a defective argument type present by matching it against the definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Application of Decomposition (IDAA):

**Step 1:** Identify the Proposition (<P>)

In this string, the Proposition can be inferred as:
"Now she’s shopping for new patio furniture and not asking me about the garage."

**Step 2:** Identify the Reason (<R>)

The Reason provided is less direct but can be inferred as:
"I asked her what she wants to do with our patio furniture."

**Step 3:** Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>), if present

This string does not provide explicit additional arguments to corroborate the Reason, so there is no clear Proof of Reason present.

**Step 4:** Determine if there is a defective argument type present

Now, we need to match this with the defective argument types:

- **<G> Generalization:** The argument does not generalize based on some individual or majority but applies to a specific situation.
  
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:** The argument does not claim to have enumerated possibilities.
  
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** The Reason does not effectively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition. The query about patio furniture does not logically lead to the conclusion about avoiding the garage topic.
  
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** Similar to <IR>, the causal link between asking about patio furniture and shifting focus to new patio furniture does not provide a strong basis: it's a weak causal link.
  
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** The Reason does not repeat the Proposition.
  
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** The argument does not rely on a universally agreed upon fact.
  
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:** The language is not particularly ambiguous in this context.

Given the reasoning steps above, it is clear that this string meets the criteria of **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** because the Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition and can be seen as **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)** due to the weak connection between the action leading to the conclusion.

### Result

The string "My wife wants to talk about cleaning out the garage, so I asked her what she wants to do with our patio furniture. Now she’s shopping for new patio furniture and not asking me about the garage." fits the defective argument types **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** and **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
