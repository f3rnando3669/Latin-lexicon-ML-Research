For 
To tackle the given task of IDAA for the string "Jimmy stole Tommy’s lunch in the past. Therefore, it is acceptable for Tommy to steal Jimmy’s lunch today.", we follow the IDAA process by decomposing the task of classifying the defective argument type into specific steps.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of IDAA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine the main statement or claim that is being set forth to prove.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Identify the causal basis presented to establish the truth of the proposition (<P>).

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Look for any supporting evidence or arguments that corroborate the reason (<R>).

4. **Classify the Argument Type:**
   - Compare the identified elements with the definitions of defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

5. **Determine the Specific Defective Argument Type:**
   - Determine which defective argument type best describes the argument based on the given structural issues. 

Let's apply these steps to the argument:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
```
<P>: It is acceptable for Tommy to steal Jimmy’s lunch today.
```

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
```
<R>: Jimmy stole Tommy’s lunch in the past.
```

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- There is no additional corroborating evidence or argument provided.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument Type

- **Generalization (G):** This doesn't apply here, as the argument isn't making an inference about all similar cases based on a single instance.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable since the argument is not attempting to list all possibilities.
  
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason given (Jimmy stole Tommy’s lunch in the past) does not logically support the proposition (Tommy stealing Jimmy’s lunch is acceptable today) conclusively. The conclusion doesn't logically follow the reason as it involves a moral judgment or principle of "an eye for an eye," which may not be universally accepted or logically strong.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reason provided doesn’t offer a compelling causal basis for the behavior being deemed acceptable.
  
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Doesn’t apply since the reason isn't a mere repetition of the proposition.
  
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There's no claim that it’s universally agreed upon.
  
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** No ambiguous terms in the sense that would lead to a different interpretation of the proof.

### Step 5: Determine the Specific Defective Argument Type

The argument can be classified under two possible types:
1. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason (R) that Jimmy stole Tommy’s lunch in the past does not logically support the proposition (P) that it is acceptable for Tommy to steal Jimmy’s lunch today.
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reason provided does not strongly justify the proposition.

Therefore, from the analysis, the argument "Jimmy stole Tommy’s lunch in the past. Therefore, it is acceptable for Tommy to steal Jimmy’s lunch today." can be primarily classified as a defective argument of type **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and secondarily as **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
