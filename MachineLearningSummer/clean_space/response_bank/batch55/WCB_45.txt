For 
To apply \( IDAA \) to the provided argument, we need to decompose the task of classifying the argument as one of the defective argument types (\( IDA \)) into specific steps (\( D \)). Here are the steps involved:

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( P \)):** Determine the main assertion or claim being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (\( R \)):** Determine the causal basis provided to support the proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Reason (\( R \)):** Check if the reason provided is a strong causal basis for the proposition.
4. **Identify any Proof of Reason (\( PR \)):** Check if there are additional arguments corroborating the reason.
5. **Assess for Defectiveness:** Based on the definitions of the defective argument types, classify the argument.

Now, let's apply these steps to the argument:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\( P \))
**Proposition \( (P) \):** "My tiger prevention strategy clearly works."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\( R \))
**Reason \( (R) \):** "I go to my front porch every morning and yell, 'May no tigers enter this house!' and for 20 years, not a single tiger has entered my house."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Reason (\( R \))
The reason suggests that the action of yelling a specific phrase has caused tigers to stay away from the house.

### Step 4: Identify any Proof of Reason (\( PR \))
The proposition does not provide additional independent arguments to corroborate the reason. It relies solely on the coincidence of no tigers visiting for 20 years.

### Step 5: Assess for Defectiveness
We analyze the identified parts for any defects based on the defined categories:
- **Generalization (\( G \))**: Not applicable here, as no generalization over a group is being made.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\( FE \))**: Not applicable, as no enumeration of possibilities is presented.
- **Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \))**: Applicable, because the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. There are many other potential explanations for why no tigers have entered the house that are not considered.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \))**: Applicable, because the causal link between yelling the phrase and tiger prevention is weak and unconvincing.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( RR \))**: Not applicable, since the reason provided is not merely a restatement of the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (\( FU \))**: Not applicable, since no consensus or universal agreement is being assumed.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (\( DEP \))**: Not applicable, as the language in the reason ("tiger prevention strategy") is not ambiguous in a way that changes the meaning.

### Conclusion
The argument primarily qualifies as having both:
- **\( IR \):** Inconclusive Reason – because the given reason (yelling the phrase) does not conclusively prove the proposition (tiger prevention strategy).
- **\( WCB \):** Insufficient Causal Basis – because the causal connection presented in the reason is weak and not compelling.

Therefore, the argument "I go to my front porch every morning and yell, 'May no tigers enter this house!' and for 20 years, not a single tiger has entered my house. My tiger prevention strategy clearly works." can be classified under **\( IR \)** (Inconclusive Reason) and **\( WCB \)** (Insufficient Causal Basis).
