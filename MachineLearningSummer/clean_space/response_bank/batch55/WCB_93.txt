For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the classification task into specific steps) to the given argument "I saw John texting yesterday, and then he got in his car and drove away; he must have crashed because he was texting. Therefore, cell phones should be banned," let's proceed step by step to classify the argument by identifying the defective argument type.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The proposition (P) is the main point or claim that is being set forth to be proven:
- "Therefore, cell phones should be banned."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason (R) provides the basis for the proposition:
- "He must have crashed because he was texting."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
The proof of reason (PR) provides additional arguments to corroborate the reason:
- "I saw John texting yesterday, and then he got in his car and drove away."

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
Now we need to classify the argument based on the defective argument types:

#### Generalization (G):
- **Description**: When an assertion based on one part or majority of individuals is incorrectly referred to all.
- **Application**: The argument generalizes from a single instance (John texting and presumably crashing) to a broad conclusion (cell phones should be banned).

This matches the characteristics of a Generalization because it takes the action of one individual (John) and generalizes that to everyone needing cell phones to be banned.

### Step 5: Evaluate for Other Defective Argument Types (Optional for thoroughness)
Evaluate the argument for other defective types, though <G> already seems to fit well:

#### Incomplete Enumeration (FE):
- **Description**: Claims complete enumeration of possibilities without covering all pertinent ones.
- **Application**: This is not necessarily applicable to the current argument.

#### Inconclusive Reason (IR):
- **Description**: Reason does not conclusively demonstrate correctness of the proposition.
- **Application**: While the reason (texting causes crashes) isn't conclusively proven, the primary issue seems more aligned with generalizing from a single instance.

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):
- **Description**: Causal basis for the reason is weak.
- **Application**: Argument could be weak here too, but the central issue appears to be the generalization.

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):
- **Description**: Reason repeats the proposition.
- **Application**: This is not applicable here.

#### Presumptuous Consensus (FU):
- **Description**: Assumes proof of reason as certain, on the ground of universal agreement.
- **Application**: This does not seem to be the case here.

#### Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):
- **Description**: Proof is taken in another sense than intended.
- **Application**: This does not apply here.

### Conclusion
The argument primarily fits the Generalization (G) type. It takes an individual event (John texting and presumably crashing) and generalizes it to a broad societal action (banning cell phones).

So, the defective argument type for "I saw John texting yesterday, and then he got in his car and drove away; he must have crashed because he was texting. Therefore, cell phones should be banned." is **Generalization (G)**.
