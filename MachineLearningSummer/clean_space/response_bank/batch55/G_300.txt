To apply the task of decomposition (D) to the task of classifying the argument type (IDA) for the string "All women care about are their looks," let's break it down step by step:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P) in the Argument:**
   - Determine the main statement or claim that is being made.
   
2. **Identify the Reason (R) Given for the Proposition (P):**
   - Identify the supporting basis that aims to establish the truth of the proposition.
   
3. **Check for Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - Look for any additional arguments or evidence that corroborates the reason (R).

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type (IDA):**
   - Compare the identified parts with the known defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) to determine the classification.

### Applying IDAA to "All women care about are their looks":

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Proposition (P): "All women care about are their looks."
     - This claim makes a general statement about all women.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Reason (R): Not explicitly stated in the given string. The statement stands alone without an apparent reason provided.
     - Since no specific causal basis is given, we cannot derive a reason from the provided text.

3. **Check for Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - Proof of Reason (PR): There is no additional supporting argument or evidence provided to corroborate a reason.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type (IDA):**
   - Based on the identifying parts, let's compare this with defective argument types:
     - **Generalization (G):** The Proposition (P) is an assertion about "all women" based on the assumption of uniformity from one group to an entire population, fitting the definition of a generalization.
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The Proposition (P) does not enumerate possibilities; it makes a sweeping statement without listing other interests women might have, so it also lacks completeness.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Since no explicit reason (R) was given for the Proposition (P), these do not directly apply in this instance.

Given the steps in decomposition, we conclude that the argument most fittingly aligns with the defective argument type:

**Generalization (G)** because it makes a broad assertion about all women based on an assumption rather than evidence that applies to all individuals within that group.

### Final Classification:
The argument "All women care about are their looks." falls under the defective argument type **Generalization (G)**.
