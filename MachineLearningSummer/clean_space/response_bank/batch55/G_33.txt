For 
To apply the decomposition approach (<D>) to the task of classifying the given argument (<IDA>), we'll break down the task into specific steps. Here's how we can do this:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine what the claim or conclusion of the argument is.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the causal basis or supporting evidence presented for the Proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Reason (<R>)**: Examine the Reason to see if it effectively supports the Proposition or if it falls into one of the defective argument types.
4. **Check for Defects in Reasoning**: Identify any potential defects in the reasoning based on the defined defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

Now, let's apply these steps to the provided argument: "Pol Pot, the Cambodian Maoist revolutionary, was against religion, and he was a very bad man. Frankie is against religion; therefore, Frankie also must be a very bad man."

### Step-by-Step Analysis

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**
   - Proposition: "Frankie must be a very bad man."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**
   - Reason: "Pol Pot was against religion, and he was a very bad man. Frankie is also against religion."

**Step 3: Evaluate the Reason (<R>)**
   - The Reason states that because Pol Pot, who was against religion, was a very bad man, Frankie, who is against religion, must also be a very bad man. 

**Step 4: Check for Defects in Reasoning**
   - **<G> Generalization**: This argument assumes that anyone who is against religion must be a very bad person because Pol Pot (a single example) was bad and was against religion. This is a form of generalization where the characteristic of one person is generalized to another without sufficient basis.
   - **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition. Just because Pol Pot was against religion and was a bad person, it does not logically follow that all people who are against religion are bad.
   - **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: The causal basis for being against religion leading to being a bad person is not compelling. The correlation between Pol Pot's anti-religious stance and his immorality does not provide a compelling causal link applicable to Frankie.
   - **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: This doesn't apply here as the Reason doesn't merely repeat the Proposition.
   - **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: This doesn't rely on a presumed universal consensus.
   - **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: There doesn't appear to be ambiguous language use that could be interpreted in another sense.

After considering the defective argument types, we can classify the argument mainly under **Generalization (<G>)** and **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, with some inclination towards **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.

### Conclusion 
The given argument "Pol Pot, the Cambodian Maoist revolutionary, was against religion, and he was a very bad man.  Frankie is against religion; therefore, Frankie also must be a very bad man." would mainly be classified as a **Generalization (<G>)** and suffers from having an **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, with elements of **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
