To apply the task of IDAA (the decomposition of advanced task IDA into specific steps) to classify the argument presented in the dialogue between Person 1 and Person 2, we follow these detailed steps:

### Step 1: Understanding the Argument Presented

First, let's break down the dialogue to understand the arguments made by both Person 1 and Person 2:

1. **Person 1**: "I am for raising the minimum wage in our state."
   - Proposition (P): Raising the minimum wage in our state is a good idea.

2. **Person 2**: “She is for raising the minimum wage, but she is not even smart enough to run a business."
   - This critique doesn't directly address the Proposition (P), but rather attacks the person making the argument.

### Step 2: Identifying the Nature of the Argument

Given the statement by Person 2, we need to determine if it fits any of the defective argument types defined. The given defective argument types are:

- Generalization (G)
- Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
- Inconclusive Reason (IR)
- Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
- Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
- Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)

### Step 3: Analyzing the Argument Types

Let's evaluate Person 2's statement:

- **Does Person 2 generalize based on a limited observation?** (Type G)
  - No, Person 2 does not generalize based on limited observations.

- **Does Person 2 miss out on some pertinent possibilities?** (Type FE)
  - No, Person 2’s argument does not concern missing out possibilities.

- **Does Person 2 provide a reason that does not conclusively support the proposition?** (Type IR)
  - Person 2 does not provide any reason that links directly to the original Proposition (P).

- **Is the reason provided by Person 2 weak or insufficient?** (Type WCB)
  - There is no causal basis provided that tries to support or refute the original Proposition (P).

- **Does Person 2's statement repeat the original proposition in another form?** (Type RR)
  - No, the statement does not repeat the original proposition.

- **Does Person 2 assume consensus without demonstrating it?** (Type FU)
  - No, there was no appeal to a consensus.

- **Does Person 2 use ambiguous language?** (Type DEP)
  - There is no ambiguous language used; the language and criticism are quite clear.

### Step 4: Identifying the Correct Defective Argument Type

The analysis shows that Person 2’s response does not directly provide a reason or proof against Person 1's proposition but instead attacks Person 1’s capability by saying, "She is not even smart enough to run a business."

This is an **ad hominem** attack (attacking the person rather than addressing the argument). While none of the provided defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP) directly match this name, the most suitable defective argument type based on the definitions provided is **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (Type RR)**, because Person 2 does not challenge the proposition and fails to relate any provided reasons to the original proposition.

### Step 5: Conclusion of Classification (IDA)

Thus, by applying the IDAA steps and analyzing the context:
- **Person 2’s argument fits most closely with the defective argument type**: **<RR>** - Faulty Repetition of Proposition.

This is because Person 2’s rebuttal does not provide a relevant reason against the proposition (raising the minimum wage) but instead shifts focus to an unrelated personal attack.
