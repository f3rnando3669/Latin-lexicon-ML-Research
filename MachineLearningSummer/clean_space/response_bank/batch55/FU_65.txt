To apply the decomposition of the task (D) to the classification task (IDA) for the given string, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - The proposition is the statement or claim that the argument is setting out to prove.

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - The reason is the causal basis or justification provided to support the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   - The proof of reason is any additional argument or evidence provided to corroborate the reason.

4. **Classify the Type of Defective Argument**:
   - Determine if any part of the argument fits one of the defective argument types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

Now, let's apply these steps to the string "Everyone I know is making fruit smoothies for quick, portable meals, so smoothies must be really good for you."

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The proposition (P) is the claim that the argument is setting out to prove:
- **Proposition (P):** Smoothies must be really good for you.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason (R) is the causal basis provided to support the proposition:
- **Reason (R):** Everyone I know is making fruit smoothies for quick, portable meals.

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
The proof of reason (PR) would be any additional argument or evidence provided to support the reason:
- **Proof of Reason (PR):** There is no additional proof of reason explicitly provided in the string.

### Step 4: Classify the Type of Defective Argument
Now, we will analyze and classify whether the argument is defective and if so, which type of defective argument it is:

- **Generalization (G)**: The argument might be generalizing from a specific group ("everyone I know") to a broader conclusion ("smoothies must be really good for you"). This fits the definition of a generalization where an assertion based on a part or a majority is applied universally.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not attempt a complete enumeration of possibilities, so this doesn't seem to apply directly.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason given ("everyone I know is making fruit smoothies") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition ("smoothies must be really good for you"). While this could be relevant, it seems secondary to the predominance of generalizing from limited evidence.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis that people are making smoothies does not strongly support the claim about their health benefits. However, this also seems to be covered under generalization, where the main issue is overapplying limited evidence.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason does not simply repeat the proposition, so this doesn’t apply.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument implies consensus ("everyone I know"), but it’s more about the scope of this consensus and how representational it is rather than assuming universal agreement. It leans more toward generalization due to limited scope.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: There doesn't appear to be ambiguous language in this instance that changes the meaning.

Based on this analysis, the most fitting classification is:

### Result: **Generalization (G)**
The argument commits the fallacy of Generalization (G) by inferring a broad conclusion ("smoothies must be really good for you") based on the behavior of a limited group ("everyone I know").
