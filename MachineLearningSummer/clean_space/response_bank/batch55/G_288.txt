For 
To apply IDAA to classify the given string, "Two members of my team have become more engaged employees after taking public speaking classes. That proves we should have mandatory public speaking classes for the whole company to improve employee engagement," we will decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine what is being set forth to be proven.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Determine what causal basis is being used to establish the truth of the Proposition.
3. **Check for defective argument types**: Compare the argument against the definitions of defective argument types to see if it falls into any.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**
- The Proposition here is: "We should have mandatory public speaking classes for the whole company to improve employee engagement."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)**
- The Reason provided is: "Two members of my team have become more engaged employees after taking public speaking classes."

**Step 3: Compare the Reason against Defective Argument Types**

**Generalization (G):**
- The argument might be a Generalization if the assertion is based on a small sample applied to the whole.
- Analysis: The Reason uses the outcome for two members to generalize to the whole company. This looks like a classic case of a **Generalization (G)** since the assertion is based on outcomes for just two individuals and extrapolated to all employees without sufficient evidence that it applies to everyone.

**Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
- If the Proposition claims comprehensive consideration but misses pertinent cases.
- Analysis: The Proposition does not enumerate all possibilities, but rather implies a single solution based on insufficient data.

**Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
- If the Reason fails to conclusively demonstrate the Proposition.
- Analysis: The Reason does not conclusively prove the Proposition, as the experience of two members may not be representative of the entire company.

**Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
- If the Reasonâ€™s causal basis for the Proposition is weak.
- Analysis: The causal link (public speaking classes -> employee engagement) is assumed but not strongly established or supported.

**Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
- If the Reason essentially restates the Proposition.
- Analysis: The Reason does not merely repeat the Proposition; it offers some evidence, albeit limited.

**Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
- If the Proof assumes universal agreement on something still in dispute.
- Analysis: The argument does not invoke a consensus; it is based on specific examples rather than a claimed universal agreement.

**Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
- If the Proof's language may be interpreted differently than intended.
- Analysis: The language used in the argument is clear and not ambiguous in the context provided.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the most fitting classification for the argument is:

**Generalization (G)**: The argument commits the fallacy of generalizing from a small sample size (two employees) to apply the outcome to the entire company without sufficient evidence that this would hold true universally.

The classified defective argument type for the given string is **<G>**.
