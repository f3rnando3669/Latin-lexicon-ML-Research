For 
To apply the decomposition strategy (IDAA) to identify the type of defective argument in "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity," we will break down the task (IDA) into specific steps (D). Here's how we can proceed:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>) of IDA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Summarize what is being asserted or intended to be proven.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Summarize the causal basis provided for the Proposition.

3. **Analyze the components**:
   - Evaluate the Reason and the Proposition relationship.
   - Determine if the argument commits any of the listed defective argument types.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument**:
   - Based on the analysis, classify the argument as one of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

Let's apply these steps to the given string:

### 1. Identify the Proposition (<P>)

**<P>:** "Paranormal activity is real."

This is the main assertion the speaker intends to prove.

### 2. Identify the Reason (<R>)

**<R>:** "I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."

This is the causal basis the speaker gives to establish the truth of the Proposition.

### 3. Analyze the components

In this step, we need to evaluate the relationship between <P> and <R> and check for any of the defined defective argument types.

- The Reason merely reiterates the assertion in a slightly different form without providing any substantive causal basis, evidence, or logical support.
- It appears to say the same thing as the Proposition, simply reiterating without actual proof or additional reasoning.

### 4. Classify the Defective Argument

Based on the analysis, we can classify this argument.

The argument type is **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)** because the Reason "I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity" is essentially reiterating the Proposition "Paranormal activity is real" without further corroboration or logical basis.

### Final Classification

The given argument "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity." is of type **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**.
