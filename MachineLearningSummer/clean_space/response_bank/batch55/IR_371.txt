For 
To apply IDAA to the argument provided, we will decompose the task of classifying the defective argument step-by-step. Here, <IDAA> involves the decomposition of the task <IDA> (the classification of defective arguments) into specific steps. Let's proceed accordingly:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)

First, we need to identify the proposition, which is the part of the argument stating what is intended to be proved or argued.

In the provided argument, the proposition is:
"There is a lot of commotion regarding saving the environment."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)

Next, we need to find the reason that sets forth the causal basis for the proposition.

The reason given in the argument is:
"We cannot make this world an Eden."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)

The proof of reason is the part of the argument that provides additional arguments or evidence to support the reason.

The proof provided in the argument is:
"What will happen if it does become Eden? Adam and Eve got bored there!"

### Step 4: Classify the Argument

Now, we classify whether <P>, <R>, and <PR> form a defective argument based on the given types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: No, the argument does not generalize based on one or a majority of individuals.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: No, the argument does not claim to have considered all possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Possibly, as the reason does not strongly support the proposition. However, let’s examine other types.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Yes, the reason “We cannot make this world an Eden” is weakly related to the proposition, as it lacks compelling support.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: No, the reason is not a mere repetition of the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: No, there is no assumption of universal agreement.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Yes, the term "Eden" is ambiguously used, and the anecdote about Adam and Eve getting bored is a non-sequitur that doesn’t offer clear meaning.

### Step 5: Determine the Final Classification

Given the classification considerations, the argument may involve both **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** and **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**. Here’s why:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reason provided (“We cannot make this world an Eden”) does not compellingly support the proposition about saving the environment.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The term "Eden" and the anecdote about Adam and Eve getting bored are not relevant or clearly related to the argument about environmental commotion.

### Conclusion

The defective argument is closely related to both **WCB** and **DEP**, with a strong leaning towards **WCB** due to the weak causal basis provided for the proposition. However, there is also a significant element of **DEP** due to the ambiguous use of "Eden." 

Thus, the argument "There is a lot of commotion regarding saving the environment. We cannot make this world an Eden. What will happen if it does become Eden? Adam and Eve got bored there!" can be classified under both **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** and **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**.
