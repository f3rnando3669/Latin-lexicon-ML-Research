For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string into specific steps) to the provided statement ("I think scientists are wrong. There is no such thing as global warming. I just finished talking to my boss, and he thought the idea was ridiculous."), we need to break down the classification task and identify which type of defective argument(s) it represents. Let's proceed step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- **Proposition**: "There is no such thing as global warming."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- **Reason**: "I just finished talking to my boss, and he thought the idea was ridiculous."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- There is no additional proof presented other than the boss's opinion.

### Step 4: Classify the identified parts and evaluate for defects
- **Evaluate Generalization (G)**:
  - The proposition does not appear to generalize from a part to the whole, so this does not seem to be a Generalization issue.
  
- **Evaluate Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
  - The argument does not present a set of possibilities, so this does not fit Incomplete Enumeration.
  
- **Evaluate Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
  - The reason given ("I just finished talking to my boss, and he thought the idea was ridiculous.") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. It relies on an opinion which isn't a decisive factual basis.
  
- **Evaluate Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
  - The causal basis ("my boss thought the idea was ridiculous") is not compelling or sufficient to establish the truth of the proposition. It's a weak causal link since a boss's opinion does not logically determine the existence or non-existence of global warming.
  
- **Evaluate Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
  - The reason does not simply restate the proposition in different words; it provides an external opinion, so this type does not apply.
  
- **Evaluate Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
  - The argument does not claim universal agreement but relies on one opinion, so Presumptuous Consensus is not applicable.
  
- **Evaluate Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
  - There is no ambiguous language that could be interpreted in various ways; the statement is relatively clear in its expression.

### Step 5: Select the most appropriate defective argument type
Based on the evaluation above, the statement primarily fits the criteria for **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason does not conclusively prove the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The reason (boss's opinion) is not a compelling causal basis for rejecting global warming.

### Conclusion
The string "I think scientists are wrong. There is no such thing as global warming. I just finished talking to my boss, and he thought the idea was ridiculous." should be classified as a defective argument of type **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** and **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
