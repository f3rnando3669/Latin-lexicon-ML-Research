To apply the process of decomposing the task (‹IDA›) of classifying the given argument "Leonardo DiCaprio is just a dumb actor. What does he really know about climate change?" into specific steps, we will follow the methodology defined as ‹IDAA›. 

Let's break down this process step by step for thorough analysis:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the proposition (P):**
   - The given statement is "Leonardo DiCaprio is just a dumb actor. What does he really know about climate change?"
   - Proposition (P): "Leonardo DiCaprio is just a dumb actor."

2. **Identify the reason (R) for the proposition:**
   - The implicit reason in the statement seems to be: "Because he is an actor, he doesn't have credible knowledge about climate change."
   - Reason (R): "Because he is an actor, he doesn't have credible knowledge about climate change."

3. **Identify any proof of reason (PR) provided:**
   - The statement does not provide additional arguments or evidence to support the reason. 
   - In this case, there is no explicit proof of reason, so we note that:
   - Proof (PR): Not explicitly provided.

4. **Classify the argument type (IDA):**
   - Now, let's classify the defective argument type the statement falls into:

   a. **Generalization (G):**
      - Checks if an assertion is made based on limited cases but applied generally. 
      - Here, the author is generalizing that an entire profession (actors) lacks credible knowledge on a specific topic.

   b. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
      - Checks if the argument claims a complete enumeration but misses possibilities.
      - This is not the case here as no enumeration is claimed.

   c. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
      - Checks if the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
      - The reason given is that being an actor inherently implies ignorance on climate change, which is a conclusive leap.

   d. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
      - Checks if the reason does not provide a compelling causal basis.
      - The argument does not provide a compelling basis on why an actor cannot understand climate change.

   e. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
      - Checks if the reason is just a repetition of the proposition.
      - It isn't just a repetition; the reason elaborates slightly on the proposition.

   f. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
      - Checks if the argument assumes certainty based on universal agreement undemonstrated.
      - Not applicable here.

   g. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
      - Checks if the argument uses ambiguous language.
      - The language here is clear, though insulting and dismissive.

   - The argument fits primarily into:
     - **Generalization (G)**: It generalizes that actors, including DiCaprio, don't have valuable knowledge about climate change, without evidence for such a wide claim.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided is not adequate to conclusively discredit DiCaprio's knowledge on climate change.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis for dismissing DiCaprio's knowledge (him being an actor) is weak and uncompelling.

### Conclusion

The argument "Leonardo DiCaprio is just a dumb actor. What does he really know about climate change?" can be classified under multiple defective argument types: **Generalization (G)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
