For 
Certainly! To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the argument "All required university courses are boring," we will decompose the task into specific steps to identify which type of defective argument it represents.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>) of <IDAA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**  
   Analyze the statement (string <s>) to identify the main proposition.

2. **Interpret the Reason (<R>):**  
   Determine if there is an implied or explicit reason provided for the proposition and analyze its strength.

3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**  
   Check for any supporting arguments (Proof of Reason) that back up the Reason provided.

4. **Check for Defective Argument Types:**  
   Assess the statement against each type of defective argument (i.e., <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Applying Steps to the Argument "All required university courses are boring":

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The proposition is: "All required university courses are boring."

2. **Interpret the Reason (<R>):**
   - The statement itself does not provide an explicit reason. It is a broad assertion without reasoning.

3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - The statement does not provide any supporting arguments or proof to back it up.

4. **Check for Defective Argument Types:**

   - **Generalization (<G>):**
     - **Definition:** <P> is based on some one part or a majority of individuals, but not necessarily applicable to all.
     - **Application:** The statement generalizes the boredom of "required university courses" to all of them. It doesn't specify if this is based on experience with a few courses or all possible courses.
     - **Conclusion:** This matches the characteristics of a Generalization because it overextends an assertion from potentially some or most required courses to all required courses.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
     - **Definition:** Claiming a complete enumeration of possibilities but missing some pertinent ones.
     - **Application:** No enumeration of possibilities is presented.
     - **Conclusion:** This type does not seem to apply directly here.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
     - **Definition:** <R> does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the <P>.
     - **Application:** No reason is provided, so this is not applicable.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
     - **Definition:** The causal basis for <P> is not compelling.
     - **Application:** Again, no causal basis (reason) is provided, so this is not applicable.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
     - **Definition:** <R> repeats what is said in <P>.
     - **Application:** No repetition observed, so this is not applicable.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
     - **Definition:** <PR> is assumed as certain due to presumed universal agreement while still in dispute.
     - **Application:** No claim based on universal agreement is made, so this is not applicable.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
     - **Definition:** <PR> can be taken in another sense than intended.
     - **Application:** The language used is not particularly ambiguous.
     - **Conclusion:** This is not applicable.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the statement "All required university courses are boring" fits the type of defective argument called **Generalization (<G>)**. The statement makes a broad assertion that extends beyond what is likely justified without specific evidence to support that all such courses are indeed boring.
