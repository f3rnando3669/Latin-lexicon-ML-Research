For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to the classification of the statement "Fatima sneezed and she caused a tsunami in Tokyo." as a defective argument type, we need to decompose the process into specific steps and then execute them one by one. Here is the step-by-step decomposition (\( \text{D} \)) and the subsequent analysis:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (\( \text{D} \)):

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( \text{P} \))**: Determine the main claim or assertion being made in the statement.
2. **Analyze the Reason (\( \text{R} \))**: Determine the causal basis or reasoning provided to support the Proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Reason (\( \text{PR} \))**: Assess if there is any additional argument or proof that corroborates the Reason.
4. **Classify the Argument Type**: Use the definitions of defective argument types to classify the argument based on the analysis from Steps 1-3.

### Application of \( \text{IDAA} \) to the Statement "Fatima sneezed and she caused a tsunami in Tokyo":

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\( \text{P} \))**

- The Proposition (P) in the statement is: "Fatima caused a tsunami in Tokyo."

**Step 2: Analyze the Reason (\( \text{R} \))**

- The Reason (R) provided is: "Fatima sneezed."

**Step 3: Evaluate the Reason (\( \text{PR} \))**

- In this statement, there is no additional argument or proof provided to corroborate the Reason (PR). 

**Step 4: Classify the Argument Type**

- **Generalization (\( \text{G} \))**: This does not apply because the statement doesn't generalize from some individuals to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\( \text{FE} \))**: This does not apply because the statement does not enumerate possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (\( \text{IR} \))**: There is a strong candidate here because the reason "Fatima sneezed" does not conclusively demonstrate how it causes a tsunami, which is a highly improbable and unrelated event.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( \text{WCB} \))**: This also applies because the causal link between "sneezing" and "causing a tsunami" is extremely weak and not compelling. 
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( \text{RR} \))**: This does not apply because the Reason is different from the Proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (\( \text{FU} \))**: This does not apply because there is no claim of universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (\( \text{DEP} \))** This does not apply because there is no ambiguous language that can be interpreted differently.

Based on the analysis in Step 4, the statement "Fatima sneezed and she caused a tsunami in Tokyo" can be classified primarily as an **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( \text{WCB} \))** because the causal relationship proposed is weak and non-compelling. It might also be seen as containing an **Inconclusive Reason (\( \text{IR} \))**, as the Reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition. However, the primary classification given the context would be \( \text{WCB} \).
