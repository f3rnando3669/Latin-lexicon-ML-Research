For 
Sure, let's apply <IDAA> to classify the statement "Some tall people recently vandalized the park, tall people are irresponsible." Here's the decomposition step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P> in the argument.
In the given statement, the Proposition <P> is "tall people are irresponsible."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R> in the argument.
The Reason <R> given for the Proposition is "Some tall people recently vandalized the park."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Reason <R> against the Proposition <P>.
Let's see if the Reason conclusively supports the Proposition.

1. **Generalization <G>:** This defective argument type occurs when an assertion based on some or a majority of individuals is inappropriately applied to all individuals of that type.
   
Based on the given Reason, "Some tall people recently vandalized the park," the conclusion that "tall people are irresponsible" seems to be a broad generalization. The behavior of "some tall people" does not reliably indicate the behavior of all tall people.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>:** This refers to a defective Proposition when a complete enumeration of possibilities is claimed but some pertinent possibilities are omitted. This doesn't seem applicable here as no enumeration of possibilities was attempted in the given statement.

3. **Inconclusive Reason <IR>:** The Reason provided does not conclusively support the Proposition. The vandalism by "some tall people" does not conclusively demonstrate that "tall people are irresponsible" universally.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>:** This occurs when the causal basis for the Proposition is weak or unconvincing. In this case, the vandalism by a few individuals is a weak causal basis to generalize irresponsibility to all tall people.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>:** This is when the Reason provided is just a repetition of the Proposition. This does not seem to be the case here; the Reason and Proposition are not saying exactly the same thing.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>:** This occurs when a Proof of Reason is assumed to be certain based on a supposed universal agreement. There's no indication of such an assumption in the given argument.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>:** This refers to ambiguity in the language used in the Proof of Reason. Again, there's no indication that the language used in the Reason is ambiguous.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument Based on Analysis

Based on the steps above, this argument most closely resembles a **Generalization <G>**. The behavior of some tall people is improperly generalized to all tall people, leading to the conclusion that "tall people are irresponsible."

### Conclusion
The string "Some tall people recently vandalized the park, tall people are irresponsible." is classified as a defective argument type **Generalization <G>**.
