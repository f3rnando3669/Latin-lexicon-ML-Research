For 
To apply IDAA to "Violent video games cause teens to be violent, because violent teens play violent video games," we need to decompose the task of identifying the defective argument type into specific steps and then execute those steps systematically.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDA (Identification of Defective Argument)

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - What is the assertion or claim being put forward?

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - What is the causal basis provided for the Proposition?

3. **Assess the Reason (<R>) in relation to the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Does the Reason conclusively support the Proposition?
   - Is the Reason a mere repetition of the Proposition?
   - Is the causal basis sufficient and compelling?
   - Are any claims made that presume consensus without grounds?
   - Is there any use of ambiguous language?
   - Are there claims of complete enumeration that are not supported?

### Applying <D> to <IDA> for the given string

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition: "Violent video games cause teens to be violent."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason: "Because violent teens play violent video games."

3. **Assess the Reason (<R>) in relation to the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine whether the Reason conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the Proposition.
   - Check if the Reason is merely a restatement of the Proposition.
   - Evaluate the sufficiency and compulsion of the causal basis provided.
   - Look out for any presumed consensus or ambiguous language use in the Proof of Reason.

### Analysis:

**Step 1: Assess if the Reason supports the Proposition conclusively:**
- The Reason given is "because violent teens play violent video games." This does not provide conclusive evidence that violent video games cause teens to be violent. It merely states that teens who are already violent happen to play violent video games.

**Step 2: Check for repetition of the Proposition:**
- The Reason seems to be a roundabout way of restating the Proposition. It does not provide new information but rather reiterates the scenario described in the Proposition.

**Step 3: Evaluate the causal basis:**
- There is an insufficient causal basis here. The assertion "violent teens play violent video games" is weak because it does not establish a causal link; correlation does not imply causation.

**Step 4: Check for presumed consensus or ambiguous language:**
- The argument does not rely on an assumed consensus. It is straightforward in its wording.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis, the argument seems to suffer primarily from a repetition where the Reason does not provide additional support but merely reiterates the Proposition. Therefore, the type of defective argument can be identified as:

### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)

Thus, applying <IDAA> to "Violent video games cause teens to be violent, because violent teens play violent video games," the classification of <s> is:

**<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**
