For 
To apply IDAA to the string "Everyone who likes pizza likes pepperoni is an example of", we need to break down the task of classifying this string as a defective argument into specific steps. Hereâ€™s how we can do it:

1. **Identify the proposition (<P>) in the string**: Determine what is being asserted or intended to be proven in the statement.
2. **Determine if the proposition is based on a generalization**: Check if the proposition makes a broad assertion based on a limited set of observations.
3. **Check for completeness of enumeration**: Determine if the statement claims to consider all possibilities but misses out on pertinent options.
4. **Analyze the reason (<R>) supporting the proposition**: Examine if any reasons are provided and whether they are conclusive or not.
5. **Assess the causal basis**: Verify if the reason provided, if any, offers a compelling causal basis for the proposition.
6. **Check for repetition**: Determine if the reason merely repeats the proposition without adding any new information.
7. **Evaluate presumptuous consensus**: See if the statement uses the assumption of universal agreement as proof.
8. **Examine for ambiguous language use**: Identify if any part of the argument can be interpreted in more than one way, leading to ambiguity.

Let's break down the specific steps for the given string:

### Step 1: Identify the proposition (<P>)
The proposition in the string is "Everyone who likes pizza likes pepperoni."

### Step 2: Determine if the proposition is based on a generalization
The proposition asserts that "everyone who likes pizza likes pepperoni," which appears to be based on a generalization. It assumes that because some people who like pizza also like pepperoni, therefore all people who like pizza must like pepperoni.

### Step 3: Check for completeness of enumeration
The statement does not attempt to enumerate possibilities, so this step is not applicable in this context.

### Step 4: Analyze the reason (<R>) supporting the proposition
There is no explicit reason provided in the string to support the proposition, implying that no specific evidence or reasoning is presented.

### Step 5: Assess the causal basis
Since no reason is offered, there is no causal basis to assess in this instance.

### Step 6: Check for repetition
There is no reason that simply repeats the proposition, so this step is not applicable.

### Step 7: Evaluate presumptuous consensus
The statement does not claim universal agreement as a form of proof, hence this step is not relevant.

### Step 8: Examine for ambiguous language use
The language used is straightforward and does not appear ambiguous.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the classification of the string "Everyone who likes pizza likes pepperoni" is an example of **Generalization (<G>)**. It generalizes from possibly a limited observation that everyone who likes pizza also likes pepperoni, which is not necessarily true for all individuals.

So, the final classification is:
**<G> Generalization**
