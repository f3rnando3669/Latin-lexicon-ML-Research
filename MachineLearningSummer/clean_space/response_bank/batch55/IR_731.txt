For 
To apply IDAA to the statement "I am committed to preserving traditional marriage, the union of one man and one woman," we need to break down IDA into specific steps and then apply those steps to classify the statement. Let's begin with the decomposition (D) of the task (IDA):

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
Analyzing the given statement to determine if it encapsulates a Proposition (P). This would involve identifying the assertion or claim being made.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
Determine if there is a Reason (R) provided to support the Proposition (P).

### Step 3: Identify Proof of Reason (PR)
Establish if there is a Proof of Reason (PR) that corroborates the Reason (R).

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument
Compare the statement with the definitions of potential defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) and classify it accordingly:

- **Generalization (G)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**

Now, let's apply these steps to the given statement.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
"I am committed to preserving traditional marriage, the union of one man and one woman."
- The Proposition (P) is: "Traditional marriage is the union of one man and one woman."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
- The statement does not provide a clear Reason (R) supporting the assertion (P). 

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
- There is no additional Proof of Reason (PR) corroborating any Reason because no Reason (R) is provided in the statement.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument
Given that we have identified the Proposition (P) but found no Reason (R) or Proof of Reason (PR), we can evaluate the types of defective arguments to see which best applies.

- **Generalization (G)**: The statement does not suggest a generalization based on any specific part or majority.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: There is no enumeration of possibilities, so this doesn't fit.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Since no Reason (R) is provided, (IR) doesn’t fit.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is no causal basis (R), so (WCB) isn’t applicable.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: There is no Reason (R) to be a restatement.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The statement does not claim consensus as proof.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: There isn’t an ambiguity in language that leads to confusion.

The statement appears to be a strong assertion without backing evidence or reasoning. The closest fit for a defective argument here is likely:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This classification is relevant because there is no Reason (R) supporting the proposition (P).

Therefore, upon applying IDAA, the statement "I am committed to preserving traditional marriage, the union of one man and one woman," can be classified as an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** since it makes a proposition without providing any reasoning behind it.
