For 
To apply IDAA (which involves decomposing the classification task IDA into specific steps) to the given string "Has your psychology department stopped teaching that ineffective approach to therapy yet?", we'll follow a systematic approach to classify the argument according to one of the defective argument types.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
Analyze the statement to determine its main proposition or claim.

**Statement Analysis:**
- The statement is in the form of a question, which presupposes that the psychology department has been teaching an ineffective approach to therapy in the past.

**Proposition (P):**
- The psychology department has taught an ineffective approach to therapy.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
Determine the reason that purportedly supports the proposition (if present).

**Analysis:**
- The statement does not explicitly provide a causal basis or reason for the proposition. Instead, it presumes the truth of the proposition within the question framework.

**Reason (R):**
- The reason is implied rather than stated, suggesting that teaching an ineffective approach is inherently problematic, but not detailing why.

### Step 3: Classify Based on Defective Argument Types
With the proposition (P) and reason (R) identified, evaluate the type of defective argument that best fits the given string.

#### Generalization (G)
Does the statement make a broad generalization based on limited cases? 
- No, the statement does not generalize from specific cases.

#### Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
Does the statement claim to have considered all possibilities but misses out?
- No, it does not enumerate possibilities.

#### Inconclusive Reason (IR)
Does the reason fail to conclusively establish the correctness of the proposition?
- The reason is not clear or explicit enough for this classification.

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
Is the causal basis for the proposition weak or uncompelling?
- The causal basis is not explicitly provided, only implied.

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
Does the reason merely restate the proposition without proving it?
- There is no explicit reason provided to repeat the proposition.

#### Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
Is the reason assumed as certain based on supposed universal agreement on a disputed point?
- No universal agreement or consensus is claimed.

#### Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)
Is there ambiguity in the language that can lead to multiple interpretations?
- Yes, the language used in the form of a loaded question implies a presupposition that the approach to therapy is ineffective, regardless of its actual truth.

**Classification:**
The statement "Has your psychology department stopped teaching that ineffective approach to therapy yet?" is best classified as **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)** because it embeds a presupposition that may not necessarily be agreed upon or proven, leading to multiple interpretations based on the ambiguous terms "ineffective approach" and the loaded nature of the question.

### Conclusion
By applying the decomposition steps of IDAA, we determined that the argument in the string "Has your psychology department stopped teaching that ineffective approach to therapy yet?" is a defective argument type corresponding to Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).
