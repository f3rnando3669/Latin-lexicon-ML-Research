To apply the advanced task decomposition (IDAA) to the problem of identifying the type of defective argument (IDA) in Louise's campaign speech, we need to break down the process into specific steps. Here is the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine what Louise is intending to prove with her argument.
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Understand the causal basis or reason Louise provides to support her proposition.

3. **Analyze the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Review any additional arguments or evidence Louise uses to corroborate her reason.

4. **Match with Defective Argument Types:**
   - Compare the identified structures of the argument with the definitions of defective argument types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), and Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

5. **Conclude the Type of Defective Argument:**
   - Assign the appropriate defective argument type based on the comparison.

### Application to the Given Argument

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Louise's proposition is: "My opponent does not deserve to win."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Louise's reason is: "She is a smoker and she cheated on her boyfriend last year."

3. **Analyze the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - There is no further proof or additional argument presented. Louise's statement simply asserts the reason without further corroboration.

4. **Match with Defective Argument Types:**

   - **Generalization (G):** Louise is not making a generalization based on a part or majority.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Louise is not claiming to have listed all possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reasons given (smoking and cheating) do not conclusively demonstrate the proposition that her opponent does not deserve to win a class president election.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reasons provided are not strong or compelling enough to establish that someone does not deserve to win an election based on class president criteria.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason is not a restatement of the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Louise does not claim that her statement is proven since it's universally agreed upon.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** There is no ambiguity in the language used.

5. **Conclude the Type of Defective Argument:**
   - The argument fits both <IR> and <WCB>, but it fits best with Inconclusive Reason (IR) because the reasons given (smoker and cheater) do not conclusively demonstrate why the opponent should not win the class president election.

Therefore, the fallacy Louise has committed is best classified as **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
