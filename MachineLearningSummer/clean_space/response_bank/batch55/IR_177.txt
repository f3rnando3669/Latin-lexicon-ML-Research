Sure, let's apply the process of decomposition (<IDAA>) to classify the string "I used to have that haircut. Then my mom got a job." to identify what type of defective argument it may represent.

Step-by-Step Decomposition of the Task (<IDAA>):

### Step 1: Identify and Separate Statements
Examine the provided string for distinct statements.
- "I used to have that haircut."
- "Then my mom got a job."

### Step 2: Determine if there is a Proposition (<P>)
A proposition (<P>) is a statement indicating what the speaker intends to prove.
- Statement 1: "I used to have that haircut." 
  This is more of an assertion about past events, not a proposition trying to prove something.
- Statement 2: "Then my mom got a job."
  This describes a subsequent event, not a proposition.

### Step 3: Search for a Reason (<R>)
Reason (<R>) is the causal basis for the proposition.
- In this case, the statement "Then my mom got a job." implies a reason but is not clearly linked as a reason supporting a proposition.
  
### Step 4: Analyze the Logical Connection
Check if there is a causal or logical connection asserted between the statements that could be a reason supporting a proposition.
- "I used to have that haircut." (Past fact about the person)
- "Then my mom got a job." (Change in situation)

Here, the implied causal connection could be: "I had that haircut because my mom didn't have a job."

### Step 5: Classify the Type of Defective Argument
Given the above breakdown, we can now classify the argument based on defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** This argument type is about generalizing from a small sample to a larger group. This does not seem to be a case of generalization.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This involves claiming completeness while missing relevant possibilities; not applicable here.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The causal basis ("my mom got a job") does not conclusively prove why the haircut was changed.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal relation ("I used to have that haircut. Then my mom got a job.") is weak; the job change does not necessarily explain the haircut change sufficiently.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This does not involve repetition of the same information.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** No claim of universal agreement here.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The link between the two statements could be seen as ambiguous, but not necessarily due to language use.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis:
- The argument seems primarily to suffer from an **Insufficient Causal Basis** (<WCB>), as the reason cited ("my mom got a job") does not compellingly establish why the haircut was a certain way or why it changed.

Thus, the string "I used to have that haircut. Then my mom got a job." can be classified under the defective argument type <WCB>.
