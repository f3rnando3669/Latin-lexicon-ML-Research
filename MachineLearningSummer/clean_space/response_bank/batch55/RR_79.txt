For 
Certainly! To apply <IDAA> to the statement "In her paper, Aida states 'Filthy, polluting hummers should be banned'", we will follow the steps to decompose the task of classifying the defective argument.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D> for <IDA>):

1. **Identify the Proposition (\<P\>)**:
   - Determine the main assertion or conclusion that Aida is putting forth.

2. **Identify the Reason (\<R\>)**:
   - Determine the causal basis or reasoning Aida provides, if present, for the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\<PR\>)**:
   - Look for supporting arguments or evidence that Aida presents to corroborate her reason.

4. **Classify the Argument (\<IDA\>)**:
   - Compare the identified parts (\<P\>, \<R\>, \<PR\>) against the definitions of defective argument types:
     - \<G\>: Generalization
     - \<FE\>: Incomplete Enumeration
     - \<IR\>: Inconclusive Reason
     - \<RR\>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition
     - \<WCB\>: Insufficient Causal Basis
     - \<FU\>: Presumptuous Consensus
     - \<DEP\>: Ambiguous Language Use

### Application to the Given Statement:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\<P\>):
- Proposition (\<P\>): "Filthy, polluting hummers should be banned."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\<R\>):
- Reason (\<R\>): The statement does not explicitly provide a causal basis or a reason for banning hummers; it only provides the conclusion.

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (\<PR\>):
- Proof of Reason (\<PR\>): The statement does not provide any additional arguments or proofs for the reason, it only refers to "filthy" and "polluting" as attributes without further exploration.

#### Step 4: Classify the Argument (\<IDA\>):
- By examining the description, it seems to be a case of assuming that because hummers are described negatively ("filthy, polluting"), they inherently should be banned without additional reasoning or evidence. This lacks a solid reason (\<R\>) or proof (\<PR\>) to substantiate the proposition.
- The defective argument type that best fits this scenario is:
  - **\<WCB\> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The causal basis which it submits for the \<P\> ("filthy, polluting") is not compelling or sufficiently reasoned out to arrive at the conclusion that hummers should be banned.

### Conclusion:
The fallacy in the statement "In her paper, Aida states 'Filthy, polluting hummers should be banned'" can be classified as <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the given statement, we identify the fallacy as <WCB>.
