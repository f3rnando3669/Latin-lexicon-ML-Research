To apply the IDAA (the application of task decomposition <D> to the classification task <IDA>) to the statement "You have to invite Jenna to your party because it would not be nice not to invite Jenna," let's proceed through the specific decomposition steps to classify the argument.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)

First, let's identify the main assertion or proposition (<P>):

- **<P>:** "You have to invite Jenna to your party."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)

Next, identify the reason given for the proposition (<R>):

- **<R>:** "Because it would not be nice not to invite Jenna."

### Step 3: Link the Reason to the Proposition

Determine how the reason (<R>) supports the proposition (<P>):

- The reason given ("it would not be nice not to invite Jenna") is intended to justify the main assertion that one must invite Jenna to the party.

### Step 4: Evaluate the Structure of the Argument

Examine whether the reason (<R>) genuinely provides new information or conclusive support for the proposition (<P>):

- We see that the reason given is essentially a rephrasing of the proposition. "It would not be nice not to invite Jenna" doesnâ€™t add substantial new information or a compelling causal basis for the proposition; it merely rephrases the imperative of inviting Jenna.

### Step 5: Determine the Classification of the Argument

Classify the argument based on the definitions of defective argument types provided:

- **<G> (Generalization):** Not applicable here.
- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):** Not applicable here.
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** Applicable, but more specifically:<br>
- **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** This fits the argument since the reason provided is essentially a repetition of the proposition. <br>
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** This could also apply, but again, it's more accurately <RR>.
- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):** Not applicable here.
- **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):** Not applicable here.

### Step 6: Conclude the Classification

Based on the evaluation, classify the argument accordingly:

- **Classification:** <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)

### Summary

The argument "You have to invite Jenna to your party because it would not be nice not to invite Jenna" is classified as a **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**. This is because the reason given does not provide additional support or a different causal basis but simply repeats the assertion in different words.

--- 

This step-by-step decomposition applied to the given statement effectively shows why it falls into the <RR> category.
