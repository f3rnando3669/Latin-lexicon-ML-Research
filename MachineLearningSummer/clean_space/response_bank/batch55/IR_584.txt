For 
Applying the given definitions and performing the step-by-step decomposition of the process to the task of classifying the string for defective arguments, we proceed as follows:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>)

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
    - Determine what is being set forth or claimed.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
    - Determine the causal basis provided for the <P>.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
    - Determine any additional arguments that support the <R>.

4. **Classify the Argument Type:**
    - Using the identified parts, classify whether the argument falls into one of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Application of <IDAA>

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)

- Proposition <P>: "Some coronavirus vaccinations are fine while others are not."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)

- Reason <R>: "Some people say that the coronavirus is dangerous. Others say that it is not dangerous."

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)

- In this case, there seems to be no additional proof of reason provided. The arguments supporting <R> are based on conflicting opinions of people.

#### Step 4: Classify the Argument Type

Now, classify the argument type based on definitions of defective arguments:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument is not a case of generalization because it does not extend a part or a majority to all inappropriately.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This does not attempt to present an exhaustive list of possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The given reason (conflicting opinions) does not conclusively support the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This closely applies since the causal basis (opinions) is not compelling evidence for the claim about vaccinations.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: There is no apparent repetition of the proposition as the reason.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument doesn't assume consensus.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: There is no ambiguous language that can be taken in another sense here.

The argument appears to primarily suffer due to an insufficient causal basis to support the proposition. The reason provided is based on opinions, which are not compelling enough to justify the proposition.

### Conclusion 

Given the above analysis, the classification of the string "Some people say that the coronavirus is dangerous. Others say that it is not dangerous. That must mean that some coronavirus vaccinations are fine while others are not." is:

**<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**

The reason (conflicting opinions) provides a weak causal basis for the proposition regarding the efficacy of coronavirus vaccinations.
