For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument into specific steps) to "See the movie that everybody's talking about," we'll break it down into manageable steps. Let's go step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)

We need to identify the main assertion or proposition in the sentence provided.

- **Proposition (P)**: "See the movie"

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)

Next, we identify the reason given to support the proposition.

- **Reason (R)**: "everybody's talking about"

### Step 3: Classify the Defective Argument Type (IDA)

We now determine which type of defective argument (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP) this falls into by evaluating the Reason and how it supports the Proposition.

#### Evaluation:

1. **Generalization (G)**: This doesn't generalize from a part to a whole inaccurately.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This is not trying to enumerate all possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason may not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition, but let's examine other types first.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis ("everybody's talking about") may not necessarily compel someone to see the movie, but it is not inherently weak.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The Reason is not saying precisely the same as the Proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The reason "everybody's talking about" assumes a universal agreement or consensus without evidence.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: There is no significant ambiguity in the language that leads to different interpretations.

Based on this evaluation, the reason given ("everybody's talking about") seems to fit best with the defective argument type **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**. This type assumes a consensus or universal agreement (in this case, interest in the movie) without sufficient evidence.

### Step 4: Summarize the Classification

Summarize the classification based on our evaluation:

- The argument "See the movie that everybody's talking about" is classified as **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** because it assumes a universal agreement that the movie is worth watching simply based on the claim that everyone is talking about it, without providing further substantial evidence.

By breaking down the steps, we've successfully applied IDAA to classify the defective argument type for the given string.
