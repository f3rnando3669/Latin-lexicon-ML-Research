To apply the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types, we need to follow a structured approach. Here are the steps in detail:

1. **Identify the Proposition (\<P\>):** Isolate the main statement or claim made in the argument.
2. **Identify the Reason (\<R\>):** Determine the causal basis or reasoning provided to support the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\<PR\>):** Look for any additional supporting arguments or evidence that corroborates the reason.
4. **Analyze the Defective Argument Types:** Compare the elements of the argument (\<P\>, \<R\>, and \<PR\>) against the definitions of the defective argument types (\<G\>, \<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<WCB\>, \<RR\>, \<FU\>, \<DEP\>).
5. **Classify the Argument:** Based on the analysis, classify the argument as one of the defective types.

Let's apply these steps to the given string "Explaining that the U.S. Civil War was fought only because of the institution of slavery."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

#### 1. Identify the Proposition (\<P\>):
The main claim here is:
- "The U.S. Civil War was fought only because of the institution of slavery."

#### 2. Identify the Reason (\<R\>):
- In this case, an explicit reason is not given in the string. However, we can infer that the reason is implied to be the institution of slavery being the sole cause of the war.

#### 3. Identify the Proof of Reason (\<PR\>):
- No additional supporting arguments or evidence are provided in the string.

#### 4. Analyze the Defective Argument Types:

##### Generalization (\<G\>):
- The claim in the proposition might be an overgeneralization because it asserts that the U.S. Civil War was fought solely for one reason (slavery), whereas historical evidence suggests multiple causes.

##### Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>):
- The proposition implicitly suggests a complete enumeration of the causes (only one cause) but does not consider other potential causes like states' rights, economic differences, etc.

##### Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>), Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>), Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>), Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>):
- Since no explicit reasons or further supporting arguments (\<R\> and \<PR\>) are provided, it is difficult to directly apply these defects.

#### 5. Classify the Argument:
Based on the analysis, the defective arguments that best fit are:
- **Generalization (\<G\>):** The claim is a broad assertion that does not necessarily apply to all instances or explanations of the causes of the U.S. Civil War.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>):** The claim misses out on other pertinent causes for the U.S. Civil War.

### Conclusion:
The string "Explaining that the U.S. Civil War was fought only because of the institution of slavery" can be classified as a defective argument of types \<G\> (Generalization) and \<FE\> (Incomplete Enumeration).
