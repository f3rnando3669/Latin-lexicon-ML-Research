Sure, let's apply the decomposition strategy (<D>) to the task of classifying the provided string ("I ate Oreos, and then I was sick the next day. It must have been the Oreos that caused my sickness.") according to the defective argument types defined earlier.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for <IDAA>

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The proposition (<P>) in the argument appears to be: "It must have been the Oreos that caused my sickness."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason (<R>) given for the proposition is: "I ate Oreos, and then I was sick the next day."

3. **Examine the Causal Basis and Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - The causal basis for the reason is: Eating Oreos has a direct causal relationship with getting sick.
   - There isn't an explicit additional proof of reason (<PR>) provided in the argument.

4. **Classify the Defect in the Argument:**
   - Now, consider whether the argument falls into one of the defective argument types. Here's a closer look at each type:

    - **Generalization (<G>):** This doesn’t seem to be a generalization because it's a statement about a single instance (the speaker’s own experience) rather than a general assertion about all instances.
    
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This doesn’t involve an enumeration of possibilities, so it doesn’t fall into the incomplete enumeration defect.
    
    - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This could be an example of an inconclusive reason since the speaker assumes that the Oreos caused the sickness based on timing alone, without ruling out other potential causes for the sickness.
    
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This is a likely candidate because the causal basis provided (eating Oreos) is weak and doesn’t compellingly establish that the Oreos are indeed the cause of the sickness.
    
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This type is not applicable as the reason provided is not a repetition of the proposition.
    
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The argument doesn’t appeal to a presumed consensus, so this type doesn’t apply here.
    
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** There is no ambiguous language in the argument as the terms and causal relations are clear, even if incorrectly concluded; hence, this defect does not apply.

### Conclusion:

The defective argument type that best classifies the given string is **"Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)"**. The reason provided does not compellingly establish that the Oreos caused the sickness, as it lacks conclusive evidence and doesn’t consider alternative explanations for the illness. 

Thus, applying <IDAA> to "I ate Oreos, and then I was sick the next day. It must have been the Oreos that caused my sickness." leads us to classify this argument as type <WCB>, or Insufficient Causal Basis.
