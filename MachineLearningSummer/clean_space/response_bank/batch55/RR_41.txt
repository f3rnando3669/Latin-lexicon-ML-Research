To begin the process of applying *IDAA* (the application of decomposition to classify defective arguments), we first need to break down the task *IDA* into specific steps. Here's a possible decomposition (*D*) for classifying a given string *s* into one of the known defective argument types:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Determine what claim is being asserted in the string.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Determine the causal basis or explanation provided for the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Check if there are any additional arguments or evidence supporting the reason.
4. **Classify Argument Defects:** Compare the identified elements (<P>, <R>, <PR>) with the known defective arguments to classify the string.

Now, let's apply this decomposition to the provided string "Smoking pot is against the law because it is wrong; I know it is wrong because it is against the law."

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
In this case, the main claim being asserted is:
- *P: Smoking pot is against the law.*

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason given for this proposition is:
- *R: Because it is wrong.*

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
The proof provided for the reason is:
- *PR: I know it is wrong because it is against the law.*

### Step 4: Classify Argument Defects
Next, we need to check which of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) fits the argument structure identified.

Here is the breakdown:
- **Generalization (<G>):** Not applicable, since there is no generalization based on a part to the whole.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Not applicable, no complete enumeration claimed.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This is not fitting because the reason given is conclusive in its circularity.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The reasoning here is not about weak causal basis but about circular logic.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason appears to state the same information as the proposition itself. 
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Not applicable, no presumption of universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** No ambiguous language here.

The most fitting defective argument type is:
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The string essentially presents the reason in a circular manner, making it a repetition of the proposition rather than providing a true causal basis.

Therefore, applying *IDAA* to "Smoking pot is against the law because it is wrong; I know it is wrong because it is against the law," the string is classified as **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**.
