For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as a particular defective argument type), we need to break down the classification process into specific steps and then apply those steps to the given statement:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**
- This is the assertion or claim that is being made in the argument.

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)**
- This is the causal basis which supports the Proposition.

**Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**
- This provides additional arguments or evidence to support the Reason.

**Step 4: Compare the argument components (P, R, PR) to the definitions of various defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP)**
- This step involves analyzing each component to see if it fits any of the defective argument types.

**Step 5: Make the classification**
- Based on the comparisons, classify the argument into one of the defective argument types.

Now, let's apply these steps to the given statement:

"President Bennett is an effective communicator, because he has a natural talent for speaking with people."

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**
- "President Bennett is an effective communicator."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)**
- "Because he has a natural talent for speaking with people."

**Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**
- There is no additional proof or supporting arguments provided in the statement.

**Step 4: Compare the argument components (P, R, PR) to the defective argument types**

- **Generalization (G)**: This doesn't seem to be a generalization since it doesn't make an assertion based on a part or majority and apply it to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument doesn't claim to have enumerated all possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided ("he has a natural talent for speaking with people") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. Just having a natural talent doesn't necessarily mean one is effective in all communication contexts.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis here (natural talent for speaking) may not be compelling enough to establish that he is an effective communicator in all necessary aspects of his role.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason given is not merely a repetition of the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There is no indication that the proof or reason is assumed on the ground of universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language in the statement seems specific and not inherently ambiguous.

**Step 5: Make the classification**

The given argument best fits the definition of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. The reason provided ("he has a natural talent for speaking with people") does not conclusively demonstrate that "President Bennett is an effective communicator." Having a natural talent for speaking with people doesn't necessarily cover all aspects of effective communication, such as clarity, persuasion, appropriateness to context, etc.

Thus, the classification for the given statement is **<IR>**: Inconclusive Reason.
