For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "If you don’t give me a passing grade, I won’t get accepted to medical school. That will break my grandmother’s heart.", we need to decompose the task <IDA> (the classification of the argument as one of the defective argument types) into specific steps. Let's proceed with the decomposition and subsequent classification.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D> for <IDA>):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   Determine what is being asserted or claimed by the statement.
   
2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   Determine the causal basis for the proposition set forth.

3. **Check for Proof of Reason (PR):**
   Analyze if there's any additional argument that corroborates the reason.

4. **Classify the Argument Type:**
   Compare the identified components with the definitions of defective arguments to classify them appropriately.

### Applying the Steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   The statement can be broken into two assertions:
   - "If you don’t give me a passing grade, I won’t get accepted to medical school."
   - "That will break my grandmother’s heart."

   The initial proposition (P) seems to be that the speaker’s rejection from medical school will break their grandmother’s heart.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   The given reason (R) is:
   - "If you don’t give me a passing grade, I won’t get accepted to medical school."

   This reason links the passing grade directly to acceptance in medical school, which in turn is linked to the emotional state of the grandmother.

3. **Check for Proof of Reason (PR):**
   There is no further argument presented to independently corroborate the reason that being rejected from medical school will break the grandmother’s heart. No further proof is provided for the reasons themselves.

4. **Classify the Argument Type:**
   We now need to compare the components to the definitions of defective arguments:
   - Generalization (<G>): Not applicable, as it doesn't generalize a single instance to all.
   - Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>): Not applicable, as it’s not enumerating all possibilities.
   - Inconclusive Reason (<IR>): Examining the reason "If you don’t give me a passing grade, I won’t get accepted to medical school," it's not necessarily conclusive since many factors contribute to medical school acceptance beyond a single grade.
   - Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>): Claiming rejection from medical school based solely on one grade being insufficient suggests that the reason has an insufficient causal basis.
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>): Not applicable, as the reason and proposition are not repeating precisely the same statement.
   - Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>): Not applicable, the argument does not claim universal agreement.
   - Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>): Not applicable, the language is clear in its intent.

### Conclusion:
The argument seems to fit best with **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the reason given ("If you don’t give me a passing grade, I won’t get accepted to medical school") does not conclusively prove the proposition (that failing the course will solely result in non-acceptance into medical school). There are typically many more factors involved in medical school acceptance beyond a single grade.

Therefore, the argument is classified as **<IR>**.
