For 
To apply the IDAA (application of task decomposition) to classify the given argument "Ghosts exist.... because I saw a ghost in my closet," as a specific defective argument type (IDA), we need to break down the task into specific steps. Let's proceed step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P) and Reason (R) in the Argument
1. **Proposition (P)**: "Ghosts exist."
2. **Reason (R)**: "I saw a ghost in my closet."

### Step 2: Determine if the Argument Contains Additional Proof of Reason (PR)
In this example, the argument does not provide additional proof beyond the reason given. It is a simple argument with just a proposition and reason.

### Step 3: Analyze the Reason in Relation to the Proposition
Examine whether the reason given logically supports the proposition. 

### Step 4: Match the Defective Argument Type
Refer to the definitions of defective arguments and see which one best fits:

- **Generalization (G)**: The proposition is based on one individual's experience ("I saw a ghost in my closet") and is generalized to all ("Ghosts exist").

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This doesn't fit as there's no claim of covering all possibilities.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason doesn’t conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition; one sighting doesn’t prove the existence of all ghosts.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis (sighting a ghost in a closet) is weak in proving the existence of ghosts in general terms.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason is not a repetition of the proposition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There is no mention of a universal agreement.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language doesn't appear to have ambiguous terms affecting the argument.

### Step 5: Classify the Specific Defective Argument Type
Based on the analysis, multiple defects could theoretically apply, but we need the most fitting one:
- The argument predominantly fits the **Generalization (G)** type.

### Conclusion
By the process of decomposition, analyzing the components, and comparing with the definitions of defective arguments, the example "Ghosts exist.... because I saw a ghost in my closet," is an instance of the logical fallacy of **Generalization (G)**.
