For 
To apply the IDAA (application of task decomposition to the task of classifying the argument) process to the given string "Eugene is silly in class. Harry is his friend, so Harry must be silly, too.", we need to follow a structured approach to identify which type of defective argument (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, or DEP) it represents.

**Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of IDA:**

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - What is the main assertion or claim being made?

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - What is the causal basis or reasoning given to support the main claim?

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - What additional arguments or evidence are provided to corroborate the Reason?

4. **Classify the Argument:**
   - Compare the identified parts against the definitions of defective argument types to determine the classification.

**Applying these steps to the string:**

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - "Harry must be silly."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - "Harry is Eugene's friend."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - There is no additional specific evidence given beyond the friendship.

4. **Classify the Argument:**
   - The proposition asserts that just because Harry is friends with Eugene, Harry also possesses the trait of silliness.
   - This relies on the assumption that traits are shared due to the friendship without any evidence of a causal basis or proof.
   - Based on the provided definitions, this appears to be a Generalization (<G>). The argument generalizes the trait of one individual (Eugene being silly) to another individual (Harry) based on their friendship without any specific proof that being a friend causes or implies having the same trait.

Therefore, the argument "Eugene is silly in class. Harry is his friend, so Harry must be silly, too." is classified as <G> (Generalization).
