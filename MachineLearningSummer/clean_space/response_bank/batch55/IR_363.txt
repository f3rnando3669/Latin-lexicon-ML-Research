To apply IDAA to the conversation between Jack and Nick, we need to decompose the task of classifying the defective argument (IDA) into specific steps (D). Here's a step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
1. Examine the statements to identify the main claim:
   - Jack: "I have tiny, invisible unicorns living in my anus." 
     - This is the Proposition (<P>).

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
2. Examine the statements to identify the reason that supports the Proposition:
   - Jack: "Can you prove that I don't?" (as a form of reasoning for his claim).

### Step 3: Assess the Reason to Determine its Type
3. Analyze the type of reasoning used:
   - Jack's reasoning is essentially: Nick cannot disprove the existence of unicorns in Jack's anus, therefore the unicorns exist.

### Step 4: Classify the Reason's Adequacy
4. Determine if the Reason (<R>) adequately supports the Proposition (<P>):
   - Jack's reasoning relies on the fact that the inability to disprove something does not inherently prove it (i.e., it shifts the burden of proof).

### Step 5: Identify Potential Defective Argument Types
5. Compare the reasoning pattern with the defined defective argument types:
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
     - Here, the inability to disprove a claim does not constitute concrete proof.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This does not apply here because consensus or universal agreement is not mentioned.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason is not a restatement of the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal basis is the absence of disproof, which isn't a compelling causal relationship.
   
In this context, the argument is primarily dealing with the issue of not providing a conclusive reason to support the proposition. Therefore, it is an <IR> type of defective argument.

### Step 6: Final Classification
6. Based on the analysis, the string "Jack: I have tiny, invisible unicorns living in my anus.

Nick: How do you figure?

Jack: Can you prove that I don't?

Nick: No.

Jack: Then I do." is classified as <IR>.

### Conclusion
Applying IDAA to the given dialogue, we conclude that it is an Inconclusive Reason (<IR>) defective argument. Jack's assertion ("I have tiny, invisible unicorns living in my anus") is based on the fallacious reasoning that something must be true if it cannot be disproven. This does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
