For 
To apply IDAA (the application of the decomposition of a task into specific steps) to IDA (the task of classifying the given string as a certain type of defective argument), we follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (\<P>)**: Determine what is being set forth summarily as the intent to prove.
2. **Identify the Reason (\<R>)**: Determine the causal basis provided for the Proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\<PR>)**: Identify if there's any supporting argument or evidence given to corroborate the Reason.
4. **Classify the Defective Argument**: Use the identified Proposition, Reason, and Proof of Reason to classify the argument as one of the defective types (\<G>, \<FE>, \<IR>, \<RR>, \<WCB>, \<FU>, \<DEP>).

Now, let's apply these steps to the given string: "Yes, I do think that all drunk drivers should go to prison, but your honor, he is my son!  He is a good boy who just made a mistake!"

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Proposition (\<P>)**:
   - Proposition: "All drunk drivers should go to prison."

2. **Identify the Reason (\<R>)**:
   - Reason: "He is my son and he is a good boy who just made a mistake."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\<PR>)**:
   - There is no additional supporting argument or evidence offered. The statement relies on the assertion that being "my son" and "a good boy who just made a mistake" itself should serve as the basis.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument**:
   - The causal basis (\<R>) does not align with proving the Proposition (\<P>). The argument hinges on the emotional appeal and special pleading for leniency based on personal relation (he is my son), rather than providing a logical, compelling reason why the general rule of "all drunk drivers should go to prison" should not apply to this specific case.
   
   - This fits the defective argument type of Inconclusive Reason (\<IR>): The Reason provided ("He is my son! He is a good boy who just made a mistake!") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition ("All drunk drivers should go to prison").

### Conclusion:
By following the decomposition of the task into specific steps (IDAA), we classify the given string as an example of the defective argument type \<IR> (Inconclusive Reason). The Reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate why the Proposition should be exempted for this particular individual.
