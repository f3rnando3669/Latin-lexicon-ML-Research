For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument into specific steps) to the given statement "It is warmer this year in Las Vegas as compared to last year; therefore, global warming is rapidly accelerating," we need to follow a systematic approach to classify the argument into one of the defined types of defective arguments. 

Here's the step-by-step decomposition:

### Step 1: Identify and Analyze the Proposition (P)
- **Proposition (P):** "Global warming is rapidly accelerating."

### Step 2: Identify and Analyze the Reason (R)
- **Reason (R):** "It is warmer this year in Las Vegas as compared to last year."

### Step 3: Determine the Type of Defective Argument
- **Check for Generalization (G):** Is the proposition (P) a broad assertion based on limited evidence?
  - Yes. The statement takes the observation of warmer weather in one specific location (Las Vegas) and asserts a global phenomenon (global warming is rapidly accelerating). This is not necessarily applicable to all and is referred to all.
  
- **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Does the proposition claim to enumerate all possibilities but miss some pertinent ones?
  - No. The argument does not claim to enumerate all possibilities; instead, it generalizes a phenomenon based on a single observation. 
  
- **Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the proposition?
  - Partially. The reason provided (temperature observation in Las Vegas) is insufficient to conclusively prove the entire proposition, but the main issue here is more about generalization.

- **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the causal basis submitted for the proposition not compelling?
  - Yes. The observation of warmer weather in a single location does not provide a compelling causal basis for the global phenomenon being asserted.

- **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Is the reason simply a repetition of the proposition?
  - No. The reason is not merely repeating the proposition; it provides a specific observation.

- **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Is the proof of reason based on assumed consensus?
  - No. This argument does not assume a consensus.

- **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Is there ambiguity in the use of language?
  - No. The language is clear, even if the reasoning is flawed.

### Step 4: Conclusion
- The argument is classified as **Generalization (G)** because it generalizes an observation from a single place and time (Las Vegas temperature) to make a broad statement about a worldwide phenomenon (global warming accelerating).

**Final Classification:** Generalization (G)
