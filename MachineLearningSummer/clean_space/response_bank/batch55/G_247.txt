To apply the task of decomposing and classifying the argument "All women are bad drivers" into specific steps as defined by <IDAA>, we would proceed as follows:

1. **Understand the Argument**: First, we need to comprehend the statement thoroughly.
   
   - **Proposition (P)**: "All women are bad drivers."
   
2. **Identify the Type of Defective Argument**: We need to evaluate the statement to determine which type of argumentative defect it falls under. The possible categories are Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

3. **Evaluate Each Defective Argument Type**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: Check if the statement makes a conclusion about all individuals based on an observation of some or a majority of individuals.

     - **Inspection**: The statement asserts that "All women are bad drivers," making a sweeping claim about all women based on insufficient evidence or limited observation.
     - **Conclusion**: This fits the definition of Generalization.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Assess if the statement makes a claim of completeness without considering all possibilities.

     - **Inspection**: The statement is not presenting an incomplete list but rather a categorical assertion about all individuals in a group.
     - **Conclusion**: This isn't a case of Incomplete Enumeration.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Look for a reason given to support the proposition that does not conclusively demonstrate its correctness.

     - **Inspection**: The given argument lacks any reasoning to support the proposition, making assessment impractical.
     - **Conclusion**: This is not applicable since no reason is provided.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Determine if the reason given is weak and does not compellingly support the proposition.

     - **Inspection**: The statement does not provide a reason to inspect.
     - **Conclusion**: This is not applicable in the absence of reasoning.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Check if the reason given merely repeats the proposition without adding anything new.

     - **Inspection**: No reason exists in the statement to verify repetition.
     - **Conclusion**: This is not applicable due to lack of reasoning.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Examine if there is an assumption of universal agreement on a point still in dispute.

     - **Inspection**: The statement does not presume universal agreement.
     - **Conclusion**: This does not fit the Presumptuous Consensus type.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: See if the statement contains any ambiguous language where terms can be interpreted differently than intended by the speaker.

     - **Inspection**: The language used is clear without multiple interpretations.
     - **Conclusion**: This is not applicable to Ambiguous Language Use.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - **Final Classification**: The statement "All women are bad drivers" is best classified as a Generalization (<G>).

Therefore, by decomposing the advanced task of identifying the argument type step by step, we determine that the given statement falls under the category of Generalization (<G>).
