For 
To apply IDAA, we need to break down the task of classifying the given statement into specific steps and then execute these steps to identify which type of defective argument the statement represents.

The given statement is: "Girls should not be allowed to try out as kickers for school football teams because girls are not very athletic."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) for IDA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - Find the key assertion or claim in the statement.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - Determine what is given as the causal basis justifying the Proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Reason (R) for Common Defective Types**:
   - Check for Generalization (G).
   - Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE).
   - Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR).
   - Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).
   - Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR).
4. **Identify Possible Defect in Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   - Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU).
   - Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

### Executing the Steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - Proposition (P): "Girls should not be allowed to try out as kickers for school football teams."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - Reason (R): "because girls are not very athletic."

3. **Evaluate the Reason (R) for Common Defective Types**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: 
     - The statement asserts that "girls are not very athletic." This seems to generalize the athletic abilities of all girls based on either a stereotypical view or a non-representative sample.
     - The Reason (R) implies a characteristic (lack of athleticism) that is generalized to all girls to support the Proposition (P).
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
     - This doesn't apply here because the Reason (R) does not involve enumeration of all possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
     - The Reason (R) provided ("girls are not very athletic") is a conclusion based on a broad generalization that does not provide a conclusive basis for the Proposition (P).
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
     - This may also apply as the Reason (R) ("girls are not very athletic") does not provide a compelling causal basis for the Proposition (P), especially considering that some girls could indeed be athletic and capable of being kickers.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
     - This does not apply here because the Reason (R) and Proposition (P) are not identical.

4. **Identify Possible Defect in Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
     - The statement does not assume a consensus.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
     - There is no ambiguity in the language used in the Reason (R).

### Conclusion of IDAA:

The given statement mainly suffers from **Generalization (G)** as it makes a sweeping claim about the athletic abilities of all girls without any supporting evidence or acknowledging individual differences. It could also potentially suffer from **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, as the Reason does not compellingly justify the Proposition.
