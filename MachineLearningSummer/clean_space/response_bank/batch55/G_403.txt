To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the classification task into specific steps) to the given string "I have one Japanese friend and it's true that all of them are numb," we'll break down the process step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Proposition <P>
The proposition <P> in the argument is the statement we intend to prove. Let's identify it in the given string:

**Proposition (P):** "all of them are numb"

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
The reason <R> sets forth the causal basis for <P> and seeks to establish the truth of what we are urging. Let's identify it in the given string:

**Reason (R):** "I have one Japanese friend"

### Step 3: Analyze the Proof of the Reason <PR>
While <PR> corroborates <R> by means of additional arguments, this step does not seem relevant here because there are no additional arguments presented beyond the reason.

### Step 4: Check for Defective Argument Types
Now we classify the argument based on the defective argument definitions provided. We must determine whether <P> and <R> form a faulty reasoning pattern as per any of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP).

### Step 4.1: Generalization (G)
A Generalization occurs when an assertion about a part or a majority is inaccurately applied to all. Letâ€™s see if this fits our string:

**Assertion in <R>:** "I have one Japanese friend"
**Application in <P>:** "all of them are numb"

The reasoning in the string is a clear case of taking a single instance ("one Japanese friend") and erroneously generalizing it to an entire group ("all of them"). Hence, this argument fits the type <G>.

### Step 5: Conclusion
Having analyzed the proposition and reason identified in the string, and checked against the defective argument types, we conclude that the argument is a:

**Defective Argument Type (G):** Generalization

By following the decomposed steps, we systematically identified that the string "I have one Japanese friend and it's true that all of them are numb" should be classified as a Generalization.
