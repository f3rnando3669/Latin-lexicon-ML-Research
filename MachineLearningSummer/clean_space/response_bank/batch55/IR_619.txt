For 
To apply \(IDAA\) to the statement "Have you stopped cheating on tests? To answer yes means you cheated before. To answer no means you continue to cheat," we follow the decomposition of the advanced task \(IDA\) into specific steps \(D\). Here is the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\(P\))
**Proposition:** The statement "Have you stopped cheating on tests?" attempts to set forth the premise that the respondent has cheated on tests at some point.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\(R\))
**Reason:** The follow-up explanations:
- "To answer yes means you cheated before."
- "To answer no means you continue to cheat."

These reasons intend to establish the truth of the Proposition by framing the response to the initial question.

### Step 3: Analyze the Reason (\(R\))
Assess if the Reason provided satisfactorily supports the Proposition.

### Step 4: Identify the Proof of Reason (\(PR\))
Determine if additional arguments are provided to corroborate the Reason offered, enhancing its force.

### Step 5: Check for Defective Arguments
Examine if the argument fits any of the predefined defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (\(G\))**: Not applicable in this case.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\(FE\))**: Not applicable in this case, as it does not involve the enumeration of possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (\(IR\))**: Not applicable directly but should be considered.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(WCB\))**: The causal basis for presuming the respondent's guilt is logically flawed.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(RR\))**: Not applicable here.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\(FU\))**: Not applicable in this case.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\(DEP\))**: The statement inherently creates ambiguity by forcing a false dichotomy.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- The proposition "Have you stopped cheating on tests?" implicitly assumes that the respondent has cheated, without providing any external proof or context for this assumption.
  
- The statement frames a loaded question, where any binary answer (yes/no) incriminates the respondent in cheating either past or present. 

### Determining the Defective Argument Type:
The statement is best classified as using **Ambiguous Language Use (\(DEP\))**, as it relies on a loaded question that inherently creates ambiguity, trapping the respondent in an assumptive dilemma.

### Final Classification:
Applying \(IDAA\) to the statement, it can be classified as a defective argument of type \(DEP\) due to the ambiguous use of language through a loaded question that falsely constrains the respondent to self-incrimination in a misleading manner.
