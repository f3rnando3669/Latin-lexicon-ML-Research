For 
To apply the process of <IDAA> (the application of the decomposition of <IDA> into specific steps) to the argument "If everyone believes it, you should too!", we will first decompose <IDA> into its constituent steps and then apply those steps to classify the given argument. 

Decomposition <IDA> into Steps (Task <D>):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine the main claim or proposition being made in the argument.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine the reason or causal basis given for the proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Reason (<R>):**
   - Assess whether the reason satisfactorily establishes the truth of the proposition.
4. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Determine if there is additional argumentation provided to substantiate the reason.
5. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:**
   - Match the argument to one of the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP> based on the evaluation from the previous steps.

Now, apply these steps to "If everyone believes it, you should too!":

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition (<P>): "You should believe it."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason (<R>): "Everyone believes it."

3. **Evaluate the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason provided is: "Everyone believes it."
   - Assessing this, the reason relies on the idea that universal belief is sufficient justification for individual belief.

4. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Proof of Reason (<PR>): The argument does not provide additional argumentation to substantiate the reason.

5. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:**
   - The given argument assumes that the broad acceptance of an idea (universal belief) is a sufficient and compelling reason for an individual to accept the same idea without additional justification or evidence.
   - This aligns with the defective argument type: **<FU> - Presumptuous Consensus.**
   - This is because the argument presupposes the correctness of the proposition based on its alleged universal acceptance, which is still a matter of dispute and lacks independent confirmation.

Thus, the correct classification of the argument "If everyone believes it, you should too!" is:
**<FU> - Presumptuous Consensus.**
