For 
To apply the IDAA (decomposition task) to IDA (argument classification task) for the statement "Unfair judgement of people based on looks, belief, or ethnic background," we will break down the task into specific steps, identify which type of defective argument (if any) the statement falls under, and then finally classify it.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of IDA:

1. **Extract the proposition (P) from the statement.**
2. **Identify the reasoning (R) behind the proposition.**
3. **Check for any proof of reason (PR) if provided.**
4. **Analyze if the identified proposition, reason, and proof of reason match any of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP).**

### Step 1: Extract the Proposition (P)

The proposition here is "Unfair judgement of people based on looks, belief, or ethnic background."

### Step 2: Identify the Reasoning (R)

The statement does not provide explicit reasoning or a causal basis for why it claims such judgments are unfair. Therefore, we need to infer that the implied reason is that such judgments are inherently unjust or prejudiced without providing evidence.

### Step 3: Check for any Proof of Reason (PR)

No additional proof or evidence is provided within the statement to corroborate the implied reason.

### Step 4: Analyze for Defective Argument Types

1. **Generalization (G):** The statement does not generalize from one part to a whole but states it as a blanket proposition.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The statement doesn't enumerate possibilities but makes a generalized assertion.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The implied reason does not conclusively demonstrate that the judgment is unfair; it states it without substantial evidence.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis for calling the judgment "unfair" isn't provided or weak since it's not directly addressed or evidenced.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The statement does not repeat the proposition as the reason.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The statement does not assume consensus.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The statement is fairly clear in its language and context.

Given the analysis, we identify that the statement primarily lacks strong reasoning and corroborative evidence, making it fit most closely with types IR and WCB.

### Classification (IDA)

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason behind the proposition (that such judgments are unfair) is not conclusively demonstrated.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The statement does not provide a compelling causal basis for the assertion that the judgment is unfair.

Thus, the statement "Unfair judgement of people based on looks, belief, or ethnic background" most likely fits the defective argument types Inconclusive Reason (IR) and Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).
