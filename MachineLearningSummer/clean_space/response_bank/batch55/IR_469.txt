For 
To apply <IDAA> to "I don't think that there should be marriage among homosexuals. Anyway, taxes on married people are high. I think that taxes on the married are just ridiculous." we need to decompose the task of classifying the string into specific steps, and then execute those steps.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Execution

#### Step 1: Identify Proposition and Reason
1. **Proposition (\<P\>):** This is the primary assertion or claim made in the argument.
   - In our case, the proposition appears to be: "I don't think that there should be marriage among homosexuals."
2. **Reason (\<R\>):** This is the basis or justification given for the proposition.
   - In our case, the reasons cited are: "Anyway, taxes on married people are high" and "I think that taxes on the married are just ridiculous."
   
#### Step 2: Analyze the Type of Reason
3. **Reason Analysis:** Determine the strength and relevance of the reason provided in relation to the proposition.
   - The reason given about taxes on married people being high and ridiculous does not directly support or relate to the proposition of marriage among homosexuals.
   
#### Step 3: Classify Defective Argument
4. **Classify the Defect:**
   - **\(\<G\>: Generalization\):** The argument is not generalizing from a specific part to the whole.
   - **\(\<FE\>: Incomplete Enumeration\):** The argument isn't claiming to have considered all possibilities.
   - **\(\<IR\>: Inconclusive Reason\):** The reason does not conclusively establish the claim.
     - This seems to apply, as the proposed justification about taxes does not logically support the claim about homosexual marriage.
   - **\(\<RR\>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition\):** The reason isn't just rephrasing the proposition.
   - **\(\<WCB\>: Insufficient Causal Basis\):** The reason given is weak, but here it's more about relevance than insufficient causation.
   - **\(\<FU\>: Presumptuous Consensus\):** The argument doesn't assume a universally agreed-upon statement.
   - **\(\<DEP\>: Ambiguous Language Use\):** There's no evident ambiguity in language usage here.

Based on this analysis, the argument falls into the category of:
- **\(\<IR\>: Inconclusive Reason\)**
  - The reason related to taxes on married people does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition about marriage among homosexuals.

### Conclusion
The defective argument type for the provided string "I don't think that there should be marriage among homosexuals. Anyway, taxes on married people are high. I think that taxes on the married are just ridiculous." is classified as **\(\<IR\>: Inconclusive Reason\)**.
