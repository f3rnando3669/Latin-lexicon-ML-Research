To apply the decomposition of the task (IDAA) to classify the string "Earthquakes are caused when the plates of the Earth's crust move. Earthquakes happen along 'fault lines' in the earth’s crust. When the plates in the Earth suddenly shift, the Earth will begin to shift, shake or tremble" and identify the central idea, let's break it down step-by-step. Here's the decomposition:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The proposition is the central claim or assertion that the argument aims to establish.

- **Proposition (P)**: Earthquakes are caused when the plates of the Earth's crust move.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason sets forth the causal basis for the proposition, providing support to establish the truth of the proposition.

- **Reason (R)**: Earthquakes happen along "fault lines" in the earth’s crust. When the plates in the Earth suddenly shift, the Earth will begin to shift, shake or tremble.

### Step 3: Classify any Defective Elements
Now, we will classify whether any parts of this argument have the characteristics of a defective argument type. We'll assess the provided Reason for any defects like Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

- **Evaluation of R**:
  - "Earthquakes happen along 'fault lines' in the earth’s crust." → This statement is generally accepted based on geological science and does not appear defective.
  - "When the plates in the Earth suddenly shift, the Earth will begin to shift, shake or tremble." → This connects the movement of plates directly to the physical manifestation of earthquakes.

Given the above, each part of the Reason seems to directly and factually support the Proposition without falling into any of the defective argument categories.

### Step 4: Determine the Presence of Proof of Reason (PR)
The text provided does not explicitly elaborate further arguments that corroborate the Reason with additional evidence. We should look at deeper details or examples if they were given, but in this case, additional arguments are not presented.

### Step 5: Analyze for the Central Idea
Finally, summing up from the presented P and R, the central idea can be deduced.

- **Central Idea**: The movement of the plates of the Earth's crust causes earthquakes, which primarily occur along fault lines.

### Conclusion
The decomposition steps helped us systematically analyze the argument. We identified the central idea: earthquakes are caused by the movement of the Earth's crust along fault lines.

There does not appear to be any defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP) present in the given string. This completes the IDAA application to classify the provided string and identify the central idea.
