For 
To apply `IDAA` to the sentence "Where did you hide the marijuana you were smoking?" we need to decompose the task `IDA` into specific steps (`D`) and then apply these steps to classify the given string.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (`D`) for `IDA`:

1. **Identify the Proposition (`P`)**: Determine the main claim or assertion in the string.
2. **Identify the Reason (`R`)**: Look for the causal basis or rationale provided for the proposition.
3. **Determine if there is Proof of Reason (`PR`)**: Identify any supporting arguments backing up the reason.
4. **Check for Argument Defects**: Compare the identified components with the definitions of defective argument types (`G`, `FE`, `IR`, `RR`, `WCB`, `FU`, `DEP`).

### Applying the Decomposition Steps to the String:
 
1. **Identify the Proposition (`P`)**:
   - The proposition (`P`) here is implicit. The question presupposes that the listener was smoking marijuana and that it was hidden. Therefore, the assertion (`P`) could be interpreted as: "You were smoking marijuana and hid it."

2. **Identify the Reason (`R`)**:
   - The reason (`R`) in the question is not explicitly given. However, the phrase "where did you hide" implies that there is an assumption or pretext that the listener has indeed hidden marijuana after smoking it. This assumption is embedded in the construction of the question.

3. **Determine if there is Proof of Reason (`PR`)**:
   - This question does not provide any additional arguments or proof (`PR`). It merely assumes the proposition is true based on the premise implied in the question itself.

4. **Check for Argument Defects**:
   - The question presupposes something controversial or unproven within its structure, leading us to inspect for potential flaws:
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (`FU`)**: The string assumes that it is a known fact ("universally agreed upon") that the person being questioned was smoking marijuana, which is still in dispute.
     - **Ambiguous Language Use (`DEP`)**: There is some level of ambiguity regarding the activity being addressed without any preliminary context, but not strictly altering the meaning in a different sense than intended.
     - **Other Defects**: The line might also suffer from a form of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (`RR`)** in combining assertion (smoking marijuana) and the act of hiding it as an implied truth within the question.

Analyzing them closely, the most fitting classification would be:
- **Presumptuous Consensus (`FU`)**: The question presumes as a certainty that marijuana has been smoked and hidden, which are assumptions still in dispute and not established.

Therefore, the defective argument in "Where did you hide the marijuana you were smoking?" is best classified as:
- **Presumptuous Consensus (`FU`)**.
