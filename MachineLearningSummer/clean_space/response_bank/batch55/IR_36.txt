For 
To apply the task of <IDAA> to classify the argument "Stephen Hawking is the smartest scientist on the planet, so if he says global warming is real, it must be true!", we need to decompose the task into specific steps and follow each accordingly.

### Step 1: Break down the proposition and reason
**Proposition (P):** "Global warming is real."
**Reason (R):** "Stephen Hawking is the smartest scientist on the planet, so if he says global warming is real, it must be true!"

### Step 2: Assess the argument type
We now need to determine if this argument corresponds to one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

1. **Generalization (G):** The argument does not rely on a general assertion applied to all.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument does not claim to have listed all possible reasons.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This seems likely. Stephen Hawking's intelligence and expertise do not conclusively prove the reality of global warming; the truth of global warming should be established through scientific data and consensus, not solely by authority.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This could also apply. The causal basis (Stephen Hawking's intelligence) is not compelling enough to establish the truth of the proposition on its own.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason is not repeating the proposition verbatim.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument does not claim universal consensus.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language in the argument is not ambiguous.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Based on this assessment, the argument can primarily be classified as:
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** because the reason (Stephen Hawking's intelligence) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (global warming is real).
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)** because relying solely on the authority of Stephen Hawking is not a sufficiently compelling reason to establish the proposition.

The final classification for the string "Stephen Hawking in the smartest scientist on the planet, so if he says global warming is real, it must be true!" is **<IR>** and **<WCB>**.
