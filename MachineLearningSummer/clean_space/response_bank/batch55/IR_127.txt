For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of <D> to <IDA>) to the string "Distracting your audience from the original issue by introducing an irrelevant topic," we break down the task <IDA> (classifying the string type) into specific steps and then proceed step by step.

### Step 1: Understanding the Types of Defective Arguments

We need a clear understanding of each defective argument type defined:
1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Making an assertion applicable to all based on a subset.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Claiming completeness but missing some possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Reason does not convincingly support the proposition.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Weak causal basis for the proposition.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Reason is the same as the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Assuming universal agreement on a disputed proposition.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Proposition could be interpreted differently than intended.

### Step 2: Interpreting the String

The string "Distracting your audience from the original issue by introducing an irrelevant topic" seems to describe a particular method of argument, rather than stating an argument by itself. 

### Step 3: Analyzing the String

- **Key Concept**: The string involves introducing an irrelevant topic to distract from the original issue.
- **Nature of the Defect**: This does not directly fit into any of the specific defective argument types listed above (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

### Step 4: Mapping to Defective Argument Types

- **Generalization (<G>)**: The string does not involve making generalizations.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The string does not involve enumerating possibilities incorrectly.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The string does not discuss the strength of the reason in supporting the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The string does not discuss a weak causal basis.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The string does not involve repeating the proposition as the reason.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The string does not involve assuming universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The string does not involve ambiguity of language.

### Step 5: Concluding the Classification

Based on the definitions provided, none of the types precisely match the description "Distracting your audience from the original issue by introducing an irrelevant topic." This description is more reflective of a logical fallacy known as a "red herring," which is not currently defined among the defective argument types.

### Final Conclusion

The string "Distracting your audience from the original issue by introducing an irrelevant topic" does not fit into any of the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP> as defined. Therefore, it appears to belong to an undefined category of argument flaws, specifically a logical fallacy known as a "red herring."
