For 
To apply \( IDAA \) (the application of decomposition \( D \) to the task of identifying defective arguments \( IDA \)), we need to systematically break down the classification task \( IDA \) into specific steps. The goal is to classify “Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way.” as one of the defective argument types: \( G \), \( FE \), \( IR \), \( RR \), \( WCB \), \( FU \), or \( DEP \).

Here is the step-by-step decomposition \( D \):

1. **Identify the Structure**:
   - Determine the \(\ <P>\ \) (Proposition), if any.
   - Determine the \(\ <R>\ \) (Reason), if any.
   - Determine the \(\ <PR>\ \) (Proof of Reason), if any.

2. **Analyze the Argument**:
   - Evaluate whether the \(\ <P>\ \) is a generalization (\( G \)).
   - Evaluate whether the \(\ <P>\ \) suffers from incomplete enumeration (\( FE \)).
   - Evaluate whether the \(\ <R>\ \) is inconclusive (\( IR \)).
   - Evaluate whether the \(\ <R>\ \) is just a repetition of the \(\ <P>\ (\( RR \)).
   - Evaluate whether the causal basis (\( R \)) is insufficient (\( WCB \)).
   - Evaluate whether the \(\ <PR>\ \) exhibits presumptuous consensus (\( FU \)).
   - Evaluate whether the \(\ <PR>\ \) uses ambiguous language (\( DEP \)).

3. **Classify the Argument**:
   - Based on the analysis in step 2, classify the argument into one of the defective argument types.

Let's apply this to the given statement:

1. **Identify the Structure**:
   - Proposition (\( P \)): The audience should become part of a group or act.
   - Reason (\( R \)): Because other people are acting in the same way.
   - Proof of Reason (\( PR \)): This isn’t concretely given in the statement but can be assumed as an appeal to the behavior of the group.

2. **Analyze the Argument**:
   - **Generalization (\( G \))**:
     - The statement doesn’t assert something about a group as a whole based on a part or majority, so it doesn’t fit \( G \).
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (\( FE \))**:
     - The statement doesn’t claim a complete enumeration; it focuses on the behavior of a group to justify action, so \( FE \) isn't applicable.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \))**:
     - The reason provided is a generalized social behavior (others are doing it), which is not a logical proof of the correctness or benefit of the action. This is closer to being an appeal to popularity.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( RR \))**:
     - The reason doesn’t simply repeat the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \))**:
     - The reason itself lacks a compelling causal linkage to the proposition. It suggests doing something because others are doing it, not necessarily a cause-effect relationship that justifies the action logically.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (\( FU \))**:
     - It implies a form of universal agreement because "others are doing it," suggesting it as a given fact, potentially still in dispute if others don't actually endorse it.
   - **Ambiguous Language (\( DEP \))**:
     - The language is straightforward and not ambiguous in this context.

3. **Classify the Argument**:
   - The primary defect appears to be \( FU \) (Presumptuous Consensus) because it assumes the action is validated by the consensus ("because other people are acting in the same way"), potentially without concrete proof that it is universally agreed upon or that it carries inherent value due to this agreement.

Therefore, the classification of the given statement is \( FU \) (Presumptuous Consensus).
