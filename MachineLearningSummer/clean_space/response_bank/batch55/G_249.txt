For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "Exercise is good. Therefore everybody should exercise. 'I agree,' said Polly earnestly. 'I mean exercise is wonderful. I mean it builds the body and everything,'" we will follow the process of decomposition <D> into specific steps:

### Step-by-step decomposition for <IDA> (Identification of Defective Arguments):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - **Definition:** A part of a complete argument called a Proposition (<P>) is a statement that sets forth summarily what we intend to prove.
   - **Identification in the string:** "Exercise is good." and "Everybody should exercise."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - **Definition:** A part of a complete argument called Reason (<R>) sets forth the causal basis for <P> establishing the truth of what we are urging.
   - **Identification in the string:** No explicit reason is given for "Everybody should exercise," but the implied reason could be the benefits of exercise (e.g., "it builds the body and everything").

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - **Definition:** A part of a complete argument called Proof of Reason (<PR>) corroborates, by means of additional arguments, the briefly presented Reason.
   - **Identification in the string:** "Exercise is wonderful. It builds the body and everything."

4. **Classify the type of defect in the argument (if any) according to the given definitions:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** Applying a proposition based on some part or majority to all.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Claiming to list all possibilities but missing some.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal basis is not compelling.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason repeats the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Assuming proof on the grounds of universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Using language that can be interpreted differently than intended.

### Applying <D> to <IDA>:

1. **Decompose the task:**
   - Identify the main argument's components.
   - Check each identified component against the definitions of defective arguments.
   - Classify the overall argument based on identified defects.

2. **Analyze the main parts of the string:**
   - Proposition (<P>): "Exercise is good." and "Everybody should exercise."
   - Reason (<R>): Implicit (exercise builds the body, etc.)
   - Proof of Reason (<PR>): "Exercise is wonderful. It builds the body and everything."

3. **Identify potential defective argument types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** "Everybody should exercise" based on "Exercise is good." - This involves generalizing the benefit of exercise to everyone without considering individual differences or contexts.

4. **Check for other defects:**
   - No Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>) appears since the argument doesn't list possibilities.
   - Potential Inconclusive Reason (<IR>): No explicit and concrete reason is provided. The benefit mentioned ("it builds the body") is not enough to demonstrate that everyone must exercise.
   - Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>): The reasoning is weak as it doesn't compellingly support that "everybody should exercise" (only vaguely states benefits).
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>): The reasoning "exercise builds the body" is quite close to repeating "exercise is wonderful," leading to repetitive reasoning.
   - Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>): Not explicitly used in the argument.
   - Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>): "Exercise is wonderful" and "It builds the body" are not ambiguous, but they may not be sufficiently precise.

5. **Conclude the classification:**
   - The primary defective argument type for the string appears to be **Generalization (<G>)** since it asserts that "everybody should exercise" based on a general benefit of exercise.

### Conclusion:

The given string's argument can primarily be classified under the defective argument type of **Generalization (<G>)**, with potential issues related to **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**, and **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**.
