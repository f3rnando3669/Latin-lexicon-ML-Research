For 
To apply \( IDAA \) (the application of \( D \) to \( IDA \)) on the string given, let's first decompose \( IDA \) (the task of classifying \( s \) into defective argument types) into specific logical steps that can be exhaustively and systematically followed.

### Decomposition \( D \) of \( IDA \):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine the main assertion or claim that is being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Determine the statement that supports or provides a basis for the proposition.
3. **Evaluate \( P \)**: Check the nature and validity of the proposition.
4. **Evaluate \( R \)**: Determine if the reason provided is logically sufficient and directly supports the proposition.
5. **Identify Proof of Reason (PR)**: Check if there is any supporting argument or evidence for the reason given.
6. **Classify Defects**: Assess if any defective argument types \( G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP \) apply.
   
Let's apply these steps to the given string:

### Step-by-Step Application of \( IDAA \):

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition \( (P) \)
"Of course I can read Spanish! Look, I just finished this book by Jorge Luis Borges!"

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason \( (R) \)
"Look, I just finished this book by Jorge Luis Borges!"

#### Step 3: Evaluate \( P \)
The claim is that the person can read Spanish.

#### Step 4: Evaluate \( R \)
The reason provided is reading a book by Jorge Luis Borges, which is intended to demonstrate Spanish reading ability.

#### Step 5: Identify Proof of Reason \( (PR) \)
There is no additional corroborative evidence or argument provided to back up the reason.

### Step 6: Classify Defects:

1. **Generalization (G)**: Does not apply. The \( P \) is not generalized from a part to a whole.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Does not apply. The \( P \) is not formed from an incomplete list.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Yes, it applies. The reason especially reads a Borges book (an Argentine author who writes mostly in Spanish) does not conclusively prove the ability to read Spanish since it's possible Borges' works were translated to another language, or the specific book might not have been written in Spanish.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Yes, it applies. The fact that Borges wrote in Spanish isnâ€™t a compelling reason that finishing a Borges book means understanding Spanish.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Does not apply. The Reason and Proposition are not circularly equivalent.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Does not apply. There is no claim of universal agreement.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Does not apply. There is no obvious ambiguity in the language that could be taken in another sense.

### Final Classification:
The defective argument types that fit are **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

So, \( IDAA \) applied to the string results in classification as both **\( IR \) and \( WCB \)**.
