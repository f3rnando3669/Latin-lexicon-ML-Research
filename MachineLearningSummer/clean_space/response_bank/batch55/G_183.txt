Sure, let's follow the steps of applying the decomposition of the advanced task (IDAA) to classify the given string under the different defective argument types.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (IDAA for IDA)
1. **Identify Proposition (\<P\>)**: Determine the main assertion of the argument.
   
2. **Identify Reason (\<R\>)**: Determine the causal basis or rationale given for the Proposition.

3. **Identify Proof of Reason (\<PR\>)**: Determine additional arguments used to support the Reason.

4. **Analyze for Defects**: Compare the argument against the known defective argument types (\<G\>, \<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<RR\>, \<WCB\>, \<FU\>, and \<DEP\>) to classify it.

### Applying IDAA to the Given String

**String to Analyze**: "Don't let your children stay up till midnight on New Year's Eve. Before you know it, they'll be demanding to stay up till midnight every night."

#### Step 1: Identify Proposition (\<P\>)
- **Proposition**: Don't let your children stay up till midnight on New Year's Eve.

#### Step 2: Identify Reason (\<R\>)
- **Reason**: Before you know it, they'll be demanding to stay up till midnight every night.

#### Step 3: Identify Proof of Reason (\<PR\>)
- **Proof of Reason**: Not explicitly provided. The argument mainly presents a causal reasoning without additional supporting proof.

#### Step 4: Analyze for Defects

- **Generalization (\<G\>)**: The argument suggests that allowing children to stay up one night will lead to them demanding it every night. This fits the pattern of taking one example and generalizing it to all cases.
  
  - **Reasoning Here**: One instance (staying up on New Year's Eve) is taken to predict a regular future behavior (staying up every night).

- **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)**: This does not seem to enumerate possibilities, thus doesn’t fit this category.
  
- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**: The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate that the initial proposition will indeed lead to the stated outcome. 

  - **Reasoning Here**: The cause (letting children stay up one night) does not necessarily lead to the effect (demanding to stay up every night).

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**: The causal link between letting children stay up one night and them demanding to stay up every night is not compelling.

  - **Reasoning Here**: The scenario presented fails to establish a strong, logical causal connection.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)**: The reason given here isn't just a repetition of the proposition. So, not relevant.
  
- **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)**: There isn't an appeal to universal agreement or commonly held belief here, so this type doesn’t apply.
  
- **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)**: The language in the statement appears clear and unambiguous.

### Conclusion
- The string is best classified primarily under:
  - **Generalization (\<G\>)**: It's taking a specific scenario (staying up on New Year's Eve) and generalizing it to suggest a broader behavior (staying up every night).
  - **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**: The reason provided does not conclusively support the proposition.
  - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**: The causal link presented in the reason lacks strength.

Hence, the argument "Don't let your children stay up till midnight on New Year's Eve. Before you know it, they'll be demanding to stay up till midnight every night." is primarily a **Generalization (\<G\>)**, and also contains aspects of **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**.
