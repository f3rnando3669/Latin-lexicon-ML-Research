For 
To apply the advanced task of IDAA to the string "Don't make me angry; you won't like me when I'm angry", we need to decompose the task of classifying this string into the specific steps required to identify which defective argument type it corresponds to. Here we go step by step:

### Step 1: Understanding the Argument

First, let's break down the statement "Don't make me angry; you won't like me when I'm angry." Here we have:

- Proposition (<P>): "Don't make me angry"
- Reason (<R>): "You won't like me when I'm angry."

### Step 2: Identify Potential Defective Argument Types

Next, consider each defective argument type definition:

- **Generalization (G)**: Refers to applying an assertion broadly based on a limited experience or evidence.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Implies claiming a complete set of possibilities when some are left out.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided does not conclusively prove the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The provided causal basis is not compelling.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason is merely a repetition of the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assuming something is true because it is "universally agreed upon."
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language in the proof could be understood in a different way than intended.

### Step 3: Analyze the Argument for Defective Types

- **Generalization (G)**: The argument does not seem to generalize a limited assertion to all cases, so it's likely not a case of Generalization.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not claim to have covered all possibilities, so it's unlikely to be an Incomplete Enumeration.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason "you won't like me when I'm angry" is a subjective assertion and might not be compelling to everyone, making it a potential case but not strongly conclusive.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: "You won't like me when I'm angry" does not provide a detailed causal link that specifies why the person would be unlikable when angry, so it fits well into this category.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason "you won't like me when I'm angry" essentially rephrases "don't make me angry" by stressing the consequence of anger, making it a repetition of the proposition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument does not rely on a presumed universal consensus, so it's unlikely this type.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language used here is clear in context and does not seem open to another interpretation.

### Step 4: Classification

Based on the analysis, the argument resembles predominantly **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** because the reason given fundamentally restates the proposition without adding substantive causal details. It also has traits of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because the causal basis given (dislike due to anger) is not factually compelling.

### Conclusion

Therefore, the string "Don't make me angry; you won't like me when I'm angry." can be classified as:

1. **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**
2. **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**

The primary classification would be **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)** with an additional note for **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)** due to the non-specific nature of the causal relationship.
