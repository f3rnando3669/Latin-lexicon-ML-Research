For 
To apply the process of <IDAA> to the given statement, we need to decompose the task into specific steps and then classify the given string as one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for <IDAA>

1. **Identify the Proposition and the Reason (if present):**
   - Look for a statement of what is intended to be proved (P).
   - Identify any reasoning provided to support the proposition (R).

2. **Examine the Reason:**
   - Check if the reason provides sufficient causal basis (WCB) or if it is merely a repetition of the proposition (RR).
   - Determine if the reason is inconclusive (IR).

3. **Check for Generalization and Enumeration Errors:**
   - Evaluate whether the proposition is a faulty generalization (G) from specific instances.
   - Determine if there are any claims of complete enumeration that miss pertinent possibilities (FE).

4. **Examine the Proof of Reason:**
   - Verify if any presumed consensus (PR) is used to support the reason without actual evidence (FU).
   - Check for ambiguous language that might be causing the argument to be taken in another sense than intended (DEP).

### Applying to the Given Statement

**Statement:** "The mother of a young child tells him to go to bed, and he begins to ask questions, say that he is hungry, or say that he needs to go to the bathroom-all to avoid bed and distract mom."

1. **Proposition (P):**
   - Implicitly, the proposition here is that the child is trying to avoid going to bed.

2. **Reason (R):**
   - The reason given is the child's behavior of asking questions, saying he is hungry, or needs to go to the bathroom.

3. **Examine the Reason for Defects:**
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The behavior of the child (asking questions, saying he's hungry, etc.) does not conclusively prove he is avoiding bed; these reasons might be legitimate needs.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** There is a weak causal link between the child's actions and the conclusion that he is trying to avoid bed. The reasons provided are not compelling enough to establish the proposition firmly.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason does not simply repeat the proposition.

4. **Check for Generalization and Enumeration Errors:**
   - **Generalization (G):** The argument is not generalizing from a part to the whole; it is specific to this child.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** There is no claim of having made a complete enumeration of possibilities.

5. **Examine Proof of Reason:**
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There is no indication of an assumed universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language is fairly clear and does not seem ambiguous.

### Conclusion

The defective argument type that best fits the given statement is <IR> (Inconclusive Reason). The behavior of the child provided as the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition that the child is trying to avoid going to bed.

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the given string classifies it as:

**Type: <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**.
