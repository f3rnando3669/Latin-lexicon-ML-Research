For 
To apply IDAA to the argument "The universe has a beginning. Every thing that has a beginning has a cause. Therefore, the universe has a cause called God.", we need to perform the task of IDA (classifying the argument as one of the defective argument types) by decomposing it into specific steps. Here’s how we can do it step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Components of the Argument
1. **Proposition (<P>):** The universe has a beginning.
2. **Reason (<R>):** Every thing that has a beginning has a cause.
3. **Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Therefore, the universe has a cause called God.

### Step 2: Analyze the Argument for Defective Types

#### Generalization (G)
- **Does the proposition assert something based on some one part or a majority, but not necessarily applicable to all?**
- The proposition doesn’t seem to be a generalization of one part or a majority; rather, it makes a universal claim about the universe.

#### Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
- **Does the proposition or reason overlook relevant possibilities?**
- The argument assumes that the cause of the universe is definitively God, without acknowledging other potential causes. This suggests an incomplete enumeration of possibilities regarding the cause.

#### Inconclusive Reason (IR)
- **Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?**
- The reason provided (everything that has a beginning has a cause) may be generally logical, but it doesn’t conclusively demonstrate that God is specifically the cause. The leap from a cause to God as the cause is presumptive rather than conclusively demonstrated.

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
- **Is the causal basis submitted for the proposition not compelling?**
- The reason itself (everything that has a beginning has a cause) is a philosophical premise and is generally accepted, but the specific causal basis linking it to God is not compelling without additional support.

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
- **Does the reason simply restate the proposition?**
- The reason does not restate the proposition; it adds new information about causality.

#### Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
- **Is the proof of reason assumed as certain, on the grounds that "it is universally agreed upon"?**
- The proof of reason assumes the widely debated claim that God is the cause without sufficiently supporting it. It relies on presumed consensus rather than presenting independent verification.

#### Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)
- **Can the proof of reason be taken in another sense than the speaker intended?**
- The language "cause called God" could have different interpretations (e.g., different understandings of God). However, the main issue seems to be more about presumption of consensus rather than ambiguous language.

### Step 3: Classify the Argument Type
Based on the analysis:
- The argument potentially commits multiple fallacies, but the dominant defective argument type is **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**. The conclusion "Therefore, the universe has a cause called God" assumes a disputed claim as certainty that is not universally agreed upon without independent verification.

**Conclusion**: The classification of the argument "The universe has a beginning. Every thing that has a beginning has a cause. Therefore, the universe has a cause called God." is **FU (Presumptuous Consensus)**.
