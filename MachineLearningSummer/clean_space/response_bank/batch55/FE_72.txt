For 
To apply the task of IDAA to the given statement "Either support gun confiscation or have the government provide everyone with his own private nuclear warhead, you decide which one," we need to decompose the task of identifying the type of defective argument (IDA) into specific steps (D) and then carry out those steps systematically. 

### Decomposition (D):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine what is being proposed or asserted.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Understand the causal basis or reasoning given to support the proposition.

3. **Check for Generalization (<G>):**
   - Verify if the proposition is generalized from a part to the whole without adequate basis.

4. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Determine if the argument claims to exhaust all possibilities but misses out on some.

5. **Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Examine if the reason fails to conclusively support the proposition.

6. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Assess if the reason provided has a weak causal link to the proposition.

7. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - Ensure that the reason is not just a restatement of the proposition.

8. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - Confirm if the proof of reason assumes something as universally agreed upon without evidence.

9. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - Identify if there are any unclear terms or meanings that could be interpreted differently.

### Step-by-Step Application:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition: Support gun confiscation.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason: The only other alternative presented is to have the government provide everyone with a private nuclear warhead.

3. **Check for Generalization (<G>):**
   - This argument does not generalize from a part to a whole. It is presenting a binary choice.

4. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Yes, the argument suggests that there are only two possibilities: support gun confiscation or have the government provide everyone with a private nuclear warhead. This misses out on many other potential solutions or alternatives to gun control, thus it's an incomplete enumeration.

5. **Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The reason doesn't seem to provide a conclusive argument for why gun confiscation should be supported. It's more of a hyperbolic statement than a logical reason.

6. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The causal basis (either confiscation or nuclear warhead) is weak and not compelling as it presents an extreme alternative without a logical causal link.

7. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - The reason is not a repetition of the proposition. It is an extreme scenario presented as the only alternative.

8. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - There doesn't appear to be an assumed universal agreement in this particular argument.

9. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - The language is relatively clear; the issue is more with the reasoning than ambiguity.

### Conclusion:

The defective argument type for the statement "Either support gun confiscation or have the government provide everyone with his own private nuclear warhead, you decide which one" primarily fits the category of **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**, since it falsely presents only two options as if they were exhaustive, failing to acknowledge other possible solutions or alternatives.
