Certainly! We'll apply the decomposition of the advanced task "classifying the type of defective argument" (IDA) to the given string step-by-step. The string to classify is:

"Speaker 1: I’m against the war.
Speaker 2: You must hate our troops."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (IDAA) of Argument Classification (IDA)

#### Step 1: Identify the Propositions and Reasons
First, let's identify the key parts of the dispute:
- **Speaker 1’s Proposition (<P1>):** "I’m against the war."
- **Speaker 2’s Proposition (<P2>):** "You must hate our troops."
  
#### Step 2: Determine Relationship and Evaluate Speaker 2’s Reasoning
Speaker 2 appears to be making an inference based on Speaker 1’s position. The implied reason (<R>) for <P2> seems to be that opposition to the war is equated with hating the troops.

#### Step 3: Check for Defective Argument Types
Now, we’ll classify if <R> is defective according to the given defect types:
1. **Generalization (G):** This involves making a broad assertion not supported by sufficient specifics. Speaker 2 might be making a generalization about people who are against the war.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This occurs when all possibilities are not enumerated. This does not quite fit our situation.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Here, <R> does not conclusively support <P>. Saying opposing war equates to hating troops is inconclusive reasoning.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Similar to IR, it implies the causality submitted is weak.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This does not match our scenario.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument does not claim universal agreement.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** There is no apparent ambiguity in the language used.

#### Step 4: Determine the Most Appropriate Defective Argument Type
After evaluation, the defective logic seems to align with **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
- Speaker 2’s reasoning does not conclusively demonstrate that being against the war logically leads to hating the troops.

### Conclusion
Applying <IDAA> to the argument provided:

"Speaker 1: I’m against the war.
Speaker 2: You must hate our troops."

The argument by Speaker 2 most closely fits the defective argument type **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the reason given does not conclusively support the proposition.
