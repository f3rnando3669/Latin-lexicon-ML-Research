Sure, let's apply IDAA to classify the string "To this very day (at the time of this writing), science has been unable to create life from non-life; therefore, life must be a result of divine intervention."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - The proposition in this string is: "life must be a result of divine intervention."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - The reason given for the proposition is: "science has been unable to create life from non-life."

3. **Evaluate if the Reason (R) is conclusive and compelling:**
   - Here, we need to check if the reason conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the proposition. The reason provided (science being unable to create life from non-life) does not necessarily imply that life must be a result of divine intervention.

4. **Consider if the Reason (R) introduces any Faulty Repetition of the Proposition (RR):**
   - In this case, the reason does not repeat the proposition but introduces a separate assertion.

5. **Check for a Generalization (G):**
   - Determine if the proposition is based on a generalization. Here, the statement "science has been unable to create life from non-life" is a generalized observation, but it's not applied to all individuals, so it's not a direct issue of generalization.

6. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - Identify if there are other possibilities not considered. The statement does not enumerate other possibilities for the origin of life, such as abiogenesis theories or other scientific hypotheses.

7. **Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - Evaluate if the reason concludes definitively to the proposition. The inability of science to create life from non-life does not conclusively demonstrate that divine intervention is the only other possibility.

8. **Determine if there is an Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - Assess if the causal basis (inability of science) is compelling to establish the proposition. The inability of current scientific methods to create life from non-life is not a compelling causal basis for concluding divine intervention.

9. **Examine for Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - Check if there is any appeal to a universally agreed-upon but disputed fact. The argument does not rely on an assumed consensus but on a factual claim about scientific capability.

10. **Assess for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
    - Determine if there is any ambiguous language. The terms used are clear in their intent, without apparent ambiguity.

### Classification

Based on the analysis, the string "To this very day (at the time of this writing), science has been unable to create life from non-life; therefore, life must be a result of divine intervention." shows elements of both **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:

1. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The inability of science to create life from non-life does not conclusively imply that divine intervention is the correct proposition.
2. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reason that science cannot create life from non-life is not a sufficiently compelling causal basis to conclude that life must necessarily result from divine intervention.
