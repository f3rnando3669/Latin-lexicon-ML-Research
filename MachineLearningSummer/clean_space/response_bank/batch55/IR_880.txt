For 
**Step 1: Identify the Argument Types Involved (Proposition, Reason, Proof of Reason)**

1. **Proposition (P):** Peter asserts that "it is morally wrong to use animals for food or clothing."
2. **Reason (R):** The arguments Peter presented (not explicitly provided in the string) are meant to serve as reasons for the proposition.
3. **Proof of Reason (PR):** Peter assumes the arguments he has presented serve as a proof for his reason which supports the proposition.

**Step 2: Analyze Bill's Response for Defective Arguments**

Bill's response essentially highlights a perceived inconsistency in Peter's behavior (wearing a leather jacket and holding a roast beef sandwich) with his proposition (it is morally wrong to use animals for food or clothing).

**Step 3: Map Bill's Response to Defective Argument Types**

1. **Generalization (G):** Not applicable here. Bill does not generalize from a part to a whole.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable here. Bill does not enumerate possibilities and miss some pertinent ones.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Bill does not provide a reason that fails to conclusively demonstrate correctness.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Not directly applicable. Bill's argument doesnâ€™t focus on insufficient causality but rather points to inconsistency.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Not applicable. Bill does not repeat the proposition as his reason.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Not applicable. Bill does not assume universal agreement on Peter's arguments.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Not applicable. There is no ambiguous language use.

**Step 4: Determine the Relevant Defective Argument Type**

Bill's argument can be seen as a form of an ad hominem fallacy (attacking the person instead of addressing the argument). However, given the context of the exact defective argument types specified, the closest fitting is:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Bill implies Peter's reason is inconclusive because Peter's actions contradict his proposition, but this response focuses more on perceived inconsistency rather than conclusively disproving the argument itself.

**Conclusion**

Applying <IDAA> to the string indicates Bill's response as having characteristics of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, though strictly speaking, it borders on an ad hominem argument rather than directly falling into one of the predefined categories.
