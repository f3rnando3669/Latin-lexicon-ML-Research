For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a given string as a defective argument) to the string "I know four poor families. They are lazy drug addicts. Therefore, all poor people are lazy drug addicts," we will decompose the task of classification into specific steps and then perform those steps systematically:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), and Proof of Reason (<PR>)

**Proposition (<P>):**
- The statement we aim to prove is: "All poor people are lazy drug addicts."

**Reason (<R>):**
- The causal basis given for this proposition is: The speaker knows four poor families who are lazy drug addicts.

**Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
- No additional proof of the reason is explicitly given in the string.

### Step 2: Review the list of defective argument types and their definitions

**Defective Argument Types:**
1. **<G> (Generalization)**: Assertion based on some part or majority, but not necessarily applicable to all.
2. **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: Claiming complete enumeration but missing pertinent possibilities.
3. **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
4. **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: Weak causal basis for the proposition.
5. **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: Reason repeats what has been said in the Proposition.
6. **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: Assumes consensus where it is still in dispute.
7. **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: Language can be taken in another sense than intended.

### Step 3: Match the argument against the definitions to classify it

**Analysis:**

- The argument presented asserts that "all poor people are lazy drug addicts" based on the observation of four poor families.
- This involves making a broad assertion about an entire group (all poor people) based on evidence from a very small subset (four poor families).

Given this, the argument fits the definition of **<G> (Generalization)** because it takes an observation about a small sample and improperly applies it to the entire population.

### Step 4: Conclude with the classification

Thus, the string "I know four poor families. They are lazy drug addicts. Therefore, all poor people are lazy drug addicts." is classified as a defective argument of type **<G> (Generalization)**.

**Final Classification: <G> (Generalization)**
