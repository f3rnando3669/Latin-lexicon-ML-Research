For 
To apply IDAA to the statement "Ms. Baker assigned me a lot of homework because she’s a witch!", we will decompose the task of classifying defective arguments (IDA) into specific steps (D). Here’s a step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
   - In the given statement, the proposition (P) is "Ms. Baker assigned me a lot of homework."
   - This part is the claim we intend to prove.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
   - The reason (R) provided is "because she’s a witch!"
   - This part sets forth the causal basis for the proposition.

### Step 3: Evaluate the Reason (<R>) for Potential Defective Argument Types
   - We need to examine whether the provided reason (R) and its corresponding proof or lack thereof (PR) fall into any of the defective argument categories.

### Step 4: Determine Defective Argument Type

- **Generalization (G)**:
   - This doesn’t seem to fit since there’s no broad assertion based on a part or majority of individuals.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - This doesn’t apply as there’s no claim of enumerating possibilities.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - Yes, the reason "because she’s a witch" does not provide a substantial causal basis to conclusively demonstrate why Ms. Baker assigned a lot of homework. It’s an assertion without any logical or factual support.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - Yes, the reason is weak because the causal basis "she’s a witch" is not compelling or logically sound in explaining the assignment of a lot of homework.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - This doesn’t apply because the reason is not a repetition of the proposition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - This doesn’t apply since there is no assumed universal agreement presented.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
   - This doesn’t apply as the term "witch" isn’t ambiguously used in terms of different possible meanings.

### Step 5: Classify the Defective Argument
   - Based on the evaluation, the statement falls into two defective argument types:
     1. Inconclusive Reason (IR)
     2. Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)

### Conclusion

By applying IDAA step by step, we classify the argument "Ms. Baker assigned me a lot of homework because she’s a witch!" as containing defective argument types:
   - Inconclusive Reason (IR)
   - Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
